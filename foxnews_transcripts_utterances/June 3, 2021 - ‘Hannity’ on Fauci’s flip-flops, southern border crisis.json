      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, we will bring you a \"Hannity\" special investigation. The very latest from the crisis from the crisis at our southern border. And you will hear tonight from one 9-year-old unaccompanied minor about the perilous journey alone and why in fact this child took this journey. Spoiler alert: think president sippy cup. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, tonight, new tape from a new city -- New York City school that is teaching grammar school kids porn literacy in school.

He has a special message for Dr. Flip-flop Fauci, which is where we begin tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } More damning revelations surrounding Anthony Fauci and the country of China and what we have been describing as gain of function research. As we explain last night, gain of function research, that involves researchers engineering viruses to make them more potent, and thus more dangerous, more lethal. The practice is so risky it was banned in the U.S. for several years. In 2012, though, Dr. Fauci, he actually argued that the benefits of gain of function research are worth risking even a global pandemic caused by a lab leak. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, less than ten years later, the world was upended by COVID-19, which was likely created through gain of function research at this Wuhan Institute of Virology and leaked into the world, killing millions, 600,000 Americans. On January 31st, 2020, a team of top scientists warned Dr. Fauci that COVID-19, their research showed them it looked like it had been engineered. This is ten days after the first identified case of coronavirus in the U.S. Also, the same day Trump put in his xenophobic and historical travel ban. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Fauci and the entire world knew that the Wuhan facility was experimenting with gain of function with coronaviruses. Logically, any idiot could have realized on January 31st, 2020, that a Wuhan lab leak was plausible and possibly responsible for the pandemic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We brought the question up. You are a conspiracy theorist. You're talking about debunked conspiracy theories. Not so debunked anymore, are they? E-mails now prove that Dr. Fauci knew that everything was happening in the lab, and he was showing great concern that, in fact, NIH money that he was in charge of was being used to do all of this. We may have actually paid for this. And for months in public, Fauci treated the lab leak hypothesis as a FOX News conspiracy theory. He said there was no scientific evidence the coronavirus was made in a Chinese lab, even though he got that note on January 31st on 2020. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He strongly implied that all signs pointed to the virus originating in nature just the opposite of what he was told. So why did he do this? What did Fauci know and when did Fauci know it? Again, new e-mails from February 1st, the day after 2020, it shows that Fauci and his colleagues, they were extremely concerned that the NIH may, in fact, have funded this very specific Chinese lab and specifically gain of function research, yeah, into coronaviruses. According to a new \"Vanity Fair\" report just out, State Department staffers, they were warned early on not to probe the origins of the coronavirus because it would, quote, open a can of worms. Well, what in the hell went on here? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Even today, Fauci is still urging Americans, don't be too accusatory of China because they are working hard to get to the bottom of what really happened. It's in their best interest to tell the truth. He has e-mails that he got saying that they were covering up the number of people that were killed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, in fact, their travel ban prohibited people from leaving Wuhan province and traveling anywhere within China or going to Wuhan province. You got to be kidding. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "So, you got Fauci there this morning literally repeating what is Chinese propaganda, communist Chinese government at this point. It's not in China's best interest to be honest? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, we have evidence to the contrary, just the opposite. They have every motive to lie as they have been lying. The malignant government of China, they know full well what the origins are. They've known them for a long time. They've known them from the get-go and they've been covering it up for more than a year. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, this is definitely not the only thing that flip-flop Fauci got wrong over the last 17 months, starting with masks and projections and models and lockdowns and shutdowns and draconian shutdowns -- pretty much everything he flip-flopped, flailed, kind of like Joe Biden giving a speech sippy cup. Emails show Fauci was even furious with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for not heeding his expert advice on lockdowns. Thank God that the governor didn't listen to him because he was predicting that Florida's open bars and beaches would be a disaster. Wrong again, Dr. Fauci. Perhaps Fauci was wrong so often because he didn't actually listen to the experts that were writing him and telling him exactly what was happening. For example, in March 2021, one such expert sent Fauci a detailed email warning him that China was purposely severely under counting their COVID-19 death toll and that the outbreak is way past the point of containment, contradicting what he said earlier today that China knows it's in its best interest to tell the truth. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No, Dr. Fauci, they've been lying the whole time and you were warned from the get-go, and you've been less than honest and clearly you wanted these tough questions to go away. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This expert also recommended -- oh, multiple safe, potentially effective treatments, oh, including hydroxychloroquine. Fauci eventually responded too long for me to read. I guess Dr. Fauci was too busy. He had more important matters to attend to like appearing on pretty much every single television show that would have them on and emailing with celebrities like Morgan Fairchild, pushing for a feature film about his great life and giving keynote addresses at Cornell and Qatar (ph) and other institutions, and last but not least writing a book. Does that sound familiar? But about his tremendous leadership. One has to wonder how Fauci found the time to do anything legitimately constructive he was too busy enjoying his newfound celebrity status. I think it is safe to say nobody enjoys seeing Dr. Fauci on TV more than Dr. Fauci. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Fauci has not served this country well in any of this. He needs to go. But he also needs to answer questions and he needs to respond to why he did not listen to the experts, why didn't he follow the science that was being mailed to him in other words. And the malignant government of China, they've got to be held accountable. They put this country and the world through hell. In a statement today, if somebody stands up to China, President Trump did. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He wrote, quote: Now everyone, even the so-called enemy -- I'm sure he's talking about the mob in the media -- are beginning to say that President Trump was right about the China virus coming from the Wuhan lab. The correspondence between Dr. Fauci and China speaks too loudly for anybody to ignore. China should pay $10 trillion to America and the world for all the death and destruction that they have caused. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I agree with him. Unfortunately, for America -- yeah, sippy cup Joe Biden doesn't have that same resolve. President sippy cup Joey is just too incompetent, too weak, I don't even know if he knows what day it is, never mind standing up to China. According to Rasmussen, a plurality now of Americans they now see what I see and they believe that Joe Biden is the weakest president in their lifetime. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And also, one has to wonder if Hunter Biden has led to the entire family being compromised by let's say China and Russia -- oh, yeah they got approval for their pipeline. We took away high paying career jobs at the Keystone XL pipeline. But compromised by China, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan because after all, according to that Senate report, Ron Johnson and Senator Grassley, zero experience Hunter, remember, he got millions of dollars, that one point billion dollar deal with the Bank of China. He got the hundred thousand dollar choppy -- a shopping spree for his family, with a Chinese national, again connected to the Communist Party and the Bank of China. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A Chinese national gifted the Biden family of Hunter a hundred grand for an international shopping spree. Wouldn't you like that deal? With no experience? Now, as for the $1.5 billion deal for Hunter with the Bank of China, let me ask you a question, knowing as much as we know about Hunter Biden, what about Goldman Sachs, Chase Morgan, Stanley -- I'm sorry Chase, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, don't you think that they were -- were they less qualified than Hunter, the crack addict? Just like Hunter also collected over $3.5 million from a Russian oligarch known as the first lady of Moscow? Huh, I guess maybe is that why is that why Joe granted the waiver for Vladimir to build his pipeline after he killed jobs in this country on the Keystone XL pipeline? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As of now, Joe apparently is doing nothing about the two devastating Russian cyberattacks. According to our sources, we've been told that Hunter Biden's hard drive, yep, it still has a trove of disturbing and damning information. It's so bad, my lawyers won't let me get my own copy of it. He said, otherwise, they would fire me as a client. That's how bad they think it is. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If America's enemies are somehow using this as leverage, is that a far- fetched thing? Because if it was Donald Trump as president, you know the media mob and others would be saying it? Here with more, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right. You've been saying it. Ted Cruz has been saying it. Senator Kennedy has been saying it. And Senator Rand Paul has been saying it, and I credit all of you. It -- why -- let's start with the basics, why -- please tell me, in the name of Jesus in Heaven, why would we give China and their Wuhan lab of virology one single solitary penny? Let's start there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The person from NBC asked him, isn't it in their interest to lie to the world and not admit it came from their lab because it'd make them look terrible? If you can't figure that out, then you've got a real problem on your hand. Candor and openness and transparency do not go in the same sentence when it comes to China. So, what to do? Call Dr. Fauci before the Senate and the House, allow the people in the State Department who were silenced about pushing the lab leak theory to have their say, hold those responsible who shut down this conversation, make sure they're fired and get to the bottom of what happened. And finally, introduce sanctions, bipartisan, against China, if they don't cooperate with an international community.

You just want to be able to comfort them. And you really wanted to speak with his mother. He did speak with his mom before making this journey he did reunite with her on the phone. He has not seen his mother since he was two years old. So he left his grandmother's home even though his grandmother wanted him to stay and he made the journey alone, and it appeared that of course family members paid for him to be smuggled to the United States. But this is the bigger picture, right? We have children coming across our border, he's really only one of 20,000 children that are now in our custody, probably more than 20,000 in over 200 shelters across the United States. And, Sean, when you talk to people about this, when you talk to border patrol agents, national guardsmen, people that are working on the front lines, the detective -- like the Texas Department of Public Safety, they'll tell you that this is the worst part of Biden's policies, that they have opened up these borders, have given false hope to so many people. And so many children have lost their way. Last night, after the show, we went back out on the river. That's where we ran into this young man. I'm not saying his name just to keep the privacy but the roads were filled, filled with people. You could see across the river just -- you could hear them in the darkness, making their way with the smugglers, down along the river. And then the smugglers loading people up into rafts, bringing them across the river with no indication of fear or worry that they were going to be arrested. Who was waiting on the other side of the river? Our national guardsmen, who were there all night. And they kept saying, you know, where they're coming. Boat after boat after boat, and we were watching young people get off, pregnant women, families. This is a very serious crisis but I could tell you this, Sean. One of the biggest issues being here on the border for all this time is the fact that it is the policies themselves that are driving the people here to the United States and endangering the lives of these children and endangering the people on these journeys, because remember, this young boy is one of the lucky ones. He actually made it. What about all the children that we never see, that we never hear about, the children that don't make this journey?",

It's my eighth book, I think, given the times and given what's going on in this country. And you can pre-order a copy and get a first edition now. You know, Sean, it's not just Dr. Fauci. First of all, it would be one of the most unimaginable ironies in our history if the federal department responsible for protecting us from a pandemic contributed to creating one. And this gets to the heart of the matter, the nature of government, the nature of politicians. You see Biden and the Democrats want to centralize more and more power. They're trying to destroy the suburbs as I speak. They want to control health care. They want to control energy. They want to control all these things. But they're incompetent boobs. Who are these people in the bureaucracy? Nobody ever gets fired. People aren't necessarily hired based on merit, but they grab more and more of our power. We have vaccines today. Of course, the government contributed to that. But without the private sector, we wouldn't have vaccines. We wouldn't have masks. We wouldn't have any of these things. And so, Biden and the Democrat Party's war on the private sector massive taxes, massive economic dislocation, massive regulations and all these other things, they deny us the things that make the life much better. Now, look at big tech Big tech, look at big media, none of them or very few of them reported on the lab issue or allowed anybody to even discuss it, even if they had scientific backgrounds, even if they were -- they were well known. You know, one of the great men and he's an unsung hero on this is a fellow by the name of Nicholas Wade who helped blow the lid off this one month ago. In a piece he wrote, \"The origin of COVID: Did people or nature open Pandora's box at Wuhan?\" This is the piece that should be credited with all the talk we now hear in the last month. It was in \"The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\". I don't know about you, but I'm a regular subscriber and I like to look at the pictures. But seriously, this man who I had on my Sunday show two Sundays ago, he's a former senior editor at \"The New York Times\" on science. And he spent a year retired, he's about 80 years old looking into this. And he's the one that looked at the grant, and he's the one that wondered what happened to the moratorium on this gain of access research. It is -- he is the one that questioned the lack of curiosity of the media and that grabbed the media's attention that one of their own was raising serious questions. He's the one who pointed out that the grant that went to this third party in New York, part of that was used to fund the Wuhan lab, which investigates what, which does science on coronaviruses, it makes them more lethal, more deadly. And he is the one that looked at the Lancet publication and another medical publication and raised questions about all these virologists signing on to these letters which was used by the media when he said there's not one scintilla of evidence Mr. Fauci, Dr. Fauci, not one that this was caused from an animal to human a transformation. It never happened. They don't have any evidence. This has been communist Chinese propaganda and he writes in the article: Science is supposedly a self-correcting community of experts who constantly check each other's work. So why didn't other virologists point out that the Anderson group and these other groups argument was full of absurd large holes, perhaps because in today's universities, speech can be very costly. Careers can be destroyed for stepping out of line. Any virologist who challenges the community's declared view risks having his next grant application turned down by the panel of fellow virologists that advises the government grant distribution agency. I recommend, seriously, you can go online, you can get it. It's the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist by Nicholas Wade. Read it. Everything you're hearing on TV and radio is really based on this column. Now, I want to make a couple other points quickly here. This should inform us when people run around and talk about man-made climate change, and they don't have serious science to back it up, and they close down anybody who raises questions as deniers, and we're supposed to transform our entire free market economy into some kind of Marxist socialist dream, that we're going to destroy fossil fuels and sign on to some crummy deal that we that we just did again in Paris and so forth, we're going to follow the science they say. Ladies and gentlemen, news flash, the science has been politicized and not by conservatives but by the radical left. They want to destroy our economy based on their science. They want to destroy the private sector, the fossil fuel industry based on their science. Couple other points very quickly here.",

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, we will bring you a \"Hannity\" special investigation. The very latest from the crisis from the crisis at our southern border. And you will hear tonight from one 9-year-old unaccompanied minor about the perilous journey alone and why in fact this child took this journey. Spoiler alert: think president sippy cup. Also, tonight, new tape from a new city -- New York City school that is teaching grammar school kids porn literacy in school. Just run (ph) how its term (ph) rots. Also, tonight, the great one, Mark Levin, he'll be here. He has a special message for Dr. Flip-flop Fauci, which is where we begin tonight. More damning revelations surrounding Anthony Fauci and the country of China and what we have been describing as gain of function research. As we explain last night, gain of function research, that involves researchers engineering viruses to make them more potent, and thus more dangerous, more lethal. The practice is so risky it was banned in the U.S. for several years. In 2012, though, Dr. Fauci, he actually argued that the benefits of gain of function research are worth risking even a global pandemic caused by a lab leak. Now, less than ten years later, the world was upended by COVID-19, which was likely created through gain of function research at this Wuhan Institute of Virology and leaked into the world, killing millions, 600,000 Americans. On January 31st, 2020, a team of top scientists warned Dr. Fauci that COVID-19, their research showed them it looked like it had been engineered. This is ten days after the first identified case of coronavirus in the U.S. Also, the same day Trump put in his xenophobic and historical travel ban. Now, Fauci and the entire world knew that the Wuhan facility was experimenting with gain of function with coronaviruses. Logically, any idiot could have realized on January 31st, 2020, that a Wuhan lab leak was plausible and possibly responsible for the pandemic. We brought the question up. You are a conspiracy theorist. You're talking about debunked conspiracy theories. Not so debunked anymore, are they? E-mails now prove that Dr. Fauci knew that everything was happening in the lab, and he was showing great concern that, in fact, NIH money that he was in charge of was being used to do all of this. We may have actually paid for this. And for months in public, Fauci treated the lab leak hypothesis as a FOX News conspiracy theory. He said there was no scientific evidence the coronavirus was made in a Chinese lab, even though he got that note on January 31st on 2020. He strongly implied that all signs pointed to the virus originating in nature just the opposite of what he was told. So why did he do this? What did Fauci know and when did Fauci know it? Again, new e-mails from February 1st, the day after 2020, it shows that Fauci and his colleagues, they were extremely concerned that the NIH may, in fact, have funded this very specific Chinese lab and specifically gain of function research, yeah, into coronaviruses. According to a new \"Vanity Fair\" report just out, State Department staffers, they were warned early on not to probe the origins of the coronavirus because it would, quote, open a can of worms. Well, what in the hell went on here? Even today, Fauci is still urging Americans, don't be too accusatory of China because they are working hard to get to the bottom of what really happened. It's in their best interest to tell the truth. He has e-mails that he got saying that they were covering up the number of people that were killed. And, in fact, their travel ban prohibited people from leaving Wuhan province and traveling anywhere within China or going to Wuhan province. You got to be kidding. Take a look."

      "utterance": "So, you got Fauci there this morning literally repeating what is Chinese propaganda, communist Chinese government at this point. It's not in China's best interest to be honest? Well, we have evidence to the contrary, just the opposite. They have every motive to lie as they have been lying. The malignant government of China, they know full well what the origins are. They've known them for a long time. They've known them from the get-go and they've been covering it up for more than a year. And, by the way, this is definitely not the only thing that flip-flop Fauci got wrong over the last 17 months, starting with masks and projections and models and lockdowns and shutdowns and draconian shutdowns -- pretty much everything he flip-flopped, flailed, kind of like Joe Biden giving a speech sippy cup. Emails show Fauci was even furious with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for not heeding his expert advice on lockdowns. Thank God that the governor didn't listen to him because he was predicting that Florida's open bars and beaches would be a disaster. Wrong again, Dr. Fauci. Perhaps Fauci was wrong so often because he didn't actually listen to the experts that were writing him and telling him exactly what was happening. For example, in March 2021, one such expert sent Fauci a detailed email warning him that China was purposely severely under counting their COVID-19 death toll and that the outbreak is way past the point of containment, contradicting what he said earlier today that China knows it's in its best interest to tell the truth. No, Dr. Fauci, they've been lying the whole time and you were warned from the get-go, and you've been less than honest and clearly you wanted these tough questions to go away. This expert also recommended -- oh, multiple safe, potentially effective treatments, oh, including hydroxychloroquine. Fauci eventually responded too long for me to read. I guess Dr. Fauci was too busy. He had more important matters to attend to like appearing on pretty much every single television show that would have them on and emailing with celebrities like Morgan Fairchild, pushing for a feature film about his great life and giving keynote addresses at Cornell and Qatar (ph) and other institutions, and last but not least writing a book. Does that sound familiar? But about his tremendous leadership. One has to wonder how Fauci found the time to do anything legitimately constructive he was too busy enjoying his newfound celebrity status. I think it is safe to say nobody enjoys seeing Dr. Fauci on TV more than Dr. Fauci. Fauci has not served this country well in any of this. He needs to go. But he also needs to answer questions and he needs to respond to why he did not listen to the experts, why didn't he follow the science that was being mailed to him in other words. And the malignant government of China, they've got to be held accountable. They put this country and the world through hell. In a statement today, if somebody stands up to China, President Trump did."

      "utterance": "Now everyone, even the so-called enemy -- I'm sure he's talking about the mob in the media -- are beginning to say that President Trump was right about the China virus coming from the Wuhan lab. The correspondence between Dr. Fauci and China speaks too loudly for anybody to ignore. China should pay $10 trillion to America and the world for all the death and destruction that they have caused. I agree with him. Unfortunately, for America -- yeah, sippy cup Joe Biden doesn't have that same resolve. President sippy cup Joey is just too incompetent, too weak, I don't even know if he knows what day it is, never mind standing up to China. According to Rasmussen, a plurality now of Americans they now see what I see and they believe that Joe Biden is the weakest president in their lifetime. And also, one has to wonder if Hunter Biden has led to the entire family being compromised by let's say China and Russia -- oh, yeah they got approval for their pipeline. We took away high paying career jobs at the Keystone XL pipeline. But compromised by China, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan because after all, according to that Senate report, Ron Johnson and Senator Grassley, zero experience Hunter, remember, he got millions of dollars, that one point billion dollar deal with the Bank of China. He got the hundred thousand dollar choppy -- a shopping spree for his family, with a Chinese national, again connected to the Communist Party and the Bank of China. A Chinese national gifted the Biden family of Hunter a hundred grand for an international shopping spree. Wouldn't you like that deal? With no experience? Now, as for the $1.5 billion deal for Hunter with the Bank of China, let me ask you a question, knowing as much as we know about Hunter Biden, what about Goldman Sachs, Chase Morgan, Stanley -- I'm sorry Chase, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, don't you think that they were -- were they less qualified than Hunter, the crack addict? Just like Hunter also collected over $3.5 million from a Russian oligarch known as the first lady of Moscow? Huh, I guess maybe is that why is that why Joe granted the waiver for Vladimir to build his pipeline after he killed jobs in this country on the Keystone XL pipeline? As of now, Joe apparently is doing nothing about the two devastating Russian cyberattacks. According to our sources, we've been told that Hunter Biden's hard drive, yep, it still has a trove of disturbing and damning information. It's so bad, my lawyers won't let me get my own copy of it. He said, otherwise, they would fire me as a client. That's how bad they think it is. If America's enemies are somehow using this as leverage, is that a far- fetched thing? Because if it was Donald Trump as president, you know the media mob and others would be saying it? Here with more, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. All right. You've been saying it. Ted Cruz has been saying it. Senator Kennedy has been saying it. And Senator Rand Paul has been saying it, and I credit all of you. It -- why -- let's start with the basics, why -- please tell me, in the name of Jesus in Heaven, why would we give China and their Wuhan lab of virology one single solitary penny? Let's start there."

But the most stunning thing out of your monologue to me was the idea that Dr. Fauci doesn't believe that it's in China's interest to lie about the leak from their lab. The person from NBC asked him, isn't it in their interest to lie to the world and not admit it came from their lab because it'd make them look terrible? If you can't figure that out, then you've got a real problem on your hand. Candor and openness and transparency do not go in the same sentence when it comes to China. So, what to do? Call Dr. Fauci before the Senate and the House, allow the people in the State Department who were silenced about pushing the lab leak theory to have their say, hold those responsible who shut down this conversation, make sure they're fired and get to the bottom of what happened. And finally, introduce sanctions, bipartisan, against China, if they don't cooperate with an international community. They will never tell you the truth until they're made to do so."

On the other hand, it doesn't make any sense why Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan and Chase, that they didn't get the $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China that Hunter got it, the crack addict.

Why would a bank in China give Hunter Biden money except for the fact that he has connections to Vice President Biden? Why is he on Burisma's board in the Ukraine if he doesn't know anything about the oil and gas business? Because of his last name and the fact that Vice President Biden was in charge of rooting out corruption in the Ukraine. It defies common sense that these are normal business deals. Is it illogical to think that somehow, due to his activity in the Ukraine and China, he may have been compromised? I can guarantee you, if a Republican president's son had done this or a vice president -- Republican vice president's son had done these things, it'd be front page news all over the world.

Secondly, Israel will not tolerate an enrichment program in Iran. We're headed for a war between Israel and Iran. If we go back into JCPOA, we're going to have a nuclear arms race between the Arabs and the Iranians, and you're going to put Israel in a bad spot where you'll have a war between Iran and Israel if we go back into this bad deal.

More than that, they now have put themselves in a position of determining what news can be re-reported. We remember those articles about Hunter Biden, and they quashed \"The New York Post\" stories.

You have a virus that we know the Chinese are experimenting within that lab and a lab we know that has -- that has safety problems. We know for a fact that messing around with viruses and lab accidents have led to outbreaks in the past. That happened with SARS back in the day, that two different outbreaks from researchers that were infected. And, by the way, coincidence out of coincidence, this outbreak started in the very city where that lab is located. There isn't a bat cave -- and Wuhan is in enormous city. It's like the size of Manhattan. There's no bat caves there. And by the way, under SARS, they found the animal that spread it within four months. Under MERS, they found the animal that spread it within nine months. Still, to this day, the Chinese have not said this is the animal that that first spread it over to a human being. And you put all of that together, and that's why there are a lot of people that say at a minimum -- at a minimum, the lab leak theory is at least as credible as the fact that it would carry over naturally, if not more so because of the circumstantial evidence."

He was trying to tell a story. He was very nervous. Obviously, he's very young. I'm a mother. I know what it feels like when your children are hurting or when any child's hurting. You just want to be able to comfort them. And you really wanted to speak with his mother. He did speak with his mom before making this journey he did reunite with her on the phone. He has not seen his mother since he was two years old. So he left his grandmother's home even though his grandmother wanted him to stay and he made the journey alone, and it appeared that of course family members paid for him to be smuggled to the United States. But this is the bigger picture, right? We have children coming across our border, he's really only one of 20,000 children that are now in our custody, probably more than 20,000 in over 200 shelters across the United States. And, Sean, when you talk to people about this, when you talk to border patrol agents, national guardsmen, people that are working on the front lines, the detective -- like the Texas Department of Public Safety, they'll tell you that this is the worst part of Biden's policies, that they have opened up these borders, have given false hope to so many people. And so many children have lost their way. Last night, after the show, we went back out on the river. That's where we ran into this young man. I'm not saying his name just to keep the privacy but the roads were filled, filled with people. You could see across the river just -- you could hear them in the darkness, making their way with the smugglers, down along the river. And then the smugglers loading people up into rafts, bringing them across the river with no indication of fear or worry that they were going to be arrested. Who was waiting on the other side of the river? Our national guardsmen, who were there all night. And they kept saying, you know, where they're coming. Boat after boat after boat, and we were watching young people get off, pregnant women, families. This is a very serious crisis but I could tell you this, Sean. One of the biggest issues being here on the border for all this time is the fact that it is the policies themselves that are driving the people here to the United States and endangering the lives of these children and endangering the people on these journeys, because remember, this young boy is one of the lucky ones. He actually made it. What about all the children that we never see, that we never hear about, the children that don't make this journey?"

She's avoiding the border because she knows it's an apocalyptic disaster. If she thought this was a success story, Sean, she'd be down there tomorrow with \"The Washington Post\" with a photo-op and \"Vogue\" or something like that. I mean, give me a break. She, of course, she understands this is a disaster. Now, the second point on this is, what's really frustrating about this, listening to Sara's report and, you know, on a very serious note, listening this morning to \"FOX and Friends\", you know, I consume content on the station too, and I just work here, and I heard this story this morning. There was a woman being raped on the border. She got shot. Border Patrol had to rescue her. This is total anarchy down there. The Democrats talk about this like there isn't an alternative, Sean.

So, now, Dr. Doom and gloom, flip-flop Fauci's credibility completely wrecked after the explosive emails we talked about earlier, revealing there was a huge gap between his public remarks on the origins of COVID-19 and his private messages with other so-called experts, and that's in addition to his never-ending, yeah, stream of flip and flop and misdirections and wrong calls. Anyway, joining us, he's the host of the number one show Sunday night here on the FOX News Channel, \"Life, Liberty & Levin\", syndicated radio host. But more importantly, see this book coming up? Okay, I think I'm the only person in America that has actually read two chapters. This is Mark's new book coming out. It's called \"American Marxism\". Let me put it this way, the answer to everything this country is going through and how to fix it is in this book. I think it's probably your best work. Why you won't give me the full copy, I don't know. I mean, you're supposed to be, my friend. I kind of wish you'd send the whole thing over. But anyway, congratulations. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST, \"LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN\": Well, I appreciate that."

      "utterance": "Yeah. People can pre-order it. There's a whole lot of books out right now. But I would tell our FOX friends that this is my most important book. It's my eighth book, I think, given the times and given what's going on in this country. And you can pre-order a copy and get a first edition now. You know, Sean, it's not just Dr. Fauci. First of all, it would be one of the most unimaginable ironies in our history if the federal department responsible for protecting us from a pandemic contributed to creating one. And this gets to the heart of the matter, the nature of government, the nature of politicians. You see Biden and the Democrats want to centralize more and more power. They're trying to destroy the suburbs as I speak. They want to control health care. They want to control energy. They want to control all these things. But they're incompetent boobs. Who are these people in the bureaucracy? Nobody ever gets fired. People aren't necessarily hired based on merit, but they grab more and more of our power. We have vaccines today. Of course, the government contributed to that. But without the private sector, we wouldn't have vaccines. We wouldn't have masks. We wouldn't have any of these things. And so, Biden and the Democrat Party's war on the private sector massive taxes, massive economic dislocation, massive regulations and all these other things, they deny us the things that make the life much better. Now, look at big tech Big tech, look at big media, none of them or very few of them reported on the lab issue or allowed anybody to even discuss it, even if they had scientific backgrounds, even if they were -- they were well known. You know, one of the great men and he's an unsung hero on this is a fellow by the name of Nicholas Wade who helped blow the lid off this one month ago. In a piece he wrote, \"The origin of COVID: Did people or nature open Pandora's box at Wuhan?\" This is the piece that should be credited with all the talk we now hear in the last month. It was in \"The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\". I don't know about you, but I'm a regular subscriber and I like to look at the pictures. But seriously, this man who I had on my Sunday show two Sundays ago, he's a former senior editor at \"The New York Times\" on science. And he spent a year retired, he's about 80 years old looking into this. And he's the one that looked at the grant, and he's the one that wondered what happened to the moratorium on this gain of access research. It is -- he is the one that questioned the lack of curiosity of the media and that grabbed the media's attention that one of their own was raising serious questions. He's the one who pointed out that the grant that went to this third party in New York, part of that was used to fund the Wuhan lab, which investigates what, which does science on coronaviruses, it makes them more lethal, more deadly. And he is the one that looked at the Lancet publication and another medical publication and raised questions about all these virologists signing on to these letters which was used by the media when he said there's not one scintilla of evidence Mr. Fauci, Dr. Fauci, not one that this was caused from an animal to human a transformation. It never happened. They don't have any evidence."

      "speaker": "This has been communist Chinese propaganda and he writes in the article",
      "utterance": "Science is supposedly a self-correcting community of experts who constantly check each other's work. So why didn't other virologists point out that the Anderson group and these other groups argument was full of absurd large holes, perhaps because in today's universities, speech can be very costly. Careers can be destroyed for stepping out of line. Any virologist who challenges the community's declared view risks having his next grant application turned down by the panel of fellow virologists that advises the government grant distribution agency. I recommend, seriously, you can go online, you can get it. It's the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist by Nicholas Wade. Read it. Everything you're hearing on TV and radio is really based on this column. Now, I want to make a couple other points quickly here. This should inform us when people run around and talk about man-made climate change, and they don't have serious science to back it up, and they close down anybody who raises questions as deniers, and we're supposed to transform our entire free market economy into some kind of Marxist socialist dream, that we're going to destroy fossil fuels and sign on to some crummy deal that we that we just did again in Paris and so forth, we're going to follow the science they say. Ladies and gentlemen, news flash, the science has been politicized and not by conservatives but by the radical left. They want to destroy our economy based on their science. They want to destroy the private sector, the fossil fuel industry based on their science. Couple other points very quickly here."

Kids -- parents can't send their kids to public schools in New York because they suck. Anyways, parents at Manhattan's Columbia Grammar and Prep are now demanding answers after their, well, precious children were subjected to a, quote, porn literacy workshop earlier this month. Seminar for grammar high school students reportedly containing explicit presentation materials about something called a, quote, orgasm gap and contained a slide discussing different porn categories. You know, like incest-themed and barely legal and kink and BDSM. And there's a portion of the lecture posted anonymously online talking about something called electro porn. Sorry, can't help you with that one. Viewer discretion advice."

So electro is like actual like electrocuting, like actual -- that they're doing on porn but people are actually attracted and aroused by it. So even if it's actually fake and, you know, hopefully, the performers are protected, or we have real people who are searching for that because that's what they get off to. Because my goals as a sex educator is that my students grades 1 through 100, have safe, fulfilling and pleasurable sexual lives, whenever it is going to be relevant for them."

A lot of the parents are afraid to speak up for fear of being cancelled or ostracized. And we're planning to push back. The bigger issue is it's part of the critical race theory that's being fast-tracked into both the curriculum and into the culture at Columbia Grammar Prep."
