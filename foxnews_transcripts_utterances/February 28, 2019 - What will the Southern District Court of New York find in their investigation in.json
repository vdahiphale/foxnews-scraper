And the fear always with China, as it's always been for the last 20 years, is they will say they're going to do this, they will say they're going to make concessions on intellectual property and on technology and all these things, and then there's no real enforcement mechanism to make sure it happens. So the president, I think, doesn't want to find himself in that position where he trumpets a deal, and then we discover a year down the road that China has done nothing. So I think it's helpful what happened in a way in North Korea today, to send a signal to the Chinese, look, I want a deal, but I don't want a deal so badly that I will just sign up to anything.

And the dossier matters because it was also a foundational piece for securing the surveillance warrant for a Trump campaign aide. What we expect when these documents are unsealed is, we will get kind of a road map as to how the dossier got to the FBI through multiple different channels in 2016. We know that the British spy Christopher Steele provided parts of the dossier to the FBI directly. We also know that once his contact was cut off with the FBI, he used a back channel through a senior Justice Department official. We also know through transcripts of interviews done here in Congress that at least one journalist provided pieces of the dossier to the FBI. But one of the missing links here has been the late Senator John McCain and the role of his associate, David Kramer, how they worked together to get the dossier to the FBI and also whether Kramer may have been the one to provide the dossier to BuzzFeed. And, remember, it was the report in BuzzFeed that kind of open the Pandora's box in January of 2017 that sort of helped kick-start the whole public discussion about Russian collusion -- Neil.",

They can look at any violation of federal law. And, Neil, what can they do? I mean, they're not continuing to investigate the president in order to just do nothing. They will look at these two Office of Legal Opinion opinions, legal counsel opinions, and they will say, hey, we agree with them, or we don't agree with them. If they don't agree with them, maybe they will do what we did in Watergate. Maybe they will file through the court a road map and ask the court to give it directly to the Judiciary Committee.

So, some knee-jerk reads of events have a way of changing. Hudson Institute senior fellow Rebeccah Heinrichs, Fred Fleitz, the former chief of staff for National Security Adviser John Bolton. Rebeccah, your thoughts on this? Mixed reads from what happened there. You almost get the impression the North Koreans were trying to say it didn't go down the way the president said it went down, and that they were almost rethinking the wisdom of continuing a summit at all right."

So I am relieved that President Trump had the wherewithal, with all of this mounting pressure on him to get something, anything, for him to say no. The thing that makes the Trump approach to North Korea different than previous American presidents is he's not giving sanctions relief up front. He -- what he has given Kim is two summits, given him international prestige, the pageantry. And at this point, it's Kim's responsibility to do something now, to dismantle. He has chosen not to. And he had a lot of gall to say that he wants all of the sanctions relief in exchange for partial dismantlement."

President Reagan did it in Reykjavik. John Bolton did it concerning the biological weapons convention in 2001. Diplomats never walk away from a potential deal. But there's something here no one's talking about. Why did leader Kim think he could get away with this? And this dovetails with things we have been hearing on this channel and on other outlets, that there are lower- level people at the State Department who were raising issues that we would have been giving away too much to the North Koreans. And I worry, in the run-up to the summit, the North Koreans were told by lower-level officials that they might have been able to get more than the president will give them. And I think the president has to look at what these lower-level officials have been saying to North Koreans, so this kind of thing doesn't happen again."

If he really wanted to dismantle -- and if he claims that the terms of a deal were different than what President Trump is saying, he can just write that down and say, this is what my terms are. But he's not doing that."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

This guy took a two-hour train ride. I understand the reasons why. My point is, it sounds like the North Korean leader then botched it in that regard, that he either anticipated something or didn't know much about the diplomatic process, that if you're especially going to have a second meeting, it's a good idea to have ahead of time an idea of signing off on something."

That's probably what Kim Jong-un thought. And when President Trump said, no, that's not my understanding, I have given you now two summits. I have given you everything that you have wanted to this point here, all of this prestige, normalcy between our two countries to a large degree."

They're looking at what happened during the second Bush administration, when there were negotiations between North Korea and basically Condi Rice and her representatives. And the North Koreans didn't agree to anything. They basically -- we gave concession after concession to get a deal. And I think the North Koreans have been looking at the way multiple Republican and Democratic administrations have handled situations like this in every instance, and especially concerning the flawed nuclear deal with Iran. When the rogue state would make trouble, we would simply give in. I think that's what the North Koreans thought we would do."

He's seen how favorably the stock market, how favorably investors have reacted over the last month or two to suggestions of a deal. And I think he would be right to think that there would be a very positive reception if he got a deal with China. But, again, I think what he probably has very helpfully underscored today with the failure of -- to get a deal with North Korea is that it's not a deal at any price. And I think the fear among some in the administration who've been really restraining the president on a deal, people like Bob Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, is that, look, don't sign up to something that we don't have any real clear means of verifying. And the fear always with China, as it's always been for the last 20 years, is they will say they're going to do this, they will say they're going to make concessions on intellectual property and on technology and all these things, and then there's no real enforcement mechanism to make sure it happens. So the president, I think, doesn't want to find himself in that position where he trumpets a deal, and then we discover a year down the road that China has done nothing. So I think it's helpful what happened in a way in North Korea today, to send a signal to the Chinese, look, I want a deal, but I don't want a deal so badly that I will just sign up to anything. I'm prepared to walk away. And he said those very words in that press conference."

There's not a lot of negotiation that -- usually done. It's almost -- it's almost symbolic. So it is striking that the president goes all the way to Hanoi, building up the possibility of a deal with North Korea, and then comes away and says no, and now prepares to welcome, as we believe, Xi Jinping to Mar-a-Lago at some point in the next month or so, and again leaving open the possibility that, look, I like Xi Jinping, I have got a good relationship, because that's the other thing he's been careful with -- with -- controversially, with Kim, with leader Kim, in North Korea.

I do think there is more at stake economically in terms of a deal and in terms of the markets with a deal.

That will require ensuring that China and the other regional powers cooperate with us. But that's the next real step, of reapplying the pressure.

Of course, Ronald Reagan walked away at Reykjavik in Iceland back in 1985, came back to secure a better deal. If you think about it, John F. Kennedy as a new incoming president had a rough first meeting with Nikita Khrushchev. I think it's fair to say that little more than a year-and-a-half later, he had righted that ship with a very strong response during the Cuban Missile Crisis. So I'm wondering if we're prejudging this. What's your sense of where this puts the president on the global stage?"

Despite the great work of the special envoy, Steve Biegun, to set the meeting up, there was no detailed listing of the nuclear sites and the nuclear facilities that are really the heart of our discussions. Typically, for a meeting -- and President Reagan had many meetings with Gorbachev, but they went in with pretty detailed sort of, if you will, guidelines or pathways that they were going to pursue. They didn't have this in this case. And the second mistake is, in Singapore, President Trump, I think, sent the signal to Kim Jong-un that this is all going to be a one-on-one private conversation. You can ask me, and I will give it to you, particularly with respect to our military exercises. When the president conceded off the cuff that we wouldn't have military exercises, in fact, described them as provocative war exercises, I think that sent the wrong signal to Kim Jong-un. I think he said, I don't need this preliminary negotiation. I'm just going to sit down with him. I'm going to ask him to take off sanctions, he will probably do it. And so the setting was all wrong for anything..."

Had there been something that looked like an outline, a detailed outline of agreements, or at least points of disagreement, and the president knew that, and his team was meeting in a structured way to deal with them, that's a lot different than sitting down one-on-one and sort of, let's talk about a deal. What do you want? You have got to avoid that to get any type of comprehensive agreement. The next step, as I suggested, is, we have got to get this maximum pressure campaign, because if the North Koreans walk away thinking they have got -- they have won, that they're now a recognized nuclear power, they have met twice with the president of the United States, Kim Jong-un is a world leader, nothing can take him off that pedestal, and, gradually they will see they were sanctions regime begin to erode, then they have won.

And these prototypes were built for a couple reasons. They want them to be tested. The Border Patrol had a special operations team. Can you climb them? Can you dig under him? Can you drill through them? Can you break them apart? And what they did during this -- all this testing by the special ops teams, they found some had good attributes, some didn't.

It means less transportation contracts. It means less social services that some illegal aliens use. Last year, they put the cost at $816 billion a year for illegal immigration.

The Democrats knew exactly the position they put the president in. I think he picked the lesser of two evils. He's going to say, OK, I will sign this bill, because there's some things are good in it, some things bad. And he's going to try to fix it with executive actions. It's unfortunate the president is put in this position once again because Congress has failed to do their job. I have been doing this for 34 years. Congress has never taken seriously on securing this border. This president has taken it seriously. He talked the talk during the election and now he's walking the walk. He actually has ideas taken from experts, myself, the Border Patrol, ICE agents who have been on that line and done this for decades.

You're talking about the president declared -- President Obama declared a national emergency on the criminal cartels on the northern border of Mexico because of cross-border crime and drug smuggling. This president has doubled down on that, because we still have the issue of cartels smuggling drugs, raping one-third of the women that are smuggled up to the border. Children are dying. I mean, how many bodies we got to keep burying until the Democrats realize that there's an issue on the border? And as we talked previously, there is no downside.

He talked to the men and women on the front line, including myself, who have been there. We have stood on that line in the middle of the night taken on drug smugglers and people who come across. You sit in the middle of that trail, 3:00 in the morning, the sensors goes off. You don't know if it's an illegal alien looking for a job or a heavily armed drug smuggler.

Christopher Steele was a former British spy who was the primary author for the anti-Trump dossier that was funded by the DNC and the Clinton campaign through this opposition research firm Fusion GPS. And the dossier matters because it was also a foundational piece for securing the surveillance warrant for a Trump campaign aide. What we expect when these documents are unsealed is, we will get kind of a road map as to how the dossier got to the FBI through multiple different channels in 2016. We know that the British spy Christopher Steele provided parts of the dossier to the FBI directly. We also know that once his contact was cut off with the FBI, he used a back channel through a senior Justice Department official. We also know through transcripts of interviews done here in Congress that at least one journalist provided pieces of the dossier to the FBI. But one of the missing links here has been the late Senator John McCain and the role of his associate, David Kramer, how they worked together to get the dossier to the FBI and also whether Kramer may have been the one to provide the dossier to BuzzFeed. And, remember, it was the report in BuzzFeed that kind of open the Pandora's box in January of 2017 that sort of helped kick-start the whole public discussion about Russian collusion -- Neil."

But the Southern District, where I'm an alumni of, their only limited by anything that might have taken place in their jurisdiction and the statute of limitations. They're not limited to collusion. They can look at any violation of federal law. And, Neil, what can they do? I mean, they're not continuing to investigate the president in order to just do nothing. They will look at these two Office of Legal Opinion opinions, legal counsel opinions, and they will say, hey, we agree with them, or we don't agree with them. If they don't agree with them, maybe they will do what we did in Watergate. Maybe they will file through the court a road map and ask the court to give it directly to the Judiciary Committee. Or another thing, they could bring a civil action. In the case involving Paula Jones, the Supreme Court said the president can be sued civilly.

But, Jon, what I also hear what you're saying is, the irony could be a much of the attention of the public has been on collusion, did anyone in the Trump team, the president even himself, do something to collude directly with the Russians to force the election in his favor? Now it's going into all other areas that have nothing to do potentially with collusion and everything to do with business deals that could go back decades."

He really didn't add anything to the collusion, so that didn't advance the ball at all. But that's correct. And that's why the Southern District of New York is a threat. And there is nothing the president can do about it. It's an institution. And firing the U.S. attorney, which he could do, that wouldn't matter. They're going to continue in the tradition of an honest investigation. Much like President Nixon, President Trump goes on foreign trips. He's on the world stage. And he comes back and all he is going to hear about from the press is Russian collusion, Southern District of New York. It's just difficult for him to get away from. I think the country needs some closure, though, to tell you the truth."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Joe Biden is at an event going on right now in Omaha, Nebraska, still is sort of dangling and thinking and torturing himself over whether he should run for president and all. We do know that he's spoken to advisers. We do know as well that he's getting advice from social media companies on exactly how to connect with younger voters. What would a presidential bid then mean in an already crowded field, especially with a relatively older guy reaching out to try to get younger guys? But, then again, Bernie Sanders has been very effective at that. Let's go to Democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov, RealClearPolitics' A.B. Stoddard, and Republican strategist Evan Siegfried. A.B., to you first on this reaching out that is to get young people going for you. It would be -- it would seem counterintuitive for an old guy to do that. But then we learned from Bernie Sanders it was very effective. So what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A.B. STODDARD, REALCLEARPOLITICS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think no matter -- that Joe Biden is a separate candidate than anyone else in the field. Of course, he can get it on his own time and he has an entirely different strength than any of the other candidates. But he's not going to just separate himself by being the only one who isn't attempting to have an Instagram game. So it's not like he's going to be doing a lot of pasta cooking with a streaming feed. But I think that he wants to be able to cut across the coalition. He won't be reaching for young people maybe the way Beto O'Rourke would be or even Bernie in terms of his sort of pie in the sky, free lunch, socialism things that candidates like Biden are not going to back. But he could have fun with videos and memes and try to sort of be a good time guy, without pretending that he's really Mr. Twitter."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "There can be some savvy with that, Jessica, but I'm wondering. The base of the party, whatever you want to call it these days, they have great respect for the vice president, the former vice president, but they also face a very crowded field of their own. We just mentioned -- A.B. just did -- Beto O'Rourke, young guy, if he enters this race."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Well, the young vote will split amongst a few candidates. And this is incredibly early. A lot of people who are going to declare aren't even in yet at this point. Young people did fuel the 2018 midterms alongside seniors, who might also like Joe Biden, by the way, putting that out there. But the young people are going to split amongst who they like, what proposals they're interested in. But I think this is an incredibly smart thing for Joe Biden to do. One of the companies that he's meeting with, NowThis News, which is basically responsible for Beto O'Rourke's viral effect across the nation, when they televised his defense of football players kneeling during the national anthem at games, that company reaches 70 percent of millennials across the nation right now."

      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "And there are other candidates going to meet with them as well, including Bernie Sanders, who, as we all can assume, didn't wake up one day and know how to wield social media control at the level that he did in 2016. He had a lot of advisers and probably had a lot of meetings with people to build that social media strategy. So the young will disperse, but it's very smart of Joe Biden to be doing this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, Evan, what I just don't understand right now, I guess who you meet with social media events. Are they acting as advisers, which might concern me a little bit here, or are they just sort of saying, this is how it works with our medium, this is how you connect? What are they doing?"

    {
      "speaker": "EVAN SIEGFRIED, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIEGFRIED",
      "utterance": "But I think that, for Bernie Sanders, he was smart in 2016, in that he spoke to the issues that young people actually cared about. And Joe Biden doesn't want to just say, these are the things I care about. He should be talking about what they care about. And, remember, Joe Biden, his presidential campaign strategy for the primaries would have to be based upon pulling certain percentages of each constituency, African-Americans, Hispanics, whites, millennials, baby boomers, out and getting them to vote for him. He doesn't need to win the entire overall youth vote."

      "utterance": "No, you're right about that."
    },

      "speaker": "SIEGFRIED",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The one thing I -- when I looked at Bernie Sanders and his appeal, he's direct and a genuine article, A.B. And one of the things that -- I don't think this is pegged to any age -- people respect someone who has been either consistent, his own man or woman, and a long history of being just that. I mean, he was hip into all this stuff before it became hip on all of this stuff. So I'm wondering if we overthink this, that if you need a social media person to tell you how to connect with Jessica, then something's wrong. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STODDARD",
      "utterance": "Well, you should still attempt -- as Jessica said, it's smart because you need to be where they are and then you need to get them to listen. So it's not something that Joe Biden can ignore."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STODDARD",
      "utterance": "Because they don't watch cable news. And they don't watch -- they probably don't even watch a lot of the debates, so you are really going to have to capture their attention in innovative ways. And then, again, you're going to be competing message wise with Bernie Sanders. I think Bernie Sanders, he had some great numbers out of New Hampshire day. He certainly has a very devoted following who have sent tons of money this first week. I don't know that he's going to be one of the final contenders next spring, that party officials expect this to go until May."

With the borders closed by the embattled President Nicolas Maduro, desperate Venezuelans are trying to get out any way they can, some crossing the river into Colombia carrying their children or whatever household goods they can manage just to get out of this country. The opposition leader, Juan Guaido, had promised to bring in massive amounts of humanitarian aid from around the world last weekend. He failed to do that. Maduro instead blocked the borders. There have been efforts to peel away the senior military leadership from Maduro. That up until now has also failed, Maduro still firmly in control on the ground here. As for Juan Guaido, the man backed as president of Venezuela by the U.S. and more than 50 other nations, he's in Brazil today, and he might have a challenging time even getting back into the country where he claims to be president -- Neil, back to you."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

King's College business Professor Brian Brenberg joins us right now. Brian, that's interesting, the latest one to say, like your ideas, I want to find out more about how you're going to pay for them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIAN BRENBERG, ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "Well, look, Nancy Pelosi is smart enough to know that you can't pay for these things simply by taxing the rich, which is what everybody in the Democratic Party in the House is saying. So she knows when somebody starts asking the tough questions, it'll probably come from the Republican side. They will say, the only way you're going to pay for this is raising taxes on the middle class. And that's an election loser. I don't care who's running for president on the Democrat side. So it's funny to see her in the shoes of the fiscal conservative. She's not. But in today's Democratic Party, that's the role she gets to play."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I think she is, as are others like Dick Durbin, not exactly conservatives, saying, we have got to find a way this is cost-effective, talking about Congresswoman Cortez's spending plans, green initiatives and the like. But I'm wondering whether this represents something more significant within the Democratic Party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRENBERG",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think there's an imagination problem in the Democratic Party. I mean, some on the right would say Democrats haven't had an original idea on any major policy issue for a very long time. They have got plenty of ideas now. The problem is they're totally unworkable. So, yes, Nancy Pelosi is fighting a losing battle because her opposition is capturing the imagination of the youth of their party and she's having a hard time beating it back right now. And it looks like desperation from her position."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "BRENBERG",
      "utterance": "Look, yes. I think it's very possible it will continue next year, if we get some policy changes, especially on trade. I think if trade gets done, the economy pops. But it's a very open question right now. And that is going to be a big issue going into 2020. But I do think Democrats put themselves in a bad position, even if the economy slows, if they're talking about $30 trillion price tags, because if the economy is slowing, consumers especially then, taxpayers especially then don't want to be paying more taxes for big government programs."

And that could be a very big clarion call in the next presidential campaign. We shall see. Certainly, we can figure out the number of people running for president is going to be significant, probably equal to the debt. \"The Five\" starts now.
