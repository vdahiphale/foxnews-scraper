After 40 years of talk, it's finally time for action. Fix the border for once and for all now. Now, the president's call for action comes as over 6,000 members of the migrant caravan have reached the Mexican border town of Tijuana and at one point as a smaller group of protesters broke away from the caravan and got within 500 feet of the U.S. border. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And in an interview released yesterday, get this, Hillary Clinton told \"The Guardian\" that Europe needs to get a handle on immigration to stop the growth of right wing populist. Hillary says, quote: I think it's fair to say Europe has done its part and must send a very clear message: we are not going to be able to continue to provide refuge and support because if we don't deal with the migration issue, it will continue to roil the body politic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining us now with reaction is America First Action senior advisor and former Trump press secretary, Sean Spicer, FOX News contributor Deroy Murdock, and National Border Patrol Council vice president, Art Del Cueto. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right.

It's now up to Democrats and Republicans to come together and do the right thing and help out with the bill that he is trying to present. I'll be honest, it also -- it falls on the leadership within the DHS and Homeland Security. This is a man that's on point and he is showing he cares.

What can a president do about that especially in light of this federal judge, you know, every time he does something, and we're going to talk about this in the next segment.

He has upended all of the precedent that has gone on before this and taken away just the talk and the rhetoric that we have gotten from so many politicians and replaced it with action. This president, I think, has done as much as he possibly can through executive order and action, and through his administration, through DHS.

And in the end, I will go to you, DeRoy, I mean, the truth is that, you know, the party is not working with him and now he says I want Republicans and Democrats to come together.

The other message that has to go out to all these people who want to rush across the border if you want to come to America, do the way my mother and father did when they left Costa Rica. They went to the U.S. embassy and they fill out that visa applications. Fill out the paperwork. That's not too much to ask.

Hey, if you guys want to give credit to President Trump, then give him credit because of the economy. That's the reason they're coming up here. The reality is, we have a president doing everything he can and everyone else needs to get on board. That's the bottom line. We all want to feel secure in our homes."

The town is happy to give them food and give them, you know, a place to stay. But I think we're looking at the crisis, you know, Guatemala and Tijuana.  But Tijuana in particular, in addition to some of the violence that we are seeing, you know, they are saying, look, we need the United Nations to come in.

And their attitude is basically like (INAUDIBLE) won't do. And here they come in Tijuana ready to rush the border of the United States.

They want to invade our country. They want to come in here because there is no consequences for them. That's what it is. And it's not a race issue. People need to get away from this.

He's creating an amazing economy where there is tons of jobs to go around and people are using that as a magnet to want to come into this country. But the president has been very clear. We are still a country of immigrants. We're welcoming country, but you have to do it legally. I think that's where people have to understand that the president wants to have law and order.

So, you know, that's ridiculous statement for her to have made and insulting. And, you know, I think it's shocking that, you know, that came so sort of casually out of her script."
    },

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And she did go off script because, of course, she is Hollywood and she thinks very strongly about this and let her, you know, if she needs a cop sometime deal with that. But, Jason, let me ask you, you get this. You are on the ground. While the government hesitates to pass immigration, so-called reform, and I still don't know why it's a broken immigration system, the only thing that's broken is the law, but, narcos and smugglers continue to conduct human trafficking, something like 80 percent of the drugs coming into this country are coming through the southern border. We're in an opioid crisis.  China is playing a role fentanyl as well. What is wrong with protecting our people from the poison that is coming through?"

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, the -- one of the things, the criminal aliens removing bad actors from our street of course is the goal of ICE. Yet, they object to ICE, they object to them doing their job. And even when their statistics are incredibly high in terms of drugs that they get off the streets, children that they protect in terms of human trafficking, they are still being criticized. And so, I guess the question is, why is it that or maybe that's the answer that Americans now see immigration as one of the biggest issues and most the biggest issue our country is facing? Jessica?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAUGHAN",
      "utterance": "Well, that's right. The immigration issue is one of the issues where there is the biggest difference between elite groups and American society and regular Americans. And so, this shows how out of touch people like actors in Hollywood and, you know, their script writers and others are that they don't -- they're not affected by illegal immigration. Their neighborhoods are not affected by it. They don't understand that Americans are suffering by our failure to enforce immigration laws. That, you know, people have lost family members because of our failure to enforce immigration laws. People have seen their schools having problems dealing with the number of people that they are forced to accommodate, taxpayers bills going up and quality of life declining in certain communities. And this is not affecting the Murphy Browns and the Candace Bergens but it is affecting regular Americans. And that's -- they just don't get it because they are not affected by it.  But I wish they had some sympathy for the people who are, who have lost jobs or, you know, lost family members because of illegal immigration."

Here we are now in the lame duck Congress and only now are we having subpoenas go out to Comey and Lynch. Those should have happened immediately when the inspector general issued his report that showed there were these irregularities in the Hillary Clinton investigation that resulted in no one really being held accountable when the law was not followed by Comey and by others. So, when you look at the total sum of what the Republicans have done, we drained the swamp of Comey by exposing him. McCabe, Page, and in fact the inspector general said never before has the top layers of the FBI been cleared out by this. But the fair criticism of us that you and others have logged is that we just didn't do it fast enough to actually hold Hillary Clinton and the people associated with her accountable and we never had a partner in Jeff Sessions."

So he is moving to challenge the subpoena. All right. They want him to testify before a House Committee on December 3rd. January 3rd is when the Democrats take over. So, you got Jim Comey's lawyer there, David Kelly, who I suspect will write a brief that's 29 pages long and then get a judge to take three weeks to not even render a decision and then we're nowhere with James Comey. Am I right or wrong? DAVID LIMBAUGH, \"JESUS IS RISEN\" AUTHOR: You are right about that. And, you know, how preposterous is it for Comey to complain about leaks when he is the master of leaks. He leaked something to deliberately start this special counsel investigation. He is trying to inflame the Democrats because he thinks this is going to be fought in the court of public opinion because he has no real basis. What really frosts me, Judge, is that he bent over backwards not to indict Hillary after he laid out air tight case against her and then he claimed a standard that there is no -- that had you to have a specific intent to violate the criminal law. Nobody believed that, and so, he bent backwards and the IG said he was insubordinate. Why was he so willing or so adamant about not indicting her that he was willing to be insubordinate to his superiors and not indict her? You need this hearing. The public has a right to know."

If Mueller finish, those guys are going to continue going. DAVID LIMBAUGH, AUTHOR & ATTORNEY: Yes. I hope they just make asses of themselves and it backfires in 2020. I agree with the congressman that I have no problem with this being made public. In fact, Comey already made it public will all his interviews when he went out on his book tour.

But I do know that they are a little nervous about it. But I don't think there is any connection in reality. I think maybe Stone was engaged in a little puffery when he said he predicted this and Corsi predicted these leaks were going to come out. I think he just hit on it accidentally.

You just can't -- nobody believes that that stretches credit credulity and quite frankly, it kind of shows that maybe Justice Roberts is projecting his own naivete, his own bias against bias, quite frankly.

Kayleigh, the truth is that what we've got are we've got forum shopping on some of the biggest issues that involve our country. And in the last segment we talked about the fact that immigration is now for many people the number one issue. How is it that they keep going to the ninth circuit or courts where, you know, it will move up to the ninth circuit and then some local, I'm calling him a local district judge, gets to do a temporary restraining order that enjoins the whole country?

The president has vast power over immigration. That was decided in Trump versus Hawaii when the Supreme Court literally said he has the power to do this. It was after a judge in Hawaii unilaterally struck down the temporary travel ban. The Supreme Court, of course, upheld that now have you another liberal activist judge doing the same thing with this asylum executive order. So, it's forum shopping.

Because the ninth circuit doesn't just not represent the area over which they rule, they don't represent the United States of America. They're the most overturned circuit for a reason. I mean, it's a fact.

This is what the country really needs. And it's really great when you see a president try to make both sides work together on it. Now, if they do not, if they don't, if they end up not working together like what Niger said, if they end up getting washed in the wash and going way left, then that's a real shame.
