And by moon landing, I'm referring to Brian Stelter sitting on a toilet. That's two. So, look, we haven't been doing fun news in a while. So, give me a break. So, it turns out it was as fake -- yes, as fake his Kat's love for jazz. But the love affair now has gone sour. I haven't been blindsided by a breakup like this since Donnie left Marie. They were brother and sister. So, with -- it's OK. So, yes. It's surprising that two men who profess their love for each other over and over again would now rip each other to shreds. You know, I'm starting to think that almost everything on that network is a lie. Now, I don't blame Cuomo after his firing, Lemon said Chris shouldn't get severance, since he broke journalistic standards. Which is funny, having Lemon lecturing someone on journalistic standards. That's like taking voice lessons from Neil Young, or learning how to meditate from Judge Jeanine. Bottom line. They're all phonies, including Chris. So, who do you root for? It's like a fight between Dracula and Frankenstein. I'm referring to Pelosi and Biden. But this rip tells a bigger story. It's a lesson about the media and that nothing they do is true. Even their friendships. They make it all up and they think you're dumb enough to buy it. Like the 1619 Project, a Russian collusion or a Hunter's laptop being disinformation, or that Kilmeade doesn't live out of his car. We know he does. Most of the media is just a collection of thirsty shallow hacks bent on fame and fortune. And when it goes sour, they'll sue their best pal. And that goes for America's sweetheart too, Dana Perino. She just assumed (INAUDIBLE) he was looking at you. Hi kid, I think. Actually, we do all get along here at Fox News. Here's me and Hemmer's hot tub. Here's me and Stuart Varney's hot tub. And here's me under Dana Perino's bed. That was a surprise. So, I don't care who wins this lawsuit. I just want you to know that they lie about everything from big things like collusion and crime to the little things like mere friendship. OK. Now who is bro Andrew. He's a jackass. True. And a creep, that's true. But he's still more competent than the current governor we have here. Kathy, what's her name? Who by the way, wasn't voted in by the people? She's such a dim bulb, she couldn't light up a glove compartment. She wouldn't budge on reading the bail reforms even as people died between her and Andrew Cuomo. They're responsible for the death of more New Yorkers than lose subway grates and falling air conditioners combined. But now she's coming around with an election looming. Too late, I say. So that's the dilemma, the lesser of two evils. If only there was a solution. And maybe there is. Shall I read you a tweet I saw from last night? Here goes. Hey, Greg, do you have any pictures of Kat's feet? Oh. Sorry, that's a wrong one. Freaking Geraldo. This is from our very own. Janice Dean. \"If Andrew Cuomo tries to run for governor again, maybe the weather bitch, will too.\" Well, that would be awesome. Because if she runs, she wins because unlike the others, she's real and she's likable. And there's nothing in her background, her past that would sink her. She's so clean. You can eat off her forehead. Trust me. I have. She's so spotless. He makes Dana Perino look like pig pen. And mark my words, if she does run, I will help her. Meaning I won't endorse her.",

Wednesday in his court filing he trashed his brotherly buffoon, even mentioning how Lemon warned Jussie Smollett that the cops didn't buy his fake hate crime.

And by moon landing, I'm referring to Brian Stelter sitting on a toilet. That's two. So, look, we haven't been doing fun news in a while. So, give me a break. So, it turns out it was as fake -- yes, as fake his Kat's love for jazz. But the love affair now has gone sour. I haven't been blindsided by a breakup like this since Donnie left Marie. They were brother and sister. So, with -- it's OK. So, yes. It's surprising that two men who profess their love for each other over and over again would now rip each other to shreds. You know, I'm starting to think that almost everything on that network is a lie. Now, I don't blame Cuomo after his firing, Lemon said Chris shouldn't get severance, since he broke journalistic standards. Which is funny, having Lemon lecturing someone on journalistic standards. That's like taking voice lessons from Neil Young, or learning how to meditate from Judge Jeanine. Bottom line. They're all phonies, including Chris. So, who do you root for? It's like a fight between Dracula and Frankenstein. I'm referring to Pelosi and Biden. But this rip tells a bigger story. It's a lesson about the media and that nothing they do is true. Even their friendships. They make it all up and they think you're dumb enough to buy it. Like the 1619 Project, a Russian collusion or a Hunter's laptop being disinformation, or that Kilmeade doesn't live out of his car. We know he does. Most of the media is just a collection of thirsty shallow hacks bent on fame and fortune. And when it goes sour, they'll sue their best pal. And that goes for America's sweetheart too, Dana Perino. She just assumed (INAUDIBLE) he was looking at you. Hi kid, I think. Actually, we do all get along here at Fox News. Here's me and Hemmer's hot tub. Here's me and Stuart Varney's hot tub. And here's me under Dana Perino's bed. That was a surprise. So, I don't care who wins this lawsuit. I just want you to know that they lie about everything from big things like collusion and crime to the little things like mere friendship. OK. Now who is bro Andrew. He's a jackass. True. And a creep, that's true. But he's still more competent than the current governor we have here. Kathy, what's her name? Who by the way, wasn't voted in by the people? She's such a dim bulb, she couldn't light up a glove compartment. She wouldn't budge on reading the bail reforms even as people died between her and Andrew Cuomo. They're responsible for the death of more New Yorkers than lose subway grates and falling air conditioners combined. But now she's coming around with an election looming. Too late, I say. So that's the dilemma, the lesser of two evils. If only there was a solution. And maybe there is. Shall I read you a tweet I saw from last night? Here goes. Hey, Greg, do you have any pictures of Kat's feet? Oh. Sorry, that's a wrong one. Freaking Geraldo. This is from our very own. Janice Dean. \"If Andrew Cuomo tries to run for governor again, maybe the weather bitch, will too.\" Well, that would be awesome. Because if she runs, she wins because unlike the others, she's real and she's likable. And there's nothing in her background, her past that would sink her. She's so clean. You can eat off her forehead. Trust me. I have. She's so spotless. He makes Dana Perino look like pig pen. And mark my words, if she does run, I will help her. Meaning I won't endorse her."

And he also, without doing it overtly; he's making a great case for school choice, because demonstrative annoying parents, like Seth Meyers can send their masked kids to one school and be compliant.

So, it's like, shoes, pants, shirt, let's put the mask on. And the most infuriating thing was that Eric Adams lifted the mask mandate for everybody, but kids under five. So, you could be 85 years old, have comorbidities, you don't have to wear a mask in a crowded room, but a preschooler does. How does that make sense?"
