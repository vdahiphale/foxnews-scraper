Well you know, inflation continues to take a bite out of us to play off that that sharp pain (ph) here in the latest period running away at about a 5.5 percent clip in case you are counting. It is hitting almost everything you are buying in July alone year over year increases the likes of which we have not seen in decades. Gasoline up about 42 percent, airfares 19 percent, hotels more than 24 percent, car rentals north of 73 percent. It's the trend that is not the consumers' friend. Welcome everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD. And what to make of a world where price increases are proving a little bit more than just transitory. They're sticking around a while. We've got you covered from all angles, including the White House response to all of this. But we're also going to be hearing from Lydia who had an appliance store, the very real price hikes that she is seeing up close and personal as Steve Harrigan at a supermarket in Atlanta. But we -- to begin with Lydia in Montclair, New Jersey, where if you're going into an appliance store, much like you are, if you're going in a grocery store, you're going to pay through the nodes (ph).

Like you mentioned, the consumer price index shows that consumers are paying on average about 5.4 percent for all goods this year over last year that is on par with what we saw last month as well showing that that inflation is still very hot. One thing to point out is that the monthly increase did slow to half a percent down from nine tenths of a percent in June, which is when we saw the highest monthly increase since August of 2008. Now if we take apart the data a little bit, take a look at this because it gives us an idea of exactly what is costing consumers more, where it's hurting them the most televisions, they're up almost 10 percent now over a year ago. Appliances that you mentioned, fridges and ovens up 12.3 percent. Laundry equipment like washers and dryers up almost 18 percent. We had a chance to talk to some folks today about where they're noticing and how they're feeling the pinch in the wallet. Listen to this.",

It's getting serious and the most concerning thing of all the data that Walmart crunches the highest correlation to consumers response hit is always gas prices. A gas prices are such a reflection of where we are in the economy. And as gas prices go up year on year, and as the report just told us 42 percent year on year, that really puts a dent in the consumer as well.

And if government policy and activity, it hasn't -- it's going to allow us to become as competitive as we were, say, two years ago, in generating our own oil and driving the global prices of oil down. I think that could be with us for a while. Hopefully, that will change. And maybe there's some, you know, faster adaptation to use of less gas and electric cars.

We're seeing a big increase in the concern about the economy. But it's different depending where you sit. So Democrats, by and large, are saying I'm not concerned about inflation. Less than 20 percent of them say that that's one of the biggest problems facing America today. And when you look at Independence Republicans, they view the world very differently. They're saying, more than 30 percent of them are saying that that is -- the inflation is, in fact, the number one issue facing America. So, we're really divided on how we see this.

The question people have is how long it's going to last. Republicans and Independents are a little bit more concerned about it. Democrats are willing to let it slide. If we're going to see it starting to, you know, sort of drag on now, people are going to start to see it through the holidays into early next year, throughout the winter, I think it's become a much bigger issue for Democrats. But at the same time, I think a lot of people are optimistic about the spending programs about infrastructure, and about the social programs. More than half of Americans think that that's actually going to help us move things forward. And so Republicans have a real challenge, because it's not enough for people to feel like things aren't good. They're going to have to have a solution, they're going to have to have something that makes people feel that the Republicans are going to be the party of the future. They're going to be the party that makes things better. Right now, it feels a little bit like Republicans are the party that's just saying no, and that's not necessarily a good place to be.

If this went to trial, I challenge you to find a single vote in the Senate that was against impeachment, you're probably not going to find one. And I think he knew that as well.

But having said that, the Assembly Judiciary Committee can still move forward with their investigation, and they should and we can still move forward with impeachment proceedings. The A.G.'s report covered the sexual harassment charges, but the Judiciary Committee is looking at a lot more than that. As you just heard, looking at the nursing home deaths, looking at the improper use of COVID testing for family and friends in his inner circle, looking at the book deal, a lot more that we are looking at, they should be looked at, they should continue this report, they planned on wrapping it up very shortly here, they should do that.

Even though we've had about a 30-day stretch without really any tropical development across the Atlantic. All of that is changing right as we're getting into kind of the meaty part of hurricane season, which is from now until about six weeks from now, it's when the bulk of our activity happens. So, this is a look at the radar picture. There's Puerto Rico, this is radar out of Puerto Rico looks like it's not as big of a deal right now. But that's just because that radar now getting -- little extending out a little bit too far from Puerto Rico as a storm is now just in towards the Dominican Republic area. I want to point out. So here's our tropical models. These are all of the different model suggestions of the track of the storm. You get the idea, a very general sense of agreement of pulling off towards the Northwest and then moving somewhere across the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. That's the point where we're going to watch to see if there's any maybe strengthening. Now, this is a forecast radar. It's just one models depiction of what it thinks the storm will look like. This goes in towards Friday morning. The storm not really well organized, and that's because it's got a lot of mountain territory to get over through Dominican Republic into Haiti. It's Hispaniola, is what we call that island. A lot of big mountains there that will rip it apart. And then we're also going to see this storm likely track right along the coast of Cuba. So the official track out of the National Hurricane Center, you get the idea right here, center of it, maybe hugging right along the coast a little bit inland. If that happens, even more destruction from the center of the storm. But then we are going to see this likely out across parts of the Eastern areas of the Gulf, more time across water there, would potentially give it the chance to strengthen at this point. Best guess is maybe into a strong tropical storm, eventually making some sort of a landfall around the panhandle of Florida. But you notice the eastern side of this track could be impacting some sort of the center of it interacting with the west coast of Florida. One last thing, Neil, I want to show you these are our sea surface temperatures, at least the anomalies where we are departure from typical temperatures. Right there across parts of the Eastern Gulf, temps a little bit below average. And that's where the center of this storm goes. That maybe helps us out a little bit for the strengthening, maybe inhibiting strengthening of the storm as it's in towards Eastern Gulf. Nonetheless, we know we're going to get a lot of moisture from the storm, especially across parts of Florida and maybe eventually in towards the southern Appalachians as well could cause some flooding there.

      "utterance": "Thank you Martha. Well you know, inflation continues to take a bite out of us to play off that that sharp pain (ph) here in the latest period running away at about a 5.5 percent clip in case you are counting. It is hitting almost everything you are buying in July alone year over year increases the likes of which we have not seen in decades. Gasoline up about 42 percent, airfares 19 percent, hotels more than 24 percent, car rentals north of 73 percent. It's the trend that is not the consumers' friend. Welcome everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD. And what to make of a world where price increases are proving a little bit more than just transitory. They're sticking around a while. We've got you covered from all angles, including the White House response to all of this. But we're also going to be hearing from Lydia who had an appliance store, the very real price hikes that she is seeing up close and personal as Steve Harrigan at a supermarket in Atlanta. But we -- to begin with Lydia in Montclair, New Jersey, where if you're going into an appliance store, much like you are, if you're going in a grocery store, you're going to pay through the nodes (ph). Lydia?"

      "speaker": "LYDIA HU, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neal, some of the price increases that we're seeing are upwards of 20 percent to 30 percent. Like you mentioned, the consumer price index shows that consumers are paying on average about 5.4 percent for all goods this year over last year that is on par with what we saw last month as well showing that that inflation is still very hot. One thing to point out is that the monthly increase did slow to half a percent down from nine tenths of a percent in June, which is when we saw the highest monthly increase since August of 2008. Now if we take apart the data a little bit, take a look at this because it gives us an idea of exactly what is costing consumers more, where it's hurting them the most televisions, they're up almost 10 percent now over a year ago. Appliances that you mentioned, fridges and ovens up 12.3 percent. Laundry equipment like washers and dryers up almost 18 percent. We had a chance to talk to some folks today about where they're noticing and how they're feeling the pinch in the wallet. Listen to this."

President Biden saying that the administration is going to take action. They are calling on production cuts of oil that were made internationally to be reversed now. And they're also calling on the FTC to investigate the domestic gasoline industry to make sure that there's no anti-competitive behavior involved that could be potentially, they say, driving gas prices.

In the meantime here, you're noticing when you go to any store these days, the former CEO of Walmart with us right now, Bill Simon, on how long that will likely last. Bill, it's good to have you. Walmart shoppers are seeing it as well. I know you guys try to hold the line on that sort of thing, but there's only so much you can control. This looks like it could get out of control. Where do you see it going? BILL SIMON, FMR. WALMART U.S. PRESIDENT & CEO: Yes, Neil, good to be with you. It's getting serious and the most concerning thing of all the data that Walmart crunches the highest correlation to consumers response hit is always gas prices. A gas prices are such a reflection of where we are in the economy. And as gas prices go up year on year, and as the report just told us 42 percent year on year, that really puts a dent in the consumer as well. And so far, through everything, the COVID and everything we've been through in the last year, the consumer has remained remarkably resilient. But as gas prices and food prices are particularly start to go up, I think we're going to see a reaction from the consumer."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIMON",
      "utterance": "Well, they change their protein. So they go from beef to chicken to cheeses, and things are different ways. And depending on where the prices are, they change their buying frequencies and their buying patterns to compensate for it. They're remarkably smart and very capable."

      "utterance": "You know, I'm curious, though, you know, in the latest government statistics, it's interesting, Bill, that, by and large, we've seen wages go up. In fact, they were going up at a pretty smart rate, 4 percent year over year, not bad. But, unfortunately, the things they're buying are going up at a 5.5 percent clip (ph). So they're losing money on this. That's not a good combination."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIMON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, a couple years ago, we were seeing wages go up 2 percent or 3 percent but prices were only going up 1 percent. And any other consumers (ph) was making out. I think the wild card and all this, Neil, is the amount of money that's been flowing from the government straight to the consumer. And, you know, I think that's kept them buying (ph) through the early stages of this inflation. But when that money runs out, or inflation outstrips that, that funding from the government I think there's going to be a day of reckoning. And hopefully by then prices will have begun to moderate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What do you think in your gut, do you think they will moderate? Everyone says it's transitory. I've been alive long enough. I know I don't look it to remember 200 inflationary spirals. They didn't end anytime soon. In other words, they drag on a while, that's the history on inflation. What do you think here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIMON",
      "utterance": "I'll tell you what really concerns me, it's oil prices, because there's oil -- oil prices impact the entire economy. One of the reasons that food prices are increasing is because the transportation component, obviously, oil of the food prices have gone up. And if government policy and activity, it hasn't -- it's going to allow us to become as competitive as we were, say, two years ago, in generating our own oil and driving the global prices of oil down. I think that could be with us for a while. Hopefully, that will change. And maybe there's some, you know, faster adaptation to use of less gas and electric cars. I still see that being 10 or 12, 15 years away before it has any meaningful impact on it. So I think in less (ph), we can get fuel prices, oil prices in line, gas prices back down. It could be with us for a while."

      "utterance": "Bill Simon, thank you. I thank my friend. Bill Simon, the former head of Walmart. Lee Carter, GOP pollster extraordinary with us right now. You know, the history again on this as we keep saying, Lee, is that inflation tends to stick around a while. It began with oil, it's extended to pretty much everything else. But the President today indicating that the trend is the friend that things will stabilize, that all this new government spending is going to put money in people's pockets. What we've discovered is you better be careful what you wish for because that extra money also has come with it bringing extra inflation. So where is this going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEE CARTER, GOP POLLSTER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a really interesting moment because conventional wisdom isn't applying for folks right now. About 64 percent of Americans are buying the President's message that this inflation is temporary. More than 70 percent Americans are reporting that they're feeling the impact of inflation in their pocketbooks right now. A lot of people are concerned about the economy overall. We're seeing a big increase in the concern about the economy. But it's different depending where you sit. So Democrats, by and large, are saying I'm not concerned about inflation. Less than 20 percent of them say that that's one of the biggest problems facing America today. And when you look at Independence Republicans, they view the world very differently. They're saying, more than 30 percent of them are saying that that is -- the inflation is, in fact, the number one issue facing America. So, we're really divided on how we see this. I think Democrats right now tend to be more optimistic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But we all go to the same stores, right? I'm sorry, Lee, but they all go to the same stores, whether you're Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, you're going to notice like, hey, bacon, it's doubled in price, but maybe, you know, some, you know, aren't too keen on bacon, and they might buy cheaper alternatives like get that. But the point is, you know, it's hard to ignore this. It's a real issue. Now, it might be a short lived one, although it's past the short live (ph), shelf life. I'm just wondering if this continues, and people notice, regardless of their income range, that their increases in what they make, is just being burnt up in what they're spending, then it could be a different story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "I think that's right. If it's an extended story, right now, people are just starting to notice that we're seeing over the last two months, the increase in the rise, and people being aware of it. Now more than 70 percent of people feel it, 80 percent of people are concerned about their health care costs. This is really starting to feel like it's something. The question people have is how long it's going to last. Republicans and Independents are a little bit more concerned about it. Democrats are willing to let it slide. If we're going to see it starting to, you know, sort of drag on now, people are going to start to see it through the holidays into early next year, throughout the winter, I think it's become a much bigger issue for Democrats. But at the same time, I think a lot of people are optimistic about the spending programs about infrastructure, and about the social programs. More than half of Americans think that that's actually going to help us move things forward. And so Republicans have a real challenge, because it's not enough for people to feel like things aren't good. They're going to have to have a solution, they're going to have to have something that makes people feel that the Republicans are going to be the party of the future. They're going to be the party that makes things better. Right now, it feels a little bit like Republicans are the party that's just saying no, and that's not necessarily a good place to be. I think they're going to have to have a story, plus these feelings of people saying, you know, what, this isn't working for us. And so, Republicans have some work to do over the next few months."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And you got to wonder, too, I mean, someone's going to be very right or someone's going to be very wrong. Democrats are placing their bets on a $3.5 trillion human infrastructure package, on top of this $1 trillion actual infrastructure package, even though it is no actual infrastructure. But they're looking at that and saying, all right, that's going to produce a boon for the economy that will carry us right through the midterm elections and will profit off and considerably. Republicans counter and say, no, by the end, whatever gains you're talking about will be eaten up by the higher prices of everything. So someone's going to be fatally mistaken on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Yes. And I think that the people that we really need to be focused on right now are those independent voters, those people who could go either way on this right now. And independents, by and large, are behaving more like Republicans. When you look at how they view inflation, when you look at how they view infrastructure, when you look at how they view the economy. Right now, they're leaning more Republican, and that's going to be problem for the Democrats come the midterms, but the Republicans are really going to have to have a story as to why these independents are going to move to their side. Right now, it can't be enough that they have the same sentiment, it's got to be enough for them. It's -- they're going to have to come to a place that they say, you know what, I want to vote Republicans because they're the party that's going to do something to fix the problems I see in front of me.

To Lee's point, if you're looking separately at the markets, if they're worried about this, how often I say this, they have a funny way of showing it. The Dow and the S&P race to new records today. NASDAQ wasn't following suit. But again, the market's view of this has always been this too shall pass. In other words, the rate of increase is beginning to slow. They argument maybe this short live thing sticks. Hard to say but right now, they don't appear to be too worried about this at the corner of wall and broad. That could change, these guys are not Nostradamus, but we're following that. And there is a new sheriff coming to town in New York.

      "speaker": "ANGELO SANTABARBARA (D), NEW YORK ASSEMBLYMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, we were all surprised by the Governor's resignation. He had been so defiant that we were not expecting a resignation. But given the fact that he did resign, we have to believe that he determined that it may have been his only option at this point. He could certainly count votes. He knows -- he knew that an impeachment means that he just -- he would have -- he would not have much support in the Assembly or the Senate. If this went to trial, I challenge you to find a single vote in the Senate that was against impeachment, you're probably not going to find one. And I think he knew that as well. And this resignation, of course, you know, in typical, Governor Cuomo fashion has this 14-day waiting period, which is unheard of that we have to put up with him for the next two weeks. But having said that, the Assembly Judiciary Committee can still move forward with their investigation, and they should and we can still move forward with impeachment proceedings. The A.G.'s report covered the sexual harassment charges, but the Judiciary Committee is looking at a lot more than that. As you just heard, looking at the nursing home deaths, looking at the improper use of COVID testing for family and friends in his inner circle, looking at the book deal, a lot more that we are looking at, they should be looked at, they should continue this report, they planned on wrapping it up very shortly here, they should do that. And they should present it to the full body and make their recommendation. We need to decide if we're going to move forward with impeachment. We should not let the Governor's resignation decide what we're going to do next. We should decide what the next steps are based on their findings."

We're able to get back to the important work that we have to do at the state Capitol. And by his own words, yesterday, he has been and continues to be a distraction. Now he's going to be a distraction for the next 14 days as well. But having said that, the impeachment investigation, one of the things we can do going forward is we need accountability, we need to decide what next the steps are there. There are a number of investigations going forward, including criminal investigations. And the -- as we saw, there may be may be others that have yet to come forward. That's the other part of this. So it's very important that we complete this work. It's very important that we hold him accountable for his actions. He tried to minimize his actions. We didn't hear an apology during -- when he announced his resignation. He blamed his actions on generational differences. He claimed he didn't know where the line was redrawn on sexual harassment, when in fact, he's the one that redrew those lines. He's the one that champion those sexual harassment laws. And he's acting like it was something he didn't know about. So, we have more work to do, but it's in -- the Judiciary Committee's report will be important to determine what those next steps are and how we hold this Governor accountable. Should that be impeachment? It should be one of those options that should be on the table for sure."

And while I should have listened to Rick Reichmuth, who was saying, you know, we're a long way from the hurricane season being done. And along comes this Tropical Storm Fred barreling up to the Dominican Republican and points north what it seems now including the state of Florida. Rick, what are we looking at here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes, you know, you said if we got to the five named storms faster than we ever had, and that was on the heels of last year, which we had the most active season we've ever had, we do expect this year to be active. Even though we've had about a 30-day stretch without really any tropical development across the Atlantic. All of that is changing right as we're getting into kind of the meaty part of hurricane season, which is from now until about six weeks from now, it's when the bulk of our activity happens. So, this is a look at the radar picture. There's Puerto Rico, this is radar out of Puerto Rico looks like it's not as big of a deal right now. But that's just because that radar now getting -- little extending out a little bit too far from Puerto Rico as a storm is now just in towards the Dominican Republic area. I want to point out. So here's our tropical models. These are all of the different model suggestions of the track of the storm. You get the idea, a very general sense of agreement of pulling off towards the Northwest and then moving somewhere across the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. That's the point where we're going to watch to see if there's any maybe strengthening. Now, this is a forecast radar. It's just one models depiction of what it thinks the storm will look like. This goes in towards Friday morning. The storm not really well organized, and that's because it's got a lot of mountain territory to get over through Dominican Republic into Haiti. It's Hispaniola, is what we call that island. A lot of big mountains there that will rip it apart. And then we're also going to see this storm likely track right along the coast of Cuba. So the official track out of the National Hurricane Center, you get the idea right here, center of it, maybe hugging right along the coast a little bit inland. If that happens, even more destruction from the center of the storm. But then we are going to see this likely out across parts of the Eastern areas of the Gulf, more time across water there, would potentially give it the chance to strengthen at this point. Best guess is maybe into a strong tropical storm, eventually making some sort of a landfall around the panhandle of Florida. But you notice the eastern side of this track could be impacting some sort of the center of it interacting with the west coast of Florida. One last thing, Neil, I want to show you these are our sea surface temperatures, at least the anomalies where we are departure from typical temperatures. Right there across parts of the Eastern Gulf, temps a little bit below average. And that's where the center of this storm goes. That maybe helps us out a little bit for the strengthening, maybe inhibiting strengthening of the storm as it's in towards Eastern Gulf. Nonetheless, we know we're going to get a lot of moisture from the storm, especially across parts of Florida and maybe eventually in towards the southern Appalachians as well could cause some flooding there.

Let's go to Richard Besser, the former Acting CDC Director to get his take on all of this. Richard, it's always good having you.

I think there are settings where requiring vaccination makes a lot of sense. You know, for our offices, we're reopening our offices after Labor Day and only staff who are fully vaccinated can work in the building. Others will need to work remotely. For a school setting where you have teachers and staff who may be at increased risk of having severe disease, you have children for whom vaccines aren't yet available, I think considering requiring vaccination is something that should be on the table. My hope is that more people will reach out to their own health care providers, explore this, get their questions answered and make the decision to get vaccinated.

It's important for their educational progression, for their social, emotional, physical well-being. And schools are taking a layered approach to preventing COVID with improved ventilation and separating desks, and in many schools doing testing and wearing masks. The thing is, Neil, that this strain, the Delta variant is so much more contagious. Last year, there was an approach of cohorting, which is going to be used this year as well, where you're going to try and keep children contained within particular classes. With a strain that this contagious, I worry that when it's introduced into one classroom, it's going to be very hard to keep it contained to one classroom and say, OK, that class will be working -- will be attending school remotely. I think we're going to end up seeing more schools that have to shut down for short periods, and then reopen as they're able to contain COVID.

If your child happened to be carrying it, it helps protect staff and teachers. Some of whom may have immune conditions for which the vaccine doesn't give them as much protection. It's part of what we do to help protect each other. You know, if each person had a sign on them that said, I'm carrying the virus or I'm infected with the virus would be different thing, but so many people can carry this virus and spread this virus who don't even know it.

It's not the billionaires who get their money based on capital gains, which is taxed at a lower rate. But here's the bottom line, he makes -- the point he makes is very valid. Look at what's in this package. Look at what we're spending money on. And by the way, I know you had the last guest on talking about masks, the pandemic is coming to an end. I mean, the vaccines do work. You know, if you noticed people that are getting sick generally do not get the vaccines, things are opening up. That is the stimulus package."

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Oh yes. Well, look, they're spending the money. They're making sure it sticks around by just throwing money at a problem that doesn't exist. The economy is doing pretty well, right?"
