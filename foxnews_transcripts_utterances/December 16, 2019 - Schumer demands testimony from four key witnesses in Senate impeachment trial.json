Breaking tonight: as the House gets ready for an historic vote to impeach the president of the United States, another record day on Wall Street today. All three major indices closed at new record highs. as investors are optimistic over trade deals here in North America and with China: the Dow gaining 101 today, the 16th record close of 2019; the S&P 500 up 23, the 29th record of the year; and the NASDAQ finished ahead 79, number 24 this year. As the I's are being dotted and the T's crossed for the official impeachment vote here in Washington, the bulls are still running on Wall Street. Susan Li from Fox Business Network is in New York with the market optimism, despite all the political turmoil. Good evening, Susan."

And one notable milestone crossed today: the Dow gaining its 10,000th point since the presidential elections in 2016. So, for the year, it's been one of the best over the past decade, with the Dow now up 21 percent, the best year for the S&P 500 in six years and counting. The NASDAQ, the best performer so far in 2019, led by gains in tech giants' Apple and Microsoft, optimism that's been further fueled by expectations that USMCA, which is the new NAFTA trade deal, will be approved by Congress on Thursday. A last-minute dispute threatening to snag USMCA approval, though, with Mexico complaining about rules installing U.S. inspectors, complaints that seemed to be resolved after discussions today with Mexico's representative now saying that he's very satisfied."

Turning now to impeachment, Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, is demanding four current and former White House officials be issued subpoenas to testify in an impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate, if the full House passes the two articles of impeachment it has on the docket, as expected. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts is following that story from the North Lawn as we await a response from the president. Good evening, John."

      "utterance": "Bret, good evening to you. Considering that within 48 to 72 hours, President Trump could become just the third president in American history to be impeached, the White House was pretty low-key about it all today. But behind the scenes, preparations for what may lie ahead after the Christmas break. President Trump took no questions on impeachment at a meeting with several governors this afternoon. His only comments about his looming fate on Twitter this morning: \"Read the transcripts,\" he wrote. \"The impeachment hoax is the greatest con job in the history of American politics.\" A new Fox News poll finds that the impeachment investigation and public hearings have not had a significant impact on public opinion. Support for impeaching and removing the president about where it was in late October: 50 percent of respondents favor impeachment; it was 49 percent in late October; 46 percent oppose impeachment now, compared to 45 percent in October. At the same time, President Trump's job approval rating has ticked up, now 45 percent, compared to 42 percent in late October. Now the battle is turning toward the Senate and an impeachment trial expected to begin in January. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sending a letter to Senator Mitch McConnell asking to call four current or former White House witnesses: acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney; his top adviser, Robert Blair; former National Security Adviser, John Bolton; and Michael Duffey, the deputy director for national security at the Office of Management and Budget."

Stephanie Grisham tweeting: \"Let us hope that fairness will prevail.\" A laughable quote from Senator Schumer this morning after Dems released an impeachment report in the middle of the night: \"Thankfully, the people of this country continue to see the partisan sham that this is.\" President Trump did talk today about Rudy Giuliani, who recently traveled to Budapest in Kiev to meet with former Ukrainian officials and produce a documentary aimed to undercut the impeachment proceedings. Giuliani was at the White House last Friday. The president said today Giuliani didn't talk much about his trip, but President Trump had high praise for him."

    {
      "speaker": "Bret Baier",
      "utterance": "Just what Kristin was talking about there, the James Comey interview with Chris Wallace over the weekend. What was your take? I mean, a lot of people said they were surprised by how much he said he didn't remember or didn't know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Brit Hume",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, I agree with that. I think he gets credit for doing the interview, and I think he gets credit for saying that he was wrong about one thing at least, which was that the FISA process that he discussed, it wasn't as robust as he previously claimed repeatedly. Beyond that, though, it seems to me that he still tried, wherever and in any way he could to exonerate himself and the senior leadership of the FBI, which the IG report manifests, so he did not do. So I think, you know, we know a little bit more about how slippery he can be. But Chris did well to get that confession from him, and hurray for Chris, and hurray for you for the previous interview you did with elicited some information about Comey that was clearly not true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bret Baier",
      "utterance": "Yeah. It's been a lot of information over these past couple of years. The other interview on Fox News Sunday was Adam Schiff, the chairman now of the House Intelligence Committee. Here, he's talking about his response to Devin Nunes and this report about the FISA process."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Adam Schiff",
      "utterance": "I'm certainly willing to admit that the inspector general found serious abuses of FISA that I was unaware of. Had I known of them, Chris, yes, I would have called out the FBI at the same time. But I think it's only fair to judge what we knew at the time, not what would be revealed two years later. But, yes, there were very serious abuses of the FISA process. They need to be corrected. We need to make sure they never happen again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bret Baier",
      "utterance": "That seems, Brit, on its face, to be a fine answer right now. But if you look back in time --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Brit Hume",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bret Baier",
      "utterance": "-- at what was happening then --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Brit Hume",
      "utterance": "He says he didn't know about that. What utter nonsense. One of the most striking things about this IG report, Bret, as I'm sure you've noted, is how closely it mirrors what the Devin Nunes investigation, when Nunes was still chairman and Schiff was ranking member on the Intelligence Committee, what Nunes found and what he said about the FISA abuses and so on, to which this very same Adam Schiff issued a report in rebuttal which disputed the Nunes findings, findings now confirmed by the IG report. And now he claims he didn't know about those things. Of course, he knew about them. He wrote a rebuttal to them, and the rebuttal was full of falsehoods. So, you know, it's striking to me that having said, for however many -- two years that he had additional -- all this additional evidence on collusion, and that turned out not to exist, or it was at least unfindable by the Mueller team, he now is claiming that he didn't know about the FISA abuses, which he most certainly did. And yet here is the guy appointed by Nancy Pelosi to lead the impeachment inquiry. Remarkable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bret Baier",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, that part of that interview didn't get picked up a lot. And back in -- when he issued that response to Nunes, the media lifted up that response as --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Brit Hume",
      "utterance": "Oh, the media treated Schiff's response like this was the official report; these are the facts. And I -- you know, I looked to see if any reporters are now acknowledging that they had that wrong. I think I've counted one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bret Baier",
      "utterance": "Last thing very quickly. Do you think there's any shoe to drop in this process of impeachment that we don't yet know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Brit Hume",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, as you've often said, Bret, about all these things, we don't know what we don't know. But I would say this: I attribute this desire to bring on additional witnesses that weren't called by the House or were not reached by the House as an attempt to try, at long last, to breathe some life and to engender some real public interest in what is being charged here. It hasn't worked so far. Public opinion has barely moved. And I don't think, you know, that Democrats think they have much to lose by calling in witnesses. But I would say this about one witness in particular, John Bolton, who, throughout much of the time in question, not all of it, but much of it, was the national security advisor and thus privy to the deliberations in the Trump administration about how to handle Ukraine, and somebody who is a Ukraine, you know, supporter and hawk."

Today, on December 16, 1944, 200,000 German soldiers were turned back after a surprise offensive by wearied U.S. troops. U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper was in attendance and paid tribute to more than 19,000 Americans who died during that battle. Just some of the other stories Beyond Our Borders tonight. We'll be right back."

The legislation would raise the tobacco purchase age to 21; three Obamacare taxes would be repealed: the Medical Device tax, the Cadillac tax, and the health insurance tax; military members would receive a 3.1 one percent pay increase; and nearly $1.4 billion is earmarked for the border wall system, with flexibility on where the president can build that wall.

This, as the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, is really targeting some GOP senators, specifically Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Cory Gardner, Lisa Murkowski, potentially, to get witnesses during a Senate trial. These people would have to vote on that decision, and it could affect whether it happens or not. What about that? Let's bring in our panel: Christopher Stirewalt, politics editor here at Fox News; Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor at The Federalist; and Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics. Okay, Mollie, what about this Schumer effort?"

    {
      "speaker": "Mollie Hemingway",

The problem is what the House did already. When they had a chance to do this in a fair manner, in a way that people would think of as legitimate, they chose not to do that pretty much every step of the way. So, it's very hard to now ask the Senate to go out of their way to be helpful to the Democrats, as they try to have some chance with this impeachment, when they didn't do that when they were in control in the House."

      "speaker": "Chris Stirewalt",

She could have waited for the Supreme Court to make a decision about the power of the House to call witnesses and the supreme power of the House under impeachment and all of those things. And there was going to be some -- potentially some interesting new case law made, and it would have been cool. But that did not fit the political timetable for Democrats because that could have taken us well into 2020 and pretty close to election day. So she said we're going to go ahead without the rulings, and then the Senate has the power to compel it. But it's not even in Chuck Schumer's interest. He is almost going through the motions here because it's in no senator's interest to have a wiz-bang, gee wiz, week's long goat roping on national television in the Senate."

You see atic up there from late October in this particular poll. However, the president's job performance also takes a tick up, Fox poll two, from 42 to 45 in this latest poll. In the RCP average of recent polls when it comes to impeachment, Mo, it does seem like it is going a little bit upside-down. It's kind of shift -- shifted \"oppose\" and \"support.\" Of course, everybody over the weekend was saying, \"Even Fox News poll.\" They love to say that, even though we're just like every other poll anyway. Go ahead."

What's amazing is -- to me, is just how remarkably static it's been in terms of the country being fairly evenly divided. Sometimes it's a little bit above, sometimes it's a little bit below. People seem to -- you know, the cake may be baked, which is why I think you do see Democrats pushing for the witnesses, because I think it's going to take some new information. And these guys that you just had up on the screen, they are the ones who have the potentially new information to inject into the conversation that could, you know, break the fever a little bit in terms of the approval ratings on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mollie Hemingway",
      "utterance": "Well, when you look at these numbers, they really are stagnant, not just from recent months, but really going back to March, the same percentage of people wanted impeachment then as they do now. I think the reason why Democrats wanted to do it was because they just wanted to tarnish Donald Trump's name leading up into the election. So that's why these approval polls showing that he is, in some cases, at an all-time high, that really shows what didn't go well for the Democrats more than any shift in impeachment numbers, although that's also significant."

And remember, there's -- you know, it wasn't until very, very late, right before he left office, that you started to see mass public movement towards -- in support of Richard Nixon's impeachment. People tend not to like it. They never liked it with Bill Clinton. These numbers are stronger."

Not only is he not vindicated, I think it's worth remembering there's actually a criminal investigation going on into some of these things that were done. And the Horowitz report, which could only talk to people at the Department of Justice who agreed to speak with Horowitz had -- is limited. What this criminal probe can do is look into people who used to work there, like Comey, and other who are not even in the FBI or Department of Justice. We don't know what that's going to find out. We were told for years, \"We don't know what's going to be in the Mueller report.\" Well, we found out that there was no Russia collusion.

      "utterance": "Finally tonight, getting in the Christmas spirit, a grieving father honoring his daughter's memory by bringing a Christmas tree farm to a children's hospital in Alabama. The kids were able to pick out their own tree, decorate it with homemade ornaments. Mark Miller, whose daughter Mary Beth died at the age of seven said he knows the difficulty and toughness of bringing the holiday spirit to a loved one in the hospital. Miller, along with his Ace Hardware colleagues, delivered more than 340 Christmas trees, a whole winter wonderland, to that hospital. That is awesome. That's it for this Special Report, fair, balanced, and unafraid. The Story hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now. It's just the little things, Martha, that's it."
