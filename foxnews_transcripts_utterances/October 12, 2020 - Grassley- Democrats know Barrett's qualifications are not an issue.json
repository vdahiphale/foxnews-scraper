Mariel, you know Judge Barrett well. And thank you for coming. I don't believe we have ever had, at least in recent memory, a justice with young school-age kids. Now we will have plenty if she makes it. Tell us about that part of her life, because it was the first thing she talked about."

And I think that will absolutely bring a new dynamic to the court. Judge Barrett is open about how important her family is to her. And when I was clerking with her on the Seventh Circuit, we would see her children. Occasionally, her youngest would come into chambers with her, and they would be there while we worked. And if that -- if she winds up as a justice on the Supreme Court, I think that dynamic will be the same. Her family's a big part of her life. And that will, of course, continue."

She never snapped back at any of the senators, notwithstanding some of the inappropriate questions.

This process can be very unseemly. And it seems, over the years, it's gotten even more so, when you think that a Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg was approved, what, 96-3. That wasn't all that, that long ago. But, of course, times have changed mightily. How do you think this process is going to go? The chairman of the committee, Lindsey Graham, is very confident the votes are all there, and it will get wrapped up before Election Day. What do you think?"

Think back to Justice Thomas. Let's face it, confirmations for Supreme Court justices have become, Stephen Carter of the Yale Law School put it many years ago, a mess. And so how big of a mess is it going to be? At least today, there weren't the kind of ad hominem attacks on the individual's character that we have seen, including with Bob Bork so many years ago. But it's really become very political and insulting in one way. You're being put on the court, Judge Barrett, simply to overturn the Affordable Care Act. That is stuff and nonsense, absolute nonsense. But it is politics. It's a political season. And, frankly, I think, at this stage, it's all the Democrats have. They don't have substantive arguments with her with respect to her qualifications, her abilities, her character. Look at those kids. She drives a minivan, right, with seven children. And the outpouring today by her former dean, the dean emerita, as Lindsey Graham said, if I'm pronouncing that right, the dean emerita, was so powerfully saying, I -- last time I testified was in favor of Elena Kagan, and I'm here with the equal kind of confidence in the abilities and the character of this judge."

And, of course, he was Barack Obama's pick in his final year in office to try to get to the Supreme Court. We all know what happened. But it talked about how his profile has risen rather dramatically. He's seen as an elder statesman right now. But the point that got me near the end of the article was that, now in his 60s, he is unlikely to be called to become a Supreme Court justice, no matter who's in the White House, that they're erring on the side of young.

You always hear this term packing the Supreme Court, packing the Supreme Court. As I was trying to raise this past weekend on our live show, that all started with Franklin Roosevelt in 1937. He had won in a landslide in 1936. He was annoyed as all heck at the Supreme Court, because a lot of the justices ruled down a lot of the things he wanted to do. So, he said, I have an idea. I'm going to pack this puppy, and I'm going to try to add judges that will make it impossible for them to overrule me. Here's the thing that happened, though. Not only did Republicans find it obnoxious, but Democrats did as well. FDR learned his lesson. Now fast-forward to today. What is Joe Biden's view on all of this? Hard to know -- after this."

But that is really campaign Biden's push right now. Less clear, of course, is how the campaign feels about this effort on the part of some Democrats to push for another FDR packing of the Supreme Court to load it up with liberal-minded justices that will prevent this from being a problem anymore in the future. That's their view. As to whether the Biden camp espouses that, we don't know. They don't answer the question.

Biden has tried to frame this as unconstitutional, saying voters are being robbed of their chance to weigh in on the process, because voters make up the makeup of the next Senate.

And it's a curious way to honor the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, because she spoke vehemently against this type of proposal. She said it would effectively destroy the court. And it would. For about almost 30 years, I have proposed the expansion of the Supreme Court. But that's over the course of about 20 years. That's different from packing the court, to just dump five or six new members, so you get an instant majority. That would do considerable violence to this institution.

Well, these are not supposed to be blind date elections. We're - - on an issue of this importance, which was raised, by the way, by the Democrats, not by the Republicans, he really does have a duty to be clear as to where he stands.

He ought to know better than lie to the American people that this case won't be made public maybe for months down the road. And a lot of times, they don't do it until the last couple weeks of June.

I mean, it's not -- and I don't mean Democrats. I mean Americans, Republicans, Democrats, independents, vegetarians, Oakland Raider fans. I mean, everybody is saying..."

And they're saying, look, we have got to have this spending bill, or it's going to do enormous damage and take us much longer to get out of the hole."

      "speaker": "ACUNA",
      "utterance": "But the president still has to do some convincing on his own party's side. You have a number of Republicans in the Senate who are still frustrated by what the president has brought up. But then we also had -- over the weekend, we had the White House chief of staff, we had the Treasury secretary saying, look, we're calling on Congress, let's get this done, let's begin with the PPP, let's do that. However, nothing has moved yet. And I know that the airwaves today have been filled with the Supreme Court nomination. However, this is something Americans are waiting on every day, hour by hour. What is going to move this along?"

      "utterance": "Well, I agree with you. I agree with everything you just said. And I think most Americans agree with what you just said. And I hope they also agree with the fact that we need a holistic approach to this. We can't start parceling out pieces, because that's going to do damage to many of my constituents. In other words, we can't say, well, let's take care of the airlines, and then we will take care of the payroll protection program later. We have to do everything, and we need to do it as quickly as we can. I would say to the American public that I think that the problem is here. We can pass the bill, the president -- what the president wants, but it will mean that Republicans and Democrats will have to vote together. It'll be a bill where there may be, and particularly in the House, more Democrats voting for it than Republicans. And I think that's a political picture that some Republicans don't care to share out in the greater universe. But that may be the only way we're going to get something substantial passed. And I would rather have both sides bending, as opposed to breaking the heart of the American public. And I think that's what's going on now. People are out here hurting and crying."

We're just at the beginning of the week here for Judge Amy Coney Barrett. But I wanted to know what you thought. How do you feel Democrats are doing right now in this hearing? And do they -- are they walking a fine line this week? They got to be careful. She seems to be doing well."

And unlike some of my colleagues, if I hear somebody attacking her religion, I won't be saying, I wouldn't do it, I would have never said it. I will condemn it. I'm an ordained United Methodist pastor with three years of seminary. I have a master's degree in theology. I respect every religion, every faith tradition. And if somebody is attacking her religion, that's -- in fact, I just made a phone call and said, hey, I keep hearing people, the Republicans, saying that. Can somebody tell me who it was? So -- and I'm going to try to figure that out. I will hopefully get some more information about it."

      "utterance": "Twenty years ago today, what some call the precursor of the modern-day terrorist attacks on the United States that would come 11 months later at the World Trade Center. Well, it all began 20 years ago today, when the USS Cole, off the coast of Yemen, was attacked by Al Qaeda terrorists in a speedboat. It ultimately killed 17 sailors, wounded another 37. And it was the opening salvo, some say the continuing salvo, in a terror war that continues to this day. Kirk Lippold, the commander of USS Cole, joins us right now. Commander, very good to have you. If you think about what you and your men and women endured that day, and what it would trigger a little more than 11 months later, and in countless attacks back and forth since, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK LIPPOLD, FORMER COMMANDER, USS COLE",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, it was one of those where the attack on USS Cole really was the start, because, up until that point, whether it had been World Trade Center 1, Khobar Towers, the embassies in Africa, they were attacked by terrorist organizations against buildings that housed and represented U.S. interest. Cole was actually -- the attack on Cole was an attempt to prevent us from defending those interests. And when you try to take away a nation's ability to defend itself, it's an act of war that, unfortunately, because of the mind-set of the American people in the political class at the time, they missed it. And so, unfortunately, we suffered through 9/11 11 months later."

      "utterance": "There was no indication. The morning we pulled in for a brief stop for fuel as part of routine harbor operations, we contracted for three garbage barges to take off trash, plastic and hazmat. Two boats came out, one to the middle of the ship, one to the back of the ship by the flight deck. They left and were halfway across the harbor when a boat that looked exactly like they did about 24-foot-long, center console, outboard motor with to two people in it, came down by the bow, came right to the middle of the ship -- that's how it was inside the security perimeter -- and detonated as a waterborne improvised explosive device, which the Navy had no intelligence on, we'd never trained for. And, consequently, that explosion would kill 17 and wound 37. But the crew responded as true heroes and valiantly, and immediately went out to save that ship and their shipmates."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Just amazing. That was an Al Qaeda-sourced attack. Al Qaeda and host of others, from the Taliban, to ISIS, have emerged, different names, same goal, same perversions. We like to say now we have got ISIS on the run, and this isn't a problem anymore. You have always reminded me, they're like cockroaches. They come up in different forms, shapes and in different locales. Are you still worried about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIPPOLD",
      "utterance": "I'm very much concerned. I think, unlike the mind-set back then, I think that Americans now realize there's no such thing as a non-state sponsor of terrorism. All these international terrorist organizations have state sponsors somewhere that allow them to recruit, to conduct operations, to do financing, get arms. And so, consequently, it's going back to some of these governments that have supported it. One that recently decided to change its mind and turned around has been Sudan, which there was a lawsuit by some of the Cole survivors that have done that. But the reality is, we need to hold governments accountable. And when we, as the United States, do that, that is where you go to the core and the route of finding terrorists and cutting them off at the knees, so that they literally don't have the capability to do harm, not only to the United States, but our allies in other countries around the world."

It was an absolute honor to be at that ceremony today, to not only remember the 17 sailors we lost, but to truly honor the crew that saved that ship, where USS Cole is out there still defending freedom today, and getting ready for another deployment. Those young men and women have inherited that legacy. And they're carrying on in the finest traditions of the United States Navy."

But Florida is an important tipoff, as the president plans his first outside Washington area campaign appearance since testing positive for COVID. David Paleologos joins us right now from Suffolk University, good read of all things politics and where we stand right now. David, the polls show it's still pretty tight in the Sunshine State. The RealClear average still gives the edge to Joe Biden, but anything could happen. What's your sort of lay of the Florida state right now?"

I'm less inclined to believe that. I think that, in the last election, we had higher-than-average in undecideds, higher than average in the third- party candidates.
