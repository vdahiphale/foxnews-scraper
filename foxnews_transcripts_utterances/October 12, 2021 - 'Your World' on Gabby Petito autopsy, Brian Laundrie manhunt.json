We know that, on September the 13th, Laundrie, Brian, goes missing himself, last seen allegedly in the Carlton Reserve. They started and they searched that Carlton Reserve. We know that, on September the 19th, Gabby's body was found in the Grand Teton Park there in Wyoming. And we know that, on September the 23rd, Brian was charged with the use of her credit card. Those are some of the facts that are faced. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now that we have found that the cause of death is strangulation, I think they are beginning to close in, meaning the FBI, on a suspect. As you know, Neil, Brian has been all along treated as a person of interest. I have a feeling that, sooner than later, those -- that will change.

They're going through this process because they're trying to get moderates and progressives to sign on to the same plan that then would be able to pass in the upper chamber in the Senate. But Pelosi really appeared then today to backtrack on that message that she was hearing that the preference was to do fewer programs well, and she said today that the timing would be the very first thing to go, so really sort of conflicting messages there.

And this is \"Your World\" on top of a mystery that has gripped the nation for the better part of a month right now and growing questions as to where, well, Brian Laundrie is. So much, we don't know. This much, we do, some closure for the family perhaps on the details of their daughter's tragic death, but so many questions besides. Let's go to Laura Ingle right now with the latest -- Laura."

As you mentioned, the cause of death now made public by the Teton County coroner in Wyoming, announcing his verdict of the cause and manner of death of Gabby Petito, saying she died by strangulation and explaining in his press conference today held on a Zoom how his team came to their conclusions."

      "speaker": "INGLE",
      "utterance": "Another key finding, that Petito had died three to four weeks before her remains were found September 19 near the border of the Grand Teton National Park in Jackson, Wyoming. This is in a rural stretch of wilderness in the Spread Creek campground area. And that's just 30 miles down the road from where she was last seen on August 27 at a restaurant arguing with her boyfriend, Brian Laundrie. Now, when asked about the condition of Petito's remains, if she was buried or above the ground, Dr. Blue couldn't specify, but was able to give some clarification as to why it took the coroner's office nearly one month to deliver their findings."

No word, Neil, from the FBI. We reached out on if these new developments might lead to additional charges against Laundrie. They have not said -- back to you."

    {
      "speaker": "TED WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, there's a lot that we know, Neil, here and there's a lot that we don't know. But I think we need to just step back for a second and try to go through the timeline here. We know that Gabby Petito and Brian Laundrie were last seen at a restaurant on the August 27th in Wyoming. On September 1, Laundrie, Brian, returns home to Florida from the Wyoming area without Gabby. Gabby and Brian lived in a home with Laundrie's mother and father. We know that, on September the 6th through the 8th, in De Soto Park there in Florida. Brian Laundrie and his family without Gabby went hiking in that and camping. We know that, on September the 11th, Gabby was reported missing by her family, the Petito family. We know that, on September the 13th, Laundrie, Brian, goes missing himself, last seen allegedly in the Carlton Reserve. They started and they searched that Carlton Reserve. We know that, on September the 19th, Gabby's body was found in the Grand Teton Park there in Wyoming. And we know that, on September the 23rd, Brian was charged with the use of her credit card. Those are some of the facts that are faced. Now that we have found that the cause of death is strangulation, I think they are beginning to close in, meaning the FBI, on a suspect. As you know, Neil, Brian has been all along treated as a person of interest. I have a feeling that, sooner than later, those -- that will change. And I do believe that there is enough, perhaps, maybe, from all indications, to charge Brian with the strangulation here of this young lady."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, I'm just doing the timeline with you, Ted, and I'm doing the math backwards. If her body was found around the 19th, and they said that body had been in the park for upwards of three to four weeks, so that would put roughly the time of her death that around August 19 to August 26, which follows some of the prior videos we have seen and incidents in which she and Brian Laundrie had been apparently fighting. How do you piece all of that timeline together?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, what you have here, unfortunately, at this stage is more of a circumstantial evidence case. But there have been many individuals convicted on circumstantial evidence. What you have to show also here is something that we as lawyers say, something called conscious of guilt. And that is the fact that Brian Laundrie returned home on September one without Gabby. And you got to believe, Neil, that if they lived in a House with Brian's mother and father, the first thing you say is, where is Gabby? And so it is just befuddling that, on September the 6th through the 8th, you're going to go camping with Brian without Gabby. All of these things are part of the puzzle. I would have to also believe that, at this stage, the FBI has some physical evidence, and they are trying to put that together. I can tell you what defense attorneys are going to do in this case, Neil. And that is, they're going to say, yes, they were out there in that Grand Teton Park. They had a fight. Brian then took off and came back across country. He doesn't know what happened to Gabby. I guarantee you, that's going to be the defense in this case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, Ted, the fact that they have not charged Laundrie with anything beyond stealing a debit card, and apparently Gabby's credit card, debit card, why would they hold off on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Mainly because they were collecting and they are still collecting evidence. When you look at the manner of death here or the cause of death being strangulation, I think they knew that right away, and the reason being is, right in this area of your body, you have something called a hyoid bone. When you are strangled, that bone is normally crushed. They would have found that out right away. But what they now have been doing is trying to backtrack and to find out where Brian has been all of this time. As you know, Brian is now missing. We don't know where he is. He could be alive. He could be dead, for all we know. But the FBI is clearly looking at him. He is a fugitive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Ted, thank you very much. By the way, Brian Laundrie has been missing for the better part of five- and-a-half weeks right now. We do know that Gabby Petito's father's says he wants Brian Laundrie found alive. Let's go to Mark Eiglarsh, the criminal defense attorney. Mark, obviously, the corner was very, very careful, limiting any further details beyond the fact that Gabby was strangled. Obviously, that was by design, but what do you think is going on behind the scenes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK EIGLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, first, he wanted to make sure that he didn't find himself a guest of the local jail by revealing anything more than the statute allows him to. By law, in Wyoming, the only thing he can reveal is the cause of death. Now, the reporters got some more out of him, like she wasn't pregnant right and some other details."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "But, for the most part, what we really wanted to know, things like, did he do it, well, I defer to the FBI. That's not what we decide. Was there any kind of bruising? Sorry, we can't talk about that. Did you see any physical evidence that would suggest it was with his hands vs. an object? Cannot tell you that. So, there's still a lot that they know. They're just not telling us, and with good reason."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, Mark, the fact that they have not upped the charges beyond just theft of a debit card, could there be any way to interpret that, in other words, either they don't have enough information, or they do, and they're just piecing it all together?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "OK, here's my very strong feeling, having been in the criminal arena for 30 years. They know we did it. We know he did it. He enjoys the presumption of innocence in a court of law, but, in the court of public opinion, there's no one else who likely did it. They're calling him a person of interest publicly. But we all know, even before today's announcement, he was a suspect. He's the number one, prime, only suspect. And that's really what he is. You can call them whatever you want. Maybe they haven't removed that label because it might be better for him to possibly get him in. You're merely a person of interest. We just want to talk to you. That might increase the chances of getting him in. Here's the other reason why they don't charge right now. As Ted Williams correctly indicated, they're absolutely reviewing and gathering further evidence. The minute you arrest him, assuming they could find him, his speedy trial clock starts to tick, meaning the amount of time they have to bring him to justice, as long as the defense doesn't delay the trial, begins. So why go ahead and arrest him for that right now unless you have to? They can arrest him, if they can find him, on the theft charges, and then they can bring charges right away."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "utterance": "You do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "Yes. No, I think that that's -- I do. I thought that from day one. I hope not. I would love to see a trial. I'd love to see justice done. But that was my gut feeling. Yes, I think that he knew that we would find out exactly what he did. And strangulation, he knew, he's smart enough to know that that would leave the type of clear physical evidence that we would then all know what he did. He wasn't going to sit around for that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What if there's a wild card element to this, Mark, where a third person's DNA or samples are discovered at the scene, complicating the case, and maybe yet an alternative reason why they have not upped charges at this point? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "I think that that is possible. That is 100 percent going to be the likely defense, assuming there ever is a trial: I left her. Yes, my DNA is all over her because I was with her. That doesn't prove anything. So, yes, there's some third person who must have come upon this pretty young gal, and then did things to her that you can't say that I did. All the defense needs is a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. And while all the evidence seems to suggest that he probably did it, that's not enough. It's proof beyond and to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "Yes. There is no other reason why you would stand that kind of public scrutiny, with people metaphorically with pitchforks outside your home. You're getting crucified in the court of public opinion. The only reason why you do that is because you're looking out for your boy, and you would rather take it to the court of public opinion than have him spend the rest of his days in a cage."

All right, we got a lot more coming out, including a fight on Capitol Hill right now. What else is new? But at least a push to at least put aside the debt ceiling argument for now. I just stress, for now -- after this."

It's really between Democrats and fellow Democrats, moderates and progressives, divided over just how much to slice off that $3.5 trillion so-called human infrastructure plan. Moderates want to hack it a lot, progresses barely much at all, and the president in the middle of that food fight. Jacqui Heinrich at the White House with more -- Jacqui."

      "speaker": "JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. Good afternoon to you. Well, Speaker Pelosi said in a dear letter -- or a dear colleague letter last night that she was hearing from her caucus, her broader caucus that they would really prefer as they whittled down this package to do fewer programs over the longest period of time, basically, fully fund fewer programs in order to make sure that they get through, rather than try to truncate those programs, how long they're funded, and try to do basically the whole enchilada, but over shorter periods of time. They're going through this process because they're trying to get moderates and progressives to sign on to the same plan that then would be able to pass in the upper chamber in the Senate. But Pelosi really appeared then today to backtrack on that message that she was hearing that the preference was to do fewer programs well, and she said today that the timing would be the very first thing to go, so really sort of conflicting messages there. I asked the White House whether they have given a push in either direction, whether the president prefers one avenue or the other. And she said the American people shouldn't be thinking about cuts really at all. Take a listen."

      "utterance": "The president wants to make fundamental change in our economy, and he feels coming out of the pandemic is exactly the time to do that. And if we don't do it now, if we don't address the cost of child care, to go back to Josh's question earlier, if we don't address the climate crisis, if we don't ensure that universal pre-K is a reality now, we're not going to have the same opportunity to do it for some time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICH",
      "utterance": "So, it's Psaki's answer just there that, if Democrats don't take big action now, they might not have another opportunity for quite some time. She later denied that that was sort of a cloudy forecast on Democrats' chances in the midterm. She said that she's speaking more to the moment that we're in, it was not a political statement. Meantime progressives are really digging in. They're saying that they don't want to cut anything, any programs from the social spending. They'd rather cut the timeline because they don't want to prioritize certain programs over others. But they also added that some of the programs will need to be funded for the whole 10 years, the climate program in particular, so really sort of setting the markers there, not giving a lot. And the White House says talks are continuing, including at the staff level, and including with the president, but, again, not a whole lot of progress over the last few days. And we are creeping right up on that deadline, Neil."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, you're right about that. Jacqui, thank you very much. Jacqui Heinrich on all of that. Now to Capitol Hill, where the House is going to take up that measure that the Senate approved last week to raise the debt ceiling, keep the government going for another couple of months, on a very strict diet here of about $480 billion, for a couple of months. Aishah Hasnie on all of that -- Aishah."

      "speaker": "AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey there, Neil, a couple of months, really just two months, when you think about it, and we're talking about nearly half-a-trillion dollars to keep the lights on for really now less than eight weeks. The House comes back tonight 5:00 to vote on that. But check this out, new information just coming into our newsroom here; 190 members, Neil, that is about 40 percent, more than 40 percent of the entire House, has active proxy letters to vote remotely. So you have got 100 of those that actually did that today, Democrats and Republicans who just didn't want to come back to the Hill to vote on this very important measure. But even if they do pass it, we are still not out of the woods just yet. And that is because Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, he struck a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to extend the nation's credit limit by $480 billion. It was a move to get Dems to put kind of $1 figure, a price tag on how far they were willing to stretch the debt. But McConnell has said, look, we're not going to do that again when this short-term fix expires in December. And Republicans are probably not going to have forgotten Schumer's scathing comments about them, as 11 Republicans were helping him pass the debt extension. Now, meanwhile, as Jacqui mentioned, Democrats need to get their house in order when it comes to the president's agenda. And we still don't have a top-line number for that social spending bill. Moderates, progressives are publicly battling this one out over what should stay, what should go. So we don't know what's in the plan. We don't know how much it's going to cost, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this morning telling reporters, you know what, it's the media's fault for Americans not understanding the president's multitrillion dollar bill.

Southwest says across the country, 90 cancellations and that's out of around 3, 300 flights, so a big improvement from the past few days, when hundreds of flights were canceled. The airline continues to blame bad weather, which then caused problems, leaving planes and crews out of their positions."

The airline says that is not the case. The FAA says that's not the case. And even the union that represents the pilot who is opposing the vaccine mandate in the courts says it's not the case. What seems to be the issue is staffing problems, inadequate staffing at Southwest and really a lot of the airlines, Neil.

And we really haven't seen a proactive statement from the company as to what they're going to do to address this issue moving forward, what proactive steps. As the union, we have been pushing them that we have identified -- and we have been pushing this argument for about four years -- that there are inefficiencies in their processes within the scheduling system, as well as is I.T. challenges as well.

Oddly enough, doing the forensics on this just -- and you're the first one to sort of hear this. But we also -- we realized today that the block hours had increased over 8 percent this weekend from the previous weekend. So, you were alluding to staffing issues. And that has to play into it as well. So, once..."

But it's absolutely a contributing factor is -- in the time it takes to recover."

But, internally, how they reroute pilots, how -- when a flight cancels, how they get the pilots to where they need to be, I might have a perfectly fine trip and they move me off a trip to cover something, and then they have to move another pilot in. We have -- and then a pilot has to cover that pilot. And it's a domino effect. We have a very complex network. It is not hub and spoke. It's point to point."

We will keep an eye on that for you. In the meantime, keeping an eye on inflation. Do you ever get that '70s feeling all over again? I'm not just talking bell-bottoms and leisure suits. I'm talking long gas lines and prices going nuts in grocery stores. It's happening again -- after this."

      "utterance": "I have experienced it firsthand, Neil, yes. Consumers right now being urged to be patient and flexible. But it doesn't take much, as we know, to trigger around a panic buying and hoarding, especially when you start to see empty store shelves. Costco and Walmart are already putting limits on sales of bath tissue, as new shipments failed to arrive, new items being added to that list. And take a look at these pictures from The Daily Mail, showing stores from Long Island, New York, to Southern California with near empty shelves at stores like Home Depot, CVS pharmacy, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy. The Biden administration is now scheduled to hold a roundtable meeting with private sector companies tomorrow, including Walmart, UPS and Home Depot, to discuss the broken supply chain and ways to try and fix it. Right now, it is taking roughly 80 days to transport goods across the Pacific. That is twice as long as normal. In the meantime, the logjam at U.S. ports continues to grow. There are now near record 146 cargo ships off the California coast, with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of merchandise essentially going nowhere. Now, retail giants are taking an expensive step, chartering their own cargo ships at around $140,000 a day, twice the normal cost of shipping, Walmart, Home Depot, Costco, Target some of those retailers using this pricey option, hoping to ensure key products such as electronics will arrive in time for the holiday season. But there's no guarantee. And experts say at least one to 25 percent of those stranded goods, Neil, are unlikely to make it in time for Black Friday, which we know is the kickoff for the holiday shopping season. Best advice -- and we have been saying it for a while -- start your Christmas shopping right now -- Neil."

Go to the whiteboard here. The CPI, the Consumer Price Index, in 2019 was rising at an average of 1.9 percent. In 2019, 2.3, dropped down to 1.4 in 2020. But, as of today, this -- thus far this year, it's 4.2 percent, so a significant jump up. And we're seeing it priced into a lot of things that we need, like gasoline, which is up pretty dramatically, but even things like eggs and milk are up, and with -- some of the same contours are there. We had a gas -- we had an energy crisis in the 1970s, but in a different kind of kind of a situation than we had today."

And then it quickly spreads beyond this, but in neither case was short- lived. And then so this idea that this is transitory, we will get over it, that, I think, we put the kibosh to here. Then the question becomes how long this drags on."

But we don't know. That's one of the scary things about inflation. Once you turn it on, we don't know exactly how to stop it without having damage elsewhere in the economy. And it's not easy to stop and certainly not easy to stop by pushing a button."

But in so goosing, if you buy that premise, you will also goose inflation. And I'm just wondering if they might regret what they're hoping for now."

We may be able to keep people together in a time of great difficulty, like we had last year. But I got to tell you, I think the reason that they are seeing their numbers drop on things like taxes and the economy and jobs is because people have a -- sort of a an innate understanding that you can't simply go out there and tax all the -- raise all these taxes, and spend all this money on an expansion of the welfare state, and not have bad impact on the economy. And that's why I think people are turning against the administration, not because they aren't -- they haven't raised taxes yet, but because they're talking about raising taxes, not because they haven't passed a gigantic expansion of the welfare state, but because they're talking about doing so. So -- and particularly independents. If you look at it, they're turning against the administration big time. And those are the people who are going to decide the 2022 midterm elections."

A.J. Kumaran is the CEO of Raising Cane's. If you're unfamiliar with their product, then, man, oh, man, you have missed life. Their chicken is to die for. They're very big in the South. They're all over the place. And right now, they're very, very popular, but the problem is, so popular, they have got limited staff, and now they're breaking out all the ranks, including the highest ranks, to help get the food out.

So, when times like these happen, we want all hands on deck, show the support for each other, show the camaraderie. Honestly, we have 750 people of our corporate staff jumping in and help. That is not going to fix the problem, but it's going to boost the morale. It's going to allow us to band together and fight against it. And it's working. We are -- we have put the word out there.
