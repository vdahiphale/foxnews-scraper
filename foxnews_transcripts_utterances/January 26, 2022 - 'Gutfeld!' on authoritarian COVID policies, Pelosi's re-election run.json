And still others are treating children like adults. And I'm not even talking about CNN producers. But first to the pandemic news that's affecting our nation's political elites. In Washington, D.C. our state capitol, Kat, strip clubs have allegedly been warned about their dancers not wearing masks. And a hard-hitting investigative report, the Daily Caller finds that multiple strip clubs have violated the mayor's order on masks. This includes apparently the strippers who are supposed to cover their noses and mouths, even if their butts aren't. Now this is a personal point. I would not mind the rule in the daytime, you know, when the clubs aren't exactly fielding the first string.",

So while the government looks benign, it's your neighbors who became the enforcers. What better way to unify a nation's people than force them into the roles of cops and robbers. You couldn't divide people any more efficiently with a table saw? And I've tried. But you know what? A lot of people liked it. People became OK with incremental authoritarianism, like the frog in that slow boiling water and experiment I'm sure Fauci invented the sick bastard. They enjoy the moments without knowing how it all will end. Like giving Jessie Watters his own show. It gave obnoxious people power. See, authoritarianism doesn't just show up one day screaming hey, everyone, I'm an authoritarian. It comes gradually step by step, like an undetected malignant tumor. It just grows.

The world is not your house that you can make childproof. And you can't leave it to bozos who see risk only being acceptable at zero, that destroyed society. You'd have to lock yourself in the basement to survive. And like I said to Joe DeVito's robot girlfriend, that's no life. But it's hard to explain this to people in love with their own authority. You can't wrestle fear away from them. Like a vaping pen to Kat, it's too important to them. The people in charge right now aren't risk managers, they're ass protectors trying to keep themselves from being fired, sued, or even arrested. And they deserve little respect given they never clearly gave us the whole story. Think about it. They've been applying the same risk profile from one person to the next, without any clarity. A 10-year-old skateboarder somehow has the same risk profile as a 65-year-old obese smoker. So they both must mask up and outside. It's like hiring a tax accountant for your six-year-old who ran a lemonade stand. You know, because it's April and you just never know. Fact is the government isn't crazy about telling you about your lower risk profile because then you won't adhere to their uniform rules. So the government needs to have a uniform risk which is a uniform lie that creates a uniform panic. It's why they never talked about obesity and other metrics of bad health. They preferred you scared, screw them. Remember, it wasn't you or me who made the virus and let it out. It was them. If it were you you'd be receiving your dinner through a slot in your cell door for the rest of your damn life. But the people who thought it was fine to increase lethality and contagiousness of coronavirus in Wuhan are now lecturing us about risk. It's nuts. Let's hear it from Brett.",

Vietnam, Afghanistan, the drug war, sex in the City. The only way to stop that madness is if you do the stopping. Public sentiment ended those wars. And it's time to do the same thing now, because it's not me who decides when this ends, it's you. You understand risk, you follow the science as we close in on February 1st, it's time for some good- old fashioned group civil disobedience. Don't wear the mask. Hell burn the damn thing. That worked with bras and draft cards in the 1960s. And also the house I burned down because the voices told me to.

And still others are treating children like adults. And I'm not even talking about CNN producers. But first to the pandemic news that's affecting our nation's political elites. In Washington, D.C. our state capitol, Kat, strip clubs have allegedly been warned about their dancers not wearing masks. And a hard-hitting investigative report, the Daily Caller finds that multiple strip clubs have violated the mayor's order on masks. This includes apparently the strippers who are supposed to cover their noses and mouths, even if their butts aren't. Now this is a personal point. I would not mind the rule in the daytime, you know, when the clubs aren't exactly fielding the first string."

The government made the regulations which put it on waitresses and hostesses and mattress salesman to force you to comply. And then it was up to the cops to arrest you if you didn't. So while the government looks benign, it's your neighbors who became the enforcers. What better way to unify a nation's people than force them into the roles of cops and robbers. You couldn't divide people any more efficiently with a table saw? And I've tried. But you know what? A lot of people liked it. People became OK with incremental authoritarianism, like the frog in that slow boiling water and experiment I'm sure Fauci invented the sick bastard. They enjoy the moments without knowing how it all will end. Like giving Jessie Watters his own show. It gave obnoxious people power. See, authoritarianism doesn't just show up one day screaming hey, everyone, I'm an authoritarian. It comes gradually step by step, like an undetected malignant tumor. It just grows. And who knew that entertainers and journalists usually considered skeptics of power, would happily embrace becoming the man?"

The world is not your house that you can make childproof. And you can't leave it to bozos who see risk only being acceptable at zero, that destroyed society. You'd have to lock yourself in the basement to survive. And like I said to Joe DeVito's robot girlfriend, that's no life. But it's hard to explain this to people in love with their own authority. You can't wrestle fear away from them. Like a vaping pen to Kat, it's too important to them. The people in charge right now aren't risk managers, they're ass protectors trying to keep themselves from being fired, sued, or even arrested. And they deserve little respect given they never clearly gave us the whole story. Think about it. They've been applying the same risk profile from one person to the next, without any clarity. A 10-year-old skateboarder somehow has the same risk profile as a 65-year-old obese smoker. So they both must mask up and outside. It's like hiring a tax accountant for your six-year-old who ran a lemonade stand. You know, because it's April and you just never know. Fact is the government isn't crazy about telling you about your lower risk profile because then you won't adhere to their uniform rules. So the government needs to have a uniform risk which is a uniform lie that creates a uniform panic. It's why they never talked about obesity and other metrics of bad health. They preferred you scared, screw them. Remember, it wasn't you or me who made the virus and let it out. It was them. If it were you you'd be receiving your dinner through a slot in your cell door for the rest of your damn life. But the people who thought it was fine to increase lethality and contagiousness of coronavirus in Wuhan are now lecturing us about risk. It's nuts. Let's hear it from Brett."

Vietnam, Afghanistan, the drug war, sex in the City. The only way to stop that madness is if you do the stopping. Public sentiment ended those wars. And it's time to do the same thing now, because it's not me who decides when this ends, it's you. You understand risk, you follow the science as we close in on February 1st, it's time for some good- old fashioned group civil disobedience. Don't wear the mask. Hell burn the damn thing. That worked with bras and draft cards in the 1960s. And also the house I burned down because the voices told me to.

Apparently, Jennie Nguyen seen here, shared what the network called offensive posts back in 2020. Some of the memes bashed BLM and the 2020 riots, other posts if you can believe it were pro-police and anti-looting.

Biden White House reportedly let this retirement announcement leak and according to our very own Chief Justice Correspondent, the evil Shannon Bream, Breyer was reportedly ticked off or surprised by the news coming out today. Meanwhile, here are some potential replacements. Earlier today, Jen Psaki announced that Biden remains committed to nominating a black woman to the bench, which means unless I identify as one which I may I'm out. Joe, you have a theory.

And as you pointed out, the security guard, why bother that just risks his own life, it all makes sense. And then when all of these clothes, all of the employees, the elderly that depend on it for their medicine, for their vaccinations, for their food -- the 15 that closed in San Francisco, a family that lived near it, watch the elderly get off the bus to it, they said this Walgreens fed my family.
