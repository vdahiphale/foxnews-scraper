And what that means practically is that there will be military. There will be soldiers on the streets of the UK tomorrow. And what they're saying is they're not sure if the attacker acted alone or if he was part of a bigger network. And that's what the concern is now. It all began last night at 10:30 at the arena, which I'm standing in front of at the moment. When this suicide attacker waited for the concert to end, waited for the young people to leave before blowing himself up surrounded by them. And it wasn't just the nails, the bolts and the shrapnel that killed him, it was the crash that wounded so many of them afterwards. The youngest victim was just eight years old. Her name was Saffie Rose Roussos. Her mother and her sister are both in hospital. And we know at first they thought she might have been missing but she was indeed we now know dead. Eight years old, the bomber has also now been named as Salman Abedi. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That is no picture of him yet but we know he was 22-years-old, of Libyan descent, he was born in Manchester but he was the son of refugees. Now, forensic teams today searched properties around the city, they carried out, controlled explosion and they also arrested a 23-year-old man. Still unclear about what connection he has of this. But we do know that Abedi had come back from Libya just recently. And that's going to be a connection people will look out very closely. ISIS have of course now claimed responsibility for this. There's some confusion on this, social media pages. Some of them say that he was inspired by ISIS, others say he was directed by them. And that is a very clear distinction. What is also clear is that this bomb was far more powerful, far more planned as others have been before. And that is very worrying. The U.K. government now very concerned that another attack might be imminent because to all of these pointers. So, you know, a horrible tragedy here. Twenty two dead. Twelve of them under the age of 16 and the U.K. gearing up for another possible attack. And tomorrow, we will see 5,000 soldiers in the streets of the U.K. -- Dana.",

So, instead let's ponder the barriers to combating terror. Consider Islamaphobia: An accusation meant to smear those who dare to mention the cause of terror. Media and academia uses it as a way of not judging evil. It's an offshoot of something called relativism which deems us in capable of judging evil because America is just as bad -- we have a bad past, even though we aren't bad now. The goal: To remove our moral authority to act. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, when there is an attack, you see the timid masses say: if only we were less bigoted, this wouldn't happen. And then the young people tweet: #peace, love conquers. But it doesn't. It's as if the hyper-tolerant are pleading to the terrorists: I'm not the one you want, it's those guys. But the theme will always kill you too. Relativism and its cowardly false tolerance create dead ducks. It says fold instead of fight. Don't listen. We must reclaim our moral authority. And we need to instruct others to do the same. Enough vigils, we need vigilance and a willingness to act. That requires training of both body and mind. What prevented terror on that train in Paris in 2015? It was three men trained in body and mind. You become a hard target and others might follow. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Last, let's once and for all dump this false war between freedom and security.

And what that means practically is that there will be military. There will be soldiers on the streets of the UK tomorrow. And what they're saying is they're not sure if the attacker acted alone or if he was part of a bigger network. And that's what the concern is now. It all began last night at 10:30 at the arena, which I'm standing in front of at the moment. When this suicide attacker waited for the concert to end, waited for the young people to leave before blowing himself up surrounded by them. And it wasn't just the nails, the bolts and the shrapnel that killed him, it was the crash that wounded so many of them afterwards. The youngest victim was just eight years old. Her name was Saffie Rose Roussos. Her mother and her sister are both in hospital. And we know at first they thought she might have been missing but she was indeed we now know dead. Eight years old, the bomber has also now been named as Salman Abedi. That is no picture of him yet but we know he was 22-years-old, of Libyan descent, he was born in Manchester but he was the son of refugees. Now, forensic teams today searched properties around the city, they carried out, controlled explosion and they also arrested a 23-year-old man. Still unclear about what connection he has of this. But we do know that Abedi had come back from Libya just recently. And that's going to be a connection people will look out very closely. ISIS have of course now claimed responsibility for this. There's some confusion on this, social media pages. Some of them say that he was inspired by ISIS, others say he was directed by them. And that is a very clear distinction. What is also clear is that this bomb was far more powerful, far more planned as others have been before. And that is very worrying. The U.K. government now very concerned that another attack might be imminent because to all of these pointers. So, you know, a horrible tragedy here. Twenty two dead. Twelve of them under the age of 16 and the U.K. gearing up for another possible attack. And tomorrow, we will see 5,000 soldiers in the streets of the U.K. -- Dana."

Because they thought, okay, we have other people that we considered to be worse actors in the area or in the region and somehow they did this and organize in terms of what their threat level assessment was, how they would prioritize it because it's a matter of resources. That's troubling because when you hear that and especially if you are parents who lost a child here or child who lost a parent, and you find out they had this person, they knew who he was and yet they didn't focus and prioritize."

And now they're going to go through all his, you know, personal accounts, et cetera, to see how he was radicalized, who he was in communication with, to kind of like fan it out in terms of the terror web of connections and who might be someone who is in direct communication with him.

When they target children, they might not expect the response. It might be even more fierce than it has been in the past with Theresa May and Donald Trump and others like McMaster saying, we have got to take the fight more to the enemy and some more specific way."

So, when we talk about soft targets, it just has the impact, you know, on me, of you know, making me more fearful for what will happen. You go to the ball game or you go to the theater. We know about what has happened in movie theaters in this country. But I mean, you think about the concerts -- the recent concert, there is one in obviously France not so long ago.

Maybe they need to do something about the laws over there. Maybe more surveillance. Maybe get some more spies or some more undercover agents in these areas. Because whatever they're doing now isn't working, there's been a lot of bloodshed in Europe over the last couple of years. I haven't seen a big speech. I haven't seen a new coalition. I haven't seen a big military push anywhere. You know, I remember after 9/11, you know, Bush went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, he set a black sites, he water boarded people. Enhanced surveillance.

So, it's not just we are relying on the police or the authorities who know this person as a suspect. We all have to become part of a civil defense. It is our responsibility and we are all handcuffed by the fear of being called a bigot. So, if you are on a bus and you think something weird is going on, you go through this mind, this equation like if I say and do something and I am wrong, I am a bigot. And so, everybody instead, they do their little hashtag and they say, you know, in classrooms right now, we devote so much time to the gospel of diversity but we have not taught anybody about how to deal with a death cult. And it seems to me that it would be far more valuable use of time, if you sat young people down and you told them about this virus. Because it is a virus. We hear the same story about this type of guy over and over again. He is young, he is involved in this toxic doctrine, he seems unassuming. And then it just happens. It's like he is totally healthy until he has rabies, a mental rabies, and kills. So, we have to go to the source. You have to go to young people. And you have to declare this as a public health concern. That this is something that infects everybody. And then you have to look at security as an industry that one should major in in college. It should be like electrical engineering. Where, you can have electrical engineering without security. The security should be as big as any kind of industry. Whether it's entertainment or academia or media. Security should be something that you want to get into and that you want to be trained and then create. It should be a trillion dollar industry of people who want to fight probably the biggest fight of their lives. We devote too much avoiding this fact. We are dealing with a religion which may be perverted to believe that you either join us or you die."

I mean, people said this because you have children there, you have parents coming to pick them up, it's just so horrifying. It just defies any sense of humanity. And the fact of the matter is, when they put it in that small area versus a large arena, it gives more power to the blast because of the concussive impact of the bombs. Which makes it even deadlier. And in terms of the level of sophistication of those bombs, it shows that this guy wasn't acting alone. He didn't make that, you know, at home on the internet. It was far more sophisticated. So, that is the question. So, how did this come to be? Who gave him that? This is somebody who traveled. Like all the warning signs and bells were there. So, how do you not miss this again?

The goal: To remove our moral authority to act."

It's as if the hyper-tolerant are pleading to the terrorists: I'm not the one you want, it's those guys. But the theme will always kill you too. Relativism and its cowardly false tolerance create dead ducks. It says fold instead of fight. Don't listen. We must reclaim our moral authority. And we need to instruct others to do the same. Enough vigils, we need vigilance and a willingness to act. That requires training of both body and mind. What prevented terror on that train in Paris in 2015? It was three men trained in body and mind. You become a hard target and others might follow. Last, let's once and for all dump this false war between freedom and security. Security preserves freedom, which is why as I speak right now, well-trained law enforcement surround this building. Why should I have that luxury and not you? So, Dana, that false conflict, security, sacrifices freedom -- it drives me crazy because it's not true. It never has been true.

This is a totally different situation and everybody here say, oh, yes, we just need tough language. Well, President Trump was over there in Saudi Arabia, the source of the 9/11 bomb. I didn't hear him talking about radical Islamic Jihad like the right was pushing on President Obama. Instead, realizing the circumstance today, he's talking about these folks as juvenile losers on the like. I think that's redefining our concept of what is taking place. Because we got to remember, I mean, to me, we have to go back, President Bush invaded in response to 9/11. President Obama comes and he says, you know what? We want to make it clear we are pulling troops back. We are going to deal with this differently. We will going to talk about the ideology.

So, the amount of resources that we spend trying to track down one person, we are a little bit outmanned. So, what Greg was just talking about beforehand is we have to change our thinking and our approach in a way to utilize all of those people that are willing to dedicate their lives, the law enforcement and intelligence. Also, we have to use either technology or figure out some way to include community policing and more intelligence.

We are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs, but by the number of people we help get off of those programs.

They are talking about the -- look at the positives here. Job training, apprenticeships, reforms that encourage work. If you are getting any handouts, encouraging work. You're breaking the grip of dependency. The reforms of the food stamp program. What this is doing is it's actually raising the question about the war on poverty programs and the effects that they've had. Since the war on poverty, you see racial gaps, income level test scores, unemployment, illegitimacy rates. What if this war on poverty programs actually didn't exist? Billions of people might be independent, successful individuals instead of dependent."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

There are a lot of assumptions here, but I think they also have to be prepared. Have facts about how these programs are not working and be ready because the Democrats will be able to roll out all sorts of anecdotes and you have to be ready to fight. Also, most people on Capitol Hill blew this off because this is not actually going to become a law. There will be a lot of back and forth. Republicans have to decide. Is this the hill you want to die on? Probably not. WILLIAMS: No, in fact, John Quinn (ph), number two in the senate says, this is a nonstarter."

We want to respect taxpayers, not the tax recipients. And then he had a great line when they asked him why you're slashing the budget of the EPA, he goes, the EPA had a climate change musical."

But, nevertheless, tax reform should be the banner here. That should be the headline. That's what the voters want in terms of the mandate that President Trump was elected on. So, I don't think we are going to see any of these cuts really materialize. I think they got to focus on this. If he doesn't get tax reform done, big trouble for 2018."
