But, Washington being a tough political place though it is, the White House is saying, well, no big deal, it just means that we don't have to run anybody against Jeff Flake in the primary next year because the president had been supporting Kelly Ward who's running against him, and this really is a major win for the Bannon wing of the Republican Party. Steve Bannon, you remember after he left the White House, was vowing that he was going to launch primary challenges against every establishment Republican out there who he believed was not supporting President Trump's agenda.

But here's what they're doing, and really, I have to give them credit. You know, Trump and his allies, including Fox News, are really experts at distraction and diversion, so the closer the investigation about real Russian ties between Trump associates and real Russians, as we heard Jeff Sessions finally admit to in his testimony the other day, the more they want to just throw mud on the wall, and I'm their favorite target, me and, you know, President Obama, where the ones that they always like to put into the crosshairs."

I mean, are we going to have a new commercial like, now has never been a better time to buy uranium? What's in your nuke? It makes no sense to me that that's not the big question. The next question is will the networks cover this investigation with the sweaty exuberance that they covered with the collusion because this really is a biased exposure flashlight, it will expose to your team sport, like if you like Hillary you won't do this, and if you hate Trump, you'll do that.

And as the evidence continues to develop and proliferate, there will be more questions for her to answer in terms of what she knew when and what kind of collusion that was. So this actually already seems to have a lot more like meat to it than anything you had to do with Trump and with Russian collusion. So fair play, we want to look into this and about dealings with Russia. This is an appropriate investigation. Especially like Dana said that it passed through CFIUS."

That's why you have these committee oversight hearings so that we can actually get to the bottom of it and drill down to say, wait a second, who knew what? Was Hillary directly involved? Was a surrogate from her in a meaningful capacity in a relationship aware of this and tried to put it forward? Was this something that the Obama administration let go through?

That really was an extraordinary moment that you play just there, and never in all the time that I've covered the White House or American politics have I ever seen a Republican rise in the senate to denounce their own presidents in the way that Senator Jeff Flake did. I mean, we had these feuds that were kind of, you know, existing on the periphery such as the Bob Corker feud, which we'll get into in just a couple of minutes. But for Flake to stand up there in such an emotional way denounce President Trump really was something that I have never seen before. I mean, saying that his behavior was reckless, outrageous, and undignified, really making a point there that he believes that the president is taking the country down the wrong direction. But, Washington being a tough political place though it is, the White House is saying, well, no big deal, it just means that we don't have to run anybody against Jeff Flake in the primary next year because the president had been supporting Kelly Ward who's running against him, and this really is a major win for the Bannon wing of the Republican Party. Steve Bannon, you remember after he left the White House, was vowing that he was going to launch primary challenges against every establishment Republican out there who he believed was not supporting President Trump's agenda. Let's listen to what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said earlier today in the Brady briefing room about Flake announcing his resignation. Listen here."

The last time it was reignited it was President Trump, this morning it was Senator Corker when he was on NBC television on the morning program talking about how he didn't appreciate the fact that President Trump was weighing in on the senate process to write the tax reform legislation when he tweeted out yesterday that 401(k) contributions were off limits in terms of trying to pay for tax reform. Well, that just ignited a back-and-forth that went on for the better part of the day. I asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the briefing why the president would engage in something like that when he's got a legislative issue as big as tax reform on the table, in the senate, and he's trying to develop momentum for that and this only seems to be a distraction. Listen here."

Like, if you don't act now you're going to be answering to future generations. So basically what he's saying is that if you don't do what he's doing, you're complicit. You're guilty. You're guilty if you support Trump -- unlike him, which by the way, I believe what he did was a predetermined decision that was disconnected to the statement that he made. He was going whether Trump was there or not, and the reason is it's not about Trump, it's about the voters. If his principles are strong, and they're very strong, according to him, you should run unless you feel that you're out of step with the electorate. I think he feels that he's out of step with the electorate because if he believes, and this is the bottom line here, if he believes that there is a serious threat to the democracy, which he said, that it is his obligation to stay and fight and not cut and run. So that's why this doesn't make sense to me, and for him to then say we have children, I hate the what about the children thing because that is -- basically he's saying, we're bad people because we're not agreeing with him. Screw you. Sorry. And I like him. Imagine if I didn't."

      "utterance": "Well, I agree. I think using people's children is not good for any of this and not just in politics. The thing that's interesting is he voted with President Trump 92 percent of the time. One of the things about him from his political standpoint is he's actually probably to the right of where President Trump is, and that has been a bit of a problem. But for him, he's coming out like its tone and tenor, OK? And his character and I'm bothered by it. And so, look, I think it's good if he decides he's going to leave, he might have lost anyway, OK? He's been unpopular since about 2013 with the voters and if he thought that he just can't do it anymore. Was interesting to me is that he's deciding to stay through the end of his term, and so is Senator Corker, so both of these guys are going to be around. And so, President Trump, actually, is going to rely on them, hopefully, for their votes because he's going to need them. I think the problem too is something that -- for all of us -- a quote from the Bush feed last week where he's talked about, we judge others by their worst offenses, but ourselves by our best intentions. It's just sort of a reminder that everybody needs to have a little humility here that perhaps the party is evolving in a way that some people are not going to be brought along."

We've done this in Afghanistan. And you will have elite forces like this set up a meeting with some of the local elders or tribal leaders to try to discuss this. So this was a group that had been known to be somewhat sympathetic to ISIS, but they're trying to make inroads and push in, right? So that's not just using military force but also, in a way, trying to do diplomacy and sit down. They're specially trained to do this. What happened is they go in to do this and right now, the mounting intelligence supports they were set up for an ambush. They tried to delay them when they were having this meeting so that when they left on a little bit of a delay of a tick-tock from when they were supposed to depart, they got hit."

Juan says he's not politically correct, but he wouldn't actually say the name \"Redskins.\" There is Carson Wentz escaping from the pocket. Everybody thought he was sacked. Went in there for a first down, had a great game. Also, Wentz is doing something very special. He became friends with a young boy about ten years old. The guy had stomach cancer. His name is Lucas Custer. He's wearing a bracelet in honor of Lucas. Lucas recently passed away. And played a heck of a game last night in honor of Lucas, so hats off to Wentz and the Custers family."
