Our objective is to create manufacturing jobs by reopening a former Maytag plant to produce safer drier products for American consumers.

I'm more so behind him because he is the person that has helped drive our economy up and he's driven employment - unemployment down. And I think that when unemployment goes down in the African-American community, as is proof that has happened. That poverty also, which is obviously related to if you have a job or don't have a job, if you have a job then you're not prone to commit crimes.

They are four people and that's how many votes they got. Ouch! Well, AOC punched back on Twitter basically saying that, Pelosi does not understand the power of social media. Kind of sounds like Donald Trump there. Now, while it's tempting to take Pelosi's side against the AOC allergens, she's no one to blame but herself. Now why do I say this? Because Pelosi fertilized the soil from which AOC and her socialist clique sprung. She enabled them and she's still doing it.

I think it's time for an “Ingraham Angle” fact check. now from The Wall Street Journal here it is nearly 1 million more blacks and 2 million more Hispanics are employed than when Barack Obama left office. And minorities account for more than half of all new jobs created during the Trump presidency. Unemployment among black women has hovered near 5 percent for the last six months, the lowest since 1972. That's just simply awesome. So how do Democrats argue against that?

Now right now I see 2020 as a choice between the politics of relentless racial division versus Trump's refreshing economic vision. A vision that has created more opportunities for minorities in America than Obama and Bush before him, and that's THE ANGLE. All right joining me now with reaction Horace Cooper, Co-Chair of Project 21 and Richard Goodstein, former Clinton adviser. All right Richard, Democrats claim to be the party of facts and science yet they're in denial mode when it comes to this economy. What do you say about the minority jobs numbers which are stunning and its great news for people who've been out of work.

Our objective is to create manufacturing jobs by reopening a former Maytag plant to produce safer drier products for American consumers. And I feel that Trump's policies, I feel that he is a very strong and successful businessman. I'm more so behind him because he is the person that has helped drive our economy up and he's driven employment - unemployment down. And I think that when unemployment goes down in the African-American community, as is proof that has happened. That poverty also, which is obviously related to if you have a job or don't have a job, if you have a job then you're not prone to commit crimes.

Instead of trying to get to the bottom of unfounded accusations against the now sitting Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, well despite Kavanaugh's eventual confirmation Democrats and the media laid waste to the process. And we were promised investigations into the bad actors and the leaks. Remember Julie Swetnick - remember that name Michael Avenatti? Well, what happened to those probes? Well joining me now two people who know the real story, based on real interviews, real reporting with President Trump and more than a hundred others. Carrie Severino is Chief Counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network and Mollie Hemingway, Fox News Contributor, their new book #1 on Amazon two day, first day it's out. \"Justice on Trial\" and we're delighted both of them - congrats to both of you. I know you worked hard on this book. So Mollie let's start with you. We got a leaked a letter from it looks like - Dianne Feinstein's office.

CARRIE SEVERINO, CO-AUTHOR, \"JUSTICE ON TRIAL\": well I think I think the repercussions have to be coming, hopefully, from the American people. And we talked a little bit in the book how we saw some of that in 2018 where you saw people who were really damaged. You saw the moderate Democrats who voted against Kavanaugh and then lost. You saw Republicans who were really helped by this and in the polls because people were so outraged at what they saw, which was a total miscarriage of justice. Like we say it's not just Brett Kavanaugh it was on trial, it was justice on trial. Because they were saying things that were at odds with a due process, with presumptions and since these basic fundamental tenants of our of our society."

You see time and again here's someone who says, \"I don't want this to be public\". But the first person she called to talk about it, it's The Washington Post tip line.

He - of course he was recommended by Justice Kennedy. Kennedy was the swing vote on the Court. Could you - could they have fought for the wrong Justice? Could this turn out to be another Republican slap in the face, Souter, Kennedy, I wouldn't say Souter, but more like Justice Kennedy, not a reliable judiciary conservative.

Apparently, nobody has even been interviewed. While everyone else was filming, though, and they had the cell phone cameras out and watching, trying to stop a grown man from punching women, that would have been nice. One brave bystander, Jason Blair, did step in. He joins me now. Jason, it's great to have you on tonight. Thanks so much for joining us. What made you stop in?

One person gets smacked and the other person throws -- and the poor woman falls from a wheelchair, and the child is crying. Then he pulls another women's hair -- I am watching this going, it's almost like it's fake. But it was scarily real. And yet security seemed really slow and scant at Disney, which is shocking to me.

And I didn't see it until a couple days afterwards when I saw it in its entirety. But the guy was extremely violent. And he was enraged. But he was only attacking the women.

But we should be helping our fellow man, not hindering them and filming them and being on a cell phone. To me, that was baffling. We stepped in. Granted, we didn't get into the fight. I never saw the two gentlemen fight. We were still in the back of visiting Disneyland. We were doing our thing as a family. And when we approached the situation, as soon as he laid hands on a woman, I knew that was wrong, and it's time to step in and at least separate it and defuse the situation as best I could."

But what needs to happen is people have to be much more in touch with what it is that they are trying to do to help those that are in pain. There's an inability for us to restrain our needs and our impulses. And it could come from the way we were raised. It could come from the things we see on TV. It could come from the things that we feel after we have been to a very difficult day. But it's very important for us to recognize that there is a significant difference between a fact and a feeling.

Horowitz and his team now know, quote, \"by January, 2017, FBI agents had tracked down and interviewed one of Mr. Steele's main sources for the dossier, a Russian speaker from a former Soviet Republic. After questioning him, FBI officials came to suspect that the man might have added his own interpretations to reports from his own sources that he passed on to Steele, calling into question the reliability of the information.\" Despite all this, the FBI still renewed two more FISA warrants on Carter Page after they knew, or should have known, this was all baloney. Here now is Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent counsel and a FOX News contributor, of course. Sol, how big a deal is as a revelation?

But the biggest problem, as we pointed out before, is that there was no corroboration of Steele's information. It's not enough to corroborate Steele. You have to corroborate the actual facts that you are talking about. You have to say, this is the person who reported it, he has been reliable in the past.

That is wrong. Whether or not it violates the Crime Victim Rights Act, which a judge in Florida ruled that it did. That's open to debate. But it was wrong. It shouldn't have been done. Those victims should have been told and had their input listened to as to whether or not this guy would not have any federal charge at all.

There's always been a populist strain in American politics, and what Ross Perot identified in 1992 was that antiestablishment strain that didn't want to choose George Bush or Bill Clinton. And the myth going around for years from the Bush camp that lost is that Ross Perot cost him reelection, which is not true. An old friend of mine, Arthur Finkelstein, who passed away last year, a Republican pollster, did an analysis of the Perot vote after the 92 election, and he told me that they came proportionally from Bush and Clinton. So Clinton still would have won. Bush lost the election because he gave up the ghost on the Reagan revolution. He would have won if he hadn't broken out his pledge on taxes."

And then Bush raise taxes and broke the deal."

      "utterance": "Some things never change. But Richard Nixon mentioned that in the 68 campaign. That came up in the 70s with Reagan is that some issues just never change. And the fact is there is that strain in American politics, there is a dialectic to American presidential politics which is always a political upheaval starting in 1800 with Jefferson."
