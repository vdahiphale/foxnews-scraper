So, what about the never Trumpers who only pay lip service to the will of the voters. Well, we're starting to get an idea of what they really think.

This year has been filled with a lot of political revelations. The people you thought you knew on the left and right are coming into clear focus for many people. As for President Trump's tweets, something they can be a little bit self- distracting. That's true. I say this, at least we now have an unvarnished view what the leader of the free world really thinks about issues big and small. I think that's kind of refreshing. How many Twitter accounts can drive a new cycle all by their lonesome. He has a direct pipeline to the American people, which, of course, drives the old lame extreme media nuts. They want to control the information you're getting. President Trump said, I'm going to have my say and go right to the people with it. Joining us now for reaction from Mobile, Alabama, my old friend, Quin Hillyer, a contributing editor at \"National Review,\" and in New York, a dear friend, Andy Stein, a Democrat and former president of the New York City Council.

And for better and sometimes for worse, let's face it, talking politics at the Thanksgiving table is practically as much of a tradition as the turkey and the pumpkin pie and mashed potatoes and gravy. But it's giving many us some serious heartburn because according to a new poll from NPR and Marist, 58 percent of Americans say they are positively dreading the prospect discussing politics during Thanksgiving. That's up five points from last year during the aftermath of the election. And 31 percent say they're eager to do so tomorrow, but that's a 12 point plunge from last year. Joining us now to analyze, two of my favorite people, not just favorite colleagues, favorite people here at Fox, Shannon Bream, of course the anchor of the brand new 11:00 p.m. show on Fox, and Bret Baier who is wisely already in the balmy weather of Naples, Florida.

How do you avoid this maelstrom at the table? What do you do? BRET BAIER, \"SPECIAL REPORT\" HOST: I think it's a good question because I think you have to be prepared at the beginning. You have to go in and say, you have other topics to talk about -- entertainment, sports, the kids, other things. I say stay away from LaVar Ball, the wall, Roy Moore at all.

      "sentences": "Tonight some thoughts on this eve of Thanksgiving. It's supposed to be a holiday dedicated to our families, our friends, and the ties that bind. It's a holiday where gratitude should above all else be placed front and center. But the reality is that in recent years it's become something far different. A holiday that's been tarnished by never ending sales on flat screen TVs, appliances, all manner of jewelry, forcing folks to spend time waiting in line, sometimes for days, instead of cherishing the time they have with their family. Polling shows that the majority of Americans say they're going to shop online this holiday season with internet sales poised to surpass $100 billion for the first time ever. Sure, that's good for the economy, no doubt. But shouldn't we just dedicate one day, one day to family and giving thanks without having to buy anything? Just take a look at how early these sales start this week. Kohl's, they kicked off turkey discounts on Monday. Old Navy knocking 50 percent all items beginning today. And by the time Thanksgiving morning rolls around, virtually every major retailer will be back offering black Friday deals that will bring folks to the store or their computers before they even have time to prep their meal, let alone clean it up. And that leads me to my next point. Why are stores even open on Thanksgiving at all? I know retailers, they need to sell and they make all their money this time of year. It's the biggest season of the year for them. But is it worth the breaking up of families on the one day that some of them spend time together, that one day a year? It's bad enough that consumers are dragged away from their families, but what about the employees that are forced to staff the store? Just look at this partial list of stores open tomorrow. K-mart is one of first to open, cracking doors at 6:00 a.m. Dollar General, Bass Pro Shops, I love Bass Pro Shops, I love Cabela's, but they're not far behind. And by end of the day they'll be joined by J.C. Penney, Old Navy, Wal-Mart, Target among many others. I worry that in our haste to buy for everyone on our list it's going to cause our relationships to fray with the people we love most. And some things are worth more than the 100 bucks you might save on that wide screen. And in most cases those door buster sales are come-ons to get you buy some other junk you don't need anyway. How many times have you stood in line for $200 iPad on black Friday only to learn that the sale only applied to the first five sold, and it turns out you're the 38th person in line? Read the fine print before you give up the stuff that really matters, the stuff that you're never going to get back and will never go on sale. That's time with friends and family. And part of what drives us into the cold that makes us want to join those black Friday blowouts and the Friday mobs is the thought that we might miss out on a great opportunity. My goodness, we've got to get there, we've got to drive there, we've got to park there. But on Thanksgiving, the biggest opportunity in the world is back home, and it's around the table. So savor this Thanksgiving. Try to celebrate it without wrestling your neighbors over a sale. A few things I'm thankful for when we return.",

Their extraordinary sacrifice, the risks they take to defend this country is something we all should be grateful for every day, not just tomorrow, because without it, we are not sitting around the table enjoying turkey in freedom and security.

The stock market is booming all because America first policies do work. Not the problem all the experts were predicting. Latest side of a booming economy, human resources officers from some 500 corporations are anticipating a massive 66 percent increase in cash Christmas bonuses. That adds to up a big surge in gifts and parties and frankly, happiness for American workers. You know, it's supposed to be the pursuit of happiness, that will be nice. Even the president's lefty critics are coming around to the new realities, our neighbors to the north at the Toronto Star, at least one prominent columnist, is noting this about the president's negotiations on trade in a piece titled \"Believe it or not, on NAFTA, Donald Trump makes sense\". And in The Economist this blaring headline, \"Blue collar wages are surging.\" Again, they don't want to give Trump credit, but I'll take the headlines. So, what about the never Trumpers who only pay lip service to the will of the voters. Well, we're starting to get an idea of what they really think. Here's what \"Weekly Standard\" editor-at-large, Bill Kristol tweeted out last night. He said, \"The GOP tax bill's bringing out my inner socialist. The sex scandals are bringing out my inner feminist. Donald Trump and Roy Moore are bringing out my inner liberal. What's happening?\" What's happening, Bill, is that we now can see that you're not that conservative stalwart we thought you were before the election of Donald Trump. This year has been filled with a lot of political revelations. The people you thought you knew on the left and right are coming into clear focus for many people. As for President Trump's tweets, something they can be a little bit self- distracting. That's true. I say this, at least we now have an unvarnished view what the leader of the free world really thinks about issues big and small. I think that's kind of refreshing. How many Twitter accounts can drive a new cycle all by their lonesome. He has a direct pipeline to the American people, which, of course, drives the old lame extreme media nuts. They want to control the information you're getting. President Trump said, I'm going to have my say and go right to the people with it. Joining us now for reaction from Mobile, Alabama, my old friend, Quin Hillyer, a contributing editor at \"National Review,\" and in New York, a dear friend, Andy Stein, a Democrat and former president of the New York City Council. It is great to see both of you. Happy Thanksgiving. Let's start with you Andy on this. I personally am really grateful that we have President Trump in office. That Hillary is not president. That we have an economy that is -- looks like it's in the midst of a real recovery not anemic flat lining recovery as we saw under President Obama. Do you agree with that or am I kind of looking at things way too optimistically at this point?"

Isn't it refreshing to have someone who is really honest and says what he thinks? Sure, occasionally, he may put his foot in his mouth, but I think that he's done so well. The economy is really strong. This is $2 trillion in the pocket of working men and women. We defeated ISIS in Raqqa. There's no more talk about caliphate. He's reduced all these regulations. I think he's doing a terrific job. When I first endorsed him in the Wall Street Journal in September of 2016, the people in Manhattan, everywhere I go, say how can you do that? He's this and that. You have no idea you played these other people. They went insane. But the truth is, that Trump is an extremely caring, sensitive guy.

Joining us now for reaction is the one, the only Sara Carter who is a national security correspondent for Circa News. Sara, there is a lot out there still swirling about the Clintons, about the Obama administration's acquiescence and approval of this Uranium One sale. What do you make of what Congressman Gaetz is getting at? He and Jim Jordan are going to announce something next week. SARA CARTER, NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, \"CIRCA NEWS\": That's right. I think that what we're seeing here is that the FBI designated Hillary Clinton's case, the e-mail server case, a special, right, a special investigation. They were handling it differently than they handled everything else. Now people have debated, did that mean a major investigation? I know I've heard some issues coming out about that. But this was a special. And I think they have a point here. Gaetz, Jordan, and others like DeSantis and certainly the Senate Judiciary want to know why did they designate this as special? What made her so special as compared to every other investigation? And remember, it was the FBI's decision to shut down that server investigation. It was up to the Justice Department, not to Comey not to former FBI director Comey. So what was going on there and what was the relationship between the deputy director, who's still there --"

But let's go a little bit further. Terry McAuliffe was under investigation by the FBI for campaign contribution during that same time. By the way, we don't know where that investigation went. But that investigation just disappeared off the planet, nobody has been able to figure this out. For contributions he received actually from a former Chinese legislator who happened to have residency in the United States and cut him a check for $120,000 through his own business.

He was at a lot of his wife's events. I just got off the phone with FBI, former and current FBI. They said if they would have ever done this, they would have had it handed to them. They would have violated what they have been told ever since the academy at Quantico, you do not get involved in political campaigns. You stay biased. You stay out of it. I mean, you stay unbiased. Apparently there are a few that remain biased, but you stay unbiased. You stay out of any kind of political activity.

And for better and sometimes for worse, let's face it, talking politics at the Thanksgiving table is practically as much of a tradition as the turkey and the pumpkin pie and mashed potatoes and gravy. But it's giving many us some serious heartburn because according to a new poll from NPR and Marist, 58 percent of Americans say they are positively dreading the prospect discussing politics during Thanksgiving. That's up five points from last year during the aftermath of the election. And 31 percent say they're eager to do so tomorrow, but that's a 12 point plunge from last year. Joining us now to analyze, two of my favorite people, not just favorite colleagues, favorite people here at Fox, Shannon Bream, of course the anchor of the brand new 11:00 p.m. show on Fox, and Bret Baier who is wisely already in the balmy weather of Naples, Florida. Bret, I'm so jealous you're in Naples already, and I'm sitting in your chair, Bret. I feel inadequate sitting in this chair because this is your chair really. But I'm keeping it warm until you come back. It's great to see you. Bret, I want to start with you. Trump is controversial. The divide in the country seems like it's worse than ever before, but I don't know if that's even the case. How do you avoid this maelstrom at the table? What do you do? BRET BAIER, \"SPECIAL REPORT\" HOST: I think it's a good question because I think you have to be prepared at the beginning. You have to go in and say, you have other topics to talk about -- entertainment, sports, the kids, other things. I say stay away from LaVar Ball, the wall, Roy Moore at all. I think those three things that rhyme, you stay away from them. But if it goes south, get to the place with where you listen more than you get heated. You listen."

But it is little thorny, because a lot of families I know, and certainly my family, we have some polar opposite views, my family. Some of my brothers are different politically than I am, and we just don't talk about it. We talk about anything but. We play a game of tic-tac-toe. It's uncomfortable.

And I'm sort of deputized as the fake news buster during this Thanksgiving meals and get-togethers because they want to know what's actually been said or not said. I think one of the good strategies, and I like Bret's, but also something I read that made sense to me. Instead of talking about personalities like President Trump, like Hillary Clinton, whoever, if you talk ideas or policies that seems to work better for a lot of families instead of getting into the personalities, which seem to immediately put people on one side or other."

I rolled my eyes. I'm like, oh, God, can't we hear something else. But now I get teared-up when I hear some of that music today. It's a smell of Thanksgiving and just being together. Bret, what's one of your favorite memories growing up Thanksgiving, just being with the family?"

      "utterance": "Two things. One is my mom I grew up having turnips. And I can't stand turnips. But every year, we just made them and they just sat there and it was just my mom who ate them. But it was part of the tradition. And then the wishbone at the end, pulling it apart and which person got the bigger part of the bone got the wish to come true. And I remember that every year."

      "utterance": "I will say my dad loved frying turkeys. So you get the vat of the bubbling hot oil, and they do the demonstrations every year, like they'll do this and burn down your whole house and kill everybody. My dad loves the danger of making the turkey that way. So I always think about that. He also likes fireworks and blowing stuff up and everything, so I think that fried turkey was just part of it."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Tonight some thoughts on this eve of Thanksgiving. It's supposed to be a holiday dedicated to our families, our friends, and the ties that bind. It's a holiday where gratitude should above all else be placed front and center. But the reality is that in recent years it's become something far different. A holiday that's been tarnished by never ending sales on flat screen TVs, appliances, all manner of jewelry, forcing folks to spend time waiting in line, sometimes for days, instead of cherishing the time they have with their family. Polling shows that the majority of Americans say they're going to shop online this holiday season with internet sales poised to surpass $100 billion for the first time ever. Sure, that's good for the economy, no doubt. But shouldn't we just dedicate one day, one day to family and giving thanks without having to buy anything? Just take a look at how early these sales start this week. Kohl's, they kicked off turkey discounts on Monday. Old Navy knocking 50 percent all items beginning today. And by the time Thanksgiving morning rolls around, virtually every major retailer will be back offering black Friday deals that will bring folks to the store or their computers before they even have time to prep their meal, let alone clean it up. And that leads me to my next point. Why are stores even open on Thanksgiving at all? I know retailers, they need to sell and they make all their money this time of year. It's the biggest season of the year for them. But is it worth the breaking up of families on the one day that some of them spend time together, that one day a year? It's bad enough that consumers are dragged away from their families, but what about the employees that are forced to staff the store? Just look at this partial list of stores open tomorrow. K-mart is one of first to open, cracking doors at 6:00 a.m. Dollar General, Bass Pro Shops, I love Bass Pro Shops, I love Cabela's, but they're not far behind. And by end of the day they'll be joined by J.C. Penney, Old Navy, Wal-Mart, Target among many others. I worry that in our haste to buy for everyone on our list it's going to cause our relationships to fray with the people we love most. And some things are worth more than the 100 bucks you might save on that wide screen. And in most cases those door buster sales are come-ons to get you buy some other junk you don't need anyway. How many times have you stood in line for $200 iPad on black Friday only to learn that the sale only applied to the first five sold, and it turns out you're the 38th person in line? Read the fine print before you give up the stuff that really matters, the stuff that you're never going to get back and will never go on sale. That's time with friends and family. And part of what drives us into the cold that makes us want to join those black Friday blowouts and the Friday mobs is the thought that we might miss out on a great opportunity. My goodness, we've got to get there, we've got to drive there, we've got to park there. But on Thanksgiving, the biggest opportunity in the world is back home, and it's around the table. So savor this Thanksgiving. Try to celebrate it without wrestling your neighbors over a sale. A few things I'm thankful for when we return."

      "utterance": "Before we go and as we prepare to celebrate Thanksgiving, it's the perfect opportunity to give thanks to our veterans and the men and women who are currently serving in our armed forces. We just love them. And today's crash of a U.S. Navy plane off Japan delivers a somber reminder of what our troops put on the line every single day for us. Their extraordinary sacrifice, the risks they take to defend this country is something we all should be grateful for every day, not just tomorrow, because without it, we are not sitting around the table enjoying turkey in freedom and security. I want you to know that I'm very grateful for you for tuning into Fox every night to watch all of our great shows. Thank you for trusting us with news reporting and analysis you're not going to get anywhere else. And thank you, my family, who put up with me on this crazy schedule I have. And thank us for our freedom and everyone who helped provide it. Everybody have a wonderful Thanksgiving, and remember that which really matters. Thanks for watching.
