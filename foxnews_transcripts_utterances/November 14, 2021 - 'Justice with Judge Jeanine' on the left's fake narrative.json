Fake it until you make it, that's the new motto of the left-wing of America, because in 2021, if you dare to disagree with liberals and dare to speak out against the rise of lawlessness in America, beware. We saw it this week with the fake rush to judgment prosecution of Kyle Rittenhouse, the young man from Kenosha, Wisconsin brazenly mistreated by the mainstream media, the vindictive left, and even the President of the United States who lied and said that he was a white supremacist and domestic terrorists, that he was part of a militia. This, now, 18-year-old was downright harassed and abused by a hostile prosecutor, a prosecutor who called into question the defendant's innocence in front of a jury simply because he exercised his constitutional right to remain silent before trial.",

Why was the District Attorney so quick to indict 17-year-old Rittenhouse within 48 hours of a complicated case where three individuals were shot at night in the middle of a riot, as hundreds of witnesses and hours of video needed to be reviewed? How was the so sure was intentional murder versus second degree versus reckless, or even self-defense? How was it that this young man who immediately tried to turn himself in was portrayed as a murderer who crossed state lines to kill when he crossed that state line almost every day to work and visit his father and friends. The motivation? The crowd needed a villain. It was a give us a Barabbas moment. The mob wanted blood and the DA was more than willing to appease them, giving them a 17-year-old without a real investigation. Make no mistake, liberals are emboldened and their fake it until they make it strategy has kicked into high gear. For anyone on the wrong side of the political aisle, you could quickly find yourself on the Democrats' enemy list. Remember the fake Trump dossier? The source of that phony attempt to smear the 45th President of the United States has been charged with lying to the F.B.I., but for the years, the Intelligence Community -- the Intelligence Community backed by their allies in the mainstream media, they claimed the dossier was authentic --",

That's not surprising considering that under the Joe Biden administration, consumer prices surged over six percent in October alone. And as temperatures start dropping from coast to coast, we are learning that year-over-year, propane prices are up 54 percent. Heating oil is up 43 percent, natural gas is up 30 percent, and electricity is up six percent. And with less than two weeks to go until Thanksgiving, food prices are skyrocketing. But that's not stopping Washington from spending your hard earned money. Last week, they pushed through a $1.2 trillion so-called Infrastructure Bill with 13 Republicans willing to sell their souls and their party down the river. Take a look on your screen. The Democrats who fake it until they make it can always do it alone, sometimes even so-called Republicans catapult them to the top. These are the Republicans who supported a trillion dollar piece of legislation that not even AOC herself could support. They could have stopped it and started from scratch. They don't deserve to be re-elected next term. And sadly, the spending spree is only beginning. Up next, a $1.75 trillion Climate Bill that's likely to be voted on this week. And according to the former head of the D.N.C., Ed Rendell, wasting trillions of taxpayer dollars at a rapid pace make stumbling Joe Biden a modern day FDR.",

You know, you see an anchor like Don Lemon suggesting the white Judge may also be racist. Why? For making a benign supply chain joke about an Asian food lunch order for the courthouse.

Fake it until you make it, that's the new motto of the left-wing of America, because in 2021, if you dare to disagree with liberals and dare to speak out against the rise of lawlessness in America, beware. We saw it this week with the fake rush to judgment prosecution of Kyle Rittenhouse, the young man from Kenosha, Wisconsin brazenly mistreated by the mainstream media, the vindictive left, and even the President of the United States who lied and said that he was a white supremacist and domestic terrorists, that he was part of a militia. This, now, 18-year-old was downright harassed and abused by a hostile prosecutor, a prosecutor who called into question the defendant's innocence in front of a jury simply because he exercised his constitutional right to remain silent before trial."

Why was the District Attorney so quick to indict 17-year-old Rittenhouse within 48 hours of a complicated case where three individuals were shot at night in the middle of a riot, as hundreds of witnesses and hours of video needed to be reviewed? How was the so sure was intentional murder versus second degree versus reckless, or even self-defense? How was it that this young man who immediately tried to turn himself in was portrayed as a murderer who crossed state lines to kill when he crossed that state line almost every day to work and visit his father and friends. The motivation? The crowd needed a villain. It was a give us a Barabbas moment. The mob wanted blood and the DA was more than willing to appease them, giving them a 17-year-old without a real investigation. Make no mistake, liberals are emboldened and their fake it until they make it strategy has kicked into high gear. For anyone on the wrong side of the political aisle, you could quickly find yourself on the Democrats' enemy list. Remember the fake Trump dossier? The source of that phony attempt to smear the 45th President of the United States has been charged with lying to the F.B.I., but for the years, the Intelligence Community -- the Intelligence Community backed by their allies in the mainstream media, they claimed the dossier was authentic --"

And as temperatures start dropping from coast to coast, we are learning that year-over-year, propane prices are up 54 percent. Heating oil is up 43 percent, natural gas is up 30 percent, and electricity is up six percent. And with less than two weeks to go until Thanksgiving, food prices are skyrocketing. But that's not stopping Washington from spending your hard earned money. Last week, they pushed through a $1.2 trillion so-called Infrastructure Bill with 13 Republicans willing to sell their souls and their party down the river. Take a look on your screen. The Democrats who fake it until they make it can always do it alone, sometimes even so-called Republicans catapult them to the top. These are the Republicans who supported a trillion dollar piece of legislation that not even AOC herself could support. They could have stopped it and started from scratch. They don't deserve to be re-elected next term. And sadly, the spending spree is only beginning. Up next, a $1.75 trillion Climate Bill that's likely to be voted on this week.

When the Ferguson case happened with Officer Darren Wilson, I had my sources that I won't reveal telling me there were numerous eyewitnesses that would corroborate the story of Darren Wilson --"

One is Rosenbaum, the other is Huber, and the third is Grosskreutz who is still alive, but I want you to listen to this sound from Drew Hernandez before I ask the question."

      "speaker": "BRIAN CLAYPOOL, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Hey, Judge, great to be with you. My answer is yes, because self-defense is a reasonable belief that you're in harm's way; that you might die. It is an objective standard. But here, Rittenhouse is faced with Rosenbaum who is lunging at them. He is grabbing for a gun and another piece of important information that Rittenhouse had heard Ziminski say, \"Hey, get him and kill him.\" So Rosenbaum is the aggressor and in Rittenhouse's mind, he is thinking, this guy is going to kill me. He lunges, grabs for the gun. Absolutely, I think self-defense applies there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, and in addition to that, Brian, he said he felt cornered. Let's go to the second person who was shot. This is Huber. Huber struck Kyle in the neck with a skateboard using it like you would a baseball bat, which in itself would make it something of deadly physical force. And he also grabbed Kyle's gun, and Kyle said he felt the gun strapped pulling away from him. Would Kyle be justified in resisting that with deadly physical force?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLAYPOOL",
      "utterance": "Yes, in Huber's situation, Rittenhouse again, is legally entitled to exercise self-defense. Why? Last time I checked, a skateboard could be construed as a deadly weapon. You hit somebody in the head with a skateboard that could kill you. You combine that with Huber also grabbing for the AR-15, and clearly, Rittenhouse is in harm's way. He feels like he might die and he can use deadly force."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, and finally Grosskreutz, first he has his hands up and Rittenhouse doesn't shoot at him. This is all from the testimony. But then he lunges toward Kyle, points his gun directly at his head and admits he went forward. Would Rittenhouse be justified in using his force to defend himself?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLAYPOOL",
      "utterance": "Yes, the Grosskreutz case is laughable. I mean, that shouldn't even been brought. No charges should have been brought in this case. This is ridiculous. I mean, he points a gun at Rittenhouse. Why would you charge Rittenhouse with any crime? Rittenhouse has every right at that point to shoot and save his own life. And the common thread, Judge, with these three victims is that they were all three aggressors, right? They were chasing after Rittenhouse and they were being the aggressive ones, and that's what led to what happened."

The use of deadly physical force by Kyle Rittenhouse, I believe has been established in this case, of course, it's always up to the jury, but what's happened in this country is that there has been a vacuum created, even in this case with the police standing down, the police are not there, businesses are being burnt. People are rioting, there are people there from 44 different cities. They are not even there from that community coming in.

It's like a memo went out, making it mandatory to call Kyle Rittenhouse a racist, and only in this country can a white guy shoot three other white guys and somehow racist made the central issue in the case. Maybe that's because the President of the United States once called Rittenhouse a white supremacist, which set off this whole echo chamber that you're seeing now, and it gets better. You know, you see an anchor like Don Lemon suggesting the white Judge may also be racist. Why? For making a benign supply chain joke about an Asian food lunch order for the courthouse. He also said that Rittenhouse is the ultimate case of quote \"white wannabe vigilantism.\" So this is the same guy to Tomi's point who supported Black Lives Matter in those mostly peaceful riots last summer. And you know, maybe the story is how inept the prosecution is, maybe the story -- and I'm just spit-balling here -- is that eyewitnesses testify that Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense. The video shows the same thing. Maybe the media should stop taking sides in declaring people like Kyle Rittenhouse guilty until proven innocent and do their jobs and just report the facts."

But nobody cares about the burning of the businesses, the rioting, the looting. There were people there from 44 different cities, these aren't locals. These are people who came in to make trouble and they're worried about Kyle Rittenhouse and calling him a domestic terrorist. He lives there or he visits his father and works there. He lives 10 miles from there."

Well, let's also keep in mind that that summer riot season cost American cities about a billion dollars and dozens of lives, which the media didn't seem to care about, because they really frame that in terms of activism and justice. And the same thing is continuing to happen. We've got the leaders of BLM right now in New York City also threatening that city with more riots and more bloodshed, and the media -- although the media did not cause this -- the media certainly has stoked the fire by turning the other cheek to the rioters, and by calling people like Kyle Rittenhouse a white supremacist and a racist, just to make the public perception the one that they need, which is that white supremacy is the problem in this country and not everything else that's going wrong including BLM and Antifa."

She is here now with reaction to that and much more. Good evening, it is great to see you again, Chief. I understand that you are in the midst of your great book \"Black in Blue\" that I've had a chance to look at and that you are actually in the running to be one of the Police Chiefs in New York City. I'll ask you how that's going a little later. But what do you think of Hawk Newsome, threatening New York City with bloodshed and riots if the Mayor decides to enforce law and order and bring back the anti-crime gun unit?"

You know what I'll say is, I think it's fair to be honest with you to acknowledge the concerns of racial social justice, advocacy, and Black Lives Matter. But at the same time, you know, there has to be as Mayor-elect Adams is putting forward a comprehensive public safety plan and that plan has to include strategies in which to bring down the increase in violence and shots fired that we've seen lately. And so I think it's an opportunity to put a structure in place that will help reduce the level of crime that they're seeing in the city. And so I have full confidence that that's where we're going to be going in New York, and really across the nation as agencies come up with strategies to reduce crime."

But I think you know, better than anyone that if you don't have plainclothes officers in an anti-crime unit or a street crime unit to try to get guns off the street, it's just not going to happen. Is that something that you would consider important to do in today's day and age?"

      "utterance": "Yes, you know, I can tell you my experience has been, we have officers who are out, you know, in the field, doing surveillance, you know, contacting gang members, stopping the flow of guns. It really has been beneficial. And often, believe it or not, many of those officers because they are working so closely, they actually can help, you know, help, prevent, and curtail some folks who are getting involved in nefarious acts by either doing referrals or adding in interrupters. There is a lot of good that can come from this as well. So I think it's an important part of this strategy, amongst many other things, to bring down violence."

As you know, we've all gone through this a year of ups and downs, a lot of polarization, and so the last thing any of us wants to see is more violence in the streets. In fact, we want to see just the opposite. So I think there is an opportunity to, you know for compromise to prevail and to work together to figure out ways to stop the prolific shots fired that we're seeing all over the country."
