People disappear into their Twitter and Facebook accounts and they sort of feed on this sort of thing. The problem is we are getting into dangerous and deep water with that. Political violence has a mystical attractiveness and I think Hodgkinson put that together in a way that, I will say, Speaker Nancy Pelosi put her finger on it, we all worried the length of the Obama administration about something like this happening. Thank god it didn't. And now this sort of thing is back in the waters. It's bad."

Look, Bernie Sanders, when Gabby Giffords was shot, put out a fundraiser blaming kind of right-wing Republican reaction and false narratives, and so this is very embarrassing. It proves it can hit any side on this. And I, as Dan was saying, I think we need to lower the temperature. People need to be more careful. But without blaming, look, at the end of the day, the blame for the shooting goes on the man behind the rifle scope and pulling the trigger."

If we win, we are doing it our way. And 17 percent of the U.S. economy basically run by the federal government in the ObamaCare. That makes people feel desperate on both sides."

But I think we have to admit the anti-Trump hysteria is like nothing we have ever seen in our politics in a long time. I think the people behind it have got to recognize that what happened here in Virginia, the shooting of Mr. Steve Scalise, was a dangerous portent and it is time to tone it down."

The president responded late this week calling the investigation a \"witch hunt\" and tweeting, quote, \"They made up a phony collusion with the Russian story. Found zero proof. So now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice.\" We are back with Dan Henninger, Mary Anastasia O'Grady and Bill McGurn. Bill, let's put this Mueller news in context.

But again, you have FBI agents working on this. You've got lawyers from people who are interviewed. All of these people are talking. And the danger is, with anonymous sources, you never know what to believe. As we learned with Comey's testimony, sometimes what CNN and \"The New York Times\" reported was simply false."

You know, people say they are professionals, but the second point about that is, I remember when Loretta Lynch was in charge, and they said, no, they're all professionals at the DOJ. Well, we know the DOJ, in the past, has been in the past highly politicized. I think this is a really, really awful signal to the country, this open-ended thing. A prosecutor is supposed to investigate a known crime, not search for a crime."

But I also think that part of the big problem, as I said before, is the process. This idea that whoever is in that job can just sort of throw out this net and fish for anything. And it can go on for an extended period of time, which is another objective of the Democrats. They want this on the table, consuming oxygen from the room for as long as possible, and certainly, to affect the midterm election."

The same is true with executive privilege. Subordinate officials, advisors to the president have to honor the privilege, unless and until the president says, yes, you can talk about that.

There's a lot of criticism I hear about that decision, not just because of the fact of a special counsel but because of the close ties going back, as colleagues, many, many years between James Comey, the former FBI director, and Robert Mueller. They worked together. They threatened to resign together. Does that, in your mind, suggest a potential conflict of interest?"

But the larger judgment will be made based on how Bob conducts this investigation. Again, I think -- I know Mr. Mueller very well and I don't think he is going to let any prior association get in the way of his best judgment. I think those of us who know Bob may think his year may not be finely tuned to the political music, but that is part of his charm here."

And, indeed, he issued a statement last night urging the public and everybody else concerned not to take leaks from anonymous sources too seriously. I'm sure he is as upset about these leaks as anyone else. And I think his caution in terms of putting too much weight into those reports is well taken."

      "speaker": "TERWILLIGER",
      "utterance": "Yes. The president -- we have a unitary executive. The president is in charge of everybody in the executive branch, including special councils. Normally, if a president wanted to do that, he would call up the acting attorney general, Mr. Rosenstein, and say, I want Mr. Mueller dismissed. But I seriously doubt that this is anything but a hypothetical discussion."

Look, I think this, on this obstruction business that has been reported, if you look at the reports closely -- and that is the only knowledge I have of this is what is publicly reported -- this was going before Mr. Mueller came on the job. So as was discussed earlier in the program, the fact is Mr. Mueller will feel obligated to run those leaks down, to talk to the appropriate people.

And on the Republican side, former RNC chairman and establishment favorite, Ed Gillespie, squeaked out an uncomfortably close win over former Trump state chairman, Cory Stewart. We're back with Dan Henninger and Bill McGurn. And \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial page writer, Alyssa Finley also joins us. Dan, what is the main message of the Virginia primaries? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Let me run through it. After the Democratic primary, Ralph Northam and Tom Perriello said we are united as one to defeat Ed Gillespie in the general election. After the Republican primary was over, Cory Stewart said this, \"There is one word you'll never hear from me and that is unity.\" Unless Gillespie comes across to his point of view.

What I think about is great about these apprenticeship programs is we have our children, $1.4 trillion collectively in debt. On average, about $30,000 per student in debt. People are coming to the realization that the trades -- working as a carpenter or a plumber or manufacturing, they are great jobs. They are great careers.

So why don't we, first, by providing our children with information on all of their options out of high school. These apprenticeship programs, as well as technical education in high schools - you know, what we used to call shop or industrial arts - that's also growing in Wisconsin.

And so I thought it would be far better to have states run a program where they identify the areas of their economy that they need workers, and also what the rates would be, so they don't depress wages for workers, for example, in Wisconsin. But now that I've been serving here for six years, we have not solved our illegal immigration problem. We need a legal immigration -- and I would rather have the states, by and large, manage that. Now, visas are issued by the federal government, but they would be managed by the states, through contacts. Legislators would have to pass laws. But let's face it, if Alabama doesn't want guest workers, they don't have to do it. If Wisconsin does, through compacts with others state, it would be far more flexible and really target towards the areas of the economy that need workers."

It's going to take some time. If I'm going to be lightning rod on this, that's fine, because I have the background to prove, and we have a state that proves we don't have enough workers.

      "utterance": "I think that if they were smart, they would kind of recognize that they need somebody for management that is different than the innovators. Those are two different baskets. I mean, I acknowledge that if you get too much of the kind of establishment and staid management style, that could impact innovation. But I don't know. I think a lot of mistakes they've made are really basic things about how you treat people and civility and so forth. It shouldn't be that hard."

      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "One distinction worth making here is that we always talk about things like Uber and Airbnb as startups, like they were the little mom-and- pop operations over in the corner. These are big businesses. The Internet economy is based on the fact that everyone participates. Apps like Google, Facebook, Twitter, they make money because they have millions and millions of customers. They are as big as General Motors or Ford of U.S. Steel in their time. So these are big companies, and big companies are very complicated to run. Ford was started by a maverick, Henry Ford. Andrew Carnegie was a maverick when he got into the steel business. But eventually, you grow up and you have to realize you are in something very complicated."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FINLEY",
      "utterance": "No, I think they are. I think they have more investors, shareholders, when you have to publish problems and provide these disclosures, there is more sensitivity and the investors on the board will impose some checks."

      "utterance": "What about the larger tech economy, Mary. We've been riding these companies that Dan talked about for months, they've been leading the stock market. We have had a correction of late. I guess my personal view is, I don't mind a correction. You know, we had that bubble in 2000. Corrections can be healthy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think the general market we missed in the tech sector has to be looked at in the context of the broader economy, which is that where in the eighth year of expansion, so it's normal that you would have a rotation into stocks that do well in the late cycle of an economic expansion. But you also have a lot of -- you know, you have Trump totally distracted from the agenda that he promised to deliver, and I think a lot of the rise in the market since he took office was looking forward to the idea that he would be cutting taxes and making it easy for companies to do business. So you have these great expectations, but you also have left easy money. And you also have a lot of oil weakness, which is sort of destabilizing I think a lot of the market."

John Miller, who heads up counterterrorism for the NYPD, and who says that they've stopped 25 terrorist attacks in New York City since 2001, told the press that it would \"create a one-stop shopping guide for understanding the tools and how to thwart them for criminals and for terrorists.\" And, you know, I like transparency as much as the next guy, but I think that the NYPD needs these tools."
