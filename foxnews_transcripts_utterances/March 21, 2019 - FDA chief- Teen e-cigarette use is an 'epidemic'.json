Then at the ripe old age of 29, she was appointed deputy city attorney for Atlanta. She was then elected to the Georgia assembly and became the first black woman to serve as Minority Leader for the Georgia House of Representatives where she built a reputation for working across party lines.

As a politician, she has vowed to fight for Georgia residents and she is certainly not shy about fighting for herself.

Breaking tonight, even James Comey, is now declaring he doesn't know if there was Russian collusion or obstruction of justice by President Trump. The former FBI chief adding, he doesn't care. Really? That flip-flop comes just hours after this image of the special counsel diligently driving himself to the office early this morning, sent some in the mainstream media into yet another tizzy. But the possibility of Robert Mueller, finally dropping his report on alleged collusion. As of this moment, surprise, still no Mueller report. But what is surprising is now, it's Democrats in damage control mode. Not the President. As his critics who once had visions of collusion, obstruction, maybe even sugarplums dancing in their heads, now seem to be backpedaling on what they once thought was their best shot at impeachment. Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum who's on assignment tonight, and this is THE STORY. Remember at the beginning of all this, two long years ago? Robert Mueller was the biggest game in town. The president's fiercest critics insisting it was only a matter of time before collusion was proven."

Schiff, the top Democrat on the House, the Intel panel seem to be saying, \"Hey, regardless of what you think of the congressman, you got to give him credit, at least, he's been consistent. This very week, despite they're still not being evidence of collusion, he's still insisting he thinks there was. Other critics of the president not so much. Brand-new op-ed, I mentioned from Comey, the former FBI chief fired by the president, offers a rather flippant attitude toward collusion. Suggesting the whole thing suddenly doesn't matter. \"I have no idea whether the special counsel will conclude that Mr. Trump knowingly conspired with the Russians. Or that he obstructed justice with the required corrupt intent. I also don't care.\" And get this. Some of the media are now suggesting, we might not be able to trust the Mueller report if it doesn't find collusion."

I want to be fair in this op-ed by saying he only cares, \"that the work be done, well and completely.\" And he says, he's rooting for the world to see the American justice system works. Do you think he and others were rooting for something else?"

Schiff, not only -- not only does Schiff have evidence of collusion, he claims, but in his later quotes, he's actually got him indicted. And remember he said, those are very real prospect, he would actually go to jail. And now, Swalwell is promising indictments. The part of Comey's op-ed that caught my attention. I agree that the Justice Department has had a really bad three years, where I part from director Comey as I don't think it's Trump's fault. I think it's some FBI agents and some DOJ officials that have diminished my fellow-citizens confidence, and that venerable institution that we need."

      "utterance": "Well, we've already had indictments, Eric. We've got a bunch of them, and not a single one was for conspiracy or collusion involving a Trump campaign official. Not a single one. I think what -- what's most disheartening, I think is not just that a former prosecutor like Swalwell and a former prosecutor like Schiff would flip the burden of proof that Trump is now presumed guilty. That is the sad part to me is that two former prosecutors are willing to put their entire backgrounds on hole, simply because they do not like the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, why won't they just follow the facts?"

And that's what I think -- I hope, most of my fellow citizens are going to say, you know what, let's wait until Mueller issues this report. Comey used a word in his op-ed that I do take exception too. Mueller doesn't conclude crimes. Mueller alleges. Prosecutors' allege. It is juries in this country that conclude whether or not a crime was committed, not special counsel. They don't speak through press conferences and they don't speak through reports, they speak through indictments and convictions. And there is a presumption of innocence in this country whether Democrats like Schiff and Swalwell like it or not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "And there were -- when you said a moment ago, there haven't been any indictments associated with collusion. There's certainly been indictments and guilty pleas in the Mueller investigation as you know, tied to communications with Russians. But it hasn't led to conclusion -- to collusion even though, these Democrats keep saying it's been proven. And then that there's evidence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, they -- made Adam Schiff had evidence of collusion in March of 2017. So, if you go back in time Ed, Comey is before the House Intelligence Committee and publicly confirms for the very first time. There doing of counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. That's all March the 20th, 2017. Two days later, is when Adam Schiff, said he had evidence not quite direct but a little more than circumstantial. It was -- it took him two days to find what the FBI and Mueller haven't found in two years. There's not a single indictment of a Trump campaign official for conspiracy to hack Podesta's e-mail or hack the DNC server. Not a single one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, is this why we're now starting to see some spin. Whether it's from Democrats or people in the media. They're saying, after two years of wait for Mueller, we maybe can't trust Mueller."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "I tell you that for those of us that have been defending Mueller, and trust me, there were days it was lonely as a Republican to do that. I'm very interested in his report because I think it's going to be about what Russia did. I think that's what really disappoints some Democrats. Not all, but some Democrats. It is finding out what Russia did to this country in 2016 is not enough. What they really, really want is the president of the United States indicted. But they pivoted from collusion months ago. Remember this whole obstruction of justice? Well, maybe he didn't collude, but the firing of Jim Comey is tantamount to obstruction of justice. They pivoted months ago, and now they're pivoting to Ivanka and Jared and private e-mail and to whatever else they can pivot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, is this simply as the president says, a witch-hunt? If they just keep moving the ball, they say two years ago, we have evidence of collusion. Two years later, they don't have it. So, they just keep moving, it's a shell game."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "To me, it is not a witch-hunt, Ed, because -- I don't -- if you go back and read what Comey said in March of 2017, and what Rod Rosenstein asks Mueller to do, it is find out what Russia did to this country. That is number one. And they did attack this country. That's not a witch-hunt. I think what President Trump is frustrated by is this whole collusion narrative for which there is no evidentiary support has cast a cloud over his entire presidency and it's by design. In March of 2017, when Adam Schiff said he had evidence of collusion, he hadn't even given his witness listed Devin Nunes. That's how unserious he was about investigating collusion. This has been calculated to draw out for the entire Trump first term, and they've been pretty successful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, last question, has it been almost a battle of semantics? Because what it seems to me you're saying, going back to Comey in March of 2017 with the counterintelligence investigation there was interference from the Russians. But Democrats have tried again and again to say there was collusion, and somehow that flipped the election. Nobody's denying there was interference. But did they try to make a leap from interference to collusion in flipping the election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, they made more than a leap. They made a calculated decision that what would be a unifying thing for this country. How to prevent a hostile foreign country from interfering with our election. That should be an American issue, Ed. Not a Republican or Democrat American. But that's not interesting enough to some of my -- not all, some of my Democrat former colleagues. It had to be about collusion because they still can't believe that Trump won in 2016. None of their friends voted for him. So, how in the world did he win? And I think it's about undoing an election every bit as much as it is finding out what Russia tried to do to us."

I think every voice should be heard whether it is the Republican Conservative voice, a pro-life voice, a pro- choice voice, an LGBTQ voice, all these voices should have belong on college campuses. Here in lies the problem with this executive order is that all it does is reinforce a law that's already on the books that says that you have to promote free speech at colleges to qualify for research dollars -- federal research dollars. If the president really wanted to go farther on this E.O., he could have defined what hate speech was and created an actual litmus test. This executive order doesn't create a litmus test. It just says that you have to promote free speech. Meaning this will likely get bogged down in the courts because somebody is going to be like well, what is free speech? How do you define it? And how am I doing it or not doing it which is why this E.O. is problematic."

And I think this is something that Americans now are being educated on that these college students are going onto campuses who are courageously standing up for their values are being shut down by their administrations, shouted down by other students, and I think it was good. It was a good day, a good moment to have the President of the United States, the leader of the free world reaffirm our constitutional right to free speech and free expression."

On the other hand, to Richard's point, will this executive order really have any impact when there's a law already on the books that's not being followed? Why will universities all of a sudden say, OK, the president signed this so we're going to allow Conservatives to speak out."

    {
      "speaker": "CABOT PHILLIPS, MEDIA DIRECTOR, CAMPUS REFORM",
      "utterance": "Well, I think this is going to bring accountability to these universities. For too long they've been able to operate in the dark with people not really paying attention to what's going on. And I think the President using his position to draw attention is a step in the right direction. I applaud him for doing so. And I've been all over a hundred college campuses in the last three years with Leadership Institute's Campus Reform. I've seen students be secluded to little free speech zones on campus when they're trying to express their ideas. I've seen Conservative groups lose their funding because the administration doesn't agree with their position. I've seen speakers -- I personally had to deal with suppression from administration and students.. And so this is an issue that it's going to continue to grow if we don't address it. I applaud the president for doing this. And also it's going to benefit students on both sides. Liberal students will also grow from this because they're going to have more access to ideas they maybe haven't heard in class or from other speakers. They're going to be stronger because of this. This should have bipartisan support."

And this video is disturbing, Conservative Activist Hayden Williams, this was at U.C. Berkeley just last month in February. And as you see that video play out, it built and built and built and finally he gets -- he gets punched. Why is this happening on college campuses?"

Just to focus on Berkeley or two or three different examples, isn't the best way to go about this. And I agree with everybody on this panel at the idea that we should have -- we should not have free speech zones and you should be allowed to speak freely and allowed to express your opinions.

Advisors to former Vice President Joe Biden are reportedly considering failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams as his pick for Veep right out of the gate.

      "utterance": "Good to see you, Ed. It's not as if 45- year-old Stacey Abrams is sitting around waiting for the phone to ring. After narrowly losing the Georgia governor's race back in November, she has remained a hot political commodity. She's contemplating another run for governor in 2022 and is being heavily recruited to run for the Senate. In fact, in recent days, Abrams has met with senator Kamala Harris and other party leaders about potentially taking on GOP Senator David Perdue in 2020. Stacey Abrams, the daughter of two Methodist ministers was born in Wisconsin, raised in Georgia, and has put together a powerful resume. She did her undergraduate work at historically black Spelman College in Atlanta, studied public policy at the University of Texas, and got her law degree from Yale. Then at the ripe old age of 29, she was appointed deputy city attorney for Atlanta. She was then elected to the Georgia assembly and became the first black woman to serve as Minority Leader for the Georgia House of Representatives where she built a reputation for working across party lines. Georgia newspapers say Abrams was instrumental in working with GOP Governor Nathan Deal on criminal justice reform and scholarship programs for low- income Georgia students. As a politician, she has vowed to fight for Georgia residents and she is certainly not shy about fighting for herself. After losing the governor's race by less than a point and a half to Republican Brian Kemp, Abrams initially refused to concede accusing camp who had been the Georgia Secretary of State of promoting several measures that suppress minority votes. Abram still refers to the election loss as her moment of Darkness watch."

Now look, I think that every candidate here in this race and every campaign as all of us know is looking for an edge, an edge to win the nomination, an edge to win the general right? And if Biden's folks believe that putting him or pairing him with Stacey Abrams gives him that edge to win both the nomination and win the general, I think it makes sense. There are some practical reasons why it also makes sense. It allows Joe Biden and his team to cover more ground. He and Stacey Abrams could be a multiple media markets during the day.

They have to be ready to step in to become commander-in-chief on a moment's notice. And Joe Biden will be 77 years old the day he takes office if he is elected. That's older -- that's the same age that Ronald Reagan was when he left office. So, his vice-presidential choice is going to be really scrutinized. So, you need to have somebody who is qualified to be commander-in-chief on day one. Stacey Abrams is completely unqualified to be commander-in-chief of the United States."

But the availability of these products can come at the expense of addicting a whole generation of kids onto nicotine. Some proportion of which of these children are now going to become future smokers. And so, we are taking steps to try to limit access to the products that we find are the most appealing products to kids. And these are the flavored e- cigarettes, and particularly, the pod based or cartridge-based e-cigarettes like JUUL, by putting in place heightened age verification requirements for the sale of these products in convenience stores and online."

We also are seeing increasing evidence in toxicology studies in both animals and humans that the e-cigarette vapors do have an effect on the lungs, so they are not safe. We believe they are less harmful than smoking combustible cigarettes, but they're not safe. And so, we do have concerns about the use of these products by children.

I want to read quickly from a letter, and this is from conservative groups to the president. They say, \"Private-sector initiative and sound public policy should not be held hostage by prohibitionist impulses. The FDA's current efforts and attitude toward the e-cig industry make America a less appealing place to invest and do business. Simply put, we are not a public health leader on the issue of utilizing the free market and innovation for tobacco harm reduction.\" Quite simply, sir, were you pushed out?"

And in fact, you saw tweets from the White House press secretary and the White House put out a fact sheet detailing the plan that we put out last week. Nobody in this administration wants to see children become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes, and the secretary and I, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar and I had an op-ed yesterday in the Washington Post talking about this plan. So, this has broad support in the administration. Remember, these e- cigarette manufacturers have only themselves to blame. They were marketing these products to children, and we've seen nothing short of an epidemic rise in the use of these products by kids. This is an existential threat to the industry, and the first step I took as FDA commissioner was to try to take accommodative steps recognizing that these products could be valuable tools for adult smokers, and then you saw nothing short of an epidemic use in the rise of these products by kids."

      "utterance": "I learned that we play a role, the FDA plays an important role in trying to reduce the rate of new addiction by reducing the utilization of opioids in the medical setting, and I also learned a valuable lesson that when you see a burgeoning epidemic you have to take very aggressive action upfront. And that's why you saw the FDA act aggressively when we saw the epidemic rise in the use of e-cigarettes by kids. And why we've also taken aggressive taken we see other epidemic emerging like use of kratom, another botanical product that's an opioid that's also potentially leading to a new addiction crisis in this country.

Now arguing that release of the video would violate the state's public records law. Here now criminal defense attorney, Mark Eiglarsh. I want to get that right. I think I mangled it on the way out. Mark, good to see you tonight."

      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "No. It's exactly the move that I've made in the past that I would make if I'm representing him. You don't want it out there. But I wouldn't expect to win this motion. We have some of the most liberal and strongest rules governing public release of information. Florida Sunshine Law requires this to be released. It's not a matter of national public security or safety. It's an embarrassment issue. And under the law, it has to be released."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, and there's another issue here which is not just the legal case, but what's going to happen with Bob Kraft in terms of whether or not the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell may try to kick him out or suspend him, whether or not he is going to make the hall of fame which he may be up for soon. So, he's fighting two battles which is he may be able to stay out of jail, especially as a first-time offender. But if he admits guilt, that could cause a problem with the NFL."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "Without question. But I want everyone to think of this as a much bigger issue. We get access to evidence in criminal cases because we want accountability and transparency. And if in this case we don't release the video, then we've got problems down the road."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "But what is in the public interest to see whether or not there was prostitution? If they can prove it in court, they can provide evidence, but why does that video need to be out there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",
      "utterance": "We don't need to see it. I don't want to see it. But it's because if they don't turn it over in this particular case, then the very next case when you do want to see it, all of a sudden there's some kind of exception and there's going to different rules to be had. Listen, in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting case, even though law enforcement didn't want that to be released, it had to be released. The judge ordered it released. The Pulse shooting in Orlando. The 911 calls, the body cam footage. Over objection from law enforcement, that got released."
