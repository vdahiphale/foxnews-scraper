      "utterance": "In over 40 -- between magnitude three and magnitude four, this is actually what's been expected. And we also have forecast for the probabilities of aftershocks over the next weeks. So there's a 9 percent chance within the next week that we would have an earthquake of greater than magnitude 6.4, which is the main shock. There's also a 20 percent chance that we're going to have greater than magnitude five within that one week period. It's very likely with a magnitude 6.4 that you get aftershocks of those magnitude five. Currently, we have geologist headed out to the field, they should be there later this afternoon to look at -- there's been some reports of ground cracks, there's possibility of actual faulting. And so we actually have the geologist and the reports from the field, we can't confirm that. There have also been reports of damage, several fires in the Ridgecrest area, so that certainly is consistent with what we expected as well. We had -- there were some questions about the shake alert system, I will confirm that the shake alert system, that's the early warning system, it did perform as designed. There were no glitches. There -- in the city of L.A., there's an app to issue warnings. That warning did not go out and the reason why is because the estimated intensity of shaking for Los Angeles was intensity three, the app does not kick in until the expected intensity is above for. So as designed, the app performed as it would -- or as it should. The intensity is within the L.A. area was not strong enough to cause any damage."

    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I think it's important to say we're not predicting a particular earthquake, and that seems to be one of the rumors that got going. We are rather saying here is a rate of earthquakes with those lower magnitudes being much more common than the higher magnitudes, but we can estimate the rate of the larger ones from the smaller ones. And the chance of at least another four is close to 100 percent. The chance of at least a five is about 80 percent. The chance of a six is about 20 percent. And a chance it will be above the magnitude of the main shock, i.e. 6.4., is about 9 percent. All of that is a statement about the same rate, you just choose which one you want -- which magnitude level you want to talk about."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "Once -- if it's above magnitude 6.4 we would change the name and we would call the first one a foreshock, all right? But, all of those words, foreshock, main shock, aftershock mean they are part of the same sequence with the main shock being by definition the largest one. So, it would say we're part of the same sequence. And that idea that being bigger really matters, that's sort of a centric -- it's a person's idea rather than a physical idea."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "All right. Asking what people should be doing with alerts and where it's all right to do it. Let's remind ourselves this is not a physical science question. Unfortunately, we often have physical scientist trying to give the answer. When there have been social science experiments on what people do, it's not a clean answer. Giving them more alerts convinces people that the system works and generates trust in it. Lots of false alarm generates distrust. Part of the concern and current early system without complete funding, how many false alarms would we be issuing. So that's a factor that goes into the decision. The other problem, of course, is that -- actually, there's a lot of use to the alerts beyond damage. Nobody in Los Angeles County was damaged. Nowhere close. We didn't get anywhere close to it. We've just all felt it. That does not stop people from being scared from feeling it. And one of the questions is what's the psychological benefit of giving a few seconds warning and knowing that it's coming, and that's a hard thing to measure physically and therefore is a hard one to include in those practical decisions of how you do it. And that -- you know, it becomes a decision -- it becomes a committee decision what's the -- you know, balancing off all of these different things, what's the best way to go?"

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "There are two faults active right now. We don't know for sure what they are, but you can see it from the distribution of the aftershocks. Notice that it's an L-shaped. Those -- you know, faults don't turn corners, that means that we've got two separate faults, the fact that it forms that L."

    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "And until we get reports from the geologist in the field to confirm if there was surface rupture and if we can find that with a particular fault, we're not going to be able to make a definitive statement. So at this point it's just, you know, based on speculation that it maybe that fault. Now obviously, earthquake occurs on faults, so this one is on a fault, having a name is another story. And it appears -- what probably happened here, this --"

      "utterance": "Let me point. You talk in the cameras."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "So let's say were talking about the faults -- there's one that goes northwest and that one goes northeast. The main shock appears to have occurred on the fault and then ruptured to the southwest, so along that faults there. And the motion that we expect on that fault is such that it would release the stress -- or confine stress on that fault to the northwest. So, Lucy can show with her hands -- yes?"

      "utterance": "Right, pull the material away at the top, and that release that secondary fault, which -- you know, in essence, participated in the earthquake, but also showing a lot of activity with the aftershock. Again, until we get the geologist in the field, I can't confirm that, but that's the working hypothesis at this point."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",

A California institute technology seismologist says the quake is the strongest to hit Southern California in 20 years. She says it was preceded by a magnitude 4.3 quake about half-hour earlier. There were no immediate reports of major injuries or damage, at least one house fire was reported in Ridgecrest. Dozens of aftershocks are being reported.
