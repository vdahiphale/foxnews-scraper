And I think that people have been saying for a while, particularly on the right, that if it sounds like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it is a duck, and really that came true today. They are trying to have it both ways where they can proceed on that track while not having all members be all in on a vote and have to hold the line. Obviously, an impeachment vote is different than an inquiry. The beginnings of an inquiry that might become official are different from an actual one. So it's a way to have both feet in two different places. They are under a lot of pressure, rising number of people who support it in their caucus, pressure from the outside. And at the same time I think that they do have a point that there is sort of a new threshold, which is that if Trump defies a court order than they have to proceed with impeachment, at which point that's rational. President Clinton lied under oath, there are certain things you can't do. I don't know that they're all on that song page, but that seems the most rational, one of their new arguments to me. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": In the '90s, it was depends on what the meaning of \"is\" is. Today it depends on what the meaning of \"impeachment\" is. Is impeachment an inquiry, is impeachment an actual process that leads to a vote. One of the congresswomen there in that opening clip said impeachment is not a binary choice. Yes, it is. You either decide you are going to impeach the president or you don't. The Democrats have found themselves in a pickle. I would say that Republicans felt I think a false sense of assurance after Mueller's testimony flopped that this was the end of the impeachment debate. And the fact is Mueller was always a means. The end remained the same all along. It has been the same since Maxine Waters called to impeach 45 one month into his presidency, and that is to remove Donald Trump from office.",

That decision obviously goes against what the Democrats wanted. But for two days at least the Democrats have I think looked terrible. The Mueller inquiry, or the Mueller testimony on Capitol Hill was not just an utter flop because it did not give any further information that would inculcate President Trump, but it was a flop too because it showed huge gaps and it revealed the investigation as even more likely to have been sort of biased and partisan, not looked into things where the Democrats might have been guilty of relations, using information from Russia, et cetera, et cetera. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then today they come out and they're at sixes and sevens, completely mixed on their messages. And one of them, I think it was Raskin who said that impeachment means different things to different people. No, it's one thing. And they don't know what they want to do.

In interviews with third parties she drops bombs on them. She went to AIPAC purposely to single them out as not representative of her caucus in terms of their loyalty to Israel. And she knows this is going to come down the road. Whatever she said privately to have AOC come out and say everything is hunky-dory, and her use of the word \"gracious\" is all intentional. It's not a problem that can be entirely controlled, but I think Nancy Pelosi is smart to take the high road. She's trying to give them a lesson about leadership and followership.

Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Hugo Gurdon, editor in chief of the \"Washington Examiner.\" A.B., to Chad's point, there was a lot of, are we in it, are we doing impeachment, it this really impeachment, is it not.

      "utterance": "Yes. And I think that people have been saying for a while, particularly on the right, that if it sounds like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it is a duck, and really that came true today. They are trying to have it both ways where they can proceed on that track while not having all members be all in on a vote and have to hold the line. Obviously, an impeachment vote is different than an inquiry. The beginnings of an inquiry that might become official are different from an actual one. So it's a way to have both feet in two different places. They are under a lot of pressure, rising number of people who support it in their caucus, pressure from the outside. And at the same time I think that they do have a point that there is sort of a new threshold, which is that if Trump defies a court order than they have to proceed with impeachment, at which point that's rational. President Clinton lied under oath, there are certain things you can't do. I don't know that they're all on that song page, but that seems the most rational, one of their new arguments to me. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": In the '90s, it was depends on what the meaning of \"is\" is. Today it depends on what the meaning of \"impeachment\" is. Is impeachment an inquiry, is impeachment an actual process that leads to a vote. One of the congresswomen there in that opening clip said impeachment is not a binary choice. Yes, it is. You either decide you are going to impeach the president or you don't. The Democrats have found themselves in a pickle. I would say that Republicans felt I think a false sense of assurance after Mueller's testimony flopped that this was the end of the impeachment debate. And the fact is Mueller was always a means. The end remained the same all along. It has been the same since Maxine Waters called to impeach 45 one month into his presidency, and that is to remove Donald Trump from office."

If you had to characterize this week, that's a pretty good week for President Trump. HUGO GURDON, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": It's a very good week for President Trump. That decision obviously goes against what the Democrats wanted. But for two days at least the Democrats have I think looked terrible. The Mueller inquiry, or the Mueller testimony on Capitol Hill was not just an utter flop because it did not give any further information that would inculcate President Trump, but it was a flop too because it showed huge gaps and it revealed the investigation as even more likely to have been sort of biased and partisan, not looked into things where the Democrats might have been guilty of relations, using information from Russia, et cetera, et cetera. And then today they come out and they're at sixes and sevens, completely mixed on their messages. And one of them, I think it was Raskin who said that impeachment means different things to different people. No, it's one thing. And they don't know what they want to do.

She has been incredibly disrespectful to the speaker. I think Nancy Pelosi chooses her tactics wisely. In interviews with third parties she drops bombs on them. She went to AIPAC purposely to single them out as not representative of her caucus in terms of their loyalty to Israel. And she knows this is going to come down the road. Whatever she said privately to have AOC come out and say everything is hunky-dory, and her use of the word \"gracious\" is all intentional. It's not a problem that can be entirely controlled, but I think Nancy Pelosi is smart to take the high road. She's trying to give them a lesson about leadership and followership.

And they are not coming to the table. And they seem to be preparing to ride him out of his term.

When the high school football team at Napa High School found out about it, they came and celebrated his birthday with him. And this picture is so darling I'm about to start crying. My loser is big tech. This has been building for a long time, but if you look at the combination of Warren's efforts to break it up, Senator Hawley's transparency legislation, the DOJ and state attorneys general looking at antitrust actions. The FTC decision broke along party lines, but most of this is very nonpartisan. They waited too late to give something. They have no political safe harbor anymore."

And my loser, Nancy Pelosi. The testimony left the Democrats thinking that they had actually won something. It meant that the impeachment fires will flare and flare again even though she is trying to dampen them down. I don't think there is any hope of those going away now before the election."
