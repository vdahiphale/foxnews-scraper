      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. In March of 1971, a bomb went off inside the U.S. Capitol Building. There was never any question about who did it, a Marxist group called the Weather Underground immediately took responsibility for it even before the explosions. The Weathermen were not ashamed of what they did, they planned to overthrow the U.S. government and they wanted everyone to know it, yet even at the time, many Americans were not aware of this because the media immediately began telling a very different story about what happened. \"The Washington Post\" for example explained that the radical left wasn't actually to blame for the Capitol bombings, instead the culprit was something far more general something called, quote: \"The easy contagion of extremism in a time of dark frustrations and deep disillusionment,\" whatever that means, it probably meant there was a Republican President at the time. The actual bombers meanwhile remained welcome in polite society. Years later, one of them became a quote, \"distinguished professor\" at a supposedly prestigious American university, if you can imagine. Even now, 50 years after the fact, the whitewash of that day continues. POLITICO just ran a long piece telling us that the real villain in the 1971 terror attack on the Capitol was Richard Nixon, who by the way was not there. But according to POLITICO, the bombing quote, \"Supercharged Nixon's paranoia,\" and in the end led to Watergate. The story ends this way, \"Fifty years on, it seems remarkable how fast the 1971 attack faded from collective memory.\" Oh, but is it remarkable? Maybe not so remarkable. Leftists commit violence and the media covers for them? That's something most of us are highly familiar with. It's been happening for a very long time. To this day, there are still a lot of Americans who think a right-winger killed JFK. Of course, the gunman was a person so committed to communism that he actually defected to the Soviet Union, but the media told the public it was a conservative, so many believed them. The point here, the lesson that you should remember is that the first draft of history very often is a lie, and it's not an accidental lie, it's intentional. Partisans understand that history is among other things, a tool and they can use it to accumulate power. So they lie about something to suit their ends, they keep lying about it and before long, their lies are recorded as truth. They're on Wikipedia and your kids believe them. Now, we've watched this happen all this year in real time, we're living through distorted history as we watch the offense of January 6th described by everyone. Here is how the media describe what happened that day that day.",

But because we're literal, let's go through the evidence here. Only one person was killed on January 6th, and that person was an unarmed female protester who was shot in the neck without warning by a Capitol Hill police officer who happens to have a publicly documented history of extreme recklessness. The protesters meanwhile killed no one and yet, they are telling you that those protesters were worse than the Imperial Japanese Army that attacked Pearl Harbor, killed thousands of Americans and led to the Second World War, the biggest war in history. They are also by the way worse than al- Qaeda. So as a talking point, as a political talking point, that seems a little -- how do you say -- over the top, actually kind of insane. But no, it's apt. Everybody argued that what we saw on January 6th was exactly like 9/11, Pearl Harbor, the Civil War, including a guy who writes popular histories for airport bookstores. He assured us that historically speaking, those comparisons are entirely valid. Here's that historian on NBC.",

      "sentences": "They probably would have, therefore they were as bad as people who actually did. Now you look at that and you say, well that guy is stupid and that's fair, by the way, but then you look at 15 other guys just like him saying exactly the same thing and you have to ask yourself, why are they all saying exactly the same thing? Maybe there's a purpose here. And that might lead you to ask, what actually happened? And how can we find out? How do we make up our minds for ourselves? It's clearly a significant day in American History. It's being used to change the country, so maybe we should get to the actual facts of that day, what are they? Well, it turns out the Biden administration didn't want to tell us what they were. They refused to release thousands of hours of surveillance footage taken from within the Capitol on January 6th. Why wouldn't they want us to see that? Well, we're not sure, but we know they really didn't want us to see it. In fact they went to court to keep that footage under seal. In one court document, the Department of Justice argued that releasing that footage from January 6 would -- and we're quoting here -- \"compromise the security of the United States Capitol and those who work there.\" They went on to say that that footage might quote, \"create a visual pathway where other bad actors could use in planning their breach point and pathway for future attacks.\" No word if ISIS-K was involved in those plans or even if ISIS-K in fact exists, but that's not the point. The point is, they can't let you see the video because it's just too dangerous to American National Security. Keep in mind, the Capitol is a public building which technically speaking you own, you've probably been inside because until the other day you were allowed to because it's your country or was. So the idea that you're not allowed to see the inside of the Capitol is insane. The idea that the public has a clear interest in knowing what happened that day is real. So the footage we've seen up to this point shot by journalists and citizens contradicted the official story line. Here for example is the Chewbacca guy wandering around the Senate, this is the dangerous terrorist, this is the al-Qaeda operative. This is the Tojo of January 6th, wandering around the senate chamber looking a lot more like a confused street performer than a dangerous terrorist.",

      "sentences": "So you look at the guy in the Viking horns, the Chewbacca guy and you may reach the obvious conclusion, maybe psilocybin mushrooms aren't good for you, and that's fair. But no honest person could look at that video and decide America is under attack from terrorists. So then you have to ask, is that what the rest of the so-called insurrection look like? Well, now we have an answer because a Federal Judge just rejected the Biden administration's strenuous attempts to hide the surveillance footage from January 6th. So footage was just released. It was obtained by BuzzFeed. It covers 15 minutes on January 6th from 2:25 p.m. to 2:40 p.m. Eastern and those are key moments in the so-called insurrection. Now right now, you're seeing images from a surveillance camera positioned at the entrance to the Senate wing of the Capitol. You don't see people hiding bombs or using bayonets or firing weapons, trying to take over the country in an insurrection. You see people walking around and taking pictures. They don't look like terrorists, they look like tourists, and all of them by the way are Americans. The rest of the footage including shots from surveillance cameras outside the crypt of the Capitol is similar to this. You can look it all up by the way, it's online right now and you should because you will notice that contrary to what the Department of Justice, we're going to have to start putting air quotes around that, contrary to what D.O.J. claimed, none of the footage shows a secret route into the Capitol. Oh, that ISIS-K could use. So why did they keep this from us? Well, here is one theory. You can compare the footage released today was what Democrats showed us during the impeachment hearings earlier this year. Take a look at this. It is surveillance footage showing a squad of people dressed in all black systematically entering the Capitol and kicking open one of the exterior doors on the Senate side. These people appear to be well-trained and coordinated. They're not high in hallucinogenic mushrooms. The question is: who are they? And why don't we know their names? And why aren't they dressed like any of the other people in the footage that was just released? Remember, we were attacked for saying this, but we've already been vindicated for it. We still don't know how many Federal agents were involved in the events that day on January 6th, but we have very good reason to believe from court documents that it's a significant number. And here's one clue. At a recent rally in Washington, the Feds managed to arrest one of their own undercover agents. There were so many Feds at the event that they lost track of each other and arrested one of them. So we ask once again, how many Federal agents were there on January 6th? Why can't we know? What is clear is that once again, this footage reveals the first draft of history was a total lie, an intentional distortion, a mirage created to control you. It was the work of a specific political party. It was the work of the Democratic Party. So, it turns out, the vast majority of people inside the Capitol on January 6 were peaceful. They were not insurrectionists, they shouldn't have been there. They weren't trying to overthrow the government. That's a total crock. And with that in mind, some of the other lies about January 6th start to make more sense. Do you remember this?",

      "sentences": "So here's a rule of thumb going forward if you ever watch television again or read the newspaper, when they are absolutely insistent that you believe something, when they keep beating you over the head with the same talking point again and again and again, beware. There's a reason they're saying when all of them are using exactly the same line, maybe there's a reason for that. Maybe it's coordinated. Maybe they're lying. In this case they were lying. Brian Sicknick was not murdered. There is no evidence of that at all. The Medical Examiner said he died of a stroke. So the reason they told you that was because they wanted to establish a storyline before all the facts were in. That's a common theme for virtually everything that happens in the news right now, you will notice. Something happens, you're not exactly sure what the outline is, you don't know all the facts, nobody does, and all of a sudden they hang a story on it that helps them politically and they ram it down your throat, day after day after day. They used to be called propaganda, now it's so ubiquitous, I don't know what to call it. You remember the lies that you heard again and again about the McCloskeys in St. Louis who were white supremacists, or the Covington kids who were, of course, also white supremacists. Remember how they claimed that George Floyd was choked to death even though an autopsy showed he was not choked to death and he had a fatal level of fentanyl in his system and zero signs of suffocation? That's what it said. We're not making that up. What medical reports don't matter anymore? That's true. Remember what they said about how the laptop showed that Hunter Biden was selling access to his father for years, but no it wasn't real?",

If that's true, that's very serious. You'll remember that Hillary Clinton had Muammar Gaddafi, the head of Libya killed for reasons nobody ever explained, completely destroyed the country and the lives of people who live there, and then money from the Treasury was impounded. If Hunter Biden was actually lobbying the U.S. government while his dad was Vice President to get that money, that's a very big deal, it's probably a crime. Meanwhile, Ben Schreckinger of POLITICO is out with a book that confirms that Hunter Biden's laptop is not fake, it's not Russian disinformation, the laptop contains evidence that the Biden family was in fact selling access to Joe Biden to entities in China and Ukraine, and many other countries. A year ago, POLITICO reported that the Intelligence Community thought the laptop was quote, \"Russian disinformation.\" Why are they telling us this now? Not that we ever believe their lies. Glenn Greenwald is an independent journalist, very independent. He writes on \"Substack.\" He joins us tonight. So Glenn, I mean, I don't think you're shocked by this, but you do have to ask it. Why are they telling us this now?",

You would know his name, he'd be a household name, he'd be on every TV show. But because his reporting that said the opposite, he found even more proof that all those e-mails were authentic, which meant that these media outlets, all of them pretty much, with a few exceptions deliberately lied to the public in the weeks before the election by telling them that this was Russian disinformation when they knew it wasn't true.

I got COVID despite the vaccine or I got COVID, I didn't have the vaccine but what do I do now? What treatments do you have? What are your answers? And there are actually many. First of all aspirin was just studied at George Washington University and aspirin alone, a simple aspirin decreases your risk of going on a ventilator or ever getting that far by 50 percent. Vitamin D was studied in Scotland and in Ireland, and Tucker, vitamin D and sunlight decreases your risk of getting very sick from COVID. That's another one. We talked about remdesivir on this show last February and now it turns out new data, if you get remdesivir, the antiviral very early on, the chances of you going into the hospital goes down by 87 percent and we've been talking a lot about those monoclonal antibodies that we're using it a lot in the south right now. Lilly, Regeneron, if you get that early, your chances of ever getting hospitalized decrease by 70 percent. All of this, you can have right now. Coming down the pike, Tucker, even more exciting drugs. You've got Merck working on a drug named molnupiravir, that drug stops the virus in its tracks, stops it from replicating. It looks like that's going to be out before the end of the year. That's going to be the Tamiflu that we are going to use for this COVID. And Pfizer has another drug that's very similar to what we already use for HIV. That looks very, very effective.

Earlier this month, a judge in Los Angeles County issued a second arrest warrant because Merager missed a court date for another felony indecent exposure case that is open right now. I've been able to find out some additional details about the two current open criminal cases into Merager. So one is the Wi Spa, the other is an incident that allegedly happened in late 2018 in West Hollywood at a swimming pool locker room, and the alleged victims involved children that are as young as 10 years old.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. In March of 1971, a bomb went off inside the U.S. Capitol Building. There was never any question about who did it, a Marxist group called the Weather Underground immediately took responsibility for it even before the explosions. The Weathermen were not ashamed of what they did, they planned to overthrow the U.S. government and they wanted everyone to know it, yet even at the time, many Americans were not aware of this because the media immediately began telling a very different story about what happened. \"The Washington Post\" for example explained that the radical left wasn't actually to blame for the Capitol bombings, instead the culprit was something far more general something called, quote: \"The easy contagion of extremism in a time of dark frustrations and deep disillusionment,\" whatever that means, it probably meant there was a Republican President at the time. The actual bombers meanwhile remained welcome in polite society. Years later, one of them became a quote, \"distinguished professor\" at a supposedly prestigious American university, if you can imagine. Even now, 50 years after the fact, the whitewash of that day continues. POLITICO just ran a long piece telling us that the real villain in the 1971 terror attack on the Capitol was Richard Nixon, who by the way was not there. But according to POLITICO, the bombing quote, \"Supercharged Nixon's paranoia,\" and in the end led to Watergate. The story ends this way, \"Fifty years on, it seems remarkable how fast the 1971 attack faded from collective memory.\" Oh, but is it remarkable? Maybe not so remarkable. Leftists commit violence and the media covers for them? That's something most of us are highly familiar with. It's been happening for a very long time. To this day, there are still a lot of Americans who think a right-winger killed JFK. Of course, the gunman was a person so committed to communism that he actually defected to the Soviet Union, but the media told the public it was a conservative, so many believed them. The point here, the lesson that you should remember is that the first draft of history very often is a lie, and it's not an accidental lie, it's intentional. Partisans understand that history is among other things, a tool and they can use it to accumulate power. So they lie about something to suit their ends, they keep lying about it and before long, their lies are recorded as truth. They're on Wikipedia and your kids believe them. Now, we've watched this happen all this year in real time, we're living through distorted history as we watch the offense of January 6th described by everyone. Here is how the media describe what happened that day that day."

But because we're literal, let's go through the evidence here. Only one person was killed on January 6th, and that person was an unarmed female protester who was shot in the neck without warning by a Capitol Hill police officer who happens to have a publicly documented history of extreme recklessness. The protesters meanwhile killed no one and yet, they are telling you that those protesters were worse than the Imperial Japanese Army that attacked Pearl Harbor, killed thousands of Americans and led to the Second World War, the biggest war in history. They are also by the way worse than al- Qaeda. So as a talking point, as a political talking point, that seems a little -- how do you say -- over the top, actually kind of insane. But no, it's apt. Everybody argued that what we saw on January 6th was exactly like 9/11, Pearl Harbor, the Civil War, including a guy who writes popular histories for airport bookstores. He assured us that historically speaking, those comparisons are entirely valid. Here's that historian on NBC."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "They probably would have, therefore they were as bad as people who actually did. Now you look at that and you say, well that guy is stupid and that's fair, by the way, but then you look at 15 other guys just like him saying exactly the same thing and you have to ask yourself, why are they all saying exactly the same thing? Maybe there's a purpose here. And that might lead you to ask, what actually happened? And how can we find out? How do we make up our minds for ourselves? It's clearly a significant day in American History. It's being used to change the country, so maybe we should get to the actual facts of that day, what are they? Well, it turns out the Biden administration didn't want to tell us what they were. They refused to release thousands of hours of surveillance footage taken from within the Capitol on January 6th. Why wouldn't they want us to see that? Well, we're not sure, but we know they really didn't want us to see it. In fact they went to court to keep that footage under seal. In one court document, the Department of Justice argued that releasing that footage from January 6 would -- and we're quoting here -- \"compromise the security of the United States Capitol and those who work there.\" They went on to say that that footage might quote, \"create a visual pathway where other bad actors could use in planning their breach point and pathway for future attacks.\" No word if ISIS-K was involved in those plans or even if ISIS-K in fact exists, but that's not the point. The point is, they can't let you see the video because it's just too dangerous to American National Security. Keep in mind, the Capitol is a public building which technically speaking you own, you've probably been inside because until the other day you were allowed to because it's your country or was. So the idea that you're not allowed to see the inside of the Capitol is insane. The idea that the public has a clear interest in knowing what happened that day is real. So the footage we've seen up to this point shot by journalists and citizens contradicted the official story line. Here for example is the Chewbacca guy wandering around the Senate, this is the dangerous terrorist, this is the al-Qaeda operative. This is the Tojo of January 6th, wandering around the senate chamber looking a lot more like a confused street performer than a dangerous terrorist."

But no honest person could look at that video and decide America is under attack from terrorists. So then you have to ask, is that what the rest of the so-called insurrection look like? Well, now we have an answer because a Federal Judge just rejected the Biden administration's strenuous attempts to hide the surveillance footage from January 6th. So footage was just released. It was obtained by BuzzFeed. It covers 15 minutes on January 6th from 2:25 p.m. to 2:40 p.m. Eastern and those are key moments in the so-called insurrection. Now right now, you're seeing images from a surveillance camera positioned at the entrance to the Senate wing of the Capitol. You don't see people hiding bombs or using bayonets or firing weapons, trying to take over the country in an insurrection. You see people walking around and taking pictures. They don't look like terrorists, they look like tourists, and all of them by the way are Americans. The rest of the footage including shots from surveillance cameras outside the crypt of the Capitol is similar to this. You can look it all up by the way, it's online right now and you should because you will notice that contrary to what the Department of Justice, we're going to have to start putting air quotes around that, contrary to what D.O.J. claimed, none of the footage shows a secret route into the Capitol. Oh, that ISIS-K could use. So why did they keep this from us? Well, here is one theory. You can compare the footage released today was what Democrats showed us during the impeachment hearings earlier this year. Take a look at this. It is surveillance footage showing a squad of people dressed in all black systematically entering the Capitol and kicking open one of the exterior doors on the Senate side. These people appear to be well-trained and coordinated. They're not high in hallucinogenic mushrooms."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "The question is",
      "utterance": "who are they? And why don't we know their names? And why aren't they dressed like any of the other people in the footage that was just released? Remember, we were attacked for saying this, but we've already been vindicated for it. We still don't know how many Federal agents were involved in the events that day on January 6th, but we have very good reason to believe from court documents that it's a significant number. And here's one clue. At a recent rally in Washington, the Feds managed to arrest one of their own undercover agents. There were so many Feds at the event that they lost track of each other and arrested one of them. So we ask once again, how many Federal agents were there on January 6th? Why can't we know? What is clear is that once again, this footage reveals the first draft of history was a total lie, an intentional distortion, a mirage created to control you. It was the work of a specific political party. It was the work of the Democratic Party. So, it turns out, the vast majority of people inside the Capitol on January 6 were peaceful. They were not insurrectionists, they shouldn't have been there. They weren't trying to overthrow the government. That's a total crock. And with that in mind, some of the other lies about January 6th start to make more sense. Do you remember this?"

      "utterance": "So here's a rule of thumb going forward if you ever watch television again or read the newspaper, when they are absolutely insistent that you believe something, when they keep beating you over the head with the same talking point again and again and again, beware. There's a reason they're saying when all of them are using exactly the same line, maybe there's a reason for that. Maybe it's coordinated. Maybe they're lying. In this case they were lying. Brian Sicknick was not murdered. There is no evidence of that at all. The Medical Examiner said he died of a stroke. So the reason they told you that was because they wanted to establish a storyline before all the facts were in. That's a common theme for virtually everything that happens in the news right now, you will notice. Something happens, you're not exactly sure what the outline is, you don't know all the facts, nobody does, and all of a sudden they hang a story on it that helps them politically and they ram it down your throat, day after day after day. They used to be called propaganda, now it's so ubiquitous, I don't know what to call it. You remember the lies that you heard again and again about the McCloskeys in St. Louis who were white supremacists, or the Covington kids who were, of course, also white supremacists. Remember how they claimed that George Floyd was choked to death even though an autopsy showed he was not choked to death and he had a fatal level of fentanyl in his system and zero signs of suffocation? That's what it said. We're not making that up. What medical reports don't matter anymore? That's true. Remember what they said about how the laptop showed that Hunter Biden was selling access to his father for years, but no it wasn't real?"

They have been lying left and right, front and center from the very beginning and they have no shame. The idea they had to lock down these tapes because of National Security -- are you kidding me, Tucker -- it's not National Security, it's fake news security, right? They have their propaganda arm. They have their MSNBC, they have their CNN, and they want to make sure that the American people believe the constant effort to psychologically brainwash the American people by saying, don't worry about seeing anything, we're going to tell you what happened in there. And you know what? It's sick that they said that this was akin to Pearl Harbor, this is akin to 9/11. How insulting to the victims that actually endured those real tragedies? I mean, there's no limit that they won't go. There is no limit that they won't go through. It's so extreme this rhetoric, and I also want to say this. Looking beyond this entire situation, the most embarrassing thing is that they're not thinking about internationally how embarrassing this looks for the American people. Think about when Vladimir Putin sat down with MSNBC and they said to him, look what you do to political dissidents? And he basically laughed in their face and said, look at what you do your political dissidence. He brought up January 6th, and you know what? Vladimir Putin was right.

Social justice, they're allowed to do whatever they want even the middle of a pandemic. And then you have these people which essentially, it was a grandma selfie party. Once they got into the Capitol Building, it was a grandma selfie party. There were American flags. They were wandering around aimlessly and they left. And you know what?

Well, a business insider reporting today that when Joe Biden was the Vice President, Hunter Biden sought a retainer of $2 million a year to help quote, \"unfreeze\" money that belonged to the Libyan government. If that's true, that's very serious. You'll remember that Hillary Clinton had Muammar Gaddafi, the head of Libya killed for reasons nobody ever explained, completely destroyed the country and the lives of people who live there, and then money from the Treasury was impounded. If Hunter Biden was actually lobbying the U.S. government while his dad was Vice President to get that money, that's a very big deal, it's probably a crime. Meanwhile, Ben Schreckinger of POLITICO is out with a book that confirms that Hunter Biden's laptop is not fake, it's not Russian disinformation, the laptop contains evidence that the Biden family was in fact selling access to Joe Biden to entities in China and Ukraine, and many other countries. A year ago, POLITICO reported that the Intelligence Community thought the laptop was quote, \"Russian disinformation.\" Why are they telling us this now? Not that we ever believe their lies.

And they know that even if they lie and get caught lying, their audience and readers don't care. In fact, like them even more, because they believe they're on the right side. So you have huge number of journalists who believe that, they have the right to lie and even when they get caught, they don't care because they know their audience won't hold it against them."

We should not be importing people who bite. Period. That's got to be a deal killer. Is it in the Constitution? No. Is it in a Federal law? No. But it's commonsense. If you bite, you can't come here. Meanwhile, other migrants have commandeered a D.H.S. bus. The mayor of one border town has a solution to all these problems. He is living with the effects, he joins us next."

The White House conceded today that it has no idea where they are, where they went. We should just pause and note that this is not a disaster, it's not a crisis, this is criminal behavior. This is the executive branch of government intentionally subverting Federal law, encouraging the breaking of American law, abetting crimes. This is criminal behavior. And the White House is doing nothing about it because they caused it. They did just announce the Border Patrol is now prohibited from using horses at the border because the real crime is against the people trying to break into our country, not against the country itself. Notice all of our time has been spent concerned about the people trying to break our laws and none of the time in the national media or even in our national political conversations in either party has been devoted to the Americans who are suffering because of this, which is all 340 million of us, but it is particularly the Americans who live in South Texas, towns like Uvalde. Don McLaughlin is the mayor of Uvalde, Texas he joins us tonight for an update on how things are going. Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for coming on. How are things going?"

The foot traffic has increased tenfold. The human smuggling has increased tenfold. There are no Border Patrol agents available. They're all down at Del Rio processing Haitians. It is just getting crazier and crazier and crazier and these peaceful immigrants, illegal immigrants they keep talking about are getting more and more aggressive with landowners. They're doing more destruction to property. They're tearing things up, trashing ranch houses, trashing vehicles, and you know you can complain all you want, but this administration turns a blind eye to it.

We know that because several late night TV hosts just gathered together for a special event. They renounced comedy and decided on a new direction --- propaganda. Matt Walsh was watching. He's got a review for us straight ahead. Also right no on tuckercarlson.com, you can get the new book, if you like. We'll be right back."

But the rules have changed. Now, if you have a late night TV show, your job is to provide wooden corporate propaganda at full force. Beat people over the head with talking points until they submit. That's what they're doing. Last night, seven late night hosts gathered for a special climate -- on climate. Can you imagine how fun that was? And how honest. Here are some of it."

The pandemic, systemic racism, income inequality, immigration, gun violence. But here's the thing, if we don't address climate change, none of those issues will matter at all. The car is going off a cliff and we're fiddling with the radio. We are way past climate denial."

      "utterance": "Wait a second, if someone forces you to do something, it's not really a choice, is it? You can't make someone make the right choices. That doesn't even make sense. If you make someone do something, it's a command. That person is your slave. You own that person. No choice involved. Not to be pedantic. Matt Walsh hosts \"The Matt Walsh Show.\" He joins us now. Did you watch this thing? MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": ... for climate change to be honest. I mean, it was -- I'm ready for the ice caps to just melt. I'm sorry if the polar bears are collateral damage, but it's just -- I watch these things and I wonder first of all, who is watching late night TV on a regular basis? I watched the clip of Seth Meyers. Who is watching Seth Meyers on purpose? I have to assume his entire audience is like alcoholics who passed out on the couch because I've seen boiled cabbage that's funnier than him. But what we know -- and I thought that from Colbert was interesting there, I'm not going to give him any credit, but at least he is admitting his hypocrisy and cowardice because all of these people, it's just like COVID, all of these people who are telling us to be scared of this and paranoid about it and to make changes, they're not that scared and they're not making any changes at all to their own lives. I mean, they are still doing shows. They are blaring the lights, they're having celebrities come out on jets to sit on the couch and have conversations with them, burning all that jet fuel. They are not -- they refuse to make any changes whatsoever and here is the thing, I'm not making any changes because of climate change, but that's because I don't believe what they're telling me. I don't believe it, okay. So, if I'm wrong then, I'm just wrong, but if you really believe that the world is going to end if we don't make a change and you refuse to make a change yourself, then you're like a mass murderer, you're a sociopath on top of being a hypocrite."

I mean like, if in 2018 all the networks got together to do a special on how we need to build a border wall and Mexico has to pay for it, you'd be like wow, that's a little bit like government TV at that point, right?

I think the death of comedy is something they should also be worried about especially with late-night TV. That is actually a real problem. We actually need comedy in a society and it's important to have comedians who are going to hold the people in power to account and are going to sort of make fun of the sacred cows. That is actually an important service, but these people are refusing to do it."

But that is effectively the truth for a lot of people in this country. There are treatments for COVID you can get early so maybe you won't wind up on a ventilator and die. No one wants to talk about those for some reason, but we do. We'll tell you what we found, next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So if you get your medical news from cable news, you might have reached the conclusion the only two ways to respond to COVID are get the vaccine or go on a ventilator, but there should be other options, right? Well in fact, there is new evidence that several drugs and drug combinations might effectively treat COVID before you wind up on a ventilator. For some reason, you're not allowed to talk about this. That's a separate conversation, but what is that? In any case, Marc Siegel is a FOX News medical contributor who has been on this stuff since the very first day, since March of 2020. He joins us now to give us the latest. Dr. Siegel, thanks for coming on."

      "utterance": "Hi, Tucker. As you know, I'm a big proponent of the vaccine, but I get questions every day from my patients and around the country. I got COVID despite the vaccine or I got COVID, I didn't have the vaccine but what do I do now? What treatments do you have? What are your answers? And there are actually many. First of all aspirin was just studied at George Washington University and aspirin alone, a simple aspirin decreases your risk of going on a ventilator or ever getting that far by 50 percent. Vitamin D was studied in Scotland and in Ireland, and Tucker, vitamin D and sunlight decreases your risk of getting very sick from COVID. That's another one. We talked about remdesivir on this show last February and now it turns out new data, if you get remdesivir, the antiviral very early on, the chances of you going into the hospital goes down by 87 percent and we've been talking a lot about those monoclonal antibodies that we're using it a lot in the south right now. Lilly, Regeneron, if you get that early, your chances of ever getting hospitalized decrease by 70 percent. All of this, you can have right now. Coming down the pike, Tucker, even more exciting drugs. You've got Merck working on a drug named molnupiravir, that drug stops the virus in its tracks, stops it from replicating. It looks like that's going to be out before the end of the year. That's going to be the Tamiflu that we are going to use for this COVID. And Pfizer has another drug that's very similar to what we already use for HIV. That looks very, very effective. So I'm saying to myself, wait a minute, I thought this pandemic was all about politics, right? Politics this, mask mandates, mandates, so I talked to the top medical historian I know in the world and I said how will this pandemic be remembered, Tucker? And he said, this pandemic will be remembered for what we learned in the field of science -- Tucker."

So this is a massive threat for the people telling lies on this subject, including \"Slate.\" So all people like that dismiss this incidence as a hoax, but it turns out it was not a hoax. Andy Ngo actually did some reporting on this. He confirmed it's absolutely real, and tonight he has new details on the case to share with us. Andy Ngo is a journalist. He's the author of \"Unmasked: Inside Antifa's Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy,\" and we're happy to have him tonight. Andy, thanks so much for coming on. So this story just kind of keeps going. Where is it now? ANDY NGO, JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR, \"UNMASKED\": Yes, the latest development is that the suspect in the Wi Spa incident, that is Darren Merager is now a fugitive. Earlier this month, a judge in Los Angeles County issued a second arrest warrant because Merager missed a court date for another felony indecent exposure case that is open right now. I've been able to find out some additional details about the two current open criminal cases into Merager. So one is the Wi Spa, the other is an incident that allegedly happened in late 2018 in West Hollywood at a swimming pool locker room, and the alleged victims involved children that are as young as 10 years old."

And I interviewed Merager again and she maintains her innocence and she says that she has not had any sex reassignment surgery and that her large appendage is being mistaken by other people for an erection. I also found out the details in the 2003 felony indecent exposure conviction that led to Merager being a mandated registered sex offender in the State of California. The details of that is, she was convicted over masturbating at the window of the home of an elderly woman in Southern California."
