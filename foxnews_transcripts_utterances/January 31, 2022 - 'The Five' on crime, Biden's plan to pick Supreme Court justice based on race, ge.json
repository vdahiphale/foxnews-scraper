Well, I'm talking about the consequences of the Democrat liberal progressive leftists soft on crime criminal loving victim hating group that has made a decision that no bail, no jail and the criminals are -- they should be privileged and that social justice and growth prosecutors should not be a part of the criminal justice system. And Jen, you are so locked up in your ivory tower that you have no idea what Americans really care about and what they are concerned about. The truth is that the killing of innocents who didn't deserve it, they didn't ask for it, they did nothing but get in the way of a murderer, very often out on your bail policies, and that murderer and that god decides that they should die. And now you and your own refuse to even recognize what you've done just as we mentioned, the crime wave from 2019 to 2021 is 44 percent up in terms of homicides in major American cities, but Joe Biden ignored all this. joe Biden ignored the looting, the burning, the rioting and he ignored the burning of a federal courthouse and police precincts. And now, now he wants to come to New York. He wants to come to New York because he wants to get funding the local cops? Well, why didn't they do that when they were defunding, demoralizing, and denigrating cops? Why now? Could it be because this is an election year? A midterm year? And why not increase funding when the cops really needed it? You people don't stand up for law and order, we do, and you ought to think about one thing. You ought to think about the fact that Fox quadruples all the pals all of those networks that you identified that were talking about important things that I wasn't. Here's the bottom line, we quadrupled them because we talk about things in Americans care about and maybe you and your friends ought to take a temperature of what Americans care about and talk about it.",

I think in some ways the bitter irony is that the deaths of officers or detective Rivera and Mora refocus people on cops and the jobs they do. It kind of sobered people up and they said, my God, what have I been thinking as the precincts burn and as, you know, the other government buildings were trashed? I really do believe that maybe this is a turning point. I think that Biden coming here, rather than mocking it, let him come, let him get the vibe from the NYPD. They could it be that as with De Blasio the cops would turn their back on the president of the United States? I hope it doesn't come to that. I really, I urge you not to do it. I want you to be gracious to him, not that I'm talking, I'm not lecturing you, but you know what I mean, he is the president of the United States, so let him come and let them hear you. Let him hear you that we -- you cannot have a criminal justice system that does not prosecute with special circumstance. If there were two criminals go into a building, one is a gang member and the other isn't, one has a gun and the others doesn't, those are different crimes, we have to recognize that.

      "sentences": "Well, one thing I noticed about the Psaki stuff is, because I'm an expert in sarcasm, when you don't have an answer and you know that you are wrong, you use sarcasm. Because that is how you do it. You got, stop. I mean, she basically was a tweet, her response was a tweet to actual facts, so she did it sarcastically. It's weird, because we live in a free country with free speech and we feel like we know and we see everything, even including with our own eyes. We will see things and people will meet with your sarcasm. It's really kind of a new thing. Like you talk about crime stats, they laugh. You talk about stories about the mother whose child was killed, they laugh. They say I went out and had dinner, that's what they said on CNN last year. Even when you show the border visuals like in a totally different issue, they choose to ignore it. Gavin Newsom not wearing a mask. All of these things rely on the fact that even though you see it with your own eyes, you can't get any traction, and why can't you get any traction? Because the so- called free speech, the free press, they don't do crap about it. That's their side. So, we can sit here in our bubble and talk about this forever, and she can sit in our tiny bubble and laugh at it. And then what they do is the trick is that they turn left-wing politics into context. There are only three variables in that equation about the widow, felon out on bond, victim, murder. That's the three variables. But then what you do is you layer on the context, right? Cash bail is proof of inequality. Only rich people can afford bail so it's wrong. Long sentences discriminate, COVID is inhumane in prisons, we have to let them out, overcrowding is inhumane. So, what that does, is that it creates the so-called context which is actually just political ideology and then that allows these felons to get out. And the intellectual talking heads suddenly, like Jen Psaki forget about these variables. They forget about the victim, they forget about the fiend out on bail because they are so drowned in their context, their fake context, it's just political B.S. and it's probably the largest cover your ass strategy, because the politicians and the media know that they are responsible for this new pro-crime climate and this is their only way out.",

So, Michelle Childs who is one of the possibilities who apparently Congressman Clyburn likes and Senator Graham said very positive things about this weekend, she went to public school. She didn't go to the Ivy Leagues. And that's the kind of diversity that I could really get behind. I would also just like to take a quick trip down memory lane. If Democrats really wanted to see a Black woman elevated to the Supreme Court, why did they block Janice Rogers Brown back during the Bush administration? And I will never forget it, because anonymously they told the papers, the news -- the papers, that's what we used to call the media, that it was because they didn't want the Republicans to have a shot at nominating the first woman, Black woman to the Supreme Court.

Judge, the Democrats had a good thing going for a while with the control over the public school system. We didn't know what was going on. And they were indoctrinated all the way to the top. Now, all of a sudden, the pandemic hits, we look under the rock, and they're like covering up rapes, teaching kids to hate each other, embezzling money. So, the parents come in and say, timeout, timeout, we're not going for this. And I don't think they were prepared for the pushback, because parents have never pushed back. No one has ever pushed back on schooling like that. So, they just do the only counterpunch they knew how to throw which is your racist. And that may work during the Trump era. That may work on certain Republican politicians. But you can't call millions of American parents racist. And so, they started this fire, and they just can't put it out right now.",

When it comes to masks, I read a story today that was so upsetting. This 7- year-old -- you know how kids sent home a little sample of their homework and their parents can take a look. Well, a 7-year-old, one of the assignments was draw a picture of yourself. And the kid drew a picture of himself with just eyes, no nose or mouth.

Well, I'm talking about the consequences of the Democrat liberal progressive leftists soft on crime criminal loving victim hating group that has made a decision that no bail, no jail and the criminals are -- they should be privileged and that social justice and growth prosecutors should not be a part of the criminal justice system. And Jen, you are so locked up in your ivory tower that you have no idea what Americans really care about and what they are concerned about. The truth is that the killing of innocents who didn't deserve it, they didn't ask for it, they did nothing but get in the way of a murderer, very often out on your bail policies, and that murderer and that god decides that they should die. And now you and your own refuse to even recognize what you've done just as we mentioned, the crime wave from 2019 to 2021 is 44 percent up in terms of homicides in major American cities, but Joe Biden ignored all this. joe Biden ignored the looting, the burning, the rioting and he ignored the burning of a federal courthouse and police precincts. And now, now he wants to come to New York. He wants to come to New York because he wants to get funding the local cops? Well, why didn't they do that when they were defunding, demoralizing, and denigrating cops? Why now? Could it be because this is an election year? A midterm year? And why not increase funding when the cops really needed it? You people don't stand up for law and order, we do, and you ought to think about one thing. You ought to think about the fact that Fox quadruples all the pals all of those networks that you identified that were talking about important things that I wasn't. Here's the bottom line, we quadrupled them because we talk about things in Americans care about and maybe you and your friends ought to take a temperature of what Americans care about and talk about it."

Here we have people dying, with murderers on the increase in the way that causes great, great disquiet in this country. There is -- the cops are demoralized from coast-to-coast. They are demoralized. I think in some ways the bitter irony is that the deaths of officers or detective Rivera and Mora refocus people on cops and the jobs they do. It kind of sobered people up and they said, my God, what have I been thinking as the precincts burn and as, you know, the other government buildings were trashed? I really do believe that maybe this is a turning point. I think that Biden coming here, rather than mocking it, let him come, let him get the vibe from the NYPD. They could it be that as with De Blasio the cops would turn their back on the president of the United States? I hope it doesn't come to that. I really, I urge you not to do it. I want you to be gracious to him, not that I'm talking, I'm not lecturing you, but you know what I mean, he is the president of the United States, so let him come and let them hear you. Let him hear you that we -- you cannot have a criminal justice system that does not prosecute with special circumstance. If there were two criminals go into a building, one is a gang member and the other isn't, one has a gun and the others doesn't, those are different crimes, we have to recognize that. We have to understand that we have to punish commensurate with the duty to make the street safer. That is the biggest most important job of government is keeping the citizens safe."

So, this is happening everywhere, and it could have just as easily been my -- I could've been the one talking when Jen Psaki looked up, right, because we talk about this a lot. And you don't get to 81 percent of Americans saying they are concerned about crime, just because people are watching Fox. That actually that doesn't happen.

Because you heard that young widow on Friday in her closing statement, she said I hope that the new district attorney is listening to you through me. And she named him, so everybody is putting this together. It's not just on Fox News. It's also happening at the border patrol. It's the same -- and it's the same issue, right?

      "utterance": "Well, one thing I noticed about the Psaki stuff is, because I'm an expert in sarcasm, when you don't have an answer and you know that you are wrong, you use sarcasm. Because that is how you do it. You got, stop. I mean, she basically was a tweet, her response was a tweet to actual facts, so she did it sarcastically. It's weird, because we live in a free country with free speech and we feel like we know and we see everything, even including with our own eyes. We will see things and people will meet with your sarcasm. It's really kind of a new thing. Like you talk about crime stats, they laugh. You talk about stories about the mother whose child was killed, they laugh. They say I went out and had dinner, that's what they said on CNN last year. Even when you show the border visuals like in a totally different issue, they choose to ignore it. Gavin Newsom not wearing a mask. All of these things rely on the fact that even though you see it with your own eyes, you can't get any traction, and why can't you get any traction? Because the so- called free speech, the free press, they don't do crap about it. That's their side. So, we can sit here in our bubble and talk about this forever, and she can sit in our tiny bubble and laugh at it. And then what they do is the trick is that they turn left-wing politics into context. There are only three variables in that equation about the widow, felon out on bond, victim, murder. That's the three variables. But then what you do is you layer on the context, right? Cash bail is proof of inequality. Only rich people can afford bail so it's wrong. Long sentences discriminate, COVID is inhumane in prisons, we have to let them out, overcrowding is inhumane. So, what that does, is that it creates the so-called context which is actually just political ideology and then that allows these felons to get out. And the intellectual talking heads suddenly, like Jen Psaki forget about these variables. They forget about the victim, they forget about the fiend out on bail because they are so drowned in their context, their fake context, it's just political B.S. and it's probably the largest cover your ass strategy, because the politicians and the media know that they are responsible for this new pro-crime climate and this is their only way out."

I mean, they are literally dead. I mean, they doubled their ratings when they watch their own shows. That's how bad it is. So, we don't -- we don't have to slump for ratings. We don't to divide a country to slump for ratings the way CNN does. But the Dems and the media will make this about equality, equity, history, bigotry, misogyny, all the e's, but it's not about that, it's about politics. You -- the design here is to serve up a nonwhite, nonmale selection to buffer against any or all criticism. Right? They want the theater is designed so that the critic, let's say I'm the critic or Jesse or Dana is the critic, thinks twice about engaging any kind of negativity, because you know that you will be called misogynistic or you will be called racist. So that is -- it's all a force field. This has always been a force field, do not be fooled that they are playing tolerance, because they don't care about any nonwhite person if they don't kneel before their ideology. They will destroy you. They will destroy you. So do not believe it's about tolerance or race, this is about creating a s a buffer zone."

There's -- there's a lot of brilliant people out there that could be considered. And one of the things that's really interesting is the diversity angle, I like this idea, the diversity of thought. So, Michelle Childs who is one of the possibilities who apparently Congressman Clyburn likes and Senator Graham said very positive things about this weekend, she went to public school. She didn't go to the Ivy Leagues. And that's the kind of diversity that I could really get behind. I would also just like to take a quick trip down memory lane. If Democrats really wanted to see a Black woman elevated to the Supreme Court, why did they block Janice Rogers Brown back during the Bush administration? And I will never forget it, because anonymously they told the papers, the news -- the papers, that's what we used to call the media, that it was because they didn't want the Republicans to have a shot at nominating the first woman, Black woman to the Supreme Court.

And then the media goes crazy because of the glass ceiling, and they love it and everyone is like wow. Then now, it looks like he got cornered by Clyburn to get the primary vote. I mean, whoever gets nominated is going to be -- it's the result of a back room racial deal that was cut so a white Democrat could win the nomination, that's the truth. I mean, and you are over seasoning the identity politics of this. Right? It shouldn't be what it is about.

So, it's very interesting that this identity politics, I mean, who is it for when there is only a quarter of people of color who want a Black female? And I also think that Tulsi Gabbard said it best when she said the last time, he said he's going to pick someone based on a color and sex, i.e., vice president, he picked Kamala Harris and that was a disaster.

They're three hours long. So, even a fan, I'm a fan, I don't watch 70 percent of it. So, these people are freaking hypocrites pretending, pretending that they know or somehow heard something. If they actually watched one of his podcasts, even if he's wrong, they would see the context is -- like, he's all over the place. He's known -- he's doing an incredible service.

So, the parents come in and say, timeout, timeout, we're not going for this. And I don't think they were prepared for the pushback, because parents have never pushed back. No one has ever pushed back on schooling like that. So, they just do the only counterpunch they knew how to throw which is your racist. And that may work during the Trump era.

Well, a 7-year-old, one of the assignments was draw a picture of yourself. And the kid drew a picture of himself with just eyes, no nose or mouth.
