      "sentences": "Yes, because if there's one thing missing in our educational system, it's America's history of racism. Yes. And what's missing in the strip club is the smell of desperation. And baby powder. It is funny though, how could someone named Joy Reid be so joyless and not reid. There are countless articles out there on CRT and how often it's being taught in schools. So Joyce, Tiffany said the same thing, like people who plan to lie often will. It's like MSNBC have only one brain in the freezer and in the handoff, they must have dropped it numerous times. But what if they're right? In fact, there are lots of voters who are OK with white supremacy. It says that they vote Democrat. And not just because they supported Governor Northam who either wore blackface or a Klan hood. He never did tell us which. Either way no white sheets after Labor Day, Ralph. It's OK to laugh at that. OK. Don't laugh. But the most fluent places in America are Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun counties, which are all in Virginia. Their people make six figures or even seven figures. They're the kind of folks who can afford Hunter Biden's artwork and drug habit. And they vote Democrat overwhelmingly, knowing that only leads to paying much higher taxes. As the New York Times points out, affluent suburbs went bluer than a Smurf choking on a marble. They didn't say that, I did. But McAuliffe won 77 percent of the vote in Arlington. So these are voters who know they're going to pay way more under a Democrat but they do it anyway. Whether it's in taxes at the gas pump or buying medical devices online. FYI, catheters come in handy when you can't make it to the bathroom. Trust me. So well, pocketbook issues matter to blacks they don't matter to these rich, white liberal racist. Ask yourself, if you vote a Republican, are you just trying to save some money so you can fill your tank with gas? Or are you racist? Maybe everyone who drives is racist. But the rich white liberal racist can afford stuff like climate change spending, defunding the cops, unregulated immigration, COVID lock downs and no cash bail. But no one else really can. Just ask Minneapolis where a majority of blacks just voted against replacing the police department. Getting rid of the police is a popular idea with white college kids in safe neighborhoods, but not so much with people who might be murdered. See, unlike working class blacks, rich, white, liberal, racist, they can handle it. When you're white and rich you can vote for anything that will destroy an urban area faster than a case of Whippets on Kat's brain cells. You can raise taxes on the white liberal racist, they can handle it, you can defend the police, they can handle it. They're in gated communities and can afford private security and it's OK if their security has guns. Immigration, they love the cheap labor, it takes care of their hedges. And it really only affects border states, right? COVID lock downs are fine. They have enough cash tucked away to endure a few years watching The View in their underpants. Or they have government jobs where they're used to doing nothing. No cash bail. They love that virtue signal. Look how it empties evil prisons, especially since those repeat offenders end up in the Bronx or other places. The white rich liberal racist only sees in greedy movies starring other rich white liberals who can't shoot guns. And at least one who can. In CRT, white rich liberal racist don't mind it because all their kids go to pricy private schools, just like Terry McAuliffe's sprats. They love school choice as long as poor people can't afford it. But at least the public school kids are getting laid by their teachers. Something I missed. Why did I go to Catholic school? Anyway, but you got to wonder. Even if you're a white, rich liberal, why wouldn't you also want secure borders, school choice and safe streets? That way minorities could also make a better life for themselves? Is it because the white rich liberal is racist? Perhaps they need minorities to have problems the government causes so they look to the government to solve them. I wonder what the angry black male thinks.",

The New York Times questions whether classic rock songs should be erased from memory, much like anything in Joe Biden's brain. Low hanging fruit, I admit it, as non-productive members of society find out more about the artist's personal lives now they want to punish everyone for it. The article recounts the story of singer Don McLean, who had pled -- pleaded guilty to misdemeanors related to domestic violence. He's also known for the classic song \"American Pie.\" And no, Brian Stelter, it's not about actual pie. So, should that song be canceled? Eric Clapton has taken heat for his comments on vaccines. But yes, how dare one of the Greatest Guitarists of All Time be upset because he believes the vaccine made him temporarily unable to use his hands? The Rolling Stones stopped playing their hit song \"Brown Sugar.\" Yes, they're even casting stones at the Rolling Stones. Little turn of phrase there. But it all boils down to one question, can you still celebrate art if you disagree with the artist? Nobody said they were rock and roll models. They're debased maniacs who funnel their flaws into something special. That's rock and roll. They bite heads off live birds, they marry their 14- year-old cousins and that's just Celine Dion. Expecting them to be good woke citizens is stupid. At this rate though, woke moral purging of musicians. Well, bad everybody, although I'm with them when it comes to Aerosmith.

Oh, they placed them into two separate groups based on gender, only two genders now, interesting. Pitting them against each other to solve math problems and win cash prizes. But after a bunch of scientific analytical stuff that goes way over my head, it turns out women had that competitive fight in them after all. So, it isn't just during divorce when women are better at getting their way. It's all the time. But unlike the guys, they were more likely to share their winnings with the losers, which means women are even better at losing than men. So, the take home message for us guys, you want women to make you sandwich? Tell them that you'd make it better. And sit back and reap the delicious rewards and the sandwich that they make for you and that kitchen they should never leave. Yes, that's something a sexist would say, and I denounce everything that was just said. So, because this is about women. We have three women here. What do you think, Tyrus?",

But they blame whiteness for Virginia's election while saying CRT doesn't exist. It makes me miss the Clinton era when the Dems were really good at lying. So Cross was filling in for the homophobic blogger turned pundit Joy Reid, who had said the same thing."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, because if there's one thing missing in our educational system, it's America's history of racism. Yes. And what's missing in the strip club is the smell of desperation. And baby powder. It is funny though, how could someone named Joy Reid be so joyless and not reid. There are countless articles out there on CRT and how often it's being taught in schools. So Joyce, Tiffany said the same thing, like people who plan to lie often will. It's like MSNBC have only one brain in the freezer and in the handoff, they must have dropped it numerous times. But what if they're right? In fact, there are lots of voters who are OK with white supremacy. It says that they vote Democrat. And not just because they supported Governor Northam who either wore blackface or a Klan hood. He never did tell us which. Either way no white sheets after Labor Day, Ralph. It's OK to laugh at that. OK. Don't laugh. But the most fluent places in America are Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun counties, which are all in Virginia. Their people make six figures or even seven figures. They're the kind of folks who can afford Hunter Biden's artwork and drug habit. And they vote Democrat overwhelmingly, knowing that only leads to paying much higher taxes. As the New York Times points out, affluent suburbs went bluer than a Smurf choking on a marble. They didn't say that, I did. But McAuliffe won 77 percent of the vote in Arlington. So these are voters who know they're going to pay way more under a Democrat but they do it anyway. Whether it's in taxes at the gas pump or buying medical devices online. FYI, catheters come in handy when you can't make it to the bathroom. Trust me. So well, pocketbook issues matter to blacks they don't matter to these rich, white liberal racist. Ask yourself, if you vote a Republican, are you just trying to save some money so you can fill your tank with gas? Or are you racist? Maybe everyone who drives is racist. But the rich white liberal racist can afford stuff like climate change spending, defunding the cops, unregulated immigration, COVID lock downs and no cash bail. But no one else really can. Just ask Minneapolis where a majority of blacks just voted against replacing the police department. Getting rid of the police is a popular idea with white college kids in safe neighborhoods, but not so much with people who might be murdered. See, unlike working class blacks, rich, white, liberal, racist, they can handle it. When you're white and rich you can vote for anything that will destroy an urban area faster than a case of Whippets on Kat's brain cells. You can raise taxes on the white liberal racist, they can handle it, you can defend the police, they can handle it. They're in gated communities and can afford private security and it's OK if their security has guns. Immigration, they love the cheap labor, it takes care of their hedges. And it really only affects border states, right? COVID lock downs are fine. They have enough cash tucked away to endure a few years watching The View in their underpants. Or they have government jobs where they're used to doing nothing. No cash bail. They love that virtue signal. Look how it empties evil prisons, especially since those repeat offenders end up in the Bronx or other places. The white rich liberal racist only sees in greedy movies starring other rich white liberals who can't shoot guns. And at least one who can. In CRT, white rich liberal racist don't mind it because all their kids go to pricy private schools, just like Terry McAuliffe's sprats. They love school choice as long as poor people can't afford it. But at least the public school kids are getting laid by their teachers. Something I missed. Why did I go to Catholic school? Anyway, but you got to wonder. Even if you're a white, rich liberal, why wouldn't you also want secure borders, school choice and safe streets? That way minorities could also make a better life for themselves? Is it because the white rich liberal is racist? Perhaps they need minorities to have problems the government causes so they look to the government to solve them. I wonder what the angry black male thinks."

The New York Times questions whether classic rock songs should be erased from memory, much like anything in Joe Biden's brain. Low hanging fruit, I admit it, as non-productive members of society find out more about the artist's personal lives now they want to punish everyone for it. The article recounts the story of singer Don McLean, who had pled -- pleaded guilty to misdemeanors related to domestic violence. He's also known for the classic song \"American Pie.\" And no, Brian Stelter, it's not about actual pie. So, should that song be canceled? Eric Clapton has taken heat for his comments on vaccines. But yes, how dare one of the Greatest Guitarists of All Time be upset because he believes the vaccine made him temporarily unable to use his hands? The Rolling Stones stopped playing their hit song \"Brown Sugar.\" Yes, they're even casting stones at the Rolling Stones. Little turn of phrase there. But it all boils down to one question, can you still celebrate art if you disagree with the artist? Nobody said they were rock and roll models. They're debased maniacs who funnel their flaws into something special. That's rock and roll. They bite heads off live birds, they marry their 14- year-old cousins and that's just Celine Dion. Expecting them to be good woke citizens is stupid. At this rate though, woke moral purging of musicians. Well, bad everybody, although I'm with them when it comes to Aerosmith.

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "They may look sweet, but they love to compete. Turns out all women are bloodthirsty monsters, not just Kat. A new study from the University of Arizona, Go Fighting Blisters, finds that women can be just as competitive as men in the workplace. Researchers split participants in half -- that's horrific. Oh, they placed them into two separate groups based on gender, only two genders now, interesting. Pitting them against each other to solve math problems and win cash prizes. But after a bunch of scientific analytical stuff that goes way over my head, it turns out women had that competitive fight in them after all. So, it isn't just during divorce when women are better at getting their way. It's all the time. But unlike the guys, they were more likely to share their winnings with the losers, which means women are even better at losing than men. So, the take home message for us guys, you want women to make you sandwich? Tell them that you'd make it better. And sit back and reap the delicious rewards and the sandwich that they make for you and that kitchen they should never leave. Yes, that's something a sexist would say, and I denounce everything that was just said. So, because this is about women. We have three women here. What do you think, Tyrus?"

      "speaker": "TYRUS",

      "utterance": "Because, you know, internal damnation, reminder of every constant they forget nothing. Of course, they share it with you, so they can remind you that they beat you. Like, they're the most the worst, poor sports in the world. Don't let them beat you at one of your own games. Don't let them come on your turf and beat you at a car game like wow -- this is easy. I can't believe you and your friends get together and you do this. I did it like three seconds. I'd be so embarrassed and like, they'd literally play the entire game with lemon and razor blades. So, back to you're going to ask any guy on the street if women are competitive. They -- if it was a fight with say, please stop. It's over."
