You have a couple of options here. This reminds me a bit of what Bill Clinton did when he had the planes in flight going to Haiti, and then a deal was brokered at the last minute, the planes come back around. Reuters reported that was a message sent from Trump to Tehran saying they are about the to strike and they'd like to hear from them as soon as possible. It suggests that maybe they did hear that as soon as possible, and that would be good. We need to see some diplomatic roots to tempering down this escalation that we've seen. It's also just possible that he was getting advice from people who have had a lot of power in this town for many decades who make decisions about intervention that he just came to his senses and rejected. I don't think he's going to make the same mistakes that some previous presidents have made about getting involved into an intractable conflict in the Middle East.",

JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: Iran is testing our resolve is what they're doing, and this has been escalating over at least the past month. And I don't think that these provocations are going to stop until Iran receives a response that is a serious response and a forceful response. I think it's the nature of these authoritarian regimes to poke and poke and poke and see what they can get away with it. Why is Iran doing this? They're hurting right now, their economy is hurting. It shrank by about four percent last year. It's going to shrink by another six percent this year. they're saying if we can't oil no one should be able to export oil. And that's why they're making trouble here in the Strait of Hormuz, and I think they're going to continue to do this until they get a forceful response. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I know President Trump wants to bring our troops home, he doesn't want us involved in more overseas conflicts, but when you are the leader of the free world, you don't always have that luxury.

It is true that Iran needs to be dealt with. It is true that it is an aggressive country and that they are a serious threat. There are so many things that can be done without risking actual war.

So you have to pick what you are going to do to get upset about, and so people are picking these tangential issues. But I also think there's an issue that maybe not everything that was tweeted or not everything that was reported is the whole story. You have a couple of options here. This reminds me a bit of what Bill Clinton did when he had the planes in flight going to Haiti, and then a deal was brokered at the last minute, the planes come back around. Reuters reported that was a message sent from Trump to Tehran saying they are about the to strike and they'd like to hear from them as soon as possible. It suggests that maybe they did hear that as soon as possible, and that would be good. We need to see some diplomatic roots to tempering down this escalation that we've seen. It's also just possible that he was getting advice from people who have had a lot of power in this town for many decades who make decisions about intervention that he just came to his senses and rejected. I don't think he's going to make the same mistakes that some previous presidents have made about getting involved into an intractable conflict in the Middle East."

JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: Iran is testing our resolve is what they're doing, and this has been escalating over at least the past month. And I don't think that these provocations are going to stop until Iran receives a response that is a serious response and a forceful response. I think it's the nature of these authoritarian regimes to poke and poke and poke and see what they can get away with it. Why is Iran doing this? They're hurting right now, their economy is hurting. It shrank by about four percent last year. It's going to shrink by another six percent this year. they're saying if we can't oil no one should be able to export oil. And that's why they're making trouble here in the Strait of Hormuz, and I think they're going to continue to do this until they get a forceful response. I know President Trump wants to bring our troops home, he doesn't want us involved in more overseas conflicts, but when you are the leader of the free world, you don't always have that luxury. Around 30 percent of the world's oil passes through that straight, and if Iran is doing things like this, shooting down U.S. drones in international space, they cannot get away with that behavior."

Many of his advisors, in fact, one source told me today that all of his advisors including the military, despite some reports that the Pentagon was not on board, believed unanimously that it was the right thing to do to hold some kind of a strike and a proportionate response to Iran. So when the president decided late last night, probably before we were on the but not too long before, the people around him were disappointed, and they ended up going home disappointed, but they accepted his decision because it was his call to make. But those people will continue to be watching the threat from the Iran, and one of the sources who I spoke to today made clear that the threat from Iran has not changed, and, in fact, it has tried before to shoot down a U.S. drone, and this time it was successful."

Donald Trump did campaign successfully on a claim that he would not be like that, that he saw the errors of those things. Yesterday his rhetoric was actually still along the lines of what we'd heard during the campaign, but we were hearing that there was going to be this strike. It is true that Iran needs to be dealt with. It is true that it is an aggressive country and that they are a serious threat. There are so many things that can be done without risking actual war. There are so ways to retaliate against some of what's been happening, and I would assume we are doing some of those a little bit more sub rosa than risking a complete confrontation. Iran is not Syria or even Iraq, it's not Libya. It's a very serious country with a serious military, and people contended -- they almost sound cavalier about what it would be like to go to war. And it is good that we at least have one person in this administration, even if he seems to be alone sometimes, at the top who is a little bit more reticent to get involved in yet another Middle East conflict."

It's interesting we see members of Congress who aren't running for the nomination saying he could've done better with the words, but I know him, he's been a civil rights champion. But the rest of the field is not going to let this go."

      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "They're not going to let it go because of the extent of his lead, and that's what this is really about. I don't think any of these Democrats really think that Joe Biden is a racist, but he is leading the pack and they want to chip away at that support, and particularly his black support. I think he's got a lot of good will in the black community based in his years as President Obama's vice president. And so he's going to ride that, and they're going to try and chip away at that. We should also keep in mind that Joe Biden knows how to play the race card when he wants to as well. I remember Joe Biden saying back in 2012 to a mostly black audience that Republicans want to keep you all in chains. So he can play this game too. But I think the larger point of what Biden is doing here is showing, listen, I don't think people want a Democratic brawler to replace a Republican brawler like President Trump. I am someone who can work together with people that I disagree with politically and get things done. And I think that was the broader context of the remarks that he was making, and I think they were pretty obvious at the time."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "The theory of his race is he's kind of running in the general. He's just starting to run against Trump. What the danger is here is that he has so many gaffes and he has such a history and legacy of gaffes, he might be chewed up and spit out long before you get to the general. So it's just another example of how these mistakes might mean that he is not as unstoppable as people think."

And that's partially because they've seen Joe Biden do so well just taking him on directly instead of the other members of the Democratic team or slate so far. So I think we'll see exactly what you just saw with that clip with Bernie Sanders, people attacking the president and trying to distinguish themselves from him, but also going after Joe Biden next week when there is a debate. This is a chance to do that."

After this week, Vice President, not the former vice president, current Vice President Mike Pence decided not to give a speech next week which would have been critical of China and human rights.
