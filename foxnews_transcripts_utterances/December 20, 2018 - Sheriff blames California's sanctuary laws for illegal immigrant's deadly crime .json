Documents filed yesterday show us the publication Buzzfeed was sued after they published the bogus dossier on President Trump. But they won in court. But that's not actually the interesting part of the story. Inside the filing were revelations about certain Republicans that will shock a lot of you. First, a longtime associate of the late Republican from Arizona Senator John McCain initially provided a copy of that infamous Steele dossier to \"Buzzfeed\" in the first place. And second, a Paul Ryan aide and Congressman Adam Kinzinger were given an early look at the dossier before others even became aware of it. Here now is Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute. So Peter, why does this not surprise me, that when someone is trying to shop an anti-Trump document as salacious and as ridiculous as that was, they went to two big-time neoconservatives who are diametrically opposed to Trump on things like the wall, speaking of the wall, his noninterventionist philosophy and his economic nationalism, go down the line.

I really doubt it. This speaks to the fact that Donald Trump is a disruptor. There is a deep cultural clash between him and the Washington establishment. And it speaks to the fact that they do not like the fact that he is disrupting the way things are done in Washington, D.C., the same way that on the political left Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman-elect Ocasio-Cortez is doing on the left of the political spectrum.

I bet most Americans don't even know we are in Syria, because they're thinking, wait a second, don't we have problems in Cincinnati to deal with, but we're in Syria with 2,000 after we've already decimated ISIS.

If you come in and say, you know what, we are getting rid of these thousands of pages of regulations, now suddenly that is a huge revenue stream for Washington consultants that's gone. That's just one of the ways in which the swamp is being changed in Washington, D.C.

Sheriff, I know our viewers across the country are watching this and are shaking their heads going, how would - how can this happen in the United States of America? Will we emote morning, noon and night about the tragic circumstances of people who are trying to come into the country? And I get it. They're tragic circumstances. It's tough.

And merry Christmas to your family. Now on to some troubling revelations inside a Florida court. Documents filed yesterday show us the publication Buzzfeed was sued after they published the bogus dossier on President Trump. But they won in court. But that's not actually the interesting part of the story. Inside the filing were revelations about certain Republicans that will shock a lot of you. First, a longtime associate of the late Republican from Arizona Senator John McCain initially provided a copy of that infamous Steele dossier to \"Buzzfeed\" in the first place. And second, a Paul Ryan aide and Congressman Adam Kinzinger were given an early look at the dossier before others even became aware of it. Here now is Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute. So Peter, why does this not surprise me, that when someone is trying to shop an anti-Trump document as salacious and as ridiculous as that was, they went to two big-time neoconservatives who are diametrically opposed to Trump on things like the wall, speaking of the wall, his noninterventionist philosophy and his economic nationalism, go down the line. McCain and Kinzinger, and I guess Paul Ryan had some access to it as well."

If McCain's office or Ryan's office had been given a salacious, unverified dossier about one of their colleagues, do you think they would have been leaking it around to the press corps? I really doubt it. This speaks to the fact that Donald Trump is a disruptor. There is a deep cultural clash between him and the Washington establishment. And it speaks to the fact that they do not like the fact that he is disrupting the way things are done in Washington, D.C., the same way that on the political left Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman-elect Ocasio-Cortez is doing on the left of the political spectrum. And I think it speaks to the fact that, what Donald Trump represents, it's those policies you talked about, but it's about changing the dynamics of how Washington works. And they do not like it and they want to stop it."

Regular folks out there, they see what people make as lobbyists or consultants, and these are people who haven't won elections in a decade. And yet they still make tens of millions of dollars with ad buys and ad design and placement and consulting contracts. So they like the status quo. Trump comes in like a wrecking ball and says this whole town stinks to high heaven, and it makes them really nervous. They are freaking out about this Syria withdrawal. I bet most Americans don't even know we are in Syria, because they're thinking, wait a second, don't we have problems in Cincinnati to deal with, but we're in Syria with 2,000 after we've already decimated ISIS. So I think he has held up a mirror to the corruption in Washington, and they don't like what they are seeing. So it has got to be Trump is the problem and Trump is the corrupt one."

    {
      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "Right, exactly. And consider just something like deregulation. Everybody thinks it's great because it frees up American businesses, makes them more competitive. But it costs a lot of people in Washington, D.C., money. Here's why. The reason why regulations, whether it's environmental or financial, are so complicated and complex is they are designed that way, because you've got an entire industry in Washington, D.C., that is interpreting rules and laws that nobody else understands. If you come in and say, you know what, we are getting rid of these thousands of pages of regulations, now suddenly that is a huge revenue stream for Washington consultants that's gone. That's just one of the ways in which the swamp is being changed in Washington, D.C. So what I say to people is agree with Trump on certain policies or not, there is no disputing the fact that he is a disruptor. We love disruptors in Silicon Valley, we like them in the entertainment business. I think it's good to have them in American politics too, because it's become calcified. It's the wealthiest city in the United States today is Washington D.C. That's a huge problem."

And you see this in media figures. People who I have been friends with in other media outlets for years, not all of them -- I used to like Don Lemon. Don Lemon used to come on my radio show, we were joking earlier, I used to have people like Frank Rich on my radio, John Kerry.

She ordered this photo on a customizable stamp, and you can see her family, beautiful family, standing right there in front of Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, where I have been many times. It's a beautiful picture. The United States post office didn't think so. Soon after she placed the order, Tavia was told by Stamps.com that the U.S. Postal Service guidelines dictate that all religious content is forbidden. Joining me now is Hiram Sasser, attorney for Tavia Hunt. Tavia is not feeling well tonight. But Hiram, where does the stand now? First of all, when is the last time a religious service of any great number in attendance was held at Saint Basil's Cathedral? I think it's been quite a long time. It's a museum now."

This is not establishing a state religion, even by the most amorphous, squishiest of tests, most ambiguous of tests, that the Supreme Court established. It seems like it falls squarely within one's free expression rights under the First Amendment. So, I don't get it. You can probably show a picture of someone at Hooters and that's OK, but you can't be a little cathedral in the background, I don't even understand the argument."

But here's what's interesting about this, is that the postal service prints religious stamps. They are just saying that you are not allowed to. They just passed a regulation that went into effect in May of 2018 saying nothing religious can be on a customized stamp. And the postal service even responded to us today, and they said, look, you just can't have anything religious on a customized stamp. But we'll sell you our religious stamps, but you can't have one."

They have beautiful stamps but not the one I happen to want. OK, I like that one. Listen to the USPS policy on customized postage. \"Acceptable images or text may not contain content that is unsuitable for all ages and audiences, including any depiction of political, religious, violent or sexual content.\" How is religious lumped in with violent and sexual content?"
