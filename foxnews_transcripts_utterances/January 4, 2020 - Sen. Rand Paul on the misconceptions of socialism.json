      "utterance": "You know the craziest thing? Trump's not even impeached. Nancy is keeping the two articles in her purse. She hasn't even sent them to the Senate yet. Now, once they get sent to the Senate, then impeachment's official. But she wants to play games. She wants to wait and squeeze a little more drama out of this whole boring deal. She's afraid if she sends these weak articles, the Senate is just going to find him not guilty and be done with it all. So, Nancy's making demands. McConnell has to run the trial her way or else. Sounds like Nancy is the one demanding a quid pro quo. Not how this works. The speaker doesn't get to set the terms. The House investigates and the Senate judges. She doesn't have any leverage. The Democrats have already denied Trump due process, and now they're denying him a right to a speedy trial. It's par for the course. I thought Trump was a dire threat to democracy, and he had to be impeached before he could rig the next election? They've been trying to impeach Trump since before he was the Republican nominee. In March 2016, the New York Daily News wrote this, \"Impeach Trump. It's not too early to start.\" Then right after Trump was elected president, the media starts salivating."

      "utterance": "Then the day of Trump's inauguration, The Washington Post announces the campaign to impeach the president has begun. The whistleblower's attorney was tweeting about impeachment years ago, and the FBI agents were texting about impeachment and the insurance policy way, way back. The FBI used intelligence briefings to spy on him. They wiretapped his staff, they leaked, and they hatched stings. Trump caught wind of it and fired Comey. So, Comey leaked and triggered a special counsel, a two-year witch hunt, when Mueller already knew there was no collusion. What was he doing that whole time? He was just building an obstruction case against the president. And that dark cloud cost Republicans the House. Bill Barr finally got there and called their bluff. No collusion, no obstruction. And then the same week the Mueller hearing bombed, Adam Schiff hatched the whistleblower plot. So, Trump called their bluff again and releases the transcript. No bribe on the call, no pressure."

Say it, you crooked bastard, say it.\" Because remember bribery? And this and that. Where are they? They said these two things are not even a crime. This is the lightest, weakest impeachment. This is impeachment lite."

I’m going to be leaving here\" -- I think it was, what? Six hours? I looked at him and said, \"I leave in six hours.

      "utterance": "Biden threatened to withhold aid to an ally if they didn't fire the prosecutor investing his son's company. We should call him Quid Pro Joe. Trump was also asking Ukraine to look into how this whole Russia hoax started because the Ukrainians, Fusion, GPS, and the DNC, they were all caught working together to get dirt on Trump in his campaign. So, Democrats manufactured a crime and now they're trying to manufacture a cover up. Trump released a transcript of the call. He explained it on television and even has national intelligence director testify, all in one week; it's a pretty bad cover up. Maybe you should have just acid washed everything like Hillary. So, there's no crime, there's no quid pro quo, there's no cover up. Everything Democrats are accusing Trump of, they did. The threats, the collusion, the corruption, the getting rich off the family connection. Now, it's not like Trump enlisted foreign agents to spy on and entrap and investigate his political opponent to influence election. Oh, wait. That's what Obama, Biden, and Hillary did. The left expects Trump just to lay down and take it. They can smear him and spy on him, sue him and investigate him, conspire and collude against him, but -- so -- when he fights back? They call that a high crime. But here is the real story. It's just another coup. The intelligence community's out of control. They've been out to get Trump from the jump. Now the witch hunt failed, so this is just part two. Mueller found the president of the United States wasn't a traitor after Democrats for two years falsely accused him of being a traitor. But instead of being relieved their president wasn't a traitor, they're angry the president was fighting back against their false allegations. Donald Trump did not obstruct justice. If anything, he obstructed injustice. The president was framed. No collusion. He beat the rap. And now the angry left wants to impeach him for beating the rap. Trump survived unprecedented political torture. Prosecutors, FBI agents, the Department of Justice all investigating him and his associates based on what we now know was false information about collusion. His associates were being spied on. Other governments like Great Britain were involved. The media was accusing him of treason. Obama holdovers were criminally unmasking and leaking against him. Democrats were calling him mentally ill and trying to impeach him. His lawyers’ offices were raided, and Mueller investigated him with a team of Democrat donors and ex-Hillary lawyers. This political shock and awe campaign would have crippled any other politician who had a normal pain threshold. The fact that he fought back and survived this assault demonstrates his strong will and commitment to our country. But it also demonstrates great instincts and passion of you, the American people, who saw through the fake news and followed the facts. One, Trump didn't fire Comey to obstruct the Russia investigation. He fired him for PR reasons. Perfectly legal. Because Comey wouldn't say in public what he was telling Trump in private, that the president wasn't personally under investigation. Two, Trump Tower meeting? The president never misled or obstructed the special counsel investigation. All emails and testimony was provided. Don Jr. demonstrated no criminal intent. Interestingly, Mueller left out the part about the Russian lawyer meeting the dossier firm before and after the Trump Tower meeting. The whole meeting was a setup. It was a sting. Barr is going to dig into that, by the way. Three, Mike Flynn. There was no evidence that Trump had advanced knowledge of Flynn's discussions of sanctions. Four, Michael Cohen. There was no evidence that the president directed Cohen to lie, so I guess another Buzzfeed bombshell goes up in smoke. Number five, finally, on obstruction. Not only did Mueller not charge Trump with obstruction, he actually writes that his efforts to influence the investigation were unsuccessful. By the way, was the president supposed to just go along with being smeared by Hillary’s dossier and walk into impeachment and the perjury traps laid by Mueller’s partisan team of Democratic prosecutors? A prosecutor’s job is to charge or not charge. Donald Trump is presumed innocent as an American. The burden of proof is not on him. So, Mueller invents a new legal phrase, “not not guilty of attempted obstruction.” What the hell is that? If I get framed for something I didn’t do, and I fully cooperate while fighting back to prove my innocence, that’s a crime? His motives weren't corrupt because he wasn’t guilty of collusion. As the president says, that’s BS. If you’re accused of something, and you know you didn’t do it, you fight back as hard as you can."

      "speaker": "Donald Trump",
      "utterance": "If you look, and you read our Constitution and many other things, we -- I have an obligation to look at corruption. I have an actual obligation and a duty. I don’t care about politics. I don’t care about Biden’s politics. I never thought Biden was going to win, to be honest. I was investigated, and they think it could have been by U.K.; they think it could have been by Australia; they think it could have been by Italy. So, when you get down to it, I was investigated by the Obama administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Let’s go over this again. America has treaties with Ukraine and China, treaties about crime and corruption. It allows both governments to help with investigations and share information. Biden isn’t above the law because he’s running for president, and his family isn’t above the law when he’s overseas. Now, you’re saying that if Hillary decides to run again in 2020, Barr would have to drop the investigation into her fake foreign dossier because she became Trump’s political opponent all of a sudden? That’s ridiculous. Then everybody who committed crimes could just announce a presidential run to get immunity. The Obama crowd asked at least four allies to make up dirt on Trump. He was investigated, set up, spied on. There was no evidence of corruption. Remember the Mueller report? No collusion. But there’s Biden family corruption in plain sight, video records and bank records. Trump is not planting evidence like the Democrats did to him. He’s not using secret wiretaps, foreign spies, and crooked FBI agents. Trump is saying it all out in the open. Let’s look into this. Now, it might be shocking that Trump is calling attention to it in this way. We’re just not used to it, but this is why he was elected: to drain the swamp, restore justice, punch back twice as hard, and make the system work for people, not just the powerful. Trump is challenging the whole system where politicians and their family members cut sweetheart deals with foreign nations -- it’s kind of like a bribe -- and then those nations get to turn around and rip away jobs from working Americans. All these ex-senators and -congressmen and their family members and wealthy insiders -- they’re vested in an unfair system that Donald Trump was elected to change. This is just a cathartic exercise for Democrats. We all know it’s just about rage and power."

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Get it out of your system, and then maybe we can regroup later, because that’s what Americans want. Polls show a huge majority, 66 percent of us, want Democrats to work with Donald Trump to solve the nation’s problems rather than impeachment. They don’t care, though. They’ve totally lost it. How did impeachment work out in the ‘90s? Congress had felonies on Clinton. Impeachment failed in the Senate, and Bill’s numbers went through the roof. Now, let’s look at the facts. What’s the crime? Democrats can’t explain it. Trump is the president of the United States. He runs the country. He has every right to know what’s going on everywhere in the world. It’s his responsibility. If there’s misconduct by a high-ranking American -- Joe Biden, his son, or anyone -- in a foreign country, he needs to know what happened. Biden and his son aren’t above the law. They can do shady things overseas, and Donald Trump can’t find out about it because he might run against him? Give me a break. This latest poll has Trump beating every single Democrat head to head, doing even better in the swing states. Just to give you a sense of how impeachment played in the swing states, take Pennsylvania. During the height of the hearings this fall, here’s what people in the swing state PA were searching for on Google. See the yellow and the green spikes there? Those are “Steelers” and “Eagles.” At the bottom, you see -- you can barely see -- that’s red. That’s “impeachment.” You don’t care about political football; you care about the real thing. What are they going to do now? They’re going to run out another dossier? Another Access Hollywood tape? Another whistleblower? They don’t have any card left to play. Only Biden can save them now. Would you want your fate in Sleepy Joe’s hands? The Democrats have done nothing except lie, cheat, and impeach, but look at what the president has accomplished while they’ve waged war on him. Decimated ISIS, new North American and Chinese trade deals, two Supreme Court justices, tax cuts, jobs, energy pipelines and independence, low gas prices, stock market records smashed, Obamacare mandate gone, money for military and vets. And CBS reports that by next year 170 miles of new border wall will have been built. So, one thing is crystal-clear. Democrats are trying to take Trump out not because he failed, but because he succeeded. Nancy Pelosi’s call for impeachment began nearly three months ago, Ukraine and the whistleblower all over the news, but is it sinking in with the average American? No."

We’re not socialist.” So, the first problem with their argument is most of Scandinavia has private property, private stock market. The economic indexes that measure freedom and trade, they score on, like, a top 10 in the world. Here’s the big rub, though. Bernie wants to raise corporate income taxes. He objected to Trump’s tax cut that lowered ours from 35 percent down to 21, and he wants to be like Scandinavia. Well, Scandinavia has been at 21 for the last 30 years. So, he really doesn’t know what he actually wants. But people should be alarmed because socialism’s greatest association has been with genocide and famine for the last hundred years or more."

They say, “Oh, well, we’re going to do this, and we’re going to tax the rich.” This is the other thing we learn from looking at Scandinavia. They have a lot of so-called free stuff, socialist free stuff over there -- college, paid leave, all this stuff -- but they don’t pay for it by just taxing the right. In fact, they tax the rich less than we tax the rich, but they tax the heck out of the working class and the middle class, and that’s where the real money is. So, if you want all this free stuff that Bernie’s offering, that AOC’s offering, you can have it in America, but the working class will pay massive taxes, and so will the middle class."

They think they’re going to get a kinder, gentler kind of socialism, and they think, “Oh, it’s about fairness.” That’s why they need to be reminded of the history of socialism. They also need to be reminded of -- there is no real-world example, because they’re pointing to Scandinavia, which isn’t socialist and actually has many policies that Bernie objects to. So, I think the facts are important. You know, all along people have just been, you know, sort of ignoring it and saying, “Well, Sweden is socialism, and they’re all rich and live forever and have no infant mortality.” Well, the truth is they’re not socialist, and they’ve been heading away from socialism for the last 30 years. Four of the five countries -- of the Nordic countries have center-right governments, so really nothing that they’re saying is true. The truth should matter, the facts should matter, and our book, you know, The Case Against Socialism, is about bringing some of these facts out."

He -- we knew he wouldn't because he's basically in cahoots with Jeffrey. But we were able to find his copilots. Basically, he said, \"Listen, I flew the plane, I flew it all over the world, but I was never allowed to really leave the cockpit. I knew there was bedrooms back there. I knew that there was girls that shouldn't have been on the plane that were there. And I couldn't leave the cockpit to go back and look or I would get fired.\" He told me about -- the stewardesses on the plane would be very young girls. I mean, he couldn't tell me if they were 15, 16, 17, or 18. He just didn't know their ages, but they were very young, definitely not over 18. And he --"

It will reveal everything the Jeffery's doing with underage girls, and you'll be able to put him in prison for life.\" Well, of course, we wanted this book more than anything, but he wanted $50,000 for the book."

And when that failed, we had to contact the FBI, and we did a sting where we went in and pretended we were going to buy the book, and he delivered it to us, and he was arrested."
