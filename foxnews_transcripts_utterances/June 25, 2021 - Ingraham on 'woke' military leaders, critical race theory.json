The first person charged in the January 6 riot was a grandmother from Indiana. What was the charge? One count of parading in the Capitol? I kid you not. She's here exclusively tonight to tell us about how long she was locked away and the effort to deprogram her thoughts. But first, the military's woke makeover. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". Now, if you were Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of Defense, or any top military leader today, there's a lot that should keep you up at night, right? So put yourself in that role. But - and think about it. Most all of it is coming from China. Threats to our ally Taiwan, our strategic ally in the Pacific, China's itching to invade them, threats from China's hackers and Intel agencies, their growing presence in Africa. Plus China's threatening us in space. But our current chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley is apparently spending a lot of his waking hours worrying about what he thinks is wrong with the United States. Now, yesterday when Republican congressmen raised reasonable questions about whether it's a good idea to expose our soldiers to anti-American propaganda in the form of this critical race theory stuff, he just ended up lashing out, sounding more like a commentator on MSNBC than a military leader.",

      "sentences": "Wait, wait, think about that. The troops are hearing that in order to be honest with themselves about how they need to improve, they then need to read a book by a guy who thinks America is inherently wicked and evil. Does that make any sense? The message of the troops is this, put your lives at risk for the USA. But remember, the USA is a systemically racist, structurally biased country. And by the way, you and your parents live on stolen land. Look, what top military leaders have on their nightstands, what they choose to read, that's up to them. But how is it appropriate or helpful to our young military personnel just starting out to force this on them? How does it promote unit cohesion? The first thing we should be teaching our soldiers, our airmen, all of them is that we're a good and noble country that is worthy of their amazing sacrifice. Critical race theory sends the opposite message. And as for General Milley's attempt to justify the unjustifiable by noting that he has personally read the works of some of the worst villains of our time. Big deal? Obviously, we're not going to expose our troops to every possible twisted theory out there. What's the point of that? They're trained to be warriors in many roles. And they are among the finest in the world. Reading Ibram Kendi will no more help our troops understand the United States than Fidel Castro's writings would have in the 1960s. The reason that the military gave in to the critical race theory craze is simple. Because the Biden administration is determined to use race as a political weapon. And the Biden administration is enlisting the military to help them. Of course, they tried to deny this and claim that anyone who attacks critical race theory in the military is attacking the troops. Oh, please. Another logical fallacy. The noncommissioned officers, the enlisted men and women, they signed up to be in the U.S. military, not for a never-ending racism seminar. It wasn't long ago that Biden made this promise to our men and women in uniform.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's just not true. The military is launching an effort to monitor social media activity of the troops, meaning their personal political views and other views will be examined for so-called extremism, even if they do nothing illegal to act on those viewpoints. The fact is, too many in top leadership have forgotten the proper role of the U.S. military. They answer to civilian leadership, not the other way around. Remember, when Trump wanted to pull our troops out of Afghanistan? Well, the top brass in the military, they fought him every step of the way. There was always a reason not to bring the troops home. And now when you watch what's going on, they're even resisting Biden, pushing the narrative, of course, that when we pull out, it'll be another Saigon. They did the same in Iraq, by the way, despite public opinion and despite stated administration policy. Civilian control of the military is a cornerstone of our entire system. If military leaders are perceived to be parroting partisan, again, MSNBC style talking points, they're going to do to the Armed Forces what Tony Fauci has done to public health agencies. They'll hurt their standing and their credibility with the American people. So Republicans need to take all of this very seriously. Some already are, like Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley. The fact is post Afghanistan, we need a plan to make our military more functional and less political. Beyond reasserting civilian control of the Armed Forces, we have to eliminate all unnecessary spending, cut everything from needless weapon systems, to pointless deployments, to the hiring of any racial or gender identity consultants. Our troops aren't served by bloated budgets, only the bureaucracy and the defense industry benefit from that. Thirdly, our focus should be almost entirely on China, staying ahead of the CCP and blunting their influence wherever we can. This is not going to be easy. In fact, it will be the great challenge of this century. But we must take it more seriously. Fourth, we need new leadership. Anyone who seeks to purge patriotic volunteers from our military based on changing political whims, and anyone who spends more time thinking about January 6 than China shouldn't be leading our troops. We need more victories against our adversaries abroad and less animosity toward our own people at home. Our troops should be encouraged to have faith in our system. After all, they're the ones who volunteer to protect and defend it. Why should they or anyone commit to defending a way of life that their reading is inherently racist? Who signed up for that job? Perhaps that's a question that General Milley should spend some time thinking about before his next appearance on Capitol Hill. And that's the \"Angle\". All right.

But - and think about it. Most all of it is coming from China. Threats to our ally Taiwan, our strategic ally in the Pacific, China's itching to invade them, threats from China's hackers and Intel agencies, their growing presence in Africa. Plus China's threatening us in space. But our current chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley is apparently spending a lot of his waking hours worrying about what he thinks is wrong with the United States.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Wait, wait, think about that. The troops are hearing that in order to be honest with themselves about how they need to improve, they then need to read a book by a guy who thinks America is inherently wicked and evil. Does that make any sense? The message of the troops is this, put your lives at risk for the USA. But remember, the USA is a systemically racist, structurally biased country. And by the way, you and your parents live on stolen land. Look, what top military leaders have on their nightstands, what they choose to read, that's up to them. But how is it appropriate or helpful to our young military personnel just starting out to force this on them? How does it promote unit cohesion? The first thing we should be teaching our soldiers, our airmen, all of them is that we're a good and noble country that is worthy of their amazing sacrifice. Critical race theory sends the opposite message. And as for General Milley's attempt to justify the unjustifiable by noting that he has personally read the works of some of the worst villains of our time. Big deal? Obviously, we're not going to expose our troops to every possible twisted theory out there. What's the point of that? They're trained to be warriors in many roles. And they are among the finest in the world. Reading Ibram Kendi will no more help our troops understand the United States than Fidel Castro's writings would have in the 1960s. The reason that the military gave in to the critical race theory craze is simple. Because the Biden administration is determined to use race as a political weapon. And the Biden administration is enlisting the military to help them. Of course, they tried to deny this and claim that anyone who attacks critical race theory in the military is attacking the troops. Oh, please. Another logical fallacy. The noncommissioned officers, the enlisted men and women, they signed up to be in the U.S. military, not for a never-ending racism seminar. It wasn't long ago that Biden made this promise to our men and women in uniform."

Less than a month later, the Pentagon announced the so-called domestic extremists issue that they were the most serious threat in existence to the U.S. military, which we all know is code for purging the ranks of conservatives. So as China continues to build and grow its global influence, the Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin chose to focus on white supremacists as a major problem. Now this is straight out of the critical theory playbook. But they're not denials, they came anyway."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, that's just not true. The military is launching an effort to monitor social media activity of the troops, meaning their personal political views and other views will be examined for so-called extremism, even if they do nothing illegal to act on those viewpoints. The fact is, too many in top leadership have forgotten the proper role of the U.S. military. They answer to civilian leadership, not the other way around. Remember, when Trump wanted to pull our troops out of Afghanistan? Well, the top brass in the military, they fought him every step of the way. There was always a reason not to bring the troops home. And now when you watch what's going on, they're even resisting Biden, pushing the narrative, of course, that when we pull out, it'll be another Saigon. They did the same in Iraq, by the way, despite public opinion and despite stated administration policy. Civilian control of the military is a cornerstone of our entire system. If military leaders are perceived to be parroting partisan, again, MSNBC style talking points, they're going to do to the Armed Forces what Tony Fauci has done to public health agencies. They'll hurt their standing and their credibility with the American people. So Republicans need to take all of this very seriously. Some already are, like Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley. The fact is post Afghanistan, we need a plan to make our military more functional and less political. Beyond reasserting civilian control of the Armed Forces, we have to eliminate all unnecessary spending, cut everything from needless weapon systems, to pointless deployments, to the hiring of any racial or gender identity consultants. Our troops aren't served by bloated budgets, only the bureaucracy and the defense industry benefit from that. Thirdly, our focus should be almost entirely on China, staying ahead of the CCP and blunting their influence wherever we can. This is not going to be easy. In fact, it will be the great challenge of this century. But we must take it more seriously. Fourth, we need new leadership. Anyone who seeks to purge patriotic volunteers from our military based on changing political whims, and anyone who spends more time thinking about January 6 than China shouldn't be leading our troops. We need more victories against our adversaries abroad and less animosity toward our own people at home. Our troops should be encouraged to have faith in our system. After all, they're the ones who volunteer to protect and defend it. Why should they or anyone commit to defending a way of life that their reading is inherently racist? Who signed up for that job? Perhaps that's a question that General Milley should spend some time thinking about before his next appearance on Capitol Hill. And that's the \"Angle\". All right.

There's nothing really wrong with the list that the attorney gave to Ms. Lloyd, but it's not anything that the court should order, or should accept. What's funny is I listened to the court hearing yesterday when she offered her plea and she got very choked up in court. She's never been charged with any sort of crime. She's a 49-year-old grandmother from Southern Indiana, and she got choked up. And the DOJ kind of pushed back and said, \"Look, we don't really accept this sort of approach. We do not prosecute people based on their beliefs.\" Well, of course they do.

      "utterance": "Vaccinated people, even though they are very, very well protected, they still should try as best as possible to avoid congregate settings in which there are a lot of unvaccinated people, particularly if you happen to live in an area where the infection rate is high and the vaccination rate is low."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Wait a second, they think that's selling the vaccine? If you are vaccinated, you still have to do all the other stuff you did before. Why would anyone already apprehensive about getting the vaccine be motivated to get the vaccine if you get the vaccine and you still have to socially distance from the world or mask up? While Fauci further exposes himself as a fraud, we are learning that his own NIH was doing the bidding of the CCP. In a stunning admission to \"The Wall Street Journal\" the NIH says it scrubbed its database of some of the genomic sequences from the early COVID cases at the request of Chinese scientists. Now, it makes you wonder, what other info has the NIH buried at the request of China? Joining me now is Wisconsin Congressman Mike Gallagher who is all over this. Congressman, seems like every other day we learned of some other really weird connection between our NIH and the folks at that Wuhan lab and all of this COVID craziness that has resulted from it."

      "speaker": "REP. MIKE GALLAGHER, (R-WI) HOUSE ARMED SERVICE COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "Of course, Fauci continues to throw cold water on the lab leak hypothesis because his organization under the NIH was funneling millions of dollars through EcoHealth Alliance to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for dangerous gain of function research to take naturally coronaviruses and do crazy experiments on them and make them more pathogenic, more chimeric. In other words, our taxpayer dollars were being used to meddle with the primal forces of nature in cooperation with the genocidal communist government dedicated to our own destruction. And where is the outrage? This week in fact, Fauci went on a \"New York Times\" podcast and suggested that the intelligence community assessment saying that lab workers at the Wuhan Institute got sick prior to the broader outbreak was bogus. Fauci is attacking the intelligence community. Where's the outrage? He further suggests in that interview, if you listen to it, that he hasn't even bothered to read the intelligence. That's crazy. What Dr. Fauci is doing is not advancing science. He's advancing a dogmatic adherence to a religion that suggests you can't question the scientific experts."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said something about the intel community's COVID origins investigation. \"We're hoping to find a smoking gun, but it's challenging to do that,\" adding that \"it might happen, but it might not.\" Congressman, she sounds really committed to finding the answer about how this entire virus started right? Of course not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Well, of course, we have actually had scientists who are not right-wing scientist, Nobel Prize Winners like David Baltimore, who suggested that the furin cleavage site that we found in the sequence of the virus is itself a smoking gun. Now, he's walked that back a little bit, but there are aspects to this virus scientifically that suggest that it was modified in a lab. More to the point, the intelligence community released an unclassified assessment in April of 2020 in which they said they all agree with the strong scientific consensus that this thing was not man-made or genetically modified. Why did our intelligence committee go out there and parrot uncritically the work of the scientists who were ethically compromised because they had gotten millions of dollars to do cooperative gain of function research with the Wuhan Institute of Virology where we know we had significant securities concerns? Two years prior to the outbreak, we had security concerns flagged by our government. We have to get to the bottom of this. And Fauci telling us that any criticism of him is questioning science is the most unscientific statement I could imagine. Science is about being able to disconfirm and disprove your prior beliefs."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "What's very strange about all of this is we have a government that has locked down millions of people, and state governments and blue states, locked down, devastated the lives of children, destroyed small businesses. And it turns out we may have funded the lab that started this whole mess. And we are not going to do a commission on that? Nancy is doing the commission on January 6th or whatever she's calling it, but we're not going to have a commission on this? If these dots ultimately get connected, it's one of the biggest scandals in the history of the United States, certainly maybe the world."

    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "It's already the biggest intelligence failure since 9/11. What is even more troubling is we have a government who believed that we could trust the Chinese Communist Party to be responsible, right, which is absolutely crazy."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "No, no. Fauci did that. Fauci trusted them. He told me that February of 2020 before he stopped coming on the show. Congressman, thank you for staying on this. And a Pennsylvania school board come under fire from parents upset at that divisive curriculum being taught to their kids, so what did the school board do? They took down the videos. The man who exposed them, though, is here next."

      "utterance": "Parents all over the country are rallying against their school districts when they embrace that Critical Race Theory, you've seen it. But one district's reaction was absolutely shocking. It's the Pennsbury school district in Pennsylvania. It was caught scrubbing public testimony against its racially divisive curriculum from the Internet. It's a stunning discovery, and it led Simon Campbell, a former member of the school board there, to lay into his former colleagues."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
      "utterance": "No. It's unbelievable to me. The good news is I have calmed down since then. I haven't had to shout at any left-wing fascists. I've had a cup of tea. When I found out, before we even get into Critical Race Theory, that they were literally screaming and shouting parents down for peacefully speaking against public policy, and then cutting the videotape of public comment that they were posting on the school district's website, I spoke to a mom outside the school board meeting room a few minutes I went in, and she said she was too scared to speak at the prior meeting because of the activities of the school. And I'm like, this is the United States of America, this is not OK. So I kind of suited up and sat down and said, let's go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "After -- I guess this is according to a report that after that really contentious March meeting that was censored, the school board president, Christine Toy-Dragoni, sent a letter to parents that said one parent's comments, quote, \"contained microaggressions\" as well as explicitly racist ideas. She went on to write that \"Racist dog whistles are seemingly-innocuous often not noticeable to some but that explicitly communicate a more insidious and abusive message to a subset of the audience.\" So Simon, instead of answering the criticism, she is doing with the left always does, just basically accusing anyone who disagrees with her of thought crimes, racism, every other ism you can think of. Are you and others working to remove that cancer from the office that she serves in?"

      "utterance": "Yes, the tolerance lady. The tolerance lady is lobbying the school board president to ban speech because she knows best what Martin Luther King was talking about, not the public comment speaker. So the tolerance lady is being fanatically intolerant, and the school board president is going along with it. And the problem with it is this -- if you are a regular member of the public and you see public statements put out by school board president that basically say if you come down here and express your views, we are going to label you a racist, we are going to make public statements about you, and we're going to ban your speech from the tape of the meeting. That's like 1930s Germany."
