I know we need a white board to follow at home, but there are these two bills. And she said, I think there is, I think there is enough momentum and sign-off. Meanwhile, the head of the Progressive Caucus said no, we have dozens who are going to vote against us if they don't have a deal in place. There's a lot of mixed messages coming from Capitol Hill. JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"REUTERS\": There are. There is another piece to calculus. There's a possibility that if Nancy Pelosi, Speaker Pelosi, went ahead with that vote on the infrastructure bill, even if some Democrats didn't vote for it, that some Republicans might. I was speaking to a Republican source, or listening to a Republican source last night who said there was actually significant Republican support for that infrastructure bill as long as it's not tied to the reconciliation bill. So there is a big political calculus there. But obviously, the larger issue for President Biden and the Democrats is he is going to Glasgow this coming weekend for a global climate change conference and wants to have a victory in hand because a big chunk of both of those bills has to do with climate change. And if he arrives there without a deal and without something that he can show the rest of the world, this is what the United States is doing, it will undermine him on the world stage.",
