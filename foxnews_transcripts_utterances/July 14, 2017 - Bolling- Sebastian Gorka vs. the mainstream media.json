We are \"The Fox News Specialists.\" New names raising new questions about Donald Trump Jr. meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Fox News' John Roberts reporting a short time ago that there may have been at least eight people in attendance in that sit down. That includes a Russian-America lobbyist who reveals he's also attended the June 2016 meeting between the Russian lawyer, Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort. The lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, is a veteran of Soviet military counterintelligence unit. He has also reported ties to Russian intelligence, which is an accusation that he's denying, of course. Akhmetshin told the Associated Press today that the meeting was, quote, non-substantive, and he, quote, actually expected more serious discussion.

That includes a Russian-America lobbyist who reveals he's also attended the June 2016 meeting between the Russian lawyer, Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort. The lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, is a veteran of Soviet military counterintelligence unit. He has also reported ties to Russian intelligence, which is an accusation that he's denying, of course. Akhmetshin told the Associated Press today that the meeting was, quote, non-substantive, and he, quote, actually expected more serious discussion.

But, I mean, honestly, it was a meeting, it was a sit down, it was portrayed as some opposition research, it ended up being something about an adoption policy program that we were -- that was being pulled, that these people were lobbying for.

It required you to actually identify what policy, what requirement, what expectation was being made by the official government of the former Soviet Union. Now we have people one of whom is a citizen of the United States now, because he was born in Russia, it's OK to just simply dismiss and washed all of his actions as if he's an agent of the country from which he was born.

And even more beyond that, what really blows my mind that it had a lot more has been made of it, this group that she was somehow connected with was doing opposition research on Donald Trump.

And one thing I'd like to inject into this discussion that's never been brought up before in any of the debates, each one of us has a responsibility for our own health to an extent. And if we encourage personal responsibility, if we encourage prevention as part of it, we can lower health care costs. We can also make it possible to have a system where everyone is covered in America. That's what I stand for. I've written a legislation as a member of congress, Medicare for all.
