This is a huge storm system. And it's really strengthened here just over the course of today from a Category 2 storm up to a Category 4 storm all in the last several hours. Now, there's a defined eye wall right there. It's a big storm. It's a powerful storm with winds at 130 miles an hour. But it's still a really long ways away, still south of Bermuda. Here's the track it's going to make. You notice it stays a Category 4 storm as it heads closer to the U.S. coast. There's a lot of warm water there. And that's going to fuel this and only strengthen it. Now, what is the timing going to be with the system as it approaches the coast? I'm taking you now to Thursday morning, and you're sitting just off the coast. So the situation will be deteriorating by then, likely making landfall either Thursday afternoon or into the overnight hours. It's still a ways off. It could speed up or slow down. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So we're tracking the timing of this very closely as it moves that direction. But the speed, the intensity of the storm is going to be there. The wind speed, 130 miles an hour up to 156 miles an hour, staying a Category 4 storm, likely on the high end of this, so wouldn't be surprised if, when it made landfall, we're up close to 150-mile-an-hour winds, as there is a lot of fuel in the area for this. Now, typically, you don't see a storm that's sitting this far off towards Bermuda making its way all the way to the West Coast. Generally, it would turn north. But we have got a big high-pressure system kind of forcing it into the Southeast. And it's not going to have anywhere to go. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So all of our models are in pretty good agreement with this as we run over the course of the next couple of days several models, anywhere there from perhaps South Carolina, the Myrtle Beach, area, stretching up to the Outer Banks. That's where the models are currently taking this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The one caveat here is once we get to the coast, none of the models can really agree what happens next. Does it hover right around the coast, bringing a whole lot of rain? Does it quickly run inland? That's something we're going to have to wait and see. But if it does sit near the coast, besides just the very strong winds that we're obviously going to see, another concern is going to be rainfall. The longer it sits still, the more rain you're going to get. Current models are suggesting isolated areas, Neil, getting up to two feet of total precipitation, widespread across portions of North Carolina, up to Virginia, getting up over a foot of rain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So it's going to be windy, there's going to be the storm surge, but we're going to have to be really paying close attention to these rainfall totals as well.",

They can't force a merger. It's almost impossible. They could do it. There is a vote of the independent directors that would have to take place, but that's very difficult. For two years, where they can't force a merger between Viacom, the other property they own, and CBS, which Les Moonves was trying to prevent that. And that is essentially is a signal that the CBS board wants to sell CBS to a bigger player and that they're going to shop it. I have sources in there. And that's -- from what I understand, that's their intention. Now, who would buy it is another big story. AT&T probably can't, because they're ingesting Time Warner right now. Comcast can't because the Justice Department absolutely hates them. Trump hates the company, thinks it's too big. It's why they hate AT&T and Time Warner. They hate Comcast for the same reason, huge media conglomerate, merging distribution and content. So, they're kind of it. Maybe Verizon. Maybe you will see a tech company step up, an Amazon, a Netflix step up. The one problem I think they have in selling this thing right now is if AT&T is out, if Comcast is out, Verizon is kind of iffy, those tech companies are developing their own content. They may not want to buy this old-line media content. That might force CBS in the end to merge back up with Viacom, to do what Shari Redstone wanted to do for -- in the beginning, which caused the huge -- I mean, remember, Les Moonves sued Shari Redstone.",

This covers energy and water, VA and military construction, also the legislative branch, and they will move this through the Senate probably later this week and then the House of Representatives. Now, as you say, the president continues to threaten a shutdown over a border wall. They're not looking at funding that anytime soon. In fact, that may go after the end of the fiscal year, which is September 30. And I pressed House Speaker Paul Ryan a couple of days ago on this, because the president keeps threatening a shutdown.

Let's begin with that, perhaps a new 5.8-inch OLED device. This would be kind of a follow-up -- there you go -- follow-up to the current iPhone X. Maybe they will call it the iPhone Xs. You have the 6.5-inch OLED device. That could be up to 1,200 bucks to begin with. It's going to be a massive phone, edge-to-edge screen. And then you have the 6.1-inch device. This could be like the low end just starting at a mere $700, perhaps is more my style. And also there's talk about perhaps double SIM cards in these phones, Neil. That would be boon for those who like to travel internationally or perhaps have two cell data plans. That would be good. What about the Apple Watch? I have the 3 series. It's already out of date, apparently. We could be hearing about the 4 series, Apple Watch Series 4, where there will be a 15 percent larger display, more room for apps and watch faces, also of course compatible with the existing Apple Watch bands. And then what about other products that could be coming along? A lot of conjecture out there, but let's take a look at some of these. Wireless charging dock for up to three devices. That would be nice. You just throw your devices on this dock, and they all charge at the same time. They have been talking about this for a year. Could Wednesday be the day we hear about it? Wireless charging case for your AirPods. New big screen for the iPad Pro. You name it. Maybe an upgraded MacBook Air. Neil, when I do these things, I always feel like it's a commercial for Apple. But we should point out that Apple has a tremendous footprint, not only here, but around the world. Figure that in just the last 10 years, 1.2 billion phones have been sold, almost -- what is that, almost one in five across the entire planet? Well, what they do and the products they bring out has a big impact on everybody. And it's a huge business story, of course. So this Wednesday, 10:00 a.m. Pacific, we will start getting the details. And as I say, Gather Round. Some people say that could be an allusion to perhaps the new watch or perhaps a new docking device. Who knows, but we will find out on Wednesday.

We will be talking to the governor of South Carolina, Henry McMaster, who has just ordered a mandatory evacuation across the entire coastline. More than a million people are affected. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World,\" and a stormy world, at that. The president taking no chances as this monster storm approaches. He's already canceled the planned Jackson, Mississippi, rally for Friday, citing safety concerns. We're all over this with meteorologist Adam Klotz on just how bad things could get, and Susan Li on folks not really waiting very long to find out. We begin without hey Adam. Hey, Adam."

      "utterance": "Hey there, Neil. You said it. This is a huge storm system. And it's really strengthened here just over the course of today from a Category 2 storm up to a Category 4 storm all in the last several hours. Now, there's a defined eye wall right there. It's a big storm. It's a powerful storm with winds at 130 miles an hour. But it's still a really long ways away, still south of Bermuda. Here's the track it's going to make. You notice it stays a Category 4 storm as it heads closer to the U.S. coast. There's a lot of warm water there. And that's going to fuel this and only strengthen it. Now, what is the timing going to be with the system as it approaches the coast? I'm taking you now to Thursday morning, and you're sitting just off the coast. So the situation will be deteriorating by then, likely making landfall either Thursday afternoon or into the overnight hours. It's still a ways off. It could speed up or slow down. So we're tracking the timing of this very closely as it moves that direction. But the speed, the intensity of the storm is going to be there. The wind speed, 130 miles an hour up to 156 miles an hour, staying a Category 4 storm, likely on the high end of this, so wouldn't be surprised if, when it made landfall, we're up close to 150-mile-an-hour winds, as there is a lot of fuel in the area for this. Now, typically, you don't see a storm that's sitting this far off towards Bermuda making its way all the way to the West Coast. Generally, it would turn north. But we have got a big high-pressure system kind of forcing it into the Southeast. And it's not going to have anywhere to go. So all of our models are in pretty good agreement with this as we run over the course of the next couple of days several models, anywhere there from perhaps South Carolina, the Myrtle Beach, area, stretching up to the Outer Banks. That's where the models are currently taking this. The one caveat here is once we get to the coast, none of the models can really agree what happens next. Does it hover right around the coast, bringing a whole lot of rain? Does it quickly run inland? That's something we're going to have to wait and see. But if it does sit near the coast, besides just the very strong winds that we're obviously going to see, another concern is going to be rainfall. The longer it sits still, the more rain you're going to get. Current models are suggesting isolated areas, Neil, getting up to two feet of total precipitation, widespread across portions of North Carolina, up to Virginia, getting up over a foot of rain. So it's going to be windy, there's going to be the storm surge, but we're going to have to be really paying close attention to these rainfall totals as well."

I want to take you to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, right now, the calm before the storm, I guess, here. This is part of the South Carolina coast that the governor of that state has recommended be cleared out ahead of this storm. We will be talking to him shortly. That's better than a million individuals who will have to get out of town and fast. Some of the usual precautions ahead of that are cruise lines and airlines that are taking precautions of their own. Fox Business Network's Susan Li on what they're doing right now -- Susan."

      "utterance": "All right, Neil, so Hurricane Florence, of course, impacting travel. Six cruise ships are being diverted as a result. That includes three Carnival Cruise Line itineraries, two Norwegian ones, changing course, and one Oceania scheduled. They were all headed for the Caribbean, Bermuda or the Bahamas, which they will now skip or completely stay away from. In fact, one Norwegian cruise was supposed to sail south from Boston. Instead, now it's sailing north to Canada in order to avoid Hurricane Florence. So be sure to check with your cruise line operators to confirm those schedules. Airlines also waiving change fees, as Hurricane Florence continues to strengthen. American Airlines, Southwest waving fees that usually cost as much as $200, plus a difference in fares, so flyers can alter their travel plans accordingly. And given the path of Hurricane Florence, 23 airports will likely be impacted. That includes two major airline hubs, Delta's Atlanta hub and American's Charlotte hub. And that's usually a connecting point for many, many flights in one day. Now, for those that are traveling and they're boarding up their homes, this is helping lift some shares. We're talking about home supply companies like Home Depot and Lowe's. They are very busy during hurricane season. And power also being impacted, so home generator supplier Generac and roofing supplier Beacon likely as well seeing higher spending during this time. Insurance companies in focus as well. Travelers, All State are falling today, with high-end real estate insurer Chubb. And that that's expected, of course, with damage and travel delay claims as a result of Hurricane Florence, which is spinning closer and closer to the Southeastern coastline, Neil. And also the Navy issuing a warning to the Norfolk, Virginia, hub as well. They're telling all able warships and submarines to basically sail away before Hurricane Florence makes landfall -- back to you."

Let's get the read from Michael Brown, the former FEMA director, of course, through Katrina, and so much more, learned the hard way what can happen when people aren't all on the same page. For now, Michael, it looks like everybody is, recognizing the urgency of what's approaching. Is there any risk in telling people days before something hits, when it might bypass them, to evacuate anyway?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MICHAEL BROWN, FORMER FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, because you always get the blowback that, hey, I'm going to follow the government's orders, I'm going to evacuate, and then it ends up going somewhere else. You always face that risk. It's always a no-win situation. But I think what people need to understand is, in this particular situation, you have all the models that predict the hurricane basically going the same direction. And I think the hurricane itself will probably maintain a Category 4 status, based on all the reports I have read. But once it makes landfall, once it begins to break down, you're going to have a major flooding event in North Carolina, perhaps Virginia, West Virginia, because these storms tend to peter out. And then, as they start petering out, you just get this deluge of rain. And then you have flash flooding in all these hills of the Carolinas and the Virginias."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "For some in the affected path of this storm, for example, in the Carolinas, they have not had a direct hit in the better part of three decades of a storm of any consequence like this. So maybe they get sort of cavalier, or just a little too easy going about it. What would you advise them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BROWN",
      "utterance": "Well, in fact, they do get too cavalier. And I would remind them that the same thing that is occurring right now occurred back in, I think, either 2003 or 2004, and I forget the name of the hurricane. But it was coming up North Carolina, up toward the Virginia coast, and then began to dissipate and fall apart. But once it fell apart and made landfall, the rain just continued for days upon days. And instead of having a major hurricane event, we had a major flash flooding event that affected lots of North and South Carolina, lot -- parts of Virginia, almost all the way up into D.C. So, yes, people get cavalier about these things. But again, it's a major storm. It hasn't occurred in a while. Everybody's doing what they should be doing. And so I would just encourage people to do this. Make sure you're ready. Make sure that your homes are -- if you have a vacation home, that's boarded up. Pay attention to what people on the television stations and radio stations are saying. If they recommend an evacuation, know where you're going to go. Don't wait until that day to figure out, oh, how am I going to get from point A to point B, because those roads may be blocked because of flash flooding. Think about what you need to do."

In fact, Vice President Mike Pence was talking about this on \"FOX News Sunday\" with our Chris Wallace. And he made a very interesting point in the conversation with Chris Wallace. He said, listen, first of all, that writer will probably expose who they are, they will have loose lips, they will talk to someone, and they will be exposed.

That sentiment was actually echoed today by Sarah Sanders. But, obviously, The Times would disagree.

We're going to be speaking to the state's governor on what he is doing to prepare for that and anything else, as four states have already declared states of emergency. They are Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and, as I said, the aforementioned South Carolina. Meanwhile, another big media executive goes down. This is Les Moonves. The thing about Charlie Gasparino's and his reporting on this is, a lot of people were of the assumption, well, he leaves with big pay package, all is fine, no need to second-guess any of that.

So, if the investigation into those sexual misconduct allegations comes back very bad for him, they are going to withhold that. They're going to essentially terminate him, fire him. And then with that, all his perks go away. He doesn't get to keep -- get the driver, he doesn't get the office for two years, as most departing CEOs usually get. He doesn't get his security. It's done. They sever the relationship. That's one story. And we will know I think within the next month or two what's going on there. The second story, I think, is a corporate story with CBS. What is its future? And if you -- again, confirming our reporting, if you look in the agreement today, there is a stand-still agreement between the controlling Redstone families -- family and CBS, meaning Redstone family can't touch CBS for two years. They can't force a merger. It's almost impossible. They could do it. There is a vote of the independent directors that would have to take place, but that's very difficult. For two years, where they can't force a merger between Viacom, the other property they own, and CBS, which Les Moonves was trying to prevent that. And that is essentially is a signal that the CBS board wants to sell CBS to a bigger player and that they're going to shop it. I have sources in there. And that's -- from what I understand, that's their intention. Now, who would buy it is another big story. AT&T probably can't, because they're ingesting Time Warner right now. Comcast can't because the Justice Department absolutely hates them. Trump hates the company, thinks it's too big. It's why they hate AT&T and Time Warner. They hate Comcast for the same reason, huge media conglomerate, merging distribution and content. So, they're kind of it. Maybe Verizon. Maybe you will see a tech company step up, an Amazon, a Netflix step up. The one problem I think they have in selling this thing right now is if AT&T is out, if Comcast is out, Verizon is kind of iffy, those tech companies are developing their own content. They may not want to buy this old-line media content. That might force CBS in the end to merge back up with Viacom, to do what Shari Redstone wanted to do for -- in the beginning, which caused the huge -- I mean, remember, Les Moonves sued Shari Redstone."

This covers energy and water, VA and military construction, also the legislative branch, and they will move this through the Senate probably later this week and then the House of Representatives. Now, as you say, the president continues to threaten a shutdown over a border wall. They're not looking at funding that anytime soon. In fact, that may go after the end of the fiscal year, which is September 30. And I pressed House Speaker Paul Ryan a couple of days ago on this, because the president keeps threatening a shutdown.

And we don't do long-term spending plans. We don't do the budget the way it's supposed to be done. So, here we are at the end of the fiscal year again. We're just a couple weeks out. And we're going to be saying, OK, instead of doing this maxibus, like we did a few months ago, now we're going to do a couple of minibuses. And it's basically -- basically, you're opening up a box of sneakers, except it's in several boxes, instead of one big box. So you're still doing the massive spending. And you're not taking care of what you should be doing. And that's the real problem. And Republicans always get the blame for it.

This last week, we saw really positive job numbers, not only because jobs are created and the economy remains strong, but because wages are going up. And, remember, that was one of the crucial promises made when the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, or in this case tax cuts 1.0, was passed in December. So, 2.0 is a great vision-setting opportunity for Republicans to remind Americans what it is they stand for and, at the same time, making permanent some of the promises in that law. Like you mentioned, that individual side of the code is so important to give certainty for families and businesses across the country."

Now, a lot of parties in the past that have been shepherding recoveries have said much the same. But they have gotten something from it at the polls. Republicans are fearful they might not.

Republicans in the House know that their Senate colleagues don't have the votes to get these tax cuts through. And they have to be wondering whether or not they even have the 216 votes in the lower chamber to get this to the finish line. So, tax cuts 2.0 aren't necessarily about legislating. They are about messaging and forcing Democrats to go back on the record and vote against a second round of tax cuts at a moment when you have Barack Obama kind of coming out of the woodwork awkwardly and taking credit for the current booming economy. So Republicans see this as an opportunity to force Democrats to, you know, vote no again, and then hopefully regain some of the momentum that they have lost going into the midterms, because, like you said, they don't think they have gotten the return on investment that they deserve."

I think there's an interesting question with House Republicans in the blue states on the coasts, people like Dana Rohrabacher and others, Peter King in New York. What about a Republican voting no? They are concerned about the SALT deduction, which obviously affects high income earners in those states because they are high-tax states.

They keep saying that, well, we would vote for tax cuts, just not the ones that we don't like. Prove it. You go to the -- go to the floor and not vote against a tax cut for the average American.

Let's begin with that, perhaps a new 5.8-inch OLED device. This would be kind of a follow-up -- there you go -- follow-up to the current iPhone X. Maybe they will call it the iPhone Xs. You have the 6.5-inch OLED device. That could be up to 1,200 bucks to begin with. It's going to be a massive phone, edge-to-edge screen. And then you have the 6.1-inch device. This could be like the low end just starting at a mere $700, perhaps is more my style. And also there's talk about perhaps double SIM cards in these phones, Neil. That would be boon for those who like to travel internationally or perhaps have two cell data plans. That would be good. What about the Apple Watch? I have the 3 series. It's already out of date, apparently. We could be hearing about the 4 series, Apple Watch Series 4, where there will be a 15 percent larger display, more room for apps and watch faces, also of course compatible with the existing Apple Watch bands. And then what about other products that could be coming along? A lot of conjecture out there, but let's take a look at some of these. Wireless charging dock for up to three devices. That would be nice. You just throw your devices on this dock, and they all charge at the same time. They have been talking about this for a year. Could Wednesday be the day we hear about it? Wireless charging case for your AirPods. New big screen for the iPad Pro. You name it. Maybe an upgraded MacBook Air. Neil, when I do these things, I always feel like it's a commercial for Apple. But we should point out that Apple has a tremendous footprint, not only here, but around the world. Figure that in just the last 10 years, 1.2 billion phones have been sold, almost -- what is that, almost one in five across the entire planet? Well, what they do and the products they bring out has a big impact on everybody. And it's a huge business story, of course. So this Wednesday, 10:00 a.m. Pacific, we will start getting the details. And as I say, Gather Round. Some people say that could be an allusion to perhaps the new watch or perhaps a new docking device. Who knows, but we will find out on Wednesday. But what Apple does always has a big impact, Neil. And, yes, the $700 version, even that's -- I'm going to stick with the abacus."

      "utterance": "Boy, it looks so beautiful and peaceful there in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, but it's what's coming that has the governor of South Carolina preparing for the worst and urging people along the coast, all a million of them along the Palmetto State's coast, to get out of Dodge and do so by tomorrow. The governor joins me now on the phone, Governor Henry McMaster. Governor, thank you for taking the time. Why did you decide to do this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. HENRY MCMASTER, R-S.C.",
      "utterance": "Well, we don't want to gamble with a single life. This is a big hurricane. We haven't seen one quite like it. It is coming straight at us east -- from the east to the west, instead of sort of coming up from the south. And they high pressure that high pressure that's keeping it coming on the course towards us. It is going to cross the Gulf Stream, as we know there is nothing to stop it. So, we are ready. North Carolina is ready. I talked to Governor Roy Cooper twice today, and we are hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. And we want to get people out of the way, because we are just not going to gamble with this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, I think it's a smart strategy, Governor. I do wonder, though, your state, like others in prior storms dating back to 15, 16 years, sometimes have problems when you have to get people out fast. And, sometimes, they are allowed to go in on highways in the opposite direction to clear it all out, and there was confusion at the time, not only your state, many others. But how is it working out this time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCMASTER",
      "utterance": "We have no confusion. We haven't had any in some time. We have four roads that we are reversing. That is, all lanes will be leading away from the coast in four roads starting at noon tomorrow. People who want to go to the coast will have to take the other roads. The four big ones are pulling out. Everybody can ride in all one direction away from the storm all the way up to the center of the state."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Governor, we are told that this storm is going to hang around a while. So, it's going to do a lot of flooding. So, that makes it even more tricky for you, sort of like what Sandy was in New York, New Jersey, Northeast some years back. How do you prepare for that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCMASTER",
      "utterance": "Well, that's exactly right. This one -- Florence has got more wind than Hugo did. It's faster, high velocity, more rain than Matthew. And, as you say, it's very high velocity, very powerful. But when it gets to the land, it will be moving slowly across the land, which means it will be sitting here raining on us for a long time. So, we are preparing for a whole lot of flooding, as well as these high winds and the surge coming up, maybe 10 feet high, above ground, on the coast. But we are going to get it from the coast and we're going to get it from behind with the flooding. But team South Carolina is prepared. We have people who have been working on this and nothing else for days now."

      "speaker": "MCMASTER",
      "utterance": "We have sent the documents there to have a federal state of emergency declared here. We have been in touch with FEMA and their representatives have been with us all day today. And we are expecting to get everything we need."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Governor, there are a lot of your residents who are no doubt watching, listening to this broadcast who are saying, you know, they try to scare us, and then we end up packing up to leave or try to leave and it ends up not being necessary. What do you want to tell them? They're listening right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCMASTER",
      "utterance": "Well, that's one of the things about living in paradise here in South Carolina, is that we are preparing for the worst. We are hoping for the best. But we are not going to gamble with a single South Carolina life. It may be inconvenient, but we would rather have everybody out and have no deaths and have everybody safe and happy. We can complain about it then if we want to come of it turns out to be unnecessary. But the way this is looking, it's an unpredictable hurricane. It's fierce, it's big. We haven't seen anything like this in a long time. We are not taking anything for granted. And we are not going to gamble with a single life in South Carolina."
