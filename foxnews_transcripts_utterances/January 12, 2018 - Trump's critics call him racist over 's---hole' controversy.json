What that said, he was saying he believes in merit based immigration. That was, I think, what he was trying to get at, because people in the room are saying, let's do a deal, let's bring in these people from third world countries, and the president has made it very clear, he wants to bring in people that are based on merit, whether it's a high education, whether it's English speaking. Those are the things that he wants to focus on. Immigration policy, he is trying to put forth, that's the priority for him. What got lost in his gaffe, I would say, was that people now are talking about that. And the deal is really hanging in the balance. He had a lot of momentum going into this.

JESSE WATTERS, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Yes, I mean, the leftist seized on this, but Trump gave them the weapon. He should not have said it. It wasn't a classy thing to say. It was crude. It was rude. I wouldn't say it but Trump is offensive. We've known Trump is offensive for a very long time. So, it shouldn't come as any surprise."

But putting that aside, the point he was making is that these countries that he was talking about -- I don't believe S hole countries, they are impoverished, they are riddled with corruption, and they have a lot of problems. What that said, he was saying he believes in merit based immigration. That was, I think, what he was trying to get at, because people in the room are saying, let's do a deal, let's bring in these people from third world countries, and the president has made it very clear, he wants to bring in people that are based on merit, whether it's a high education, whether it's English speaking. Those are the things that he wants to focus on. Immigration policy, he is trying to put forth, that's the priority for him. What got lost in his gaffe, I would say, was that people now are talking about that. And the deal is really hanging in the balance. He had a lot of momentum going into this. The tax thing was doing great. He had a great meeting and he was going to bring together a lot of people on the immigration overhaul. Now, all that's been lost, so he needs to do a lot to regain the momentum. I dislike the people on the left who -- and I know people and you know people who have been at cocktail people, they call the Bronx (ph) an S-hole. They call middle America and S-hole. These people that are in their studio, they're putting people down, they live in different parts of the country, they call the Celtics (ph), they call Christians bad things, people that say bad things, you know. What did Obama say about bitter clingers (ph)? Hillary called half of the country deplorable people. So the reaction in the media when they say Trump says this about another country, there have been Democrats that said horrible things about people in our own country and have not gotten criticized nearly as much as the president. So there's a little hypocrisy there, but again with that said, obviously, the president said the wrong thing here and has to do a lot better moving forward when it comes to blunt talk."

Apparently , there were reports that there were calls being made as to check in with people that they would like to talk to and everybody was given the thumb's up. And then this morning, that changed and he said that's not actually what I said. So we are actually two things now. We are having people who are defending the comments, but even if he didn't say the comments, the comments are OK. I mean, some of the defenders are saying that. So, agreeing with what Jesse said, it's not exactly surprising that you would have profanity in the White House. This happened in every White House. Remember in 2000 when I think President Bush, at the time a candidate said at one of The New York Times reporters, was a major league A-hole. GREG GUTFELD, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Really? Damn."

And Senator Dick Durbin is one of those people. And what happened is, this makes it so much harder for Dick Durbin to convince Democrats to go along with him, to try to get this deal done.

He could prove that by just saying merit based immigration can take people from those S-hole countries. You have to separate these two issues. I can believe that these countries are really bad, but people that come there can be really good. That's all he has to do. I think -- like I say, I find the word terrible and all of that stuff. But I am not going to be self-righteous about it. Because when I watch the media do it, I just want to -- I just can't handle how self-righteous the sanctimonious they are. I mean, these are people that if they went to a gym and there wasn't the right smoothie bar in there, they would call that an S hole, especially if they were living in New York City. If a gym did not have a personalized TV in front of their stair climber, that's an S-hole. I mean, everybody uses that word. You are right about the sentiment. That is why I think that you have to divide it. But the point is, and then I will shut up, it's always going to be about rhetoric versus action. Right now, nothing Donald Trump has done in terms of action has been the problem. In fact, the country is doing really well. We have high optimism in small business. We got crazy stock market. People are getting bonuses. There might be a secular revolution. You are seeing North Korea things happening. But the issue among the media is always going to be this coarse rhetoric which we all, I think, admit has always been the problem. Donald Trump makes Donald Trump a heavy lift for everybody. Because it's like a four- hour drive to Disneyland right when it's closing. You only get an hour ride. And that's what Trump is. He's a four-hour ride to Disneyland when it's about to close. As long as the economy does well and his actions are good, people will accept this heavy lift. But the economy goes down and there is an ugly -- something bad happens, then it's going to be an issue. I think people already know what they got."

He shouldn't have done this. It's wrong. And then he said, I didn't quite say it that way. You know, the language was not quite the same. I am amazed how many Republicans are put into the difficult position of having to defend President Trump over and over again. And distracting from the agenda, maybe it's intentional distraction, I don't know. But in this case, he has offended people so deeply, yet Republicans are like, like Paul Ryan, you know, it was wrong, that should have not done.

It stopped over 50 to 60 plots. Some plots were targeting the New York City subway, the New York stock exchange. They identify the bomber from this. They can track down cyber threats. So I think this is fine. Right now, I think we are surveilling 100,000 foreigners overseas. Sometimes those foreigners call here. And they may or may not talk to an American. That automatically gets picked up. It doesn't get read, but it get stored. And sometimes you need to look into the American phone call or e-mail quickly.

If there is a ticking time bomb situation, Kimberly knows, if you are really trying to go after these people hardcore, you don't have time to go to a judge and get a warrant. That's the argument.

It's really a battle against these really and well defined and pretty sophisticated means of communication that we have now today with telegraph and signals and encryption and then also trying to balance that, trying to work cooperatively with some of these phone providers, things of that nature, like we saw Apple push back and try to protect their users and not let you have the information.

He said, oh, no, this is a terrible thing. And then he gets into whether it's unmasking that is involved because, as Jesse just explained to you, sometimes, American agent have this looked and see what was said especially if they identified potential threat. And then Donald Trump apparently was then pressured by Paul Ryan and others who said, hey, wait a second, don't forget we are trying to protect the country. It is not about something bigger than you, it is about the terrorist threat. And you see people from across the political spectrum saying this is important. But when you come back to it, it is what Donald Trump's initial objection was. I think Judge Napolitano said on our own network said it opens the door to people getting caught up. American citizens in this wider net. So you get people like Rand Paul, Mike Lee and others saying, hey, wait a second, let's put in some of these protections.
