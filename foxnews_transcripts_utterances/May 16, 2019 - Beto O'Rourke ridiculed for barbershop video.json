So, if you have a wealthy minority kid from the suburbs that went to a great prep school, minority, he has it a lot easier than a poor white kid from the wrong side of the tracks with a single mom. So, admissions directors in college campuses, they can kind of rig the whole diversity quota. So, they have to have 400 minorities in a class, OK? In order to get those 400 people, they can just take 400 minority students from the nicest prep schools in New England, fathers and mothers, you know, executives at big companies, looks like a J. Crew catalog, OK? They have the same score as another minority from a broken home in a really rough neighborhood with a lot of crime who has had to overcome so many more obstacles to get the exact same scores as that other rich minority kid, and they are shut out of the admissions process?

Coercion mixed with cronyism and constantly bailed out by the adults, he scoffs, meaning the police who continue to make the city saver so Bill can ruin other things. He benefits from them, but also the past. Giuliani and Bloomberg help rebuilt the city that's now strong enough to endure this lumbering lurch. Really, he is gambling with somebody else's chips. And he got reelected, why? No one voted. When one party runs the joint, why bother? But America is different, the moment they get their taste of de Blasio, it will be a nationwide hurl. Prepare to duck. All right, Dagen, I got to go, why is he doing this? Do you have a theory? Because this is nuts. His -- even his own party -- let me just show this poll. Even his own party can't stand him. Do you have that poll that shows that like -- this is a, would you like to see Bill de Blasio run for president in 2020? Seventy-six percent no. Now the Democrats I think it is about 74 percent, why?"

They try to make a name with something that's a flaw. Like, so if you're a car company, you got to figure out why this model is not performing. Or if you are a network, you want to find out hey, why is our digital platform is flat? In this case, it's like, well, the border is the problem right now. We have a problem with the border. We have a problem with terror, we have a problem with the border. So, the guy that comes in and takes charge, is the CEO who is trying to solve a problem. That's what he is doing, and what he is doing is, as you're hearing specifics, it comes down to one choice and one choice only. Who has the choice? The United States or the world? What we learn from Germany when they forfeited their choice to the world, it woke the rest of the world up. It didn't work out. So, all Trump is asserting the authority of the country to make the decisions about their own border. Right? It's not, we can't -- we can't feel bad, you know, if we are not letting the world make that decision. We can't feel guilty, because we're not letting the world make that decision. It is our decision to make. We have to agree that these incentives -- if you want to have a great country with great safety nets and a great economy, then you have to have a great border, because the incentives without the border ends in a mess."

This takes into account student social and economic backgrounds, and it will focus on three areas including neighborhood, family environment, and the quality of the high school. Test takers won't know their scores, but colleges reviewing the applications, they will. The college board is defending the controversial new move saying it can ignore the disparities of wealth reflected in the test. So, Jesse, how do you -- you're a dad, you're going to have to deal with it shortly, what do you think of this as a step? I mean, they are saying, look, if you're -- you know, come from a wealthy family, your parents are college educated, you have a statistically higher chance of getting admission to the best schools in America."

It's how hard you work to overcome obstacles. That is the key to success. And right now, in this country I think class has more to do with race and how well people achieve in this country. So, if you have a wealthy minority kid from the suburbs that went to a great prep school, minority, he has it a lot easier than a poor white kid from the wrong side of the tracks with a single mom. So, admissions directors in college campuses, they can kind of rig the whole diversity quota. So, they have to have 400 minorities in a class, OK? In order to get those 400 people, they can just take 400 minority students from the nicest prep schools in New England, fathers and mothers, you know, executives at big companies, looks like a J. Crew catalog, OK? They have the same score as another minority from a broken home in a really rough neighborhood with a lot of crime who has had to overcome so many more obstacles to get the exact same scores as that other rich minority kid, and they are shut out of the admissions process? I just think this is a good little thing that they can use to their advantage."

I don't think that represents the universe of Democrats in the country, obviously. You see Biden rising. You see Pete Buttigieg, by the way, taking a lot of his team, why? Because I think Pete Buttigieg is not running a social media campaign he's actually going out and running a national campaign. He does better on \"The View\", better on \"Ellen\", better on all those shows."

He decided to make a change and not only did he talk the talk, he's really walked the walk, literally. In addition to changing his diet, he began walking to school every single day, no matter the weather. Clocking in two to four miles a day, also working on a local KFC, but traded in his normal fast food meals for a salad, soups and oatmeal. And he said it was a challenge, but a change he needed to make. Watch this. MICHAEL WATSON, STUDENT WHO LOST 115 POUNDS WALKING TO SCHOOL: I looked in the mirror and I was like, \"oh, yes, you've gotten pretty far\".
