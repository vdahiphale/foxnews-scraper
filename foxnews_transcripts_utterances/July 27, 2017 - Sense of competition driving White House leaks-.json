One of which, actually, Sarah Huckabee Sanders talked about today in the press briefing, and that was that the president likes to foster this healthy competition. I mean, we saw it in The Apprentice, that's kind of been his management style. So when you have that you've got people within the administration who are going to jockey, who are going to use the information that they're privileged to have, leak it to the media in order to make others look bad, or in order to give to their position more credence with the public and the press. That's one big incentive for leaks. And the other is the fact that you've got, you know, these two individuals, Reince and Scaramucci in the White House, and you've got this major fight going on, right? And whatever they can do to try to divulge and then influence the president because he paid so much attention to the media that incentivizes leaks as well.",

Here's my response. The skinny bill policy is a disaster. The skinny bill as a replacement for Obamacare is a fraud. The skinny bill is a vehicle to getting conference to find a replacement. It is not a replacement in and of itself. The policy is terrible because you eliminate the individual employer mandate, which we all want eliminated, but we've actually have overall solution to the problem of Obamacare. So you're going to have increased premiums and most of Obamacare stays in place if the skinny bill becomes law. Not only do we not replace Obamacare, we politically own the collapse of healthcare. I'd rather get out of the way and let it collapse than have a half-ass approach where it is now our problem. So we're not going to do that with our vote. What we will do is move the process along. Our freedom caucus friends who I disagree with a lot, but sometimes I agree with them. Here's what Mark Meadows said. We would send a skinny bill to the president to question? The answer is no. So it becomes the vehicle for conference. Mark Meadows agrees the skinny repeal would be dead on arrival in the house, but he understands it's just a vehicle for a conference. Here's the problem. The whip in the house is suggesting the sum, that whatever we send becomes the final product, there will be no conference, and I am not going to vote for the skinny bill if I'm not assured by the house that there will be a conference for my idea and other ideas can be taken up so we can actually replace Obamacare. I'm not going to vote for a bill that is terrible policy and horrible politics just because we have to get something done. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So all three of us want to move the process along. We're encouraged by our leadership to be team players. They're coming up with a skinny bill that changes by the moment, but none of us believe it actually replaces Obamacare. Neither does the freedom caucus. And I need assurances from the speaker of the house and his team that if I vote for the skinny bill, it will not become the final product. It will be the vehicle to have a conference between the house and senate where we can consider a true replacement. If I don't get those assurances, I'm a no because I'm not going to vote for a pig in a poke, and I'm not going to tell people back in South Carolina that this product actually replaces Obamacare because it does not. It is a fraud. And with that, I'll turn it over to my great friend, John McCain.",

My position on this proposal would be largely guided by Governor Ducey's analysis of how it'd impact the people of our state. My friends, this is legislation that directly affects the lives of the people in my state. I trust my governor. I trust his people. And he is looking carefully at this. He's looking carefully at the skinny bill repeal, but he's also looking at steps that need to be taken in addition to it. So I am convinced that we can move forward, but we have to have an assurance that it will go to a normal conference. Right now, that is not the case. And we do not have the assurance that is the case. I believe that one of the major problems with Obamacare was that it was rammed through congress by Democrats without a single Republican vote. I believe we shouldn't make that same mistake again. And necessary, this is where we're about to hear from an antique phone that very few Americans have.",

But the point is, we've got to have Republicans and Democrats sit down together and come up with a bill that gets a majority in both houses. Otherwise, we're going to see this continuous gridlock. And I don't want to go on and on. But when we passed Obamacare in 2009, it split us. It split us dramatically. And it split us for years. It's time we sat down together and came up with a piece of legislation that addresses this issue. And don't think this issue is just out there sitting by itself. In my state, we're down to one healthcare provider in every county. Co- pays are going up by the hundreds -- you're right. You see the freshman show no respect for their elders. I'd just like to say, again, in my state, Obamacare is a failure. It needs to be fixed. We have fixes, but it's got to be done in the normal process. And what I'm afraid of, of course, is that this thing dies this week and then it sits out there over the August recess or whatever it is. It's time we sat down together and came up with solutions that the American people would overall support. I guarantee you, in my state, the status quo is not satisfactory, and that's one of the major reasons why I've been in constant contact with the governor of the state of Arizona, who bears large responsibility.

Last week's horrific deaths of 10 migrants that died of suffocation and heat exhaustion while being illegally smuggled in a tractor trailer tragically illustrates shows how dire the consequences are of continuing to kick the can down the road on real policy solutions around immigration reform. Sanctuary cities have been the answer for many of the pro-immigrant community. Now while the intention of sanctuary cities is to protect the immigrant community, I submit to you that they actually further endanger the immigrant community itself, along with greater law enforcement and the public itself.",

Homan's prosecution would not be wrong. Beyond blatantly breaking the law -- and for the record, I want to make it really clear, it is absolutely against the law to conceal, shield or harbor undocumented immigrants. Don't take my word for it. Look at the Code 8 USC 1324. Also, it flagrantly disregards, and it doesn't cooperate with existing law. And that doesn't make anybody safer. The dynamic created by willfully defining [SIC] our current immigration law leads to less witness cooperation in immigrant communities, more violence against ICE officers, and more undocumented immigrants being deported in the end. Now, listen, nobody appreciates and encourages the richness and the beauty of cultural diversity here in America more than me. But I am not here for sanctuary cities as a means to that end. Because they are blatantly illegal, and they're a Band-Aid solution that endangers society, law enforcement, and most, the very immigrants that they claim they're trying to protect. Now Eric, I know that you said that you are in favor of improving legal immigration. Some people, for some reason, think that's controversial for you to say as a conservative. But I don't get that. I would think that, in the conservative community, a law and order position would be fair.

You know it's not a leak in the classical -- in the legal sense. But I understand his frustration. At the same time, you know, Anthony Scaramucci is not a novice as to what the procedure looks like, so he knows the second that he actually enters the administration as he's now done, a lot of this -- the scrutiny and the disclosures and the publicness of all of these things, including the finances are going to be at a higher level."

He doesn't go through chief-of-staff Reince Priebus for this reason, because he's brought on. Think about it, have you ever seen -- have you even known another coms director that well, but who's been empowered with that much juice in the White House? I mean, he's the right guy to get there and clean the leaks up. They're going to stop leaking or the people are going to be fired, and just by nature of that the leaks are going to go away.

What's interesting and unique about this administration though, there's two big incentives for leaks. One of which, actually, Sarah Huckabee Sanders talked about today in the press briefing, and that was that the president likes to foster this healthy competition. I mean, we saw it in The Apprentice, that's kind of been his management style. So when you have that you've got people within the administration who are going to jockey, who are going to use the information that they're privileged to have, leak it to the media in order to make others look bad, or in order to give to their position more credence with the public and the press. That's one big incentive for leaks. And the other is the fact that you've got, you know, these two individuals, Reince and Scaramucci in the White House, and you've got this major fight going on, right? And whatever they can do to try to divulge and then influence the president because he paid so much attention to the media that incentivizes leaks as well."

The White House has sure a lot of political capital, you know within his own party right now because of the policy, because of healthcare, because of the Russia investigations. So, anything that's like we're going to crack down on these leaks, even though it's a good thing, it could look like they're continuing to hide behind, you know, this veil of they don't want to be transparent, they don't want to let people in, they want to, you know, make sure that they're protecting themselves against any kind of deeper look.

And I really don't care if it looks bad, Joe. I mean, at this point, I think that's why Scaramucci is being brought in at this point in the game to say, you know what? Whoever you are, there's no protection around it. If you're the source of the leak, I don't care if you're a senior adviser, you're getting fired."

Here's my response. The skinny bill policy is a disaster. The skinny bill as a replacement for Obamacare is a fraud. The skinny bill is a vehicle to getting conference to find a replacement. It is not a replacement in and of itself. The policy is terrible because you eliminate the individual employer mandate, which we all want eliminated, but we've actually have overall solution to the problem of Obamacare. So you're going to have increased premiums and most of Obamacare stays in place if the skinny bill becomes law. Not only do we not replace Obamacare, we politically own the collapse of healthcare. I'd rather get out of the way and let it collapse than have a half-ass approach where it is now our problem. So we're not going to do that with our vote. What we will do is move the process along. Our freedom caucus friends who I disagree with a lot, but sometimes I agree with them. Here's what Mark Meadows said. We would send a skinny bill to the president to question? The answer is no. So it becomes the vehicle for conference. Mark Meadows agrees the skinny repeal would be dead on arrival in the house, but he understands it's just a vehicle for a conference. Here's the problem. The whip in the house is suggesting the sum, that whatever we send becomes the final product, there will be no conference, and I am not going to vote for the skinny bill if I'm not assured by the house that there will be a conference for my idea and other ideas can be taken up so we can actually replace Obamacare. I'm not going to vote for a bill that is terrible policy and horrible politics just because we have to get something done. So all three of us want to move the process along. We're encouraged by our leadership to be team players. They're coming up with a skinny bill that changes by the moment, but none of us believe it actually replaces Obamacare. Neither does the freedom caucus. And I need assurances from the speaker of the house and his team that if I vote for the skinny bill, it will not become the final product. It will be the vehicle to have a conference between the house and senate where we can consider a true replacement. If I don't get those assurances, I'm a no because I'm not going to vote for a pig in a poke, and I'm not going to tell people back in South Carolina that this product actually replaces Obamacare because it does not. It is a fraud. And with that, I'll turn it over to my great friend, John McCain."

I'm in close consultation with Arizona governor, Doug Ducey, regarding this so-called skinny repeal and its potential impact on the state of Arizona. My position on this proposal would be largely guided by Governor Ducey's analysis of how it'd impact the people of our state. My friends, this is legislation that directly affects the lives of the people in my state. I trust my governor. I trust his people. And he is looking carefully at this. He's looking carefully at the skinny bill repeal, but he's also looking at steps that need to be taken in addition to it. So I am convinced that we can move forward, but we have to have an assurance that it will go to a normal conference. Right now, that is not the case. And we do not have the assurance that is the case. I believe that one of the major problems with Obamacare was that it was rammed through congress by Democrats without a single Republican vote.

But the point is, we've got to have Republicans and Democrats sit down together and come up with a bill that gets a majority in both houses. Otherwise, we're going to see this continuous gridlock. And I don't want to go on and on. But when we passed Obamacare in 2009, it split us. It split us dramatically. And it split us for years. It's time we sat down together and came up with a piece of legislation that addresses this issue. And don't think this issue is just out there sitting by itself. In my state, we're down to one healthcare provider in every county. Co- pays are going up by the hundreds -- you're right. You see the freshman show no respect for their elders. I'd just like to say, again, in my state, Obamacare is a failure. It needs to be fixed. We have fixes, but it's got to be done in the normal process. And what I'm afraid of, of course, is that this thing dies this week and then it sits out there over the August recess or whatever it is. It's time we sat down together and came up with solutions that the American people would overall support. I guarantee you, in my state, the status quo is not satisfactory, and that's one of the major reasons why I've been in constant contact with the governor of the state of Arizona, who bears large responsibility.

By the way, he can be your president. Just move to Canada, and he'll be your president. And do us all a favor and bring the rest of the editors and writers at Rolling Stone with you. We'd love that. But really, could the media be any more biased against Trump? If you listen to the media, all they seem to want to do is repeatedly cry \"Russia, Russia, Russia.\" They even claim Trump's approval rating is tanking because of Russia. But something isn't adding up again. Take a look at scenes from President Trump Wednesday night in Ohio. Just look at those crowds. Listen to them for a second. I'm going to double down on a call I made over a year ago. Watch the people, not the polls. This president is popular with the people. Not the New York crowd or the L.A. crowd and certainly not the mainstream media, maybe not even some people on this set. But real people. Middle American people. People who care about their families' bottom lines, their wages and whether or not they can buy their kids back-to-school supplies and maybe a new outfit for the first day of class. That's what matters to America. The real America. They really don't give a damn about Russia, period. The despicable Washington Post complained about this. A couple nights ago, the president spoke at the Boy Scouts jamboree. And the Wash Po complained it was indoctrinating the kids. Seriously, Wash Po? Now you have a problem with the Boy Scouts. You just don't get it, media and liberals. America loves a president who addresses the Boy Scouts. And to my fellow deplorables, stop listening to the fake news media, the propaganda stream media. Watch the people, not the polls. Trust me, you'll get called names. You'll get ridiculed. You'll be made fun of, and in the end you'll be right, and the emphasis is on \"right.\" All right.

At least it's not as bad as their Boston bomber glamor shot cover. So they need to spend more time fact-checking their campus rape stores and less time doing this."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"The Fox News Specialists.\" Our specialists today are Kirsten Haglund and Joe DeVito. Let's continue the conversation. U.S. officials confirming to Fox News that Iran has launched a rocket carrying a satellite into space. The move marks the country's most significant step to date towards a possible long-range missile launch. Officials are also warning that North Korea could be preparing yet another missile test."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "No surprise there. I mean, this is what we know, right? I mean, again, I'm not suggesting anything radical or overreactive, but the days of putting our head in the sand and pretending that things are developing at a rate that is going to be very, very difficult to get in front of, if not impossible. We cannot afford to do that any longer. Period."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGLUND",
      "utterance": "You know what is kind of disappointing, as well, is that there was -- initially, it seemed like some momentum with the Chinese president and President Trump. You know, it seemed like there was a relationship that was forming there. And there was an expectation that there was maybe going to be some help from the Chinese on pressuring North Korea, and yet, we haven't seen that develop. I hope we will. The other interesting thing about Iran is that, you know, we have to tread carefully there because of their help with Iraq and rebuilding that government there and stabilizing it. So there's this interesting dynamic playing out in the Middle East right now. And as we've seen, even as hard as President Trump was going on the Iran deal, now we've had to now kind of, you know, take our hands off that a little, even though there's sanctions. So the polarization in the region right now is really interesting to keep a watch on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEVITO",
      "utterance": "Well, it's nice to see that two-thirds of the Axis of Evil are still getting things done. And in Iran, I guess the best we can hope for is they put that satellite up there to maybe get free Playboy Channel or something. It's -- I'm more concerned about them than North Korea, because whenever they show Kim Jong- un at some site where they're doing testing, if you look at their technology, you realize it's completely fake. He's got -- he's looking at, like, a microwave that's plugged into a power strip. So I don't think North Korea is going to be able to do anything, even though they already have the nukes. I'd be more worried about Iran."

      "utterance": "I think you can step up. I think you can renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal. I think that Trump is going to do it. There's certain time frames that they had to hit, and they had to put the check -- they had to check the box like last week and the week before."

      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "But I think they're going to re -- just look at that and see if we can reapply the sanctions. Because I think sanctions will hurt Iran. As far as North Korea, I'm on record as saying we need to do something pre- emptively, whether it's, you know, get in there with our intel computer, with our very, very capable computer, cyber people and dismantle it from inside. And let them say, we did it. Yes, we did it. So what? Stop shooting bombs at us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "All right. Well, we've got enough time for that. Next up, the heat is on for sanctuary cities. The head of ICE warns that city leaders could be slapped with smuggling charges if they don't obey immigration laws. Eboni's \"Docket.\" We'll break it down next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Time now for \"The Docket.\" Few issues are as controversial, emotionally polarizing or divisive as illegal immigration. It is such a hot-button policy issue that I submit to you that Donald J. Trump rose to the presidency on its intensity. Last week's horrific deaths of 10 migrants that died of suffocation and heat exhaustion while being illegally smuggled in a tractor trailer tragically illustrates shows how dire the consequences are of continuing to kick the can down the road on real policy solutions around immigration reform. Sanctuary cities have been the answer for many of the pro-immigrant community. Now while the intention of sanctuary cities is to protect the immigrant community, I submit to you that they actually further endanger the immigrant community itself, along with greater law enforcement and the public itself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOM HOMAN, ACTING DIRECTOR OF ICE",
      "utterance": "Sanctuary cities are criminals' biggest friend. If you're an alien smuggler, and you're smuggling people in this country as -- for a living, that is one -- that's one sales pitch: \"We can get you to a sanctuary city where that city will help shield you from immigration.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "So you know, I've said it -- every time I speak, I say it",
      "utterance": "Sanctuary cities need to help us keep their communities safe. Sanctuary cities not only endanger public safety. They endanger my law enforcement officers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So Homan so strongly feels that way that he is threatening prosecution of those aiding and abetting human smuggling with the promising of delivering undocumented men, women and children -- children -- to, quote, \"safe havens\" known as sanctuary cities. Homan's prosecution would not be wrong. Beyond blatantly breaking the law -- and for the record, I want to make it really clear, it is absolutely against the law to conceal, shield or harbor undocumented immigrants. Don't take my word for it. Look at the Code 8 USC 1324. Also, it flagrantly disregards, and it doesn't cooperate with existing law. And that doesn't make anybody safer. The dynamic created by willfully defining [SIC] our current immigration law leads to less witness cooperation in immigrant communities, more violence against ICE officers, and more undocumented immigrants being deported in the end. Now, listen, nobody appreciates and encourages the richness and the beauty of cultural diversity here in America more than me. But I am not here for sanctuary cities as a means to that end. Because they are blatantly illegal, and they're a Band-Aid solution that endangers society, law enforcement, and most, the very immigrants that they claim they're trying to protect. Now Eric, I know that you said that you are in favor of improving legal immigration. Some people, for some reason, think that's controversial for you to say as a conservative. But I don't get that. I would think that, in the conservative community, a law and order position would be fair. I'm saying blatantly, I do not support sanctuary cities, but we've got to get serious about immigration reform."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Agree. And I'm glad to hear that. I'm very glad to hear that. If there's any question where the administration stands on sanctuary cities, Tom Homan, the acting director of ICE, just cleared it all up. He was very succinct. He said, \"No, we're not going to support this. We're not going to help out, and we may go after sanctuary cities.\" I mean, he was very succinct about that. I think he's got it right, and I'm glad to hear that we're taking a harder stand on illegal immigration and an open mind about increasing legal immigration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "And I think that, Kat, for a lot of people that are very pro- immigrant, that's the part of the conversation they're not hearing enough of. They're not hearing people talk about proactively really getting in there and unclogging a very broken and failed current immigration system that really leads people to be so desperate. And I don't think it's OK, and I don't think it's right. But it's that desperation is why ten people are dead now, because they were being smuggled over in a tractor trailer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, absolutely correct. I think that there are some conservatives, though, that don't really see the value in legal immigration. And I know that A.G. Jeff Sessions is one of them. So I think that's why people, when they hear him say anything about illegal immigration, illegal immigration, they just get terrified overall. And I'm -- I am -- completely think the solution is making it easier for people to come here legally. Because immigrants do provide a lot of benefits to our economy and our culture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Now, Kirsten, that's not something that you hear a lot of in GOP circles, in terms of when you talk about policy reform. That's not something that I can point to a lot of Republicans coming out and really speaking on the record about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGLUND",
      "utterance": "No, they're not. I mean, it's a political football, and it's very, very touchy. What they also need to talk about, though, however: making it easier to come here. They need to deal with the backlog in the Justice Department of cases, which means more money and more lawyers into doing this. That's also an incentive for people to come here."

      "utterance": "Joe, quickly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEVITO",
      "utterance": "And I think also, it shows you it's a question of supply and demand. If you -- if you make it more difficult at the end for people to try and get here illegally, you're going to save lives. And I'd also like to see them not only go after sanctuary cities but also after employers who chronically employ illegals. Because they're just making things worse."
    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

Going to hit the Reagan Library on Saturday and Las Vegas Country Club on Saturday night. Those are tickets. You don't want to miss that. We're going to have a blast, sign some books and have a lot of fun. And then on Sunday, I'll be in Texas. I'll be in Katy, Texas, first and then Grapevine Mills, Grapevine, Texas, in the afternoon.

I'm looking forward to that in the fall with you; it will be fun. This is a heartwarming story. This is an NFL player by the name of John Urschel. He's 26 years old. There you see him in his Baltimore Ravens uniform, huge guy. Very successful in the NFL. Retiring at age 26 after only three years in the league, because he's pursuing a Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT. I just think that is amazing."

There was a man in Florida who robbed a bank, and then he got -- he ran down the street naked, throwing money at people. And he was arrested, and everyone said, \"What?\" And he said he did this, he decided to do this to try to launch his career as a stand-up comedian, or as a comedian. He told the FBI, and I don't believe that they're finding it funny. And he's now nowhere on the comedy career, but he is, you know, facing federal charges now."
