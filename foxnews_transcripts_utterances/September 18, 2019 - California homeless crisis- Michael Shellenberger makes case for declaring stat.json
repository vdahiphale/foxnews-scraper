The question is, do they apply the same standard to themselves? Well, today we have breaking news about the past of a well-known progressive, and once again confirms that no, the standards are not the same.

The story they're telling you, Kamala Harris, she is a star, destined for big thing. She is like Obama 2.0, even more woke, with even more diversity points. Out there in America, they love Kamala Harris. She's a folk hero. She's like Pete Seeger. For eight months, they've tried to cram that story down your throat, and at times, it looked almost semi-plausible if you closed one eye. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } During the first wave of primary debates, for example, Harris took a swing at the front runner. She denounced Joe Biden as a racist for having doubts about school busing. It later emerged that Harris herself had had doubts about school busing. In fact, almost no African-American family in America supported school busing. It was a disaster. \"The Washington Post\" rushed to a rescue, quote, \"Kamala Harris's takedown of Joe Biden was more brutal than it seems.\" Look at the headline, yes, brutal. She has dominated the guy. It's o ludicrous. It turns out she didn't actually dominate anybody, and she is not dominating anybody. A new poll from California, obviously her home state which he represents in the United States Senate shows Harris way at the back of the pack. She has now dropped into fifth place. She's polling at six percent. How bad is that? Well, here's some perspective. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As of today, Kamala Harris is losing to Andrew Yang, the anti-circumcision candidate. And by the way, she ought to be losing to Andrew Yang. Whatever you think of Yang's ideas, Andrew Yang is smart. He is original. He is totally genuine. Harris is the opposite. Harris is a soulless corporate shill who hasn't uttered a single authentic word and she entered public life. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Harris, by the way, is the daughter of a Stanford Professor, which is great, good for her. And yet she somehow pretends she overcame segregation. Right? As Tulsi Gabbard pointed out, Harris is also a former prosecutor. She put others in jail for marijuana, but she now brags about smoking weed herself and listen to rap because she's cool. In other words, Harris embodies everything that is grating and unlikable about neoliberals, mindless children of privilege who sneer at those below them for not obeying. It turns out even a lot of faithful Democratic voters find the whole thing totally unbearable because it is unbearable. I mean, really. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mercifully, it looks like the Kamala Harris campaign is doomed to dry up and blow away and that can't come too soon.

At the time, the 29-year-old was teaching in a private school called West Point Grey Academy. The school was holding an Arabian Nights theme gala and Trudeau was dressed up as a character from \"Aladdin\" complete with robes, headdress and brown skin. The party was attended by faculty, administrators and parents and the photo was given to \"Time\" formerly \"Time\" magazine by a Vancouver businessman who was part of the West Point Grey community and the man said it's important the public see the picture. Others identified in the photo did not respond to \"Time's\" request for comments. But this is not a good start to the Prime Minister's reelection campaign because Trudeau is already involved in a scandal over whether he pressured his then Attorney General to drop corruption charges against a large and powerful Canadian engineering firm. It also may not sit well with voters considering Trudeau has called himself a champion of minority groups and Canada's many cultures. Justin Trudeau is of course the son of the late Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau. He is speaking right now. He was asked if he will resign. He did not answer the question.

Ahmed Alani is not yet facing any terrorism charges, but the judge who denied him bail called his actions reckless and unconscionable and said there was evidence he was at least sympathetic to terrorists. Two weeks ago American Flight 2834 from Miami to Nassau, Bahamas was on the runway when the pilot got an error light and turned back to the gate. A mechanic then found a tube in the plane's navigation system had been deliberately obstructed meaning the pilots would not have known the airplane's speed, pitch and other critical data.

In some states, you even have to produce an ID to buy spray paint at a hardware store. And you know, I don't -- no one thinks it's an assault on democracy. All the things she said, I just was looking them over. The lack of election security. Well, you know, we had an aborted recount in Michigan after the election. The Democrats were running it. They went into Detroit, 662 precincts, they found out that in 40 percent of those precincts in the City of Detroit, there were more votes cast than there were registered voters. Now, do you think that lack of election security benefited her or Donald Trump? She was talking about \"voter suppression,\" quote-unquote, in Wisconsin, do you think it might have helped her campaign if she had campaigned in Wisconsin? And I like the fact, too, you just played the cut. She said, you could run the best campaign. How the hell would she know? She ran the worst campaign. CNN was even giving her the debate questions and she couldn't handle it. She said our norms are under assault. She ran around the country saying she was going to appoint Supreme Court justices who are going to overturn citizens -- you know, the Supreme Court decision, Citizens United in D.C. versus Heller, which basically meant if you read between the lines, she was going to gut the First and the Second Amendments to the United States Bill of Rights. I mean, I would say that's a problem. She said the rule of law is being undermined. Well, she got a subpoena to turn over her e-mails and then deleted 33,000 of them.

And already in a regular flu season to give you an idea, it kills half a million people around the world and infects a billion people every year. That's the flu that we have immunity to. That's the flu that your flu shot protects you against. But if we saw a new version, a pandemic strain, a serious one, not like the one we saw in 2009, but a really bad one with air travel, it could spread around the globe in a matter of days, and we wouldn't be prepared for it. We could make a pandemic vaccine, but that take months. We have a universal flu vaccine in the pipeline, but that's going to take five years before it is ready. We need it right now. And another thing, why don't we have the kinds of detection software, we need to tell me if someone is sick before they get symptoms. People travel on planes, right? They are close together. They're coughing on each other. They could be in Asia one day, and here in New York the next day spreading a serious killer like the flu. Flu spreads very easily. It lives on surfaces. It spreads through the air. It kills you -- it can get you quite sick. It can cause pneumonia. It can cause all kinds of other infections. I want to know that a person has it before they're even sick. We have the technology for that, we're not using it. And I want that flu vaccine that we can use against all strains that come out. What's going to get us in big trouble is a mutation, something that mutates from a bird or a bird-like creature to humans. We've seen it before. We saw it in 1918. If it happens now, you're going to also see a lot of panic. And one more thing, Tucker, bioterror, we've talked about that on the show here. You could take a flu molecule in the laboratory and change it. So it's one -- just that slight change genetically so that we've never seen it before.",

Well, today we have breaking news about the past of a well-known progressive, and once again confirms that no, the standards are not the same. We'll bring that to you in just a minute.

If you're like most Americans, you cannot. You have no real idea who Kamala Harris is.

The story they're telling you, Kamala Harris, she is a star, destined for big thing. She is like Obama 2.0, even more woke, with even more diversity points. Out there in America, they love Kamala Harris. She's a folk hero. She's like Pete Seeger. For eight months, they've tried to cram that story down your throat, and at times, it looked almost semi-plausible if you closed one eye. During the first wave of primary debates, for example, Harris took a swing at the front runner. She denounced Joe Biden as a racist for having doubts about school busing. It later emerged that Harris herself had had doubts about school busing. In fact, almost no African-American family in America supported school busing. It was a disaster. \"The Washington Post\" rushed to a rescue, quote, \"Kamala Harris's takedown of Joe Biden was more brutal than it seems.\" Look at the headline, yes, brutal. She has dominated the guy. It's o ludicrous. It turns out she didn't actually dominate anybody, and she is not dominating anybody. A new poll from California, obviously her home state which he represents in the United States Senate shows Harris way at the back of the pack. She has now dropped into fifth place. She's polling at six percent. How bad is that? Well, here's some perspective. As of today, Kamala Harris is losing to Andrew Yang, the anti-circumcision candidate. And by the way, she ought to be losing to Andrew Yang. Whatever you think of Yang's ideas, Andrew Yang is smart. He is original. He is totally genuine. Harris is the opposite. Harris is a soulless corporate shill who hasn't uttered a single authentic word and she entered public life. Harris, by the way, is the daughter of a Stanford Professor, which is great, good for her. And yet she somehow pretends she overcame segregation. Right? As Tulsi Gabbard pointed out, Harris is also a former prosecutor. She put others in jail for marijuana, but she now brags about smoking weed herself and listen to rap because she's cool. In other words, Harris embodies everything that is grating and unlikable about neoliberals, mindless children of privilege who sneer at those below them for not obeying. It turns out even a lot of faithful Democratic voters find the whole thing totally unbearable because it is unbearable. I mean, really. Mercifully, it looks like the Kamala Harris campaign is doomed to dry up and blow away and that can't come too soon. Even the press appears to have abandoned her. Their new crush, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts."

And so she had that big moment on the debate stage earlier in the summer when she went after Joe Biden on an issue important to the Democratic base, and then for some reason, she took her foot off the gas. And the rest of the summer has sort of been a lost one for her. And I think that's why even in her own state, as you point out, she is now polling fifth. I think that she is somebody as a prosecutor, right? She has the ability to take it to either Biden or Warren or somebody, but instead she made a decision at the last debate, she would just take it straight to President Trump as if they were having a general election contest."

I recently heard Kamala Harris who had switched strategies. Remember, she was looking at South Carolina, not spending too much time in New Hampshire. They fixed that. And then like, oh, wait, I guess we better go to Iowa. Go to Iowa and then she's talking a lot about the farmers and she can't seem to land and pull together a natural group. Now, I do think that if she is going to have maybe one last flailing chance, right, but I don't know if she is going to be able to mount a comeback.

I think that for Democrats especially, they'd be much better off if they want to try and take a dent -- put a dent into Biden's campaign is to actually attack him on something where he is insufficiently liberal. President Trump pointed it out when he talked about the crime bill and Joe Biden, remember he knows how to really dig in. They're all just basically just waiting to see if Joe Biden is going to crater. So far that hasn't happened and somebody is going to have to take a shot.

So for years, Congressman Ilhan Omar may have been in an illegal marriage with her biological brother, species of immigration fraud. Many have alleged this in the past and it's looking like there could be some fact at the core of it. So on Tuesday, Omar deleted a six-year old tweet wishing a Happy Father's Day to a man called Nur Said. Omar's ex-husband was called document Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. So it is Somali culture that a man's middle name is typically his father's name. That would suggest that this was a father and son. In other words, she would have been married to her biological brother. In a statement, Congresswoman Omar's office gave the justification for deleting the tweet. She said this. \"Representative Omar and her family are subject to constant threats. When people write vile things on posts about people she loves - including posting disturbing doctored images she takes them down. Nur Said means 'happy light.' It's been her dad's nickname since she was a kid. He is a public page with the same name. She isn't deleting it for the disturbing and hateful reasons that are being implied by conspiracy theorists and legitimate media outlet should not be spreading conspiracy theories.\" End quote. Her office in other words, trying to decide what the news media covers. We're going to bull forward anyway, though, in search of the truth. And for that we go to Scott Johnson tonight. He is an attorney who writes for the blog Power Line. He has covered the story from the very beginning, and he joins us tonight. Scott, thanks so much for coming on tonight.

And it's become clearer every day in particular this year, that she in fact, married her brother in the year 2009 for fraudulent purposes, and has been in a frenzy to delete social media evidence supporting that fact for the past three years and this tweet is one she somehow overlooked because it's kind of obscure, it is kind of in the weeds. You did a good job setting it up. And Luke Rosiak at \"Daily Caller\" also has a good piece with a long explanation with additional commentary on how this fits in. It's one small piece of the puzzle that I think establishes the fact and conclusion that what she did in 2009 is marry her brother. She didn't get around to divorcing him until the year 2017. And in between those years, she committed frauds of a wide variety that are of an incredible nature. We've never seen anything like it before. It's an incredible story.

She asked him whether he appeared with Omar and a picture of the two of them in London, if I recall it correctly, and whether he had married her. And I believe he acknowledged that he was in the picture, but he didn't recall marrying her. But you know, the interesting thing, I reached the conclusion last time, I was on, you asked me what my level of certainty on this story was? I am up to a hundred percent based on my own reporting. The guy who hasn't talked at all is Ahmed Hirsi, and that's the real husband and father of Ilhan Omar's children, whom she is now estranged from because of the affair that has been covered by the tabloid media in New York and London. And my sources include friends of Mr. Hirsi who tell me as of last month that he is saying things such as, I'm not going to go to jail for her. That she has been threatening him that if he were to say anything, he'd be in just as much trouble as she would and the like. And it's made me conclude with absolute certainty, that we're in the middle of an unprecedented scandal in which a Member of Congress married a sibling for fraudulent reasons."

Off the top, we should note, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau admits the picture is him. It shows Trudeau wearing brown makeup on his face, neck and hands during a party in 2001. At the time, the 29-year-old was teaching in a private school called West Point Grey Academy. The school was holding an Arabian Nights theme gala and Trudeau was dressed up as a character from \"Aladdin\" complete with robes, headdress and brown skin. The party was attended by faculty, administrators and parents and the photo was given to \"Time\" formerly \"Time\" magazine by a Vancouver businessman who was part of the West Point Grey community and the man said it's important the public see the picture. Others identified in the photo did not respond to \"Time's\" request for comments. But this is not a good start to the Prime Minister's reelection campaign because Trudeau is already involved in a scandal over whether he pressured his then Attorney General to drop corruption charges against a large and powerful Canadian engineering firm. It also may not sit well with voters considering Trudeau has called himself a champion of minority groups and Canada's many cultures. Justin Trudeau is of course the son of the late Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau. He is speaking right now. He was asked if he will resign. He did not answer the question. He has said that he did this before. This picture was not the first time. He acknowledges that at the time, he did not think it was racist, but now he knows that it was racist. Let's listen to him.

      "utterance": "Well, for many years Ed Buck has been a big time fundraiser in the State of California for the Democratic Party. There he is with Hillary Clinton. She probably met him between visits to Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. It turns out when Buck wasn't donating to the Democrats, he would like to inject young men with narcotics in his living room. He didn't always do a very good job. Since 2017, two separate men have died of overdoses inside Buck's West Hollywood home. Here's the amazing part. Authorities looked at that and shrugged. Ed Buck faced no charges for either death. Now, he apparently has gone too far. This month, a third man overdosed inside Ed Buck's home. By the way, all of this was in the news. Everyone knew that Ed Buck was injecting young people with narcotics and no one did anything. The third OD, thank god, survived. Yesterday, authorities finally arrested Buck and accused him of what again, everyone knew he was doing -- luring young men into his home and injecting them with deadly amounts of methamphetamine. So they've charged him finally with what everyone knew he was doing for years. Because we already knew from Epstein and Weinstein, when you're a top democratic donor, you often don't face any consequences for your actions. How is that for corrupt? Well, in the absence of God, who has of course disappeared from the public sphere, climate has filled the void and become the new civic religion, at least on the left, and where there is religion of course, there is sin. So today, NBC News asked climate sinners to come forward and name themselves. The network tweeted this quote, \"Blast the AC? Cook a steak once a week? Where do you fall short in preventing climate change? Tell us with climate confessions.\" By the way, we're not making this up. What's a religion without Doomsday prophets? So today on Capitol Hill, Democrats brought teenage climate activists in to testify. One of them said that among young people, it is routine to believe that the world is about to end."

Not in a way that will create Doomsday and wipe us all out, but that will actually just make everyone's life a lot worse. And so that conversation, I realized can be a little less of that sort of bourgeois eschatology, the end of the world stuff that can be very exciting, but it is actually important to address that.

Kefir is an infidel or non-believer. And another American airline employee has now come forward saying Ahmed Alani also took a recent trip to Baghdad and Mosul to see his brother who allegedly is a member of ISIS. Alani's roommate says he went to Iraq because his brother had been kidnapped, but authority say photos from the trip show the brothers smiling and posing with family members. Ahmed Alani is not yet facing any terrorism charges, but the judge who denied him bail called his actions reckless and unconscionable and said there was evidence he was at least sympathetic to terrorists. Two weeks ago American Flight 2834 from Miami to Nassau, Bahamas was on the runway when the pilot got an error light and turned back to the gate. A mechanic then found a tube in the plane's navigation system had been deliberately obstructed meaning the pilots would not have known the airplane's speed, pitch and other critical data. At least two 737s in recent years crashed in part because the pilots did not know the speed and the pitch of the aircraft. Ahmed Alani said he wasn't trying to harm anyone, just wanted the overtime to repair the airplane -- Tucker."

The use of my e-mail account was turned into, you know, the biggest scandal since Lord knows when. They covered it like it was Pearl Harbor. If you look at Facebook, the vast majority of the news -- news items posted were fake. There's all these stories about you know, guys over in Macedonia who are running these fake news sites. I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party. I also think I was the victim of a very broad assumption I was going to win. You know, if the election had been on October 27th, I'd be your President. And it wasn't, it was on October 28th and there was just a lot of funny business going on around that."

None of it is her fault. Howie Carr is a radio host and author of \"What Really Happened: How Donald J. Trump saved America from Hillary Clinton.\" He joins us tonight. Howie Carr, thanks a lot for coming on. So this is and I know that you have the exhaustive master list of Hillary Clinton excuses for not winning, but this latest one -- voter suppression. What does that mean exactly?"

      "utterance": "I think it means you have Democrats as well as Republicans are only going to be allowed to vote once, you know. And she apparently doesn't like the fact that, you know, most people, Democrats and Republicans alike think that you should have to produce some kind of ID. You have to produce an ID in this country to buy alcohol, to get on a commercial airliner. In a lot of states, you have to produce ID to buy cough syrup at the pharmacy. In some states, you even have to produce an ID to buy spray paint at a hardware store. And you know, I don't -- no one thinks it's an assault on democracy. All the things she said, I just was looking them over. The lack of election security. Well, you know, we had an aborted recount in Michigan after the election. The Democrats were running it. They went into Detroit, 662 precincts, they found out that in 40 percent of those precincts in the City of Detroit, there were more votes cast than there were registered voters. Now, do you think that lack of election security benefited her or Donald Trump? She was talking about \"voter suppression,\" quote-unquote, in Wisconsin, do you think it might have helped her campaign if she had campaigned in Wisconsin? And I like the fact, too, you just played the cut. She said, you could run the best campaign. How the hell would she know? She ran the worst campaign. CNN was even giving her the debate questions and she couldn't handle it. She said our norms are under assault. She ran around the country saying she was going to appoint Supreme Court justices who are going to overturn citizens -- you know, the Supreme Court decision, Citizens United in D.C. versus Heller, which basically meant if you read between the lines, she was going to gut the First and the Second Amendments to the United States Bill of Rights. I mean, I would say that's a problem. She said the rule of law is being undermined. Well, she got a subpoena to turn over her e-mails and then deleted 33,000 of them. Is that undermining the rule of law? I mean, this is like \"Groundhog Day,\" having to listen to this stuff over and over again. There was a guy, Ring Lardner, who wrote short stories about baseball players and there was a baseball player who wrote about it. He always was making excuses. His name was Alibi Ike. This woman is the new Alibi Ike. She says it's a crisis in democracy. She lost. That's not a crisis in democracy. That's democracy."

      "utterance": "Tucker, I'm worried about this because flu is a very changeable virus. It mutates all the time and if we see a flu that we haven't seen before, and we don't have any immunity to, we could see a lot of deaths from it. And already in a regular flu season to give you an idea, it kills half a million people around the world and infects a billion people every year. That's the flu that we have immunity to. That's the flu that your flu shot protects you against. But if we saw a new version, a pandemic strain, a serious one, not like the one we saw in 2009, but a really bad one with air travel, it could spread around the globe in a matter of days, and we wouldn't be prepared for it. We could make a pandemic vaccine, but that take months. We have a universal flu vaccine in the pipeline, but that's going to take five years before it is ready. We need it right now. And another thing, why don't we have the kinds of detection software, we need to tell me if someone is sick before they get symptoms. People travel on planes, right? They are close together. They're coughing on each other. They could be in Asia one day, and here in New York the next day spreading a serious killer like the flu. Flu spreads very easily. It lives on surfaces. It spreads through the air. It kills you -- it can get you quite sick. It can cause pneumonia. It can cause all kinds of other infections. I want to know that a person has it before they're even sick. We have the technology for that, we're not using it. And I want that flu vaccine that we can use against all strains that come out. What's going to get us in big trouble is a mutation, something that mutates from a bird or a bird-like creature to humans. We've seen it before. We saw it in 1918. If it happens now, you're going to also see a lot of panic. And one more thing, Tucker, bioterror, we've talked about that on the show here. You could take a flu molecule in the laboratory and change it. So it's one -- just that slight change genetically so that we've never seen it before."
