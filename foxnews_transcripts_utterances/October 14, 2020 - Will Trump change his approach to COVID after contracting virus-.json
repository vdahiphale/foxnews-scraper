I'm sure he will go after her on that and on a number of other issues and try to really drive home the idea that the American people are really getting two different types of candidates here. Joe Biden, who claims that he's a moderate, claims he's not the Green New Deal, even though it's on his campaign website. Who is running with a Far-Left senator? The most far left in Washington, D.C., according to the studies, have been done about voting patterns and whether she's - is she the one who is really going to speak for the campaign in terms of policy, what those positions are. And also, I think a lack of transparency is what Vice President Pence will go after. Why isn't the Biden campaign discussing court packing when Kamala Harris is someone who said she would be willing to get rid of the filibuster in the primary process to pack the court? And so, these are issues that will come up tonight.

You heard Peter Doocy's piece there outlining a number of flip flops on Medicare for All, which Senator Harris said she was for, and then she said she was against it. The question of MeToo issues was also a flip flop there that was laid out, marijuana as well, in terms of how serious a crime that is. Did you guys work on that in the mock debate scenario?",

The failure of the president to keep the American people safe, the refusal of the president to so much as negotiate on a relief package that's going to benefit those who are hurting economically. Look, Mike Pence is a very skilled debater. I know him from the time that we were both serving him as governor, me as mayor. He was a talk show host for a long time. And he's very comfortable delivering talking points, some of them outrageous with a straight face. But I'm also looking forward to the opportunity. Just have some clarity on the issues that Americans care about most. We want to talk about health care. The most important thing that's about to happen in health care is the question of whether the Republican lawsuit to take away pre-existing condition coverage prevails in a few weeks when it gets to the Supreme Court. That's what Americans are worried about. And that's why I think a lot of people are going to be tuning in this evening.",

People ranking the economy first favored Trump by 12 points. Nearly twice as many people think the government should focus on limiting the spread of the virus then want to restart the economy first. And most people say the economy is in poor shape. The third most important issue facing voters is healthcare. Twice as many want to keep Obamacare as want to repeal it, 64 to 32 percent. The other big issues are racism, the Supreme Court, and violent crime. The fewest voters ranked violent crime as most important but those who did favor President Trump by a single point. Nearly 6 in 10 people think the way the president speaks about racial inequality is leading to an increase in violence including nearly a third of his supporters. And by comparison, nearly 4 in 10 think Biden's language incites violence including nearly a fifth of his supporters. Vice President Pence just tweeted a video of him touring the destruction in Minneapolis following the protest indicating tonight he will push law and order message. Now 25 percent of voters place the Supreme Court as the top issue and of those people, Biden leads President Trump by five points. At the same time about half would vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett with 90 percent of Republicans supporting, 80 percent of Democrats opposing. But 54 percent of voters overall don't think the president should appoint a lifetime position this close to the election. That's down from 2016, by the way, when a greater majority thought it was the duty of the current leaders to fill the vacancy after Justice Scalia's death. And voters are divided over adding justices to the Supreme Court with about one in five people unsure and that unclear landscape is probably why both Biden and Harris have avoided giving an answer on court packing and why President Trump and Mike Pence have been pushing for an answer there.

I do think that it helps the president came out today to talk about the treatments that he received and then making it so talking directly to the American people how he is going to make those drugs and therapeutics s available to them at an affordable cost. Because Democrats I'm sure Senator Harris tonight will say healthcare is too expensive, drug prices are too expensive and people are suffering as a result of their healthcare as a result of this pandemic. But Mike Pence has a huge opportunity here to lay out what the administration has done and what they would say in record time as the head the Coronavirus Task Force for the White House and talk about the following the science that they have done and the differences that they -- the differences they have made when it comes to progress on this issue.

On the issue of fracking, which, of course, Pennsylvania is a swing state. I'm sure he will go after her on that and on a number of other issues and try to really drive home the idea that the American people are really getting two different types of candidates here. Joe Biden, who claims that he's a moderate, claims he's not the Green New Deal, even though it's on his campaign website. Who is running with a Far-Left senator? The most far left in Washington, D.C., according to the studies, have been done about voting patterns and whether she's - is she the one who is really going to speak for the campaign in terms of policy, what those positions are. And also, I think a lack of transparency is what Vice President Pence will go after. Why isn't the Biden campaign discussing court packing when Kamala Harris is someone who said she would be willing to get rid of the filibuster in the primary process to pack the court? And so, these are issues that will come up tonight. And I think really splitting the difference on - the differences between Biden and Harris tonight is what the Vice President Pence will try to do."

This race is going to go down to the final vote. Are we going to win in the margins? Are we going to lose outside the margins? The bottom-line is the American people want a civil debate. They want a conversation about the issues. They're tired of the bickering, and they want to know about how these candidates will help them.

Let's be honest, she wasn't a very good presidential candidate. Marianne Williamson, Andrew Yang, Julian Castro, Pete Buttigieg, and others last into the race months after she was forced out. Despite having a big start at the beginning of her campaign, it quickly dwindled out. And it's going to be interesting whether we see somebody who's got empathy, can relate to ordinary people, or if we see the prosecutor that we've seen show up at several committee hearings yes or no, yes or no.

I mean, she signed on to get government health care, Medicare for All, because Bernie Sanders was winning with that message in a Democratic primary early on. She's likely been studying very hard to make sure she understands exactly where the Biden-Harris ticket is on these policy positions. But because she's been all over the place in a number of things, fracking, the Green New Deal and other issues, the moderate side of Joe Biden is what they want the country to see that tonight. They don't want this narrative that the Trump campaign has added on to them a Far-Left potential presidential candidate and Kamala Harris, given Joe Biden's age to be what people focus on."

You heard Peter Doocy's piece there outlining a number of flip flops on Medicare for All, which Senator Harris said she was for, and then she said she was against it. The question of MeToo issues was also a flip flop there that was laid out, marijuana as well, in terms of how serious a crime that is. Did you guys work on that in the mock debate scenario?"

The failure of the president to keep the American people safe, the refusal of the president to so much as negotiate on a relief package that's going to benefit those who are hurting economically. Look, Mike Pence is a very skilled debater. I know him from the time that we were both serving him as governor, me as mayor. He was a talk show host for a long time. And he's very comfortable delivering talking points, some of them outrageous with a straight face. But I'm also looking forward to the opportunity. Just have some clarity on the issues that Americans care about most. We want to talk about health care. The most important thing that's about to happen in health care is the question of whether the Republican lawsuit to take away pre-existing condition coverage prevails in a few weeks when it gets to the Supreme Court. That's what Americans are worried about. And that's why I think a lot of people are going to be tuning in this evening."

Folks want to play that game. We could do it all night.

What I'll also say is that the entire party, the ticket, and I think most Americans agree that the most important question concerning the court is the nomination that's about to happen. And it's unfortunate that Donald Trump and Mike Pence think the American people are wrong in the view that the vast majority of us have us meeting again, the American people, also Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that the next president ought to pick the next Supreme Court justice."

We don't get out of control. But I also think you're going to see tonight the vice president leaning in, for example, in coronavirus. Many in the other media that somehow there should be a liability. I think the vice president is going to be able to point out that this administration listens to the scientist. They listen to Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx early and flattened the curb. At the same time Joe Biden about that same time Joe Biden was raising concerns about travel restrictions with China and Europe. And as his own former chief of staff said, he blew it when it came to H1N1. So, there will be sharp contrast on that issue. I think the vice president is going to be very clear with the American people as to where this administration has gone and where Biden/Harris would take them in the wrong direction."

So, her tendency as we've seen in the past even when debating Joe Biden a year ago this past summer was to be aggressive and to be the prosecutor. Remember when she went after Joe Biden on the issue of busing, she made it personal. She slowed down and spoke as though she was speaking to a jury like a prosecutor would and delivered a pretty dramatic below to Joe Biden in that debate. I think you are going to see some of those, at least attempt to see some of those, sort of, activities tonight."

      "utterance": "Well, I mean the joke of this is no Plexiglas in front of the moderator. You guys know moderators if there was really about solely about health and safety why doesn't Susan Page have it? The bottom line is the vice president is not going to be phased one way or the other about in that regard. He is going to look right to the American people. He is going to talk to them. He is going to defend not just this administration's record on recovery and moving forward and explain how radical Joe Biden is as personified by his pick of Senator Harris who Newsweek says is the most liberal member of the United States Senate in terms of voting last year. But he is going to have that conversation. He is not going to get into a big fight with Harris or anyone else. He is going to tell the American people why he is defending them and why this president will always defend them going forward."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALKER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he should. I mean I think actions speak louder than words. I've said this for some time, when they push back on this issue, they ignore the fact. We talk about science. This administration has listened to the science. It's precisely why we are in a much better position. Remember, Fauci, in particular warned them in March almost seven months ago, that if they didn't take dramatic action to flatten the curb. Remember that first 15 days then expanded to 30 days. As many as 2.2 million of our fellow Americans could perish. Thankfully, that did not happen. And while we mourn for any death, the fact of the matter is they took decisive action and Joe Biden was ridiculing this administration, particularly the president for trying to put restrictions on travel places like China, and Europe and elsewhere. And as I mentioned his own, Joe Biden's own former chief of staff spelled out that when it came to H1N1, they rarely screwed it up. He talked about it being one of the most largest mass casualty events in global history had they not been fortunate, and thank God for the American people they locked out and didn't have a chance to blow it even more than the 60 million who were infected."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALKER",
      "utterance": "Well, it is a challenge, although thankfully we've seen numbers go down in terms of hospitalization and in the worst-case scenario. So it is a concern, but again, I remind people if you look at what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are talking about, it's not significantly different than what this administration has done and will continue to do going forward when it comes to the science they're listening to the science. The bigger question going forward is, who do you trust with the recovery? I think by a landslide, that's going to be Donald Trump and Mike Pence."

Workers have been working one by one picking apart the spires, taking out the original windows. The historic artwork that's been there 128 years with the ultimate goal to catalog at all and put it back in once the big job is done, digging down to the pioneer era foundation in setting up seismic stabilization disks so the temple never crumples in the future. Mike Pence is the candidate visited here in 2016. Tonight, Vice President Pence is going to try to set up his own seismic stabilization of this presidential race.

You know, there are rumors that he actually had information that it was really Russia that was interceding on behalf of Clinton. They preferred Clinton to become president and yet, he came up with intelligence committee assessment that said that, you know, all 17 intelligence isn't saying that Russia intervened on behalf of Trump. No, I believe people like John Brennan have a lot to answer and have a lot of questions that they need to provide answers for. And that's what the American people deserve.

      "speaker": "JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. Good evening, Bret. This poll taken after the first presidential debate after President Trump tested positive for coronavirus. And Biden has doubled his lead over the president since last month, now ahead by 10 points. Likely voters have coronavirus and the economy tied for the top issue affecting their vote. A large majority believe coronavirus is not under control in the U.S. Among voters who placed coronavirus as the top issue, Biden is ahead by 39 points and that's a wider margin than Trump has over Biden among those who ranked the economy as most important. People ranking the economy first favored Trump by 12 points. Nearly twice as many people think the government should focus on limiting the spread of the virus then want to restart the economy first. And most people say the economy is in poor shape. The third most important issue facing voters is healthcare. Twice as many want to keep Obamacare as want to repeal it, 64 to 32 percent. The other big issues are racism, the Supreme Court, and violent crime. The fewest voters ranked violent crime as most important but those who did favor President Trump by a single point. Nearly 6 in 10 people think the way the president speaks about racial inequality is leading to an increase in violence including nearly a third of his supporters. And by comparison, nearly 4 in 10 think Biden's language incites violence including nearly a fifth of his supporters. Vice President Pence just tweeted a video of him touring the destruction in Minneapolis following the protest indicating tonight he will push law and order message. Now 25 percent of voters place the Supreme Court as the top issue and of those people, Biden leads President Trump by five points. At the same time about half would vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett with 90 percent of Republicans supporting, 80 percent of Democrats opposing. But 54 percent of voters overall don't think the president should appoint a lifetime position this close to the election. That's down from 2016, by the way, when a greater majority thought it was the duty of the current leaders to fill the vacancy after Justice Scalia's death. And voters are divided over adding justices to the Supreme Court with about one in five people unsure and that unclear landscape is probably why both Biden and Harris have avoided giving an answer on court packing and why President Trump and Mike Pence have been pushing for an answer there. Bret and Martha."

This was a winning issue for Democrats in 2018, I believe it will be a winning issue for Vice President Biden and Senator Harris this year. One other thing that I think tonight we want to hear.

And President Trump has more to do in the next debate which will be town hall style with former president or Vice President Joe Biden. But on the issue of coronavirus, this is something that has been difficult for the administration to message in recent weeks. I do think that it helps the president came out today to talk about the treatments that he received and then making it so talking directly to the American people how he is going to make those drugs and therapeutics s available to them at an affordable cost. Because Democrats I'm sure Senator Harris tonight will say healthcare is too expensive, drug prices are too expensive and people are suffering as a result of their healthcare as a result of this pandemic. But Mike Pence has a huge opportunity here to lay out what the administration has done and what they would say in record time as the head the Coronavirus Task Force for the White House and talk about the following the science that they have done and the differences that they -- the differences they have made when it comes to progress on this issue.

But it's going to be a knife edge and we're going to be we will not have control of the United States Senate settled until January 5th when the Georgia runoff occurs. They have a primary in November and a runoff in January, and that may decide the control of the Senate."
