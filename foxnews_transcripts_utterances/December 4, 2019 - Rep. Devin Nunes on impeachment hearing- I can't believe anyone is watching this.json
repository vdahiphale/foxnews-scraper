      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Another chapter in the House impeachment melodrama unfolded today. About the 18th most important thing happening in America, but we're in Washington, it happened and so, we're going to frame it for you this evening. So, the drama shifted from Adam Schiff's Judiciary -- I mean, rather, Intel Committee to the Judiciary Committee, which is run by another Democratic member of Congress, Jerry Nadler of New York. Now, last month, you'll remember that Adam Schiff's approach was to bring down the president by bringing in a whole cavalcade of intel and foreign policy professionals and having them explain how their feelings had been hurt by the bad orange man. \"The president said nasty things about me. He fired me. I wanted to cry. Make him go away.\" It didn't work. So, Jerry Nadler tried a new approach today. His strategy was to treat impeachment like a faculty meeting at Wesleyan. So, produced a long line of academics with impressive-sounding credentials, have them condemn the president as a very bad man. Now, if you weren't paying close attention, if you were standing in line at the cafeteria and just saw it out of the corner of your eye, you might have been impressed. That was the idea.

Of course, once you pause and consider this all for a moment, it starts to look a little less impressive. None of today's witnesses had any actual evidence the president. They were, instead, giving you their opinions. It was a little bit like reading the New Republic, but less interesting. You probably heard enough impeachment opinions over Thanksgiving from one of your drunk cousins, so why would we care what these people think? Well, because of their credentials. Supposedly, they have exceptional knowledge and expertise, IQs far higher than yours, all of which enables them to give a fair, and balanced, and informed opinion on how America ought to proceed. But is that real? Well, consider today's star witness, Pam Karlan. Look up her biography online and you'll see that she's the -- quote -- \"Kenneth and Harley Montgomery Professor of Public Interest law at Stanford.\" Wow, stand back, ladies and gentlemen [laughs]. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And before that, she clerked for a Supreme Court justice and earned not one, not two, ladies and gentlemen, she earned three separate degrees at Yale.

They're not very smart, they have no wisdom, their personal lives are a disaster. By the way, if they're so wise, why are they so unhappy? Every one of them is. And in this specific case, they're not even unbiased arbiters. Karlan, for example: she's not some apolitical academic pulled out of Kohl's stores to testify about what we ought to do. She's an activist. She's literally a political activist who donates thousands of dollars to the Democratic party.

They're telling you that the Democratic primary electorate is racist because they rejected Kamala Harris. They didn't vote for some rich lady from San Francisco, so they must be racist. Now, this may shock a lot of news rooms here in Washington, but it turns out, in real life, a lot of Democratic voters are liberal; in fact, a lot are African-American women. And their favorite candidate is who? Joe Biden. So, what are they telling us? They're telling us that black women are racist. Okay.

      "sentences": "Last night, we brought you the story of Sidney, Nebraska, a small town devastated by the predatory business practices of a hedge fund manager called Paul Singer. Singer, it happens, is also one of the most prolific donors to the Republican Party, and particularly to Republican senators in Washington. A fact we suggested last night that might account for the silence of Senator Ben Sasse on what happened to Sydney. Two thousand Nebraska jobs disappeared, and yet, Sasse, a Nebraska senator, never said a word about Paul Singer's involvement in it. Well, today, Senator Sasse responded to our segment. We asked him for a statement, and he sent us this, quote, \"Melissa and I know the families in Sydney and I've constantly told companies, including Cabella’s and Bass Pro Shops, that nobody out works or outhustles Nebraskans. Sydney hasn't given up and neither have we. There's a real problem with American communities coming apart, and it's going to require creative policymaking. But this problem isn't going to be solved by the easy over-promising big government advocates on either the left or the right.\" End quote. Creative policymaking is what Senator Sasse says we need. And of course, we agree with him. Here are three creative policies the U.S. Senate ought to consider in response to what happened in Sydney and Nebraska. First, call it what it is. This wasn't creative destruction. Nothing was created. It was just destruction. Destruction for the enrichment of a tiny number of people at the expense of many others. You don't have to make this illegal to call it disgusting, because that's exactly what it is. So, our first creative policy ought to be to tell the truth. Second, return the money. We're not saying Ben Sasse, or any other senator is doing Singer's bidding purely for the cash, but why not remove all doubt about it? If one of your biggest donors turned out to be a pornographer or a mass distributor of OxyContin, you'd send back the donation. You wouldn't want to be associated with someone like that. You'd want to be clear about your own values. Senator Sasse should be clear about his. Third, and finally, Republican senators ought to resolve to speak to the rest of us like adults. No more baby talk. Stop with the bumper sticker phrases from 1986. It's a different country now. The question isn't whether we're getting big government too late. We already have it, in part thanks to you, Republican senators. The question is whether we'll become a socialist country run by a terrifying alliance of authoritarian big tech moguls and wild-eyed identity politics cult members. That could happen. We're closer to it than our leaders acknowledge. Just eleven months from now. Our system could change forever and swiftly destroy everything we have spent two hundred- and forty-years building. That's not an overstatement. It's horrifyingly real, and it's being driven by deep economic dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction with the professional conservatives here in Washington, who spend most of their time either ignoring or pretending it doesn't exist. These are supposed to be the guardians of capitalism. Somehow, they don't seem to notice it's in mortal peril. Wake up. We're almost out of time. If we don't rein in the excesses of our system, and soon, we could very easily lose it. Senator Sasse was the only one to respond to last night's segment. Paul Singer's hedge fund, Elliott Management, declined to give us a statement yesterday. But just minutes ago, they posted a response on the blogging platform medium. In a statement, Elliott Management denied responsibility for the Cabela's sale. The company was exploring a sale before Elliot bought a stake, they said. He also said Elliot did not exert, we're quoting now, \"direct influence on the Capella's board to pressure them into that decision.\" But SEC findings contradict this claim. Capella's did consider selling itself before Paul Singer arrived, but in August 2015, they rejected that path. Suddenly, after Singer's purchase, they reversed course. Otherwise, Elliot contests no essential parts of last night's reporting on this show. They did end the statement with a promise and we're quoting now, \"to protect and grow their clients hard earned capital.\" We're certain they're being honest, at least on that point. Ned Ryan is founder and CEO of American Majority, and he joins us tonight. Ned, thanks so much for coming on. I have to ask you, since you are part of the kind of professional conservative firmament and have been for a long time, you know, that landscape well.

About the 18th most important thing happening in America, but we're in Washington, it happened and so, we're going to frame it for you this evening. So, the drama shifted from Adam Schiff's Judiciary -- I mean, rather, Intel Committee to the Judiciary Committee, which is run by another Democratic member of Congress, Jerry Nadler of New York. Now, last month, you'll remember that Adam Schiff's approach was to bring down the president by bringing in a whole cavalcade of intel and foreign policy professionals and having them explain how their feelings had been hurt by the bad orange man. \"The president said nasty things about me. He fired me. I wanted to cry. Make him go away.\" It didn't work. So, Jerry Nadler tried a new approach today. His strategy was to treat impeachment like a faculty meeting at Wesleyan. So, produced a long line of academics with impressive-sounding credentials, have them condemn the president as a very bad man. Now, if you weren't paying close attention, if you were standing in line at the cafeteria and just saw it out of the corner of your eye, you might have been impressed. That was the idea. Watch."

They must be very bad men. So, presumably, if even they think Trump is rotten, that impeachment mandatory. Of course, once you pause and consider this all for a moment, it starts to look a little less impressive. None of today's witnesses had any actual evidence the president. They were, instead, giving you their opinions. It was a little bit like reading the New Republic, but less interesting. You probably heard enough impeachment opinions over Thanksgiving from one of your drunk cousins, so why would we care what these people think? Well, because of their credentials. Supposedly, they have exceptional knowledge and expertise, IQs far higher than yours, all of which enables them to give a fair, and balanced, and informed opinion on how America ought to proceed. But is that real? Well, consider today's star witness, Pam Karlan. Look up her biography online and you'll see that she's the -- quote -- \"Kenneth and Harley Montgomery Professor of Public Interest law at Stanford.\" Wow, stand back, ladies and gentlemen [laughs]. And before that, she clerked for a Supreme Court justice and earned not one, not two, ladies and gentlemen, she earned three separate degrees at Yale. She's written several textbooks on constitution law. If there's one person in this country who is impressive, who our system has deemed capable of making judgments that you don't even understand, it's this lady, this professor, Pamela Karlan. But think again. And this is a subtheme of the impeachment drama that we'd like to highlight. Because, really, it's a thing that will endure and change the country long after Trump is gone. It turns out, the more you know about the people you're supposed to consider impressive, the more you find out they're not impressive at all [laughs], actually. They're not very smart, they have no wisdom, their personal lives are a disaster. By the way, if they're so wise, why are they so unhappy? Every one of them is. And in this specific case, they're not even unbiased arbiters. Karlan, for example: she's not some apolitical academic pulled out of Kohl's stores to testify about what we ought to do. She's an activist. She's literally a political activist who donates thousands of dollars to the Democratic party. Watch this."

Because all the way back in March of 2017, this same man, Noah Feldman, suggested that Trump should be impeached because of a tweet he sent accusing President Obama of monitoring Trump Tower. Yeah, that was impeachable, he said. He also said that Jim Comey's memo of his conversations with Trump was impeachment-worthy, too. He even told Slate.com. Please. If he's so impressive, why is he [laughs] writing for Slate? Whatever. But he told Slate that the president doesn’t actually have the freedom of speech and should be impeached simply for saying things that Noah Feldman doesn't like. The only witness who didn't embarrass himself today was Georgetown University law professor Jonathan Turley. Now, reporters are describing as a GOP witness, implying that he's a partisan, or a right-winger, or a Republican, even. But he's none of those things. Turley, who has come on the show quite a bit, know him well, is a member of the Democratic party. He's on the left. He's advocated legalizing polygamy. He wanted George W. Bush tried for war crimes. He's not [laughs] -- he's not from the federal society. He doesn't' even like Trump and he didn't vote for him. But he called it absurdity where he saw one."

My Republican friends are mad. My Democratic friends are mad. Will -- and the slipshod impeachment make us less mad? Will it only invite an invitation for the madness to follow every future administration? That is why this is wrong. It's not wrong because President Trump is right. His call was anything but perfect. It's not wrong because the House has no legitimate reason to investigate the Ukrainian controversy. It's not wrong because we're in an election year. There is no good time for an impeachment.

Sydney hasn't given up and neither have we. There's a real problem with American communities coming apart, and it's going to require creative policymaking. But this problem isn't going to be solved by the easy over-promising big government advocates on either the left or the right.\" End quote. Creative policymaking is what Senator Sasse says we need. And of course, we agree with him. Here are three creative policies the U.S. Senate ought to consider in response to what happened in Sydney and Nebraska. First, call it what it is. This wasn't creative destruction. Nothing was created. It was just destruction. Destruction for the enrichment of a tiny number of people at the expense of many others. You don't have to make this illegal to call it disgusting, because that's exactly what it is. So, our first creative policy ought to be to tell the truth. Second, return the money. We're not saying Ben Sasse, or any other senator is doing Singer's bidding purely for the cash, but why not remove all doubt about it? If one of your biggest donors turned out to be a pornographer or a mass distributor of OxyContin, you'd send back the donation. You wouldn't want to be associated with someone like that. You'd want to be clear about your own values. Senator Sasse should be clear about his. Third, and finally, Republican senators ought to resolve to speak to the rest of us like adults. No more baby talk. Stop with the bumper sticker phrases from 1986. It's a different country now. The question isn't whether we're getting big government too late. We already have it, in part thanks to you, Republican senators. The question is whether we'll become a socialist country run by a terrifying alliance of authoritarian big tech moguls and wild-eyed identity politics cult members. That could happen. We're closer to it than our leaders acknowledge. Just eleven months from now. Our system could change forever and swiftly destroy everything we have spent two hundred- and forty-years building. That's not an overstatement. It's horrifyingly real, and it's being driven by deep economic dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction with the professional conservatives here in Washington, who spend most of their time either ignoring or pretending it doesn't exist. These are supposed to be the guardians of capitalism. Somehow, they don't seem to notice it's in mortal peril. Wake up. We're almost out of time. If we don't rein in the excesses of our system, and soon, we could very easily lose it. Senator Sasse was the only one to respond to last night's segment. Paul Singer's hedge fund, Elliott Management, declined to give us a statement yesterday. But just minutes ago, they posted a response on the blogging platform medium. In a statement, Elliott Management denied responsibility for the Cabela's sale. The company was exploring a sale before Elliot bought a stake, they said. He also said Elliot did not exert, we're quoting now, \"direct influence on the Capella's board to pressure them into that decision.\" But SEC findings contradict this claim. Capella's did consider selling itself before Paul Singer arrived, but in August 2015, they rejected that path. Suddenly, after Singer's purchase, they reversed course. Otherwise, Elliot contests no essential parts of last night's reporting on this show. They did end the statement with a promise and we're quoting now, \"to protect and grow their clients hard earned capital.\" We're certain they're being honest, at least on that point. Ned Ryan is founder and CEO of American Majority, and he joins us tonight. Ned, thanks so much for coming on. I have to ask you, since you are part of the kind of professional conservative firmament and have been for a long time, you know, that landscape well. Paul Ryan -- I beg your pardon, Paul Singer is one of the biggest contributors to conservative organizations. How would you describe his influence on professional conservatism in this country and the Republican Party?"

But I think we've got to have a conversation about Citizens United. Tucker. I get some of the arguments for it, but it has also empowered the vulture capitalist class to buy a lot of politicians, and buy a lot of think tanks, who are advocating and implementing policies that are antithetical to the interests of the American worker."

I lost all belief and faith and trust that that's what conservatism was about years ago. And in fact, I think we have to really reconsider what the conservative movement actually is, not only what it's advocating, but actually who's funding it and what are its priorities?

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Warren will say anything, of course. But this may be one of the few issues on which she isn't actually the furthest left in the field, at least rhetorically. That honor goes to also ran candidate Julian Castro, who promised to protect the right of transgender men to get abortions."

      "speaker": "JULIAN CASTRO",
      "utterance": "I don't believe only in reproductive freedom. I believe in reproductive justice. And, you know, what that means is that just because a woman, or let's also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female --. -- is poor, doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose."

Conversations like this does seem a little bit strange to you if you're, I don't know, a struggling blue-collar worker -- and there are millions of in this country -- or a parent with an opioid addicted son -- millions of those -- or really any normal person. Can you win an election on this issue? What is this about? Megan Murphy is a contributor to Spectator USA, and she joins us tonight. Megan, thanks so much for coming on. So, it just seems if you were to sort of compare what voters say they care about to the amount of time we spend on this question of whether biology is real, disproportionate doesn't begin to describe it. So, what exactly is this about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEGAN MURPHY, SPECTATOR USA",
      "utterance": "It is really odd because you wouldn't even need to speak to voters to assume that there are probably more important issues on the table than how somebody feels about their so-called gender. I mean, we're talking about a tiny, tiny, tiny minority of the population who identifies as transgender. And I think that people are probably worried about, you know, things like keeping their jobs, having housing, having health care, et cetera, et cetera. It's a really strange thing to focus on."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

      "utterance": "So, you know, people who are in universities are privileged people in North America, people who, you know, exist in academia are, of course, going to be mostly middle- and upper-class people. These are academic ideas. These are academic ideologies. This is about postmodernism. This whole concept of transgenderism and gender identity was really invented within academia."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "-- nobody in the general population really believes these ideas. Nobody in the general population, you know, globally thinks that it's possible to change sex. We all know, even the people who say that it is possible to change sex, I sort of am doubtful that they wholly believe that, because I'm not really sure where the scientific evidence is that that's possible."

      "utterance": "So, you can't be elected if you deny the idea that people can change their sex, but you can be shouted off the stage as he suggests that people can change their race. I think we [laughs] -- we need to think about the ground rules a little more, but whatever. Megan, thank you for being our Sherpa through these very, very confusing subject."
