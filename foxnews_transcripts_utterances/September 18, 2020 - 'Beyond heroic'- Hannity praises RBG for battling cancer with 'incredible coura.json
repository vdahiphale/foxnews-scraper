      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to FOX News. It is a FOX News alert on this Friday evening, 9:00 on the East Coast, 6:00 on the West Coast. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg is dead at the age of 87. Justice Ginsberg battled cancer on and off for decades, was fighting pancreatic cancer at the time of her passing. Now, Justice Ginsburg leaves behind a long legacy at the Supreme Court where she served since 1993. She was appointed by then President Bill Clinton, known as one of the most liberal leaning judges on the bench. Justice Ginsburg had a distinguished legal career, the first Jewish woman to serve on the highest court in our land. Our thoughts and prayers, by the way, tonight are with the entire Ginsburg family, her colleagues at the U.S. Supreme Court and everyone who knew and loved Justice Ginsburg. Sources on the ground tonight -- we'll put up a box of the president. He is in Minnesota tonight in the middle of a rally. They have confirmed to \"Hannity\" that the president has not yet been informed of her death prior to going on stage. Interestingly, while they did have a deep philosophical divide, Justice Ginsburg was well known to have a great deep friendship with Antonin Scalia, who passed away a short time ago. They were close friends. By the way, my own father died from pancreatic cancer, in a very short period of time. It is an insidious cancer. She battled this cancer with incredible, inspiring courage, beyond heroic. She will be missed by many. Now, with just 46 days until the presidential election, we are about to experience a political hurricane the likes of which -- well, we've probably never seen. Although she spoke softly, Justice Ginsburg was a giant on the Supreme Court. Her legacy will live on in the days weeks and months and years ahead, and breaking just moments ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell mourned the loss of Justice Ginsburg and announced, quote, President Trump's Supreme Court nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Here with more tonight, we begin with our own John Roberts from the White House -- John.",

      "sentences": "And, Sean, it is interesting to note that the president was about minutes into his speech there in Bemidji, Minnesota, up there on the Iron Range, when news of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death came so the president does probably not yet know what has happened. But just moments ago just as part of his standard speech the president started talking about the issue of the Supreme Court in terms of the election, saying that he will nominate justices and judges who interpret the Constitution as written, says the Supreme Court is so important the next president will get maybe up to four justices that will be appointed for a long, long time. So the president now has a decision to make does he as President Obama did in 2016 after Anthony Scalia's passing nominate someone to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the bench or does he hold back. I think that the betting is that the president probably will make a nomination sometime in the not too distant future because, obviously, tonight is a is a night to pay tribute to the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and a giant on the Supreme Court, but then we'll begin the process of replacing her. And as you pointed out right at the top of this, Sean, that is going to be a battle royal between now and Election Day. Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that it was her fondest wish that uh if she were to pass or if she were to leave the court, that she'll not be replaced until a new president is installed. So, the president has got this decision to make. And I would be if I were a betting man, Sean, I would bet that the decision will be made to make a nomination. Mitch McConnell as you pointed out at the top here, has said he will bring that nominee to the floor and then the clock will be running do you get it done before the election, or do you get it done before the end of the year, do you get it done before the end of the term, depending on how the election goes? Don't forget, the Senate's going to turn over at the beginning of January. So there is a finite period of time to get a nominee through, should the president decide to make a nomination. The -- we have not heard anything yet from the White House I'm told we probably won't hear anything until the president is on his way back. The closest we've got is Kellyanne Conway who recently left the White House, tweeted out, quote: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg led a remarkable life of consequence. She worked with a passion and conviction inspired many women offered hope to other cancer survivors, prayers to her loved ones. May she rest in peace. Ruth Bader Ginsburg may rest in peace but America is not going to be peaceful in any way, shape or form, Sean, because this will be on top of everything else that we've got going in this election a battle right through to November the 3rd, will probably likely also force Joe Biden to come out with a list of potential nominees as well. That's something that he's been resisting -- Sean. John, I just want to go back because I -- my sources on the round with the president confirmed that his speech had already started about minutes in, other news outlets reported the opposite. We are right in our reporting, is that correct, that he did not know?",

      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Hey there, Sean. Well, here's what we have to look at here. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, he came out here within a matter of a few minutes after uh it was announced that justice Ginsburg had died and this is very similar to what he did in 2016 after Justice Antonin Scalia passed away. Mitch McConnell unilaterally back in announced that they would not consider Merrick Garland or whoever President Obama was going to put forth. What he has announced this evening -- and I'll just read you the statement here -- he says, quote, President Trump's nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Now, there are some metrics here that we need to pay attention to. The average for Supreme Court nominees once they are nominated to when they get to their hearing is about 40 days, 40 to 45 days. It's 67 days from their nomination until they are confirmed. Now, some other metrics here with Brett Kavanaugh was 57 days from his nomination to his hearing and 89 days from his nomination to confirmation. So you can see we're kind of on the cusp whether or not they can properly vet a Supreme Court nominee, get a confirmation hearing through, and then put it on the floor before the election. I think probably putting it on the floor before the election is almost an impossibility based on the metric used for Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Here are the other phenomenon to look for. You have Lindsey Graham who has an increasingly competitive Senate race in South Carolina the chair of the Judiciary Committee, he will be asked to shepherd through this nominee. Kamala Harris, a Democratic vice-presidential nominee, she is on the judiciary committee as well and as I say it's always about the math on Capitol Hill. Lisa Murkowski, Republican senator from Alaska has indicated that she thinks that we should probably wait until January. A new president, whoever that is, whether it be President Biden or President Trump to consider that nominee and you wonder how these other Republican senators in battleground states how they will shape up. Will they be on board here? Remember Mitch McConnell, he needs votes to be able to overcome a filibuster. This was the precedent change that he initiated with Neil Gorsuch to confirm him back in 2017, and then also at least 51 votes to confirm the nominee. So, look at Susan Collins in Maine, Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Cory Gardner in Colorado, probably a couple of others, and certainly, Mitch McConnell, don't forget that he's up here too, but they need 51 votes. So in other words, you could lose two. Right now, there are Republican 53 yea's, and 53 Republicans in the Senate. So you can get down to 51. But if it's a 50-50 vote, keep in mind that Mike Pence, the vice president, he has broken ties they've never confirmed it justice uh with a vice president breaking the tie. In fact, Mike Pence confirmed the first executive branch nomination with Betsy DeVos, the education secretary in early 2017 on a 51-50 vote. So as John Roberts said, you know, we are in for a real roller coaster. But I want to direct everybody back to that timeline which is so critical. If you follow the history here, it would be very hard probably to put that nominee on the Senate floor to have a vote and do some of these other senators. Sean, do they agree with Mitch McConnell that they should push through as quickly as he is suggesting in this statement.",

      "speaker": "SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "sentences": "Yes, Sean, her colleagues are grieving tonight because what they know better than anyone else is that this is a family and this is a very unique position that no one else could possibly understand unless they have served on that bench. We've talked a lot about the unorthodox friendship that she had with the late Justice Scalia. They couldn't have been more different ideologically they didn't see the constitution and the way to interpret it the same way, but they actually were very close. Their families socialized together. They both loved opera and cooking together. So there are deep, deep roots there of friendship despite the ideological divides and that was a good example that probably our country could use right now. She was a trailblazer. I mean, we've talked about the fact that when she came out of law school, one of nine women in her Harvard Law School class, she couldn't find a job. She actually had people tell her I can't hire you because you're a woman. I mean she was married. She had children. She has two children. She leaves behind four grandchildren and she was always devoted to her family. They were her number one priority. But the court was clearly her life's mission, her life's work. I've told the story about the day after her husband died, she was there in court. I showed up to court and saw her on the bench and I was shocked. But she was so devoted to her work and she has always said, despite the numerous battles with cancer and other physical challenges, that she was going to keep serving as long as she possibly could. And there were people you'll remember during the last election on the left who asked her to step down before the possibility of a Republican president was elected and she said no to her critics on the left and the right. I have a position to do. I have work to do and she kind of intimated that someone like her could not be nominated in what has become a very partisan and very difficult environment now for these nominees. And she's probably right about that. So she left a trail behind her of showing working women how to be strong voices in the legal field to also have a family, to have friendships with people that you might disagree with. And you know, just a few weeks ago, she's always been very transparent about her health. She had put out a statement through the court saying that she had a recurrence of her cancer but talking about the different treatments that she tried and how she felt good that chemo was working, and she was very positive moving into the summer and into the fall term. We know she officiated a wedding just within the last few weeks. So we know that she had been feeling good and doing better. So this news does come as a bit of a shock tonight, and as we have to think about what comes next, as someone who's covered the court for years, I think about the fact that there are a number of election-related disputes that have been bubbling up to the Supreme Court. If we had another year like Bush v. Gore, we'd have eight justices on the court that would be exceptionally difficult on the court and on the justices. So there are so many things to think about tonight, but most importantly, the legacy of this woman who has made history in so many ways and is now gone at the age of 87 -- Sean.",

And usually, it's done by the chief. But I remember this particular year that Justice Scalia was really very animated and he was sort of assigning people parts and he was singing at the top of his voice and I remember seeing her at one moment sort of this bemused look on her face sort of like that's Nino, they really were close. And they seemed to really stick up for each other to have each other's backs, and to genuinely enjoy each other's company -- not that it was something they felt like they had to do, but that they actually wanted to do, just to spend time together and to support each other personally.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's quite a day and, you know, I just thought back over the fact that I had the privilege in honor of presenting oral arguments before Justice Ginsburg since the day she was sworn in and confirmed and became a justice of the Supreme Court 27 years ago. So, I've had a long history with justice Ginsburg and, you know, all I can say is, first of all, our thoughts and prayers for her family. But let me say this about Justice Ginsburg, whether you agreed with the legal position or not, she was a very, very smart, brilliant lawyer, advocate and justice. And even when she disagreed with me, which was frequent, but not always, I always remembered fondly that my mother went to the same high school as Justice Ginsburg, James Madison in Brooklyn, New York. And when I was making oral arguments in front of the Supreme Court with justice Ginsburg it reminded me of arguments. I would have with my mother growing up. It was never hostile. It was aggressive but not hostile and there's a difference. So I'm going to -- I think this is a day where you reflect on the on the good things and that is that this is a -- the woman who made some real history. She also -- whether you agreed with her legal position or you disagreed with it, you knew where she stood. Let me say this is someone that argued in front of her, you had to be very, very on your game when it was time for justice Ginsburg to ask those questions. And she always got right to the heart of it. As recently as May when we were up before her on a series of three cases, so I want to think about that right this moment. But again, it's a historic moment for the country, it's a historic moment for really the United States Senate now, of course, the president. And I think, Sean, one of the things we have to remember is that the Constitution lays out the framework of how this works. President nominates as with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. That's how it works. It doesn't change -- the Constitution doesn't change when you're five months before an election, two weeks before an election, or after an election for that matter. It's going to be up to the Senate on the advice and consent portion of this, and that that will be the debates that take place. But I think we have to realize that this is also a monumental appointment if the president decides to go in that direction because this is not simply a liberal justice for a liberal justice or conservative justice for a conservative justice support switch, both sides know that, and I think that's going to make this all the more significant and, of course, it is right before an election. So I suspect it's going to motivate both sides in that sense.",

We actually got -- we actually won that unanimously, so she ruled in our favor. But what was so interesting about that one, I knew she was going to ask a question regarding suffrage because obviously women did not have the right to vote until there was a constitutional amendment and here we had miners were being denied the right to participate in elections, supporting candidates under the McCain-Feingold. So I became an expert in the suffrage movement and there was not much I did not know about that, and sure enough I was able to utilize that. And I think it obviously was effective enough that she agreed with the other nine justices on our legal position. But, look, there were other times where she was you know dead set against me especially on a lot of the religion clause cases but you knew her question was going to be the critical question, not that you were going to sway her vote, not that you were going to necessarily get her vote, but you had to give an honest answer with integrity to a legal position that even if she might disagree with it you could respect or she could respect.

We'll turn that tape around in just a minute. I also have the statement, Jay, from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, that the Senate and the nation mourn the sudden passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the conclusion of her extraordinary American life. Justice Ginsburg overcame one personal challenge and professional barrier after another. She climbed from a modest Brooklyn upbringing to a seat on our nation's highest court, and into the pages of American history. Justice Ginsburg was thoroughly dedicated to the legal profession and to her 27 years of service on the U.S. Supreme Court, her intelligence and determination earned her respect and admiration throughout the legal world and indeed throughout the entire nation which now grieves alongside with her family friends and colleagues. I'll add this -- apparently her family was around her at the time of her death. And then Senator McConnell goes on: In the last midterm election before Justice Scalia's death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame duck president's second term. We kept our promise since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite party president Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year. By contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018, because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda particularly as outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise and President Trump's nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.

And that's exactly what Mitch McConnell was talking about. And that is going to be an issue for the Senate to decide, whether that there are votes sufficient to have a nominee and obviously the president has a constitutional authority to nominate, no one questions that. It's whether then the with advice and consent of Senate whether the Senate will move that forward. But let me say this -- I mean, I don't think it it's it goes, it should not go without mentioning that Justice Ginsburg who fought valiantly, I mean, I don't think anybody could deny that. My goodness she was asking me questions on May 12th from a hospital to some of my colleagues. I think she was out of the hospital by the time she did my case. But so she was fighting right until the end here, and as in Judaism, you say, may her memory be a blessing. I think that's going to be the takeaway of this historic life. The battle will be pitched on Monday, and I don't think there's any doubt about it. And look, this is one of these moments in U.S. history where you're going to be five and a half weeks out from an election, the president still serves until the next president sworn in. So if the president wins reelection, it's obviously it's his nominee. If the nominee is confirmed before the election, it's his nominee who's then confirmed as a justice. There's no rolling that back. But again, that's going to be the job. Starting Monday, you're going to hear a lot about that. That you're obviously and they're going to draw this exactly what Mitch McConnell was talking about this parallel between what happened to Merrick Garland and what happened here. Difference is you didn't have the same party controlling the presidency and the Senate and that, of course, is a significant issue.",

There's going to be enormous pressure from Democrats to delay filling this vacancy. But this election, this nomination is why Donald Trump was elected. This confirmation is why the voters voted for a Republican majority in the Senate. And I'll tell you one reason in particular, Sean, why I think it is tremendously important that not only does the nomination happen next week, but the confirmation happened before election day, because Democrats and Joe Biden have made clear they intend to challenge this election, they intend to fight the legitimacy of the election. As you know Hillary Clinton has told Joe Biden under no circumstances should you concede, you should challenge this election, and we cannot have Election Day come and go with a 4-4 court. A 4-4 court that is equally divided cannot decide anything, and I think, and I think we risk a constitutional crisis if we do not have a nine justice Supreme Court, particularly when there is such a risk of a contested litigation, and a contested election. Twenty years ago, I was part of the legal team that litigated Bush versus Gore and went to the Supreme Court. Thirty-seven days, the country did not know who the president was going to be, and if we had a 4-4 court, it could have dragged on for weeks and months. And so I think we have a responsibility -- a responsibility to do our job. The president should nominate a principled constitutionalist with a proven record, and the Senate -- it's going to take a lot of work to get it done before election day, but I think we should do our job and protect the country from the constitutional crisis that could result otherwise.",

As a young attorney, you all know the story, she persisted overcoming a lot of -- a lot of obstacles for a woman and practicing law in those days, as well as she continued until she moved herself in a position where she could end up changing the law of the land, or leading the effort to provide equality for women in every field, and she led in the advance of equal rights for women. It's hard to believe it was my honor to preside over her confirmation hearing. I got to meet her at the time, and she -- and her ascent to the Supreme Court. The decades since, she has been absolutely, consistently reliable and a voice for -- for freedom and opportunity for everyone. And, you know, and she never failed she was fierce and unflinching in her pursuit of the civil and legal rights of -- civil rights of everyone. Her opinions and her dissent are going to continue to shape the basis for a law for a generation. And, you know, tonight and in the coming days, we should focus on the loss of her -- the justice and her enduring legacy. But there is no doubt, let me be clear, that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider. This was the position of the Republican Senate took in 2016, when there were almost 10 months to go before the election. That's the position the United States Senate must take today and the election is only 46 days off. I think the fastest justice ever confirmed was 47 days and the average is closer to 70 days. And so, I should do this with full consideration and -- and that is my hope and expectation what will happen. Thank you all and I'm sorry -- such a -- we had to learn it on the plane ride, but thank you very much.",

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to FOX News. It is a FOX News alert on this Friday evening, 9:00 on the East Coast, 6:00 on the West Coast. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg is dead at the age of 87. Justice Ginsberg battled cancer on and off for decades, was fighting pancreatic cancer at the time of her passing. Now, Justice Ginsburg leaves behind a long legacy at the Supreme Court where she served since 1993. She was appointed by then President Bill Clinton, known as one of the most liberal leaning judges on the bench. Justice Ginsburg had a distinguished legal career, the first Jewish woman to serve on the highest court in our land. Our thoughts and prayers, by the way, tonight are with the entire Ginsburg family, her colleagues at the U.S. Supreme Court and everyone who knew and loved Justice Ginsburg. Sources on the ground tonight -- we'll put up a box of the president. He is in Minnesota tonight in the middle of a rally. They have confirmed to \"Hannity\" that the president has not yet been informed of her death prior to going on stage. Interestingly, while they did have a deep philosophical divide, Justice Ginsburg was well known to have a great deep friendship with Antonin Scalia, who passed away a short time ago. They were close friends. By the way, my own father died from pancreatic cancer, in a very short period of time. It is an insidious cancer. She battled this cancer with incredible, inspiring courage, beyond heroic. She will be missed by many. Now, with just 46 days until the presidential election, we are about to experience a political hurricane the likes of which -- well, we've probably never seen. Although she spoke softly, Justice Ginsburg was a giant on the Supreme Court. Her legacy will live on in the days weeks and months and years ahead, and breaking just moments ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell mourned the loss of Justice Ginsburg and announced, quote, President Trump's Supreme Court nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Here with more tonight, we begin with our own John Roberts from the White House -- John."

      "utterance": "And, Sean, it is interesting to note that the president was about minutes into his speech there in Bemidji, Minnesota, up there on the Iron Range, when news of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death came so the president does probably not yet know what has happened. But just moments ago just as part of his standard speech the president started talking about the issue of the Supreme Court in terms of the election, saying that he will nominate justices and judges who interpret the Constitution as written, says the Supreme Court is so important the next president will get maybe up to four justices that will be appointed for a long, long time. So the president now has a decision to make does he as President Obama did in 2016 after Anthony Scalia's passing nominate someone to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the bench or does he hold back. I think that the betting is that the president probably will make a nomination sometime in the not too distant future because, obviously, tonight is a is a night to pay tribute to the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and a giant on the Supreme Court, but then we'll begin the process of replacing her. And as you pointed out right at the top of this, Sean, that is going to be a battle royal between now and Election Day. Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that it was her fondest wish that uh if she were to pass or if she were to leave the court, that she'll not be replaced until a new president is installed. So, the president has got this decision to make. And I would be if I were a betting man, Sean, I would bet that the decision will be made to make a nomination. Mitch McConnell as you pointed out at the top here, has said he will bring that nominee to the floor and then the clock will be running do you get it done before the election, or do you get it done before the end of the year, do you get it done before the end of the term, depending on how the election goes? Don't forget, the Senate's going to turn over at the beginning of January. So there is a finite period of time to get a nominee through, should the president decide to make a nomination. The -- we have not heard anything yet from the White House I'm told we probably won't hear anything until the president is on his way back.

That's something that he's been resisting -- Sean.

    {
      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey there, Sean. Well, here's what we have to look at here. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, he came out here within a matter of a few minutes after uh it was announced that justice Ginsburg had died and this is very similar to what he did in 2016 after Justice Antonin Scalia passed away. Mitch McConnell unilaterally back in announced that they would not consider Merrick Garland or whoever President Obama was going to put forth. What he has announced this evening -- and I'll just read you the statement here -- he says, quote, President Trump's nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Now, there are some metrics here that we need to pay attention to. The average for Supreme Court nominees once they are nominated to when they get to their hearing is about 40 days, 40 to 45 days. It's 67 days from their nomination until they are confirmed. Now, some other metrics here with Brett Kavanaugh was 57 days from his nomination to his hearing and 89 days from his nomination to confirmation. So you can see we're kind of on the cusp whether or not they can properly vet a Supreme Court nominee, get a confirmation hearing through, and then put it on the floor before the election. I think probably putting it on the floor before the election is almost an impossibility based on the metric used for Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Here are the other phenomenon to look for. You have Lindsey Graham who has an increasingly competitive Senate race in South Carolina the chair of the Judiciary Committee, he will be asked to shepherd through this nominee. Kamala Harris, a Democratic vice-presidential nominee, she is on the judiciary committee as well and as I say it's always about the math on Capitol Hill. Lisa Murkowski, Republican senator from Alaska has indicated that she thinks that we should probably wait until January. A new president, whoever that is, whether it be President Biden or President Trump to consider that nominee and you wonder how these other Republican senators in battleground states how they will shape up. Will they be on board here? Remember Mitch McConnell, he needs votes to be able to overcome a filibuster. This was the precedent change that he initiated with Neil Gorsuch to confirm him back in 2017, and then also at least 51 votes to confirm the nominee. So, look at Susan Collins in Maine, Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Cory Gardner in Colorado, probably a couple of others, and certainly, Mitch McConnell, don't forget that he's up here too, but they need 51 votes. So in other words, you could lose two. Right now, there are Republican 53 yea's, and 53 Republicans in the Senate. So you can get down to 51. But if it's a 50-50 vote, keep in mind that Mike Pence, the vice president, he has broken ties they've never confirmed it justice uh with a vice president breaking the tie. In fact, Mike Pence confirmed the first executive branch nomination with Betsy DeVos, the education secretary in early 2017 on a 51-50 vote. So as John Roberts said, you know, we are in for a real roller coaster. But I want to direct everybody back to that timeline which is so critical. If you follow the history here, it would be very hard probably to put that nominee on the Senate floor to have a vote and do some of these other senators. Sean, do they agree with Mitch McConnell that they should push through as quickly as he is suggesting in this statement."

He was just wrapping up his speech before a capacity crowd in Minnesota, about 25,000 people I'm told on the ground there. John Roberts also confirming with his sources with the Trump team on the ground of Minnesota he was not made aware of the death before he was about minutes into a speech when news crossed the wires about it.

      "utterance": "Yes, Sean, her colleagues are grieving tonight because what they know better than anyone else is that this is a family and this is a very unique position that no one else could possibly understand unless they have served on that bench. We've talked a lot about the unorthodox friendship that she had with the late Justice Scalia. They couldn't have been more different ideologically they didn't see the constitution and the way to interpret it the same way, but they actually were very close. Their families socialized together. They both loved opera and cooking together. So there are deep, deep roots there of friendship despite the ideological divides and that was a good example that probably our country could use right now. She was a trailblazer. I mean, we've talked about the fact that when she came out of law school, one of nine women in her Harvard Law School class, she couldn't find a job. She actually had people tell her I can't hire you because you're a woman. I mean she was married. She had children. She has two children. She leaves behind four grandchildren and she was always devoted to her family. They were her number one priority. But the court was clearly her life's mission, her life's work. I've told the story about the day after her husband died, she was there in court. I showed up to court and saw her on the bench and I was shocked. But she was so devoted to her work and she has always said, despite the numerous battles with cancer and other physical challenges, that she was going to keep serving as long as she possibly could. And there were people you'll remember during the last election on the left who asked her to step down before the possibility of a Republican president was elected and she said no to her critics on the left and the right. I have a position to do. I have work to do and she kind of intimated that someone like her could not be nominated in what has become a very partisan and very difficult environment now for these nominees. And she's probably right about that. So she left a trail behind her of showing working women how to be strong voices in the legal field to also have a family, to have friendships with people that you might disagree with. And you know, just a few weeks ago, she's always been very transparent about her health. She had put out a statement through the court saying that she had a recurrence of her cancer but talking about the different treatments that she tried and how she felt good that chemo was working, and she was very positive moving into the summer and into the fall term. We know she officiated a wedding just within the last few weeks. So we know that she had been feeling good and doing better. So this news does come as a bit of a shock tonight, and as we have to think about what comes next, as someone who's covered the court for years, I think about the fact that there are a number of election-related disputes that have been bubbling up to the Supreme Court. If we had another year like Bush v. Gore, we'd have eight justices on the court that would be exceptionally difficult on the court and on the justices. So there are so many things to think about tonight, but most importantly, the legacy of this woman who has made history in so many ways and is now gone at the age of 87 -- Sean."

Just what they all face. I remember particular one holiday party which they were sort of still calling a Christmas party at that point, and there is a point at which uh they're in the court, in one of the great halls, that they have a piano and somebody leads carols. And usually, it's done by the chief. But I remember this particular year that Justice Scalia was really very animated and he was sort of assigning people parts and he was singing at the top of his voice and I remember seeing her at one moment sort of this bemused look on her face sort of like that's Nino, they really were close. And they seemed to really stick up for each other to have each other's backs, and to genuinely enjoy each other's company -- not that it was something they felt like they had to do, but that they actually wanted to do, just to spend time together and to support each other personally."

      "utterance": "Well, it's quite a day and, you know, I just thought back over the fact that I had the privilege in honor of presenting oral arguments before Justice Ginsburg since the day she was sworn in and confirmed and became a justice of the Supreme Court 27 years ago. So, I've had a long history with justice Ginsburg and, you know, all I can say is, first of all, our thoughts and prayers for her family. But let me say this about Justice Ginsburg, whether you agreed with the legal position or not, she was a very, very smart, brilliant lawyer, advocate and justice. And even when she disagreed with me, which was frequent, but not always, I always remembered fondly that my mother went to the same high school as Justice Ginsburg, James Madison in Brooklyn, New York. And when I was making oral arguments in front of the Supreme Court with justice Ginsburg it reminded me of arguments. I would have with my mother growing up. It was never hostile. It was aggressive but not hostile and there's a difference. So I'm going to -- I think this is a day where you reflect on the on the good things and that is that this is a -- the woman who made some real history. She also -- whether you agreed with her legal position or you disagreed with it, you knew where she stood. Let me say this is someone that argued in front of her, you had to be very, very on your game when it was time for justice Ginsburg to ask those questions. And she always got right to the heart of it. As recently as May when we were up before her on a series of three cases, so I want to think about that right this moment. But again, it's a historic moment for the country, it's a historic moment for really the United States Senate now, of course, the president. And I think, Sean, one of the things we have to remember is that the Constitution lays out the framework of how this works. President nominates as with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. That's how it works. It doesn't change -- the Constitution doesn't change when you're five months before an election, two weeks before an election, or after an election for that matter. It's going to be up to the Senate on the advice and consent portion of this, and that that will be the debates that take place. But I think we have to realize that this is also a monumental appointment if the president decides to go in that direction because this is not simply a liberal justice for a liberal justice or conservative justice for a conservative justice support switch, both sides know that, and I think that's going to make this all the more significant and, of course, it is right before an election. So I suspect it's going to motivate both sides in that sense."

We actually got -- we actually won that unanimously, so she ruled in our favor. But what was so interesting about that one, I knew she was going to ask a question regarding suffrage because obviously women did not have the right to vote until there was a constitutional amendment and here we had miners were being denied the right to participate in elections, supporting candidates under the McCain-Feingold. So I became an expert in the suffrage movement and there was not much I did not know about that, and sure enough I was able to utilize that. And I think it obviously was effective enough that she agreed with the other nine justices on our legal position. But, look, there were other times where she was you know dead set against me especially on a lot of the religion clause cases but you knew her question was going to be the critical question, not that you were going to sway her vote, not that you were going to necessarily get her vote, but you had to give an honest answer with integrity to a legal position that even if she might disagree with it you could respect or she could respect. And I think that was always my -- and my colleagues who have done this numerous times before the court."

We'll turn that tape around in just a minute. I also have the statement, Jay, from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, that the Senate and the nation mourn the sudden passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the conclusion of her extraordinary American life. Justice Ginsburg overcame one personal challenge and professional barrier after another. She climbed from a modest Brooklyn upbringing to a seat on our nation's highest court, and into the pages of American history. Justice Ginsburg was thoroughly dedicated to the legal profession and to her 27 years of service on the U.S. Supreme Court, her intelligence and determination earned her respect and admiration throughout the legal world and indeed throughout the entire nation which now grieves alongside with her family friends and colleagues. I'll add this -- apparently her family was around her at the time of her death."

We kept our promise since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite party president Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year. By contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018, because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda particularly as outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary. Once again, we will keep our promise and President Trump's nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. Within -- this being the election year obviously uh I would assume tonight obviously people mourning the death of Justice Ginsburg but by probably Tuesday of next week, the latest this battle will begin, Jay Sekulow."

So -- it's probably going to be Monday. And I think what Mitch McConnell said is actually where the battle is going to be fought and that is this -- Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama and that vote never made it to the floor of the United States Senate for a vote, why? And that's exactly what Mitch McConnell was talking about. And that is going to be an issue for the Senate to decide, whether that there are votes sufficient to have a nominee and obviously the president has a constitutional authority to nominate, no one questions that. It's whether then the with advice and consent of Senate whether the Senate will move that forward. But let me say this -- I mean, I don't think it it's it goes, it should not go without mentioning that Justice Ginsburg who fought valiantly, I mean, I don't think anybody could deny that. My goodness she was asking me questions on May 12th from a hospital to some of my colleagues. I think she was out of the hospital by the time she did my case. But so she was fighting right until the end here, and as in Judaism, you say, may her memory be a blessing. I think that's going to be the takeaway of this historic life. The battle will be pitched on Monday, and I don't think there's any doubt about it. And look, this is one of these moments in U.S. history where you're going to be five and a half weeks out from an election, the president still serves until the next president sworn in. So if the president wins reelection, it's obviously it's his nominee. If the nominee is confirmed before the election, it's his nominee who's then confirmed as a justice. There's no rolling that back. But again, that's going to be the job. Starting Monday, you're going to hear a lot about that. That you're obviously and they're going to draw this exactly what Mitch McConnell was talking about this parallel between what happened to Merrick Garland and what happened here. Difference is you didn't have the same party controlling the presidency and the Senate and that, of course, is a significant issue."

It'd be .600 in front of Justice Ginsburg. But look, as I said earlier, she was a tough, tough justice on questioning she was just by the way there's no doubt why Scalia -- justice -- the late Justice Scalia, now the late Justice Ginsburg were so close. They were a very similar personality. They were both brilliant. They both asked really hard questions and they were not going to be -- they didn't want a -- there was no answer in front of Justice Ginsburg or Justice Scalia that was this, \"I don't know\". It was yes or no, and then explain yourself. There was never \"I don't know\". And that's one thing you learned by practicing in front of them. But, Sean, look, this is going to be a big battle come Monday. We know that. Right now, you honor the memory. That's the right thing to do. Monday is going to be when the attention turns to the nominee and if there is a nominee and how that moves forward and that's going to be the president's determination under the Constitution, and then the Senate's role in advice and consent."

You got two minutes uninterrupted which I don't think I ever went 37 seconds uninterrupted before COVID, and then each justice could ask a couple of questions. Let me tell you one really quick, quick story here, and it's a Justice Ginsburg memory, and I'm glad it happened. They basically got two questions each, and came to justice Ginsburg and she asked me one I answered it. She asked me two, I answered it. She was starting another question. The chief justice came in, was going to go to the next justice, but she finished saying that kind of talked over him. And you're really supposed to not respond unless the chief justice gives you permission, and I just answered the question anyways. I figured this woman was in a hospital two weeks before answering questions, this justice deserves that honor and respect. I was going to answer her question. She may not have liked my answer and evidently she did not because she ruled against -- she ruled against my position, but I answered the question with honesty and stood for our legal position.

She lost her mom before graduating high school, went on to go to Harvard Law where she began her legal studies. Nine women in the class out of 500 -- I mean, people -- many people do not know, her husband actually got cancer during her time at law school. So, she was raising a three-year-old daughter, taking care of her husband, on the law review and worked to the top of academic excellence. She was a trailblazer for women.

She served 27 years. Before she was on the court, she was a court of appeals judge. And before that, she was a legendary advocate. She was one of the most accomplished Supreme Court advocates to have ever lived. I argued before her nine times. She was brilliant and she was a very careful lawyer and she was a trailblazer, and she leaves a large legacy.

Let me go -- the president was asked very briefly, my sources and John Robert confirming as well, had told me the president was not aware of the justice's death prior to going on stage in Minnesota for his rally tonight, but as he was walking back to Air Force One as he now makes his way back to Washington.

      "speaker": "CRUZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the court, we are one vote away from losing our fundamental constitutional liberties, and I believe that the president should next week nominate a successor to the court. And I think it is critical that the Senate takes up and confirms that successor before Election Day. There's going to be enormous pressure from the media. There's going to be enormous pressure from Democrats to delay filling this vacancy. But this election, this nomination is why Donald Trump was elected. This confirmation is why the voters voted for a Republican majority in the Senate. And I'll tell you one reason in particular, Sean, why I think it is tremendously important that not only does the nomination happen next week, but the confirmation happened before election day, because Democrats and Joe Biden have made clear they intend to challenge this election, they intend to fight the legitimacy of the election. As you know Hillary Clinton has told Joe Biden under no circumstances should you concede, you should challenge this election, and we cannot have Election Day come and go with a 4-4 court. A 4-4 court that is equally divided cannot decide anything, and I think, and I think we risk a constitutional crisis if we do not have a nine justice Supreme Court, particularly when there is such a risk of a contested litigation, and a contested election. Twenty years ago, I was part of the legal team that litigated Bush versus Gore and went to the Supreme Court. Thirty-seven days, the country did not know who the president was going to be, and if we had a 4-4 court, it could have dragged on for weeks and months. And so I think we have a responsibility -- a responsibility to do our job. The president should nominate a principled constitutionalist with a proven record, and the Senate -- it's going to take a lot of work to get it done before election day, but I think we should do our job and protect the country from the constitutional crisis that could result otherwise."

She was going to stay away from the wine, and then the dinner came and she said, it just was so delicious, it needed wine to accompany it, and Scalia pipes up and says, well, that's the first intelligent thing you've done.

      "utterance": "-- Bader Ginsburg who is not only a giant in a legal profession but a beloved figure. And my heart goes out to all those who cared for her and cared about her. And she practiced the highest American ideals as a justice, equality and justice under the law. And Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood -- stood for all of us. As I said, she was a beloved figure. As a young attorney, you all know the story, she persisted overcoming a lot of -- a lot of obstacles for a woman and practicing law in those days, as well as she continued until she moved herself in a position where she could end up changing the law of the land, or leading the effort to provide equality for women in every field, and she led in the advance of equal rights for women. It's hard to believe it was my honor to preside over her confirmation hearing. I got to meet her at the time, and she -- and her ascent to the Supreme Court. The decades since, she has been absolutely, consistently reliable and a voice for -- for freedom and opportunity for everyone. And, you know, and she never failed she was fierce and unflinching in her pursuit of the civil and legal rights of -- civil rights of everyone. Her opinions and her dissent are going to continue to shape the basis for a law for a generation. And, you know, tonight and in the coming days, we should focus on the loss of her -- the justice and her enduring legacy. But there is no doubt, let me be clear, that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider. This was the position of the Republican Senate took in 2016, when there were almost 10 months to go before the election. That's the position the United States Senate must take today and the election is only 46 days off. I think the fastest justice ever confirmed was 47 days and the average is closer to 70 days. And so, I should do this with full consideration and -- and that is my hope and expectation what will happen.

I'm already seeing a lot of conservatives use the argument that Senator Cruz used to you just moments ago that the court must be at its full compliment for any election disputes like Bush V.

We have heard an occasion uh where the folks near the top of the stairs will break into applause. There are obviously people who are speaking about the life and legacy of the late Justice Ginsburg. But, by and large, you're seeing people here considering not just her great legacy and her impact on the court, but I think it's also fair to say, Sean, they're wondering what her passing will mean for the future not just of the court but for the country. I'm going to step over here for just a second, Carrie (ph), I want you to show -- this is something else that really struck me, we've seen flowers and candles and that sort of that aroma the sweet aroma has been wafting down the stairs here.

And, John, we had both confirmed rightly so, other networks have gotten it wrong, that the president was out there about 10 minutes before the news broke, and you could see when he left and was about to board Air Force One, he made those comments about an amazing woman, an amazing life and was surprised to hear the news."

You know, this is clearly a night and it will be a weekend as well to honor the legacy of one of the true giants of the jurisprudence here in the United States. But not just behind the scenes but publicly, people are laying down positions, and you've got to wonder what the conversation is aboard Air Force One right now on the way back from Minnesota. They're obviously involved in discussions about the way forward here. Mitch McConnell has said, you know, he'll put the nominee on the floor. So if you were the president of the United States and you were facing the possibility of what Ted Cruz was laying out for you, why would you not put forward a nominee? But if you do, there is going to be a political conflagration that consumes this country, that adds on top of the conflagrations that we've already been dealing with here, since the beginning of this year. I mean, you heard Ted Cruz say the president should put up a nominee next week. Dianne Feinstein has said under no circumstances should a nominee be put forward. Joe Biden just a moment ago said voters should pick the president and the president should pick the nominee, and then it gets down to the political action committees as well, which are funding a lot of uh the politics on the periphery.

Interesting side note, her relationship with Scalia and Thomas well known, affable in spite of fierce differences in judicial philosophy.

One of her biggest decisions, United States versus Virginia, involved a single sex admission -- a military academy that became open to both sexes. I mean, this was a powerful woman in spite of her size in spite of her height and I had been to work out so where she was present as well in some of the spas that I have gone to.

I can't stand when people pass away and immediately, you know, people, you know, forget the human side of this and she has a family and she served her country and she gets along with -- got along so well with Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas. Tammy, your thoughts?"

      "utterance": "Yes. So, look, I think that she's a perfect example of what's possible in this country, right? We talk about what she accomplished, but really, only possible in this nation. And her own commitment to her work tells us that this court is important, that she would not want the court to be split four to four and even, yes, her relationship with Scalia indicates clearly that she believes and lived a life where you get along with the people you disagree with where you negotiate with them where you deal with them in a human way without being aggressive or ugly or looking to burn things down or to hurt them. So if we're going to really honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg's legacy, it is to handle this as she would want us to handle it. And I think that this entire discussion tonight has been fabulous. It's touched on all those issues. But for women as a role model, separate from ideology, but as an indication for every American about what the individual can do, what we can accomplish as individual people, Donald Trump shows us that, and from a very different life growing up to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, moving up out of some level of poverty and out of, you know -- also in New York. But showing us that no matter who you are, you can make the rest of what your future is it's in your own hands and we have heard as an excellent example of that."
