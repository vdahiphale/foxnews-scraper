Greatness most of often realized not in the moment, but rather in retrospect. As President Trump waged his unique battle to get North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong-un to the bargaining table, he was roundly criticized for his style, telling Kim Jong-un as he continued to launch his nuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles that Kim would be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Trump threatening in no uncertain terms that his nuclear button was bigger and more powerful than the dictator's. And in that back and forth, Kim threatens to send a birthday gift on Independence Day to the American \"bastards.\" The name calling was unprecedented. Madman, rogue, gangster, frightened barking dog, dotard, rocket man, little rocket man -- the criticism of course by the American media was relentless. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The narrative was that Trump was instigating a nuclear holocaust.

All the while, continuing to impose a slew of economic sanctions, warning that if forced to defend ourselves or our allies, we would have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. So, here we are, March 10th, little rocket man, seeking to sit down with the president of the United States. Never in our history or theirs has this happened. No other president could accomplish this, not Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, not Bill Clinton, not George W. Bush and certainly not Barack Obama -- all either incapable or unwilling to confront a predictable impending disaster that Trump warned of in 1999 long before he became president.

They are anything but a domestic terror organization. It's the opposite. They defend our Second Amendment rights. They are comprised of millions of law- abiding Americans across the country. You know what, to the governor of Connecticut, none of these mass shooters are NRA members. They are the ones protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans so that we could protect against the criminals.

I mean, honestly, when you think -- they're not going to send missiles up. Think of it? They're not sending missiles up, and I believe that. I believe that. I really do. I think they want to do something. I think they want to make peace. I think it's time, and I think we have shown great strength. I think that's also important. They say, they want to stop the missiles. They want to denuclearize. They want to do all of these things, and all of these people are like they can't believe it. It's unbelievable. I said to my wife, I said, \"You know, it's amazing. They are really nice tonight. It's really amazing. They are all saying this is an incredible achievement. This is.\" Okay, then, I get up in the morning. Some time goes by, right? Same people, they are saying, \"Not that big a deal. Anybody could've done it. Obama could have done it.\" Obama had a chance -- no, no. They are saying Obama, Obama, Obama. Obama was driving you down. You take a look at those numbers before we took over. They were heading down. The economy is the best it has ever been. Your coal -- by the way folks, some of you who are in the coal world. Your coal is coming back. Big, big, big, big. Your steel is coming back. Your steel is coming back. We've created three million jobs since Election Day. Nobody thought that was possible. We passed the largest tax cuts and reform in American history. We've created more than 300,000 new jobs alone last month.

      "utterance": "President Trump firing up supporters in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. We'll hear much more from the president later this hour, but now, my opening statement. Genius is rarely recognized at the time it occurs. Greatness most of often realized not in the moment, but rather in retrospect. As President Trump waged his unique battle to get North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong-un to the bargaining table, he was roundly criticized for his style, telling Kim Jong-un as he continued to launch his nuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles that Kim would be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. And Trump threatening in no uncertain terms that his nuclear button was bigger and more powerful than the dictator's. And in that back and forth, Kim threatens to send a birthday gift on Independence Day to the American \"bastards.\" The name calling was unprecedented. Madman, rogue, gangster, frightened barking dog, dotard, rocket man, little rocket man -- the criticism of course by the American media was relentless. The narrative was that Trump was instigating a nuclear holocaust. That the United States was giving Kim Jong-un no out other than nuclear war. This in spite of the fact that Kim was repeatedly launching ballistic missiles threatening their reach to Guam, Hawaii and the mainland. Trump of course, in his usual fashion was undeterred. All the while, continuing to impose a slew of economic sanctions, warning that if forced to defend ourselves or our allies, we would have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. So, here we are, March 10th, little rocket man, seeking to sit down with the president of the United States. Never in our history or theirs has this happened. No other president could accomplish this, not Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, not Bill Clinton, not George W. Bush and certainly not Barack Obama -- all either incapable or unwilling to confront a predictable impending disaster that Trump warned of in 1999 long before he became president. Don't believe me, listen to the president just two hours ago."

So, much for the Bill Clinton-Neville Chamberlain, a peace man approach to dictators. As far as George Bush in 2008, he did his part in appeasing Kim Jong-il by actually removing, I said removing North Korea from the American State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism. He really had a grasp on the issues, that one. And Barack Obama, in his inimitable fashion with language we have heard before said, he was going to \"work with all the interested partners in the international community to take appropriate steps to the let North Korea know they cannot threaten other countries with impunity.\" Now what does that mean? Whatever it meant, it didn't scare Kim. Now, instead of recognizing the historic moment and the genius that got a whack into a madman to the bargaining table, the mainstream media chooses to hit criticism on Donald Trump when their own champions accomplished absolutely nothing."

And get this, we are not even in a position to verify or monitor if there is nuclear disarmament or even do site inspections, and rest assured, there will be no cash sent unmarked on marked planes and various world currencies. Count on a new and totally different agreement with teeth with Donald Trump. It was Trump's genius in crippling economic sanctions that brought this dictator to his knees, and although the mainstream media is worried, predicting that Trump will be outsmarted and outplayed by this dictator, in truth, the only people who need to be worried are the North Koreans. Donald Trump is more than the man Kim thinks he is. He's already outsmarted him, and that can get us a peace deal that will certainly last a long, long time.

He mentioned South Korea, the stuff he's doing on steel and tariffs. It's so important to that area of Pennsylvania in particular.

      "utterance": "Well, I think there is a few things there. I mean, he's absolutely right when it comes to the ratings. Everybody admits it. It was funny, there was an interview with some of the late-night show hosts the other day and they said, \"You know, our monologues and our jokes used to always be about the news, but Donald Trump is the news now. He is the first, second, third, fourth segment on every show.\" So, part of reason that the late-night shows are all about Donald Trump is because the news is all about Donald Trump. The thing that I think is fascinating is that they focus more about process and chaos and less about the achievements. You think about Friday, Judge, 313 jobs. The expectation was supposed to be for 200,000. 313 -- that's a 113,000 more Americans that have a job largely because of the tax cuts and the regulations that this president has done and we are only 14 months in. At some point, the press is going to have a hard time making excuses for not covering the accomplishments of the president."

It was like they were upset about it, but I want to ask you something, you know, they talk about chaos in the White House, right? You were in the West Wing and they say it's a disaster, nobody knows what's going on. That this one left and that one left. What's it like when Donald Trump is in the West Wing? Is there is any question about who is in charge and what the agenda is?"

I care about whether more Americans are working, whether or not they are getting higher wages, whether or not our borders are safe. The flow of illegal immigration is down, whether or not ISIS is on the run, whether or not businesses and manufacturing is coming back and businesses are thriving. All of those metrics are moving in the right direction. I will tell you that I will take chaos and whatever else they throw our way if we continue to have results. Because at the end of the day, you don't want boring and no results. What this president is giving us is yes, he's mixing it up. He is not satisfied with the status quo. But the bigger point, Jeanine, and this just gets largely missed, he is doing exactly what he said he was going to do, and he's behaving exactly how he has before. He's a disrupter who likes to bring people in, fight it out. Get the best idea and charge forward. He's doing everything he said he was going to do and getting results."

But no one can take away from him that he has been able to do something in less than 18 months that the previous 24 years have not been able to do, and that's bringing the leader of North Korea to the table."

But for the first time, we have had a president that pushed back. We can argue about the type of rhetoric that he's used or what have you, but sometimes, a bully need to know that you will stand up to him and you are willing to throw a punch. The most important thing is that Kim Jong-un knows that he cannot take the first offensive action because China has already said that they will not stand for that. So, we do have a sense of a high ground that we can continue to implement these sanctions which put a stranglehold on him and I think that's what has brought him to the table."

But this past week, we just had a woman by the name of Elizabeth Grunick, who wrote a commentary in The Washington Post about why America should try socialism. But we just finished trying it for the past eight years, and Ms. Grunick was not joking, but you would hope that she would have been."

You know, it's not \"Make America great again,\" it's going to be \"Keep America great,\" explanation point. But what do you think is going to happen? I mean, you were in Congress, 2018, you know, it is middle of the first term of a president, not a good year generally."

Both of them delved into a very unpopular policy and that was healthcare, and that is why they saw massive losses. But right now, when you listen to the Democrats, they are the party that stands for illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. That's not a winning issue. Bernie Sanders is out there talking about repealing the tax cut law. That is definitely not a winning issue if you want to take away the crumbs that you have just given to people, and if you are looking at restoring our military, you look at having a stronger foreign policy, why would we want to turn it over to a party that had us in a position of weakness? So, I don't think they have a platform other than, \"We hate Donald Trump and we want to impeach him\""

Look, California is the petri dish for all of the progressive socialist policies that you want to see exported all across the United States of America and you know, me being here in Dallas, Texas, they have this mantra called, \"Turn Texas Blue.\" Why would you want to turn Texas into anything except the economic successful engine that it is? Why would you want to have it look like California? Why would you compare the capital of Texas -- Austin, Texas with San Francisco? That's not a winning proposition."

You know, the President is doing a great job, but specifically in the last week, he has been doing the job of cleaning up the mess left of former President Bill Clinton. Let's look at two examples. Number one, Korea. You know, you look back, North Korea had its way to get nuclear weapons because of the lack of leadership and the agreement from former President Bill Clinton. In fact, there are many people including, then businessman Donald Trump that warned the Clinton administration, don't do it. They are going to get nuclear weapons, and of course, you see this week, we are getting closer to peace talks than ever, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump. Number two, look at trade. Of course, Bill Clinton pushed forth a disaster of NAFTA, which helped -- millions of jobs left this country and the president took a strong stand to protect US steel in this country. So, you know what? He is doing his job. It's another outrageous statement from someone who is just swimming in political irrelevancy. Thank goodness her mother is not president of the United States."

In the 1960's when no other organization would do so, the NRA stepped up and trained, empowered and supplied black Americans to be able to fight back against, the Klu Klux Klan. They are anything but a domestic terror organization. It's the opposite. They defend our Second Amendment rights. They are comprised of millions of law- abiding Americans across the country. You know what, to the governor of Connecticut, none of these mass shooters are NRA members. They are the ones protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans so that we could protect against the criminals. It's a disgusting statement, but I am not surprised given the insanity that left- wing politicians are now swimming in trying to figure out some way to describe what they can't understand which is a grassroots movement that has put them in the political minority."
