They're trying to retaliate against the Brits for taking a tanker away from them for good reasons violating sanctions and they get humiliated by the Brits with a warship in the area. It's a stunning, embarrassing humiliation. Zarif is in New York City and he's talking to people about you know, I'm willing to put ballistic missiles on a table as a negotiating tool, we start to respond to it, 24 hours later he says no, no, I didn't really mean that. This is extraordinary what is happening. I think it might take on it, Martha, is an indication of the pressure, the absolute pressure that the Iranians are feeling here.",

And if we were to go back to the pre-enlightenment, that's how we use to identify ourselves, as tribal people, that our first loyalty is always to people of similar superficial appearance and nobody is singling her out. She singling herself out when she says not that I'm a woman or I'm a conservative or a progressive, but I'm a woman of color. And if everybody were to do that, you can see where it ends, where it leads to, it needs to Rwanda or the Balkans. And it's kind of disturbing because when you make any point, as you pointed out, if you have a problem at the border or you have a problem with voter registration and people who tend to be the most obvious aggressors are not of a particular race or gender, then that becomes synonymous with racism. It would be almost like saying well, there's a lot of white people in Wall Street and we are really worried about Wall Street ethics and therefore we don't like white people, or I support the Iraq war or I oppose it but the fatalities in the Iraq war were disproportionately white over their numbers in the population, therefore I'm a racist.

We've seen them make racist comments in the past -- these four particular individuals.

Not Israeli Muslims or Israeli Christians, but the targeting of Jews. And using politics as some sort of affirmative defense. And I think the shame here is that what's lost in this fake outrage over Trump's comments is that the real racists here -- really the modern-day Nazis are getting away with murder.

And knew what you can't do is take away the feelings of the people of color when we hear those type of comments. Because those type of comments have a real and lasting impact. As we heard it on the playground, We heard it at work, we heard it at school, and let's be very clear if an employer had said that -- if a restaurant owner had said that, if a store clerk had said that, there would be lawsuits. People would get fired. And it's happened. If you go to the EEOC, there's a complaint, and there's actual settlements for people using that same language.

Look, I'm the son of an immigrant too, my mother was a war refugee after World War II from Poland, and was a stateless refugee in America welcomed her here. So, immigrants make -- are what makes this country great. It's unsettling sometimes because most of the vast majority of immigrants are incredibly patriotic and love their country, and don't have hate. And they particularly have a love of the country because they've seen what oppression is like or what a lack of opportunity is like, and what real discrimination is like, and it's unsettling to see somebody like Ilhan Omar, who is a Somali refugee who was welcomed into this country to express so much hostility towards the country that welcomed her in. And such a virulent anti-Semitism. And so, the solution is not to say go back home. The solution is to oppose her in a Democratic process and show what makes -- what make America great is that free people are free to be wrong. And she is a free person in a free country and she is free to be wrong. She's free to be a bigot. And but, she is also a political figure and she is not above criticism. The fact that Donald Trump said something offensive about them, doesn't make them saints. And doesn't make them above criticism, and we should be calling out when she says it's all about the Benjamin's when she says people who support Israel have dual loyalty.

But I think if we really want to rule out bigotry in his country, it goes beyond calling names at each other and running people -- or running against each other in primaries. Let's actually have education. I mean, we saw Donald Trump went to the African-American history museum. I think he should go back. And if we really want Ilhan Omar to be educated about what anti-Semitism causes, then, let's have a trip to the holocaust museum. If we really want to change this country, if we really want to bring this country together, let's not throw mud at each other, and let's educate each other, because here is the truth. If we want to make -- truly want to make America great, we have to live with each other. We are each other's neighbors, and that requires us living together, and education is how we do it."

You know, to be quite frank about it, the Iranians obviously are feeling the weight of these crippling sanctions in a way that I've never seen for 39 years and dealing with them. And their response as much as they're determined and used to be somewhat disciplined, I find him incredibly inept in terms of what they're doing. I mean, it starts with the tankers, they sabotage six of them, and we caught them with indisputable evidence on all of them, and it absolutely backfired in their face. They had a tactical command to shoot an American drone without the authorization of their leaders, claimed it was in their airspace but couldn't prove it, our president didn't respond to it. And we wind up on a moral high ground and the Iranians loose face over it. They're trying to retaliate against the Brits for taking a tanker away from them for good reasons violating sanctions and they get humiliated by the Brits with a warship in the area. It's a stunning, embarrassing humiliation. Zarif is in New York City and he's talking to people about you know, I'm willing to put ballistic missiles on a table as a negotiating tool, we start to respond to it, 24 hours later he says no, no, I didn't really mean that.

And what we need to do is not overreact, be patient, because the strategy we have in place is working.

It shares similar routes with some other recent controversies like the push to remove a mural of George Washington from this California school because of some of the images that are also depicted in it. And you've got Nike's decision not to release these shoes, which had a Betsy Ross flag on them. In a new op-ed today, he turns on a very strong piece, pretty much every day lately it seems. Victor Davis Hanson says these arguments are really over our past -- are really over the present and especially they are about our future. Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at the Hoover Institute and author of \"The Case for Trump,\" joins us now. Victor, good to see you tonight. How are these arguments about our present and our future?"

      "utterance": "I think people feel that because of, ironically, because of our very success in addressing these sins of humankind, sexism, racism, class, oppression. We've done a pretty good job of at least compared to other countries and that creates these unreal expectations that we have to be perfect and free of all sin. We wish we were but no society, no country has ever done that, so then people get frustrated and they say well, we were flawed at the beginning, and they don't look at the United States empirically. And by that, I mean where do -- people from Kenya do not go to Honduras and students do not want to enroll at the University of Moscow. And when you're in trouble, you don't call the French Charles de Gaulle carrier to help you out. So, by any abstract or measure we are great and we are exceptional, but not when you put so many demands on us to be perfect. No country can do that. But it's a sign of our very success that we create these unreal --"

Acknowledge the fact that we are women of color so when you do singles out, be aware of that and what you're doing, especially because some of us are getting death threats, because some of us are being singled out in many ways because of our backgrounds."

    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the most anti-enlightenment thing I've ever heard, because Representative Tlaib is a person. She's a unique identity. She's a human being and she's only secondarily a woman and thirdly a person of a particular ethnic background. And if we were to go back to the pre-enlightenment, that's how we use to identify ourselves, as tribal people, that our first loyalty is always to people of similar superficial appearance and nobody is singling her out. She singling herself out when she says not that I'm a woman or I'm a conservative or a progressive, but I'm a woman of color. And if everybody were to do that, you can see where it ends, where it leads to, it needs to Rwanda or the Balkans. And it's kind of disturbing because when you make any point, as you pointed out, if you have a problem at the border or you have a problem with voter registration and people who tend to be the most obvious aggressors are not of a particular race or gender, then that becomes synonymous with racism. It would be almost like saying well, there's a lot of white people in Wall Street and we are really worried about Wall Street ethics and therefore we don't like white people, or I support the Iraq war or I oppose it but the fatalities in the Iraq war were disproportionately white over their numbers in the population, therefore I'm a racist. That's a very dangerous thing to do to transmogrified every issue into elements of race --"

It always strikes me that, you know, feminism, the whole goal is to be treated equally, to have that not be an issue that you are a woman and to have people not choose you because you're a woman or because you're not a woman, to choose you based on the merits of your work. So, it goes back to that as well. Thank you very much, Victor. Great to see you tonight, as always. Thank you, sir."

Another vote is expected next week and some Democrats believe that the Mueller hearings on Wednesday might energize members of their party toward that goal again. It's just one of the issues that is dividing Washington this week. All of which prompted a prayer to stop the incivility, and it came from House chaplain, the priest, Patrick Conroy."

And he said to me, he leaned over and said, you know, I feel a presence in here, an evil presence. He said it's not a Democrat or Republican. He said there something else going on here. And he said I'm going to have to pray tomorrow to ask God to cleanse this place. Now, that comes from Paul's letter to the Ephesians where he talked about, you know, we fight not flesh and blood but principalities. In other words, there's another evil spirit. And so, it's difficult to argue with Father Patrick because there is a mess going on here."

I have friends who say that if they don't -- if they don't come up and argue and do things that's turning off a lot of other people, that they will lose elections, that their people want them to come out and be disruptive. So, I think, you know, I'm an ordained united Methodist pastor, and I believe that there is such a thing as evil and I also think that there are forces outside the United States that are trying to tear us apart. And we are raising our hands same please, get us. Get us please. Let us tear our country up. And we are working on it, it's tragic."

Nobody one will question that. The footage is clear. You know, and I thought if I can just do this for another five minutes, we'll be out of it. We'll have a vote that it will be over. And one of the Democrats, Congresswoman Jayapal had tried to get something done to a Republican. It didn't go, and I didn't want it to go on Nancy Pelosi.
