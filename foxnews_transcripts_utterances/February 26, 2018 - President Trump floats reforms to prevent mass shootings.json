I've listened to law enforcement who have said they don't want to have to train teachers as a law enforcement agencies which takes about six months. So I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listing."

This is something that in part will have to do with the culture of each of those states, the culture of the use of guns and how comfortable people are with it. But there are a number of governors who say, including Republican governors, adding guns to this environment is not what they want to see in schools. But we will see how this debate goes forward state by state."

When we mock and ridicule the very foundational principles this nation was built upon where you treat people the way you would want to be treated, where you respect human life, where you respect the dignity of women and of children and of people who we have increasingly degraded in our society, this culture of death is becoming pervasive."

It is something all Americans can do is think about how they are handling their own families, what they are doing to look out for their own family members, helping out people in their community who have greater needs whether they be mental health or otherwise. It's not an easy fix, it's not going to get headlines, but it's actually what this country needs. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
