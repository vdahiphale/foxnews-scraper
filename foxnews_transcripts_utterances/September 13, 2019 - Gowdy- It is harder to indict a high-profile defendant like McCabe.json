      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to this Friday special edition of “Hannity: Trump Versus the Left.” We do begin tonight, though, with a Fox News alert. The DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz has now officially completed his investigation to FISA abuse. Now, the Attorney General Barr has now received a draft report, is currently reviewing those documents. And according to a letter from the House Judiciary ranking member, Congressman Doug Collins, after Barr is done reviewing the report, it will then be released to you, we, the people, the general public. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is now the culmination of a months, months, months-long extensive investigation by the DOJ's watchdog into what is rampant abuse of power at the very highest levels of the FBI and the DOJ. Now, all eyes will be on Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, and all of these other high-ranking officials who used Christopher Steele's dirty dossier as the basis, the bulk of information for a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, transition and presidency. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, remember, McCabe is the guy that said, oh, no dossier, no FISA warrant. Remember even \"The New York Times\" said about the dossier, yes, it was likely Russian disinformation from the beginning. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They used it. They never verified it. They were warned about it. Now the consequence, if we have equal justice under the law. Comey and others were all warned. They were warned over and over and over again. This dossier was unverifiable. Eventually, the FBI did a spread sheet and they found out all of it was, in fact, yes, not verified. As a matter of fact, not true. All paid for Russian lies by Hillary Clinton. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The dossier's author Christopher Steele under oath in an interrogatory in Great Britain, he said, I don't have any idea if the dossier's contents are true, but yet, it was used to get a warrant to deny an American citizen his constitutional rights and, yes, spy on a presidential campaign transition and presidency. The FBI had the spread sheet eventually after the fact detailing, yes, it's all false. Yet somehow Comey, McCabe, Rob Rosenstein, Sally Yates and others signed off on using the garbage to obtain a warrant to spy on Carter Page. This is at the height of the presidential election. That backdoored them into everything Trump world. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They told the judge that the so-called evidence in the warrant, top of a FISA warrant, it says verified. They said it was verified. That it was true, it was accurate, even though they knew the exact opposite was true, warned again multiple times. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They did this not once, not twice, on four separate occasions. That's why this would be premeditated fraud committed on the FISA court. Now, tonight, we look forward to inspector general's findings. Every American, we must demand accountability here. Now, I know we think it's pretty difficult. Are they going to hold their own accountable in these things? In other words, or is there some reticence, is there some difficulty applying our laws equally? If we don't do that, well, shred the Constitution, we don't -- we have a dual justice system, we don't have equal justice or equal application of our laws. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, now one bad actor, Andrew McCabe, he's already in hot water as we discussed last night. He's now currently facing a potential indictment for leaking sensitive material and then lying about it. But his anxious legal team is making yet another last ditch attempt to shield their client from federal charges by pushing a rumor that a grand jury failed to indict their client. Here with the very latest, Fox News contributor Sara Carter and the president of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton. Sara, is there any truth to that rumor? Because I haven't heard that. I think I'm pretty close to the story. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

What I am hearing is that Michael Bromwich, the attorney for McCabe, may be leaking this information himself in an effort to try to get the media to push a different narrative on McCabe. Now, I don't know if that is true either. All I am hearing is from sources that this is a possibility.

Jesse Liu, the U.S. attorney, wasn't buying it. The deputy assistant attorney general was not buying it. They rejected his appeal. So, that's where it's at right now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Because the DOJ and the FBI -- remember, the FBI falls under the DOJ banner. Are they going to be willing to apply the laws to their own?

Now, he'll be indicted not on spygate, but lying about, frankly, the Clinton -- his leaks about the Clinton Foundation non- investigation that he and the DOJ weren't doing. Look, you know, the Comey I.G. report, Sean, outlined the coup. Comey went over to the president-elect with that fraudulent dossier after meeting with Barack Obama and Joe Biden, Susan Rice, talked to his senior FBI guys, talked to his colleagues in the intelligence community and all they agreed they were going to go in there and confront him with it with the idea of getting a response as a witness and a target. So, they weren't trying to destroy Trump from the beginning. And that's outlined in the I.G. report. And the Justice Department couldn't manage to figure out whether that was a criminal violation of the president's rights and a fraud on the United States. It doesn't suggest to me that a FISA investigation or frauds on the FISA court are going to be prosecuted either, but we'll see. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You know, my concern is that the deep state will narrowly define the crimes and decide not to proceed. I just hope Attorney General Barr takes his own counsel as opposed to listening to thousands of James Comeys -- James Comeys that are in the Justice Department and FBI still. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We will turn now to the radical, extreme, socialist Democratic Party tonight. We, the American people, should be alarmed.

Shocking. Not even a single question from their friends in the media mob. They called for a hostile government takeover of the entire private health care industry, with the proposals to kick all of the Americans off of their private health care plans. Not an option.

And, boy, what a step back that would be now that we are for the first time in 75 years energy-independent under Trump.

There are no moderates inside the Democratic Party. Now, we start our analysis with creepy, sleepy, crazy Joe 30330. And his once strong poll numbers have taken a dive and for good reason. Well, if you ever had a fastball, it's long gone. I don't think he even has a -- well, softball. And by most accounts, Biden's debate performance was a rambling, confused disaster.

And you said it's a celebration of our justice system. Now, we have the second minor report. That was Comey lacking candor.

We now know -- I can give you -- as it relates to FISA and the FISA inspector general report, we -- I know of three separate time, including, by the way, the U.K. memo warning about Steele's credibility. We know three separate instances before the FISA was signed, the bulk of information we now know was the unverified dirty Russian dossier, likely Russian disinformation according to \"The New York Times\" from the get-go, but they were warned about Steele's credibility before they signed the first FISA. They were warned by Bruce Ohr. The U.K. was warning about his credibility. That Steele had an agenda, it wasn't verified. And Hillary paid for it. Now, they used it anyway. Now we know it's unverifiable, because Steele never stood by his own dossier and under oath said I have no idea if any of it is true. Now, to me, that seems like premeditated fraud on FISA court. And when you couple that with Andrew McCabe, the deputy FBI director, saying, well, no dossier, no FISA warrant, that makes me think they didn't care about what they were presenting to the court. And that was a fraud and they knew it was a fraud, but they said it was verified and it wasn't.",

In handing down the sentence the judge agreed that trying to be a good mom was no excuse saying the college system is already distorted by money and privilege and yet for Huffman that wasn't enough. So she took one more advantage for her child. But the judge also noted that Huffman immediately accepted responsibility, is not a threat to her community, and has apparently regained her moral compass. So along with serving two weeks in prison, Huffman will also pay a $30,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. Huffman is hoping to serve her time at an all women's low security prison in Northern California. After leaving the courthouse, the actress said that she hopes her family, friends, and community will forgive her. Sean?",

      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to this Friday special edition of “Hannity: Trump Versus the Left.” We do begin tonight, though, with a Fox News alert. The DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz has now officially completed his investigation to FISA abuse. Now, the Attorney General Barr has now received a draft report, is currently reviewing those documents. And according to a letter from the House Judiciary ranking member, Congressman Doug Collins, after Barr is done reviewing the report, it will then be released to you, we, the people, the general public. This is now the culmination of a months, months, months-long extensive investigation by the DOJ's watchdog into what is rampant abuse of power at the very highest levels of the FBI and the DOJ. Now, all eyes will be on Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, and all of these other high-ranking officials who used Christopher Steele's dirty dossier as the basis, the bulk of information for a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, transition and presidency. And, remember, McCabe is the guy that said, oh, no dossier, no FISA warrant. Remember even \"The New York Times\" said about the dossier, yes, it was likely Russian disinformation from the beginning. They used it. They never verified it. They were warned about it. Now the consequence, if we have equal justice under the law. Comey and others were all warned. They were warned over and over and over again. This dossier was unverifiable. Eventually, the FBI did a spread sheet and they found out all of it was, in fact, yes, not verified. As a matter of fact, not true. All paid for Russian lies by Hillary Clinton. The dossier's author Christopher Steele under oath in an interrogatory in Great Britain, he said, I don't have any idea if the dossier's contents are true, but yet, it was used to get a warrant to deny an American citizen his constitutional rights and, yes, spy on a presidential campaign transition and presidency. The FBI had the spread sheet eventually after the fact detailing, yes, it's all false. Yet somehow Comey, McCabe, Rob Rosenstein, Sally Yates and others signed off on using the garbage to obtain a warrant to spy on Carter Page. This is at the height of the presidential election. That backdoored them into everything Trump world. They told the judge that the so-called evidence in the warrant, top of a FISA warrant, it says verified. They said it was verified. That it was true, it was accurate, even though they knew the exact opposite was true, warned again multiple times. They did this not once, not twice, on four separate occasions. That's why this would be premeditated fraud committed on the FISA court. Now, tonight, we look forward to inspector general's findings. Every American, we must demand accountability here. Now, I know we think it's pretty difficult. Are they going to hold their own accountable in these things? In other words, or is there some reticence, is there some difficulty applying our laws equally? If we don't do that, well, shred the Constitution, we don't -- we have a dual justice system, we don't have equal justice or equal application of our laws. By the way, now one bad actor, Andrew McCabe, he's already in hot water as we discussed last night. He's now currently facing a potential indictment for leaking sensitive material and then lying about it. But his anxious legal team is making yet another last ditch attempt to shield their client from federal charges by pushing a rumor that a grand jury failed to indict their client. Here with the very latest, Fox News contributor Sara Carter and the president of Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton. Sara, is there any truth to that rumor? Because I haven't heard that. I think I'm pretty close to the story."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "That's right. I haven't heard that either. And I know no one is talking at the Department of Justice about it, Sean, not at all. They're not talking whether there was a grand jury, whether there's been a decision by that grand jury. I have talked to a number of sources and they are very tight-lipped on this. What I am hearing is that Michael Bromwich, the attorney for McCabe, may be leaking this information himself in an effort to try to get the media to push a different narrative on McCabe. Now, I don't know if that is true either. All I am hearing is from sources that this is a possibility. So, that's really interesting here. McCabe made a final-ditch effort. Jesse Liu, the U.S. attorney, wasn't buying it. The deputy assistant attorney general was not buying it. They rejected his appeal. So, that's where it's at right now."

Yes, you don't get to lie to a court, you don't get to give evidence that you didn't verify and claim it's verified. Now, the question is do you believe that they're going to be capable of holding their own accountable? Because the DOJ and the FBI -- remember, the FBI falls under the DOJ banner. Are they going to be willing to apply the laws to their own? That's the question tonight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "Well, we're not even sure that McCabe is actually going to be indicted. I hope he is. Now, he'll be indicted not on spygate, but lying about, frankly, the Clinton -- his leaks about the Clinton Foundation non- investigation that he and the DOJ weren't doing. Look, you know, the Comey I.G. report, Sean, outlined the coup. Comey went over to the president-elect with that fraudulent dossier after meeting with Barack Obama and Joe Biden, Susan Rice, talked to his senior FBI guys, talked to his colleagues in the intelligence community and all they agreed they were going to go in there and confront him with it with the idea of getting a response as a witness and a target. So, they weren't trying to destroy Trump from the beginning. And that's outlined in the I.G. report. And the Justice Department couldn't manage to figure out whether that was a criminal violation of the president's rights and a fraud on the United States. It doesn't suggest to me that a FISA investigation or frauds on the FISA court are going to be prosecuted either, but we'll see. You know, my concern is that the deep state will narrowly define the crimes and decide not to proceed. I just hope Attorney General Barr takes his own counsel as opposed to listening to thousands of James Comeys -- James Comeys that are in the Justice Department and FBI still."

We will turn now to the radical, extreme, socialist Democratic Party tonight. We, the American people, should be alarmed. Just 24 hours ago, all of the Democrats running for the highest office in the land, basically pushed the Venezuela-style socialism as a solution to all of America's problems. By the way, they didn't talk once about the American economy and the revival under Donald Trump. Shocking. Not even a single question from their friends in the media mob. They called for a hostile government takeover of the entire private health care industry, with the proposals to kick all of the Americans off of their private health care plans. Not an option. They called for a hostile government takeover of the private energy sector, putting all oil and gas companies out of business. Hate to tell you, that's the lifeblood of our economy. And, boy, what a step back that would be now that we are for the first time in 75 years energy-independent under Trump. They call for government-run universal child care, pre-K, government-mandated wages, oh, let's see, vacations, healthy food, retirement, everything is free, free, free. They even pushed government mandated gun confiscation of law-abiding citizens. Socialism 101, and it is now the status quo. There are no moderates inside the Democratic Party. Now, we start our analysis with creepy, sleepy, crazy Joe 30330. And his once strong poll numbers have taken a dive and for good reason. Well, if you ever had a fastball, it's long gone. I don't think he even has a -- well, softball. And by most accounts, Biden's debate performance was a rambling, confused disaster. The only person interrupting Joe was Joe.

Anyway, no matter who the president faces in the general election, well, frankly, we can all expect Democrats to once again weaponize the politics of race. Now, we see it every two and four years.

Only one choice, that's 40 percent of the country. Premiums, yes, nobody saved money. Premiums have skyrocketed. And many people lost their doctors and the federal price tag for all of this suffering will be trillions of dollars. Under Medicare for All, that system will even be worse. You don't get to keep your doctor plan, in fact, in a Medicare for all system, every American will even lose their private health insurance. The government would be the only insurer. And guess what? To top it off, your taxes, they're going to explode. That's right, according to multiple studies. Look at Bernie's Medicaid -- Medicare for All plan. It comes with an estimated price tag of $24 trillion to $36 trillion -- that's with a T, dollars over ten years. In other words, our entire federal budget is only $4 trillion a year. Well, to put it another way, all of your income taxes will need to pretty much double just to cover that cost on that one program. That doesn't include the Green New Deal. And there's more, because almost every Democrat, yes, they support a version of the insanely expensive Green New Deal, the battle so-called climate change. Look at your screen. Bernie Sanders, he wants to spend a whopping -- I'm trying to figure out, scratching my conservative head here, $16 trillion. Sixteen trillion? Even so-called moderate Amy Klobuchar has a plan that costs more than $1 trillion. That's on the low end.

Millions lost their doctors, plans, and everybody is paying a ton more. So I'm not so sure he's going to go over well.

But let's face it, Barack Obama isn't extreme enough for these candidates. And Joe Biden has endorsed every aspect of the socialist agenda, even if he says that he isn't an avowed socialist. I mean, he literally said at a rally we will have zero use of fossil fuels. He's saying anybody can buy into Medicare. Think about what that's like if you're a senior who's been paying these taxes into the Medicaid trust fund your whole life and you're getting ready to start to have to use it.

You first said -- and I'll get to this in a second, that the idea that now McCabe, they passed on any special treatment, but it was a while ago that report identified -- the inspector general report identified him as a liar and a leaker. And you said it's a celebration of our justice system. Now, we have the second minor report. That was Comey lacking candor. But that didn't result in -- well, it did result in a referral, but it did seem like they're moving forward. Why is this taking so long? And we'll get to FISA next.

These are tough cases. It is harder than it might appear to convince 12 people of anything. I used to have to do it for a living. It's tough. So, you've got to dot every I and cross every T, and quite candidly, it is more difficult if it's a high-profile defendant. So, if they go forward with McCabe, you can rest-assured, that's going to be a tough trial. We don't want the United States government going trial and losing on a regular basis.

We now know -- I can give you -- as it relates to FISA and the FISA inspector general report, we -- I know of three separate time, including, by the way, the U.K. memo warning about Steele's credibility. We know three separate instances before the FISA was signed, the bulk of information we now know was the unverified dirty Russian dossier, likely Russian disinformation according to \"The New York Times\" from the get-go, but they were warned about Steele's credibility before they signed the first FISA. They were warned by Bruce Ohr. The U.K. was warning about his credibility. That Steele had an agenda, it wasn't verified. And Hillary paid for it. Now, they used it anyway. Now we know it's unverifiable, because Steele never stood by his own dossier and under oath said I have no idea if any of it is true. Now, to me, that seems like premeditated fraud on FISA court. And when you couple that with Andrew McCabe, the deputy FBI director, saying, well, no dossier, no FISA warrant, that makes me think they didn't care about what they were presenting to the court. And that was a fraud and they knew it was a fraud, but they said it was verified and it wasn't."

We cannot have a society where indictment is the only thing that carries with it any stigma. Most of the names involved with the FISA approval process in the 2016 if he had been fired or they've been publicly called to task. Keep in mind, Jim Comey twice now, the Inspector General said you did not meet our expectations. You failed to follow policy. You violated your employee agreement. All of that has to be significant. Look, I used to make representations in front of the court. I tried really hard to be honest and fair about it. But let's assume that I didn't tell the court something. The remedy for me is not indictment. The remedy is I may lose my law license. The remedy is the court may hold me in contempt."

Now Gregg, I just mentioned you to Trey Gowdy, you have identified several statutes that would be violated by Jim Comey as it relates to premeditated fraud on a FISA court. GREGG JARRETT, \"WITCH HUNT\" AUTHOR: Well, there are deprivation of rights under the color of law, otherwise known as abuse of power. You have got fraud, you got conspiracy to commit fraud, false and misleading statements. And you've got perjury. There are actually several others that I identified in the new book, \"Witch Hunt,\" but I'm confident that William Barr is well aware of all of those statutes, he now has a draft report from the Inspector General, likely has already read through it at least once. And he realizes that these people have signed off with the FISA warrant including Andrew McCabe and James Comey and others, Sally Yates and Rod Rosenstein that they deceived the court, they lied to the judges.

I guess the fear among the American people is and I guess the test that will be here is do we have a dual justice system or do we have equal application of our laws, equal justice under the law, but the feeling that there's a reluctant resistance to go after your own and whether or not there's special treatments that will be involved here."

That's why these allegations are so very, very serious. A judge is giving you one of the highest rights you can have to spy on someone else. Based on information that you're certifying is true.

Now we know that the FBI eventually laid out a spread sheet and examine the dossier and they determine it's not true. They didn't do it before they filled out the application. That was October, 2016, there were three subsequent renewals, but in the interim Jim Comey signed three of the four including the original application. He told Donald Trump it's salacious but not unverified. The opposite of what he's saying to the court.

So, he is as extreme - he's worried. He knows that they're in trouble now. But he's extreme as any of them up there. But as long as they keep coming out of the closet with Beto - I'm sorry, is that cultural appropriation that he calls himself a Hispanic name when he's Irish, when he says I'm coming after your guns, 20/20 is looking better and better by the day, Sean."

Huffman attributed her actions in part in the bewilderment of being a mother. The prosecutors shot right back saying motherhood does not make you a cheat and a felon. In handing down the sentence the judge agreed that trying to be a good mom was no excuse saying the college system is already distorted by money and privilege and yet for Huffman that wasn't enough. So she took one more advantage for her child. But the judge also noted that Huffman immediately accepted responsibility, is not a threat to her community, and has apparently regained her moral compass. So along with serving two weeks in prison, Huffman will also pay a $30,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. Huffman is hoping to serve her time at an all women's low security prison in Northern California. After leaving the courthouse, the actress said that she hopes her family, friends, and community will forgive her. Sean?"
