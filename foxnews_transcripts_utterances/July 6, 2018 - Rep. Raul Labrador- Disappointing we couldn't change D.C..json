It was known by its acronym MAVNI. Since then 110,000 immigrants hoping to serve in the US military have become naturalized citizens through the program which was suspended last September amidst concerns that the Defense Department could not properly vet those who were volunteering for basic training with the promise of fast-track citizenship. The A.P. story entitled U.S. Army quietly discharging immigrant recruits quotes a retired U.S. Army Colonel who helped set up the program, She has since become an immigration lawyer and says that about 40 recruits who were hoping to obtain naturalization had been abruptly dismissed. A senior .U.S Defense official tells Fox that in fact there is no new policy when it comes to these recruits but that the 40 in question had issues with their security clearances. Fox has learned that most of those in question were from China, Pakistan, and Iran. These were the hardest cases one U.S. official told Fox. According to statistics provided by the U.S. military, 5,000 immigrants were recruited into the program in 2016. And though it is currently suspended there are 10,000 currently serving. A statement from the U.S. Army explains why some have recently been discharged. \"Any recruit who receives an unfavorable security screening is deemed unsuitable for military service and is administratively discharged. Bottom line, Dana if he can't pass the background check, you are not getting into the U.S. Military.

And that was something everyone on the right was able to unite around. And I think you will see the same with whomever he puts forward Monday night at 9 p.m. because the president has pledged to put forward Neil Gorsuch 2.0. Someone who is going to be well-qualified. Someone who is going to be fit to serve on the bench and then the attention will shift to the Senate. And where the focus will be there is on those red state Democrats. There are 10 of them in states that President Trump won who are going to face enormous political pressure to support the president's pick. And if they don't, and they stay with their party leadership they are going to have to face their voters in the fall and explain why. Because, when you are a senator who is running for re-election in a state where your party isn't popular, you need things to show your voters that you are independent. You need to be able to say hey, I'm not with my party leadership. I'm actually with the people. I'm with you. I share your values. And a Supreme Court justice is a way to really do that. So, if I were one of these Democratic senators and assuming the president puts forward a qualified pick, which he will. I would get on board and support them and do the right thing.

      "utterance": "After the president rolls out his nominee in a nationwide announcement, Monday night at 9:00, the president and the first lady head to Europe for a seven-day trip. First stop on the trip will be the NATO summit in Brussels where President Trump is expected to repeat his demands from last year that all NATO nations live up to their commitment to contribute two percent of GDP to their NATO obligation. By the end of this year, eight members are expected to meet that two percent mark. But that still leaves 20 that will fall short. Well, the president's critics fear that the NATO summit will reflect the same divisiveness to mark the recent G7 summit. Britain's ambassador to the United States told Fox News today that he expects President Trump wants a successful NATO summit to show solidarity when he goes into his summit with Vladimir Putin, the following week. From Brussels, President Trump travels to London for a working visit with Theresa May, the Prime Minister. And tea, with Queen Elizabeth. U.K. officials say a full range of issues will be on the table including trade, North Korea, Syria and the Putin summit. The president will spend the weekend in Scotland. And then, on Sunday afternoon, fly to Helsinki, Finland for that bilateral meeting with Putin. President Trump and his aides say they expect Russian meddling in the election to come up in the meeting, as well as Russia's annexation of Crimea, and how to find a solution to Syria. Including, whether Russia can facilitate Iran's exit from Syria. President Trump's critics complained that he should not be meeting with Putin and that he has been consistently soft on Russia. However, British officials told Fox News today that when you look at what the president has done over the past 18 months in regard to Russia. With sanctions the expulsion of Russian diplomats from the United States that he's actually been quite tough. Dana?"

But this is really the central piece, the rebalancing of United States relations with Europe, against Russia to relationship much closer to Russia. The president has real affinity for Putin and he keeps talking about it. And people keep saying, \"Oh well, we'll override him on foreign policy. Oh well, the Senate will force his hand.\" Donald Trump is remaking U.S. foreign policy for more -- for a generation, and he might do a lot of it on this trip. So it's a big, big, deal."

I mean, the Supreme Court is going to set off the most intense domestic battle of his presidency. No matter who he picks the left will be warning that the day after the nominees confirms, all abortion rights will vanish. They'll be digging into the nominee's background, the press, as well. And the NATO trip, we got to taste this at the G7, Dana. I mean, he is already going to get intensified criticism about upending, blowing up the Western alliance that the U.S. helped to establish after World War II, launching a trade war against our friends while saying nice things about Vladimir Putin. We've gotten a lot of that until now, but when the president is on foreign soil and it's 24/7, it's going to be deafening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And Steve, tell us about the European view. The president last year, there was a lot of trepidation going into that NATO summit. They thought, well, maybe he's not going to be supportive. But then, they were pleasantly surprised that he spoke very favorably about NATO and its importance. And he said, you know, you're got to have to pony up, that like we are here in the United States and many countries have started to do that. But there is no doubt that there's a lot of domestic problems in Europe, Italy, Germany, in particular. How do you see this playing next week from that perspective? STEVE HILTON, FOX NEWS HOST, \"THE NEXT REVOLUTION\": Well, first of all, in terms of NATO, the president is simply saying publicly what previous presidents have said privately. President Obama, I remember, was fiercely critical of my old boss, David Cameron, for not meeting the two percent threshold. And basically, wouldn't talk to him about anything until he agreed to meet that standard. The president now is just saying publicly what's been said before. So, there -- I don't think they're surprised about it, and I don't think it's some kind of existential threat to the Alliance. He's just looking for a fair deal. But the other thing to remember is that President Trump is actually really deeply unpopular in Europe. And there's no overlap if you like between the kind of populist voters in Europe, those who supported Brexit and Trump supporters. He's really unpopular across the board and that makes it harder for European leaders to do deals with them, and to be positive in their relationship because their own Electra's are so hostile to president Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Chris, then, I don't think the president worries too much about being unpopular in Europe. But he also has this other issue of -- you know, the trade deals and the trade concerns and the tensions there that are also a part of this discussion this week. How do you think that he might be able to try to navigate that? And do you think he'll walk away with any positive news on trade and deals for both sides of this of the pond?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Well, remember, when it comes to our traditional allies with Trump, the worse the better. He likes it and has you heard his supporters cheering when he was at that mass rally that he had. When it -- when he is ripping on Europeans because it's all part of his war on the elites, and the effete, and the people who he says shouldn't be called the elites. So all of Western Europe all of their fancy pants and tight jeans and little coffees, and you know what, they all stink. But you know who he does like, and he says, \"Hey, but this Putin is really strong. This Putin is really tough. I like this guy, he is like me, and he is hard, these people are soft. So, the worse, the better for Trump, the more they howl in Western Europe, the more they say you are unfair with your trade practices. He grins and his supporters cheer because it's another blow against the elites."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "OK, Howie, do you -- what do you think about the president and media coverage on this trip? I mean, we have seen that no matter where he goes, the president dominates every single media cycle. So, it doesn't necessarily matter if he's here or if he's over there. But access from the media is super important to the media, of course. But I think, also to show that transparency and be able to deliver messages. Because if he's going to dominate, he should try to be on his front foot talking to the press. Your thoughts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, I hope he grants a lot of access not just to the working reporters, but does some interviews for journalists, anchors or going halfway around the world. I'll go out on a limb here and predict that no matter what happens between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, the coverage is going to be largely negative because many in the media don't think you should be having this one-on-one meeting at all. And I still want to know how aggressively he's going to press the whole issue of Russian meddling in the election. But, remember that the president no matter where he is, follows the media coverage very closely, will punch back, I'm sure we'll hear the term dishonest press, fake news, a couple of times. And he loves stirring it up and he's not going to be shy about letting us all know if he thinks the coverage has been unfair."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that there's one clear area of common interest and that's with the U.K. and the USA to strike a big beautiful trade deal as the president once put it. I think that's what Theresa May wants, the trouble is she can't actually make much progress until she herself has done her own deal with the E.U. But one last thought actually, Chris is exactly right about the president's attitude in relation to the elites, but there's one other leader who's just been elected on a platform very similar in terms of taking on the elites, and that's the new president of Mexico. And I think, one thing we should look at is that relationship it seems to me that, that could develop the relationship between the new president Obrador and President Trump into quite a good relationship that could mean really good news for what the president -- our president is trying to do at the border on immigration and on trade, that's something to watch, I think."

      "utterance": "Dana, this military recruiting program which provided a fast track to American citizenship was set up after 9/11 by President Bush when the military needed immigrants with certain special language skills especially after the surge into Iraq and Afghanistan. It was known by its acronym MAVNI. Since then 110,000 immigrants hoping to serve in the US military have become naturalized citizens through the program which was suspended last September amidst concerns that the Defense Department could not properly vet those who were volunteering for basic training with the promise of fast-track citizenship. The A.P. story entitled U.S. Army quietly discharging immigrant recruits quotes a retired U.S. Army Colonel who helped set up the program, She has since become an immigration lawyer and says that about 40 recruits who were hoping to obtain naturalization had been abruptly dismissed. A senior .U.S Defense official tells Fox that in fact there is no new policy when it comes to these recruits but that the 40 in question had issues with their security clearances. Fox has learned that most of those in question were from China, Pakistan, and Iran. These were the hardest cases one U.S. official told Fox. According to statistics provided by the U.S. military, 5,000 immigrants were recruited into the program in 2016. And though it is currently suspended there are 10,000 currently serving. A statement from the U.S. Army explains why some have recently been discharged. \"Any recruit who receives an unfavorable security screening is deemed unsuitable for military service and is administratively discharged. Bottom line, Dana if he can't pass the background check, you are not getting into the U.S. Military. Both Republicans and Democrats on the Armed Services Committees have expressed concerns in the past about the program which is currently under review by the Defense Department. Dana?"

Anyone who's served under that program believes in it. But this A.P. headline could not be more deceptive. It's basically saying the Trump administration is pushing out immigrants because they don't want them in the military. Poorly sourced, terrible headline, and of course as the Pentagon has pointed out today, that's not what's happening at all. There's basic security clearance protocols that have to happen. Most of which by the way, are not affecting Hispanic south of the border. This is of any country that's coming in and as a result you would want our military to make sure there's no divided allegiance or there's no problems on a security clearance. That's what they're doing. They've pushed back very strongly and the right to do so."

I mean, everybody has family who lives abroad. Also, you have family that live in other countries all of a sudden it's a security risk? Give me a break. These are guys that served three, four, or five years. These are folks that are about to go to basic training. They're trying to pass a basic background check and they don't pass it.

But look, that -- all that matters is that President Trump started this whole crisis. We shouldn't even be discussing this in the first place. This is something that was created by the by the President himself. We still have zero tolerance policy in place so you know perhaps now we're trying to obviously fix the problem, it's shameful because you know what, what's going to happen now, Dana, is that a lot of these parents who are supposed to be reunified with these children are probably already deported.

He told Politico last month \"I won't miss a lot of things about this place. I think some people lose their soul here. This is a place that just sucks your soul. It takes everything from you.\" Here now-Congressman Raul Labrador. He's in his home state. He's in Boise, Idaho so he's probably feeling a little better than when he is in Washington D.C.

They wanted to change the way things decisions were made, the top-down decision-making process in Washington D.C. was going to change. But as soon as I got there, I realized that everyone just wanted to please the leadership and instead of representing their constituents, they wanted to represent the party. And I think we were all elected to represent the 800,000 people that sent us to Washington D.C. and to make the changes that we promised them.

So the leadership gets everybody to do what they want to do but the membership decides that they don't want to change things, that they would rather have the leadership make the tough decisions for them instead of actually voting on difficult bills or difficult issues on the floor. We -- we're OK -- I came from a state legislature where we saw bills die on the floor, we actually had to work things through the process. And in Congress for some reason, people don't want to see bills die on the floor so they want to be protected. We don't allow the committee process to work. We don't put things on the floor that are difficult to pass. And I think that's not the way our founding fathers wanted Congress to work."

And that's the good thing about what we have now with the Freedom Caucus. I'm one of the founding members of the Freedom Caucus. And we have 30 to 40 members of Congress that have going to make a decision on who the next speaker of the House is going to be. And I believe that they need to hold their vote until somebody determines, somebody tells them that they are going to be able to change the way things are working. That they are going to make tough decisions. They are going to let the committee process work. And if you talk to members of Congress, whether they're conservative, whether they're liberal, whether they're centrist, they feel that they're not -- their voice is not being heard, that the process is not working for them. There is a lot of frustration in Washington, D.C. among the members in Congress. And I think they would like to see things change. And I think the person who is going to be the next speaker of the House is the person who can make that promise and that commitment that they are going to change. And they are going to have to say specific things how they are going to change. You know, Paul Ryan said he was going to change things, but he did not say specific things that he wanted to do to change."

That's the only way you will get your will heard on the floor. What I would tell anybody who is going to be a new member of Congress is to never lose your soul. Never give up on the promises that you made to your constituents. Don't go to Washington, D.C. and do one thing that is different than what you said to your constituents that you were going to do. Whether you are from the right or from the left, make sure you keep your commitment.

Going forward, it's pretty interesting looking at these midterms of what people are saying is the most important. A recent Washington Post poll show that the economy and jobs at 24 percent. Healthcare 20 percent, and then immigration 19 percent. So, those are the issues that people are focused on going into this midterm. But in addition to that let me just show one other thing, Colin, NBC poll shows that the Supreme Court decision, this new nominee that the president will announce on Monday night at 9 p.m. And we'll have that for you live on Fox News. Democrats are saying 66 percent of them say that that nominee is an important factor in the midterm Republican 60 percent. Is this a midterm unlike you have maybe seen before where people will be more enthusiastic about the vote."

    {
      "speaker": "REED",
      "utterance": "Well, the issue of the Supreme Court is an issue that unites Republicans and it divides Democrats. And what I mean by that is, last year when things weren't going terribly well for President Trump, people who supported him were always able to say yes, but look at Judge Gorsuch. And that was something everyone on the right was able to unite around. And I think you will see the same with whomever he puts forward Monday night at 9 p.m. because the president has pledged to put forward Neil Gorsuch 2.0. Someone who is going to be well-qualified. Someone who is going to be fit to serve on the bench and then the attention will shift to the Senate. And where the focus will be there is on those red state Democrats. There are 10 of them in states that President Trump won who are going to face enormous political pressure to support the president's pick. And if they don't, and they stay with their party leadership they are going to have to face their voters in the fall and explain why. Because, when you are a senator who is running for re-election in a state where your party isn't popular, you need things to show your voters that you are independent. You need to be able to say hey, I'm not with my party leadership. I'm actually with the people. I'm with you. I share your values. And a Supreme Court justice is a way to really do that. So, if I were one of these Democratic senators and assuming the president puts forward a qualified pick, which he will. I would get on board and support them and do the right thing. Because not only will it be good policy, it will be good politics in the fall."

It does remind you just about joy and living and, you know, getting off your phone and figuring out a way to just experience life and people all across America certainly do love their pets. Would you recommend taking your dog on a road trip, John. And I ask this because my husband Peter McMahon was a dream killer for me one day. I had this idea of getting a puppy and taking a puppy on a road trip and writing a book about it and he said you can't take a puppy on a road trip. John, do you disagree."
