President Biden proving once again that he has got no clue when it comes to the pandemic. Some of his top former medical advisors are trying to get his attention, saying the president's COVID strategy needs a major overhaul. And want Biden to tell Americans they need to learn to live with it. Good luck with that. The commander in chief contradicting himself in the same sentence, while talking about his COVID plan and what Americans can expect.",

And I go back to that original thing that I said a long time ago. It's the people who are going to lead us out of this, not the leaders. And you can - - you talk to anybody. Because of this bad messaging and the exhaustion, and people with the boosters and the double boosters getting COVID, people have -- it's almost miraculous. People are actually in unison having enough. They have had enough. They are looking at February 1st. They know that's when this is going to be over. It's almost like we are leading the country, not the leaders. The problem with Kamala Harris, though, she is the 9/11 of Pearl Harbor's. Right? She is on what scientists call poop island. It's a place that once you get on it, you can't get off. And everyone who is supposed to help you doesn't want to because they don't want any poop on them. So basically, they are just letting her suffer. And it's unfair to Jimmy Carter because he never said malaise. It was a -- the speech was a crisis in confidence, but he never said malaise but it's called the malaise speech. But you get the sense that the Dems have given up on Kamala and Joe. It's like a dead marriage that it's kept alike until the kids are out of the house. And in this case, if the kids are out of the house is when the election comes up.",

Justice Sotomayor said 100,000 children are in serious condition, many on ventilators. Wrong. There are fewer children who have been hospitalized with COVID in the last year and a half. It's about 84,000. Another doozy. Omicron is as deadly as Delta. No, it's not, not even for the unvaccinated it's not! I've called doctors about this. They said that is patently false. Marty Makary, the doctor told me there are actually no confirmed deaths from Omicron, not even the original one in Houston. Justice Breyer, so you have a Supreme Court justice, Justice Breyer went on to say, implied Omicron case numbers would start falling if the Biden vaccine mandate was in place. Well, that's balderdash. And then Elena Kagan was talk -- essentially talking about this policy, the vaccine mandate, we need it -- we need this to stop the virus. We need to stop the spread with this vaccine mandate. Vaccinated people are catching it. Look at Geraldo and me and all of us, and spreading it. So, I just want to point out, you have a Supreme Court justice, particularly Sotomayor, that was the most egregious today, on the most important issue facing this nation and she has her facts not just wrong, but stunningly pick up my jaw off the floor-wrong. So, it's like she is getting her facts from the CNN or even The View. Joy Behar would have done a better job on the high court today.",

I think that Americans as a nation, we just have a certain level of expectation for how smart we are going to be about things, and how well we're going to handle stuff, we expect that. I looked up the numbers today, how much we spend on HHS and combined with the NIAID, the National Allergy and Infection and Disease, and NIH. Right? So, you've got about two trillion and then another $50 billion. Right? And then you have this letter that comes from the six very esteemed doctors. And one of the suggestions that they have is that the United States should have a modern data infrastructure to survey the virus. Hello? I mean, wouldn't you have a natural expectation in the technologically advanced United States of America that we wouldn't have to call on Israel and the U.K. to figure out the data for how long the immune system is able to fight off these different viruses after the vaccines? Why? How could we possibly be spending over $2 trillion, and employing thousands of people at these health agencies? What are they doing if they are not figuring out a modern data infrastructure to know more about the virus and feel smart about it? Instead, you have this sort of, I compare it to the Peanuts teacher. Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, right? Coming from the top levels of government talking about challenges that we'll face and tough things that will come and how will work through the problems. And you just say no, I want actual results. I want as an American citizen to say, well, I know that there are monoclonal antibodies out there and I know that there are achievements out there. So, I would certainly expect that if someone would need them, they would be able to get your hands on them in the United States of America. So, these are really specific things that I think Americans just have an expectation that we are going to handle well, and we haven't. So, it doesn't matter how many times you're told like, gee. we get it. You know, there's a little bit of malaise and wah, wah, wah.

I would threaten the Chicago teachers with a test, not a COVID test, an actual test to see if they can actually teach, to see if they are qualified enough to teach the students.

Which is weird because that's the benefit of age, is wisdom. But instead, we're getting the consequences of age, which is a disjointed, convoluted, aimless asides about things. And I go back to that original thing that I said a long time ago. It's the people who are going to lead us out of this, not the leaders. And you can - - you talk to anybody. Because of this bad messaging and the exhaustion, and people with the boosters and the double boosters getting COVID, people have -- it's almost miraculous. People are actually in unison having enough. They have had enough. They are looking at February 1st. They know that's when this is going to be over. It's almost like we are leading the country, not the leaders. The problem with Kamala Harris, though, she is the 9/11 of Pearl Harbor's. Right? She is on what scientists call poop island. It's a place that once you get on it, you can't get off. And everyone who is supposed to help you doesn't want to because they don't want any poop on them. So basically, they are just letting her suffer. And it's unfair to Jimmy Carter because he never said malaise. It was a -- the speech was a crisis in confidence, but he never said malaise but it's called the malaise speech. But you get the sense that the Dems have given up on Kamala and Joe. It's like a dead marriage that it's kept alike until the kids are out of the house. And in this case, if the kids are out of the house is when the election comes up."

Now it may be just the fact that, you know, I got sick a couple of weeks ago, and that tinted or tinged my optimism that I usually have. I'm kind of buoyant person naturally. But I really, it's kind of snowing in Cleveland, you are dragging your tail through like, wondering when this thing is finally going to end.

Justice Sotomayor said 100,000 children are in serious condition, many on ventilators. Wrong. There are fewer children who have been hospitalized with COVID in the last year and a half. It's about 84,000. Another doozy. Omicron is as deadly as Delta. No, it's not, not even for the unvaccinated it's not! I've called doctors about this. They said that is patently false. Marty Makary, the doctor told me there are actually no confirmed deaths from Omicron, not even the original one in Houston. Justice Breyer, so you have a Supreme Court justice, Justice Breyer went on to say, implied Omicron case numbers would start falling if the Biden vaccine mandate was in place. Well, that's balderdash. And then Elena Kagan was talk -- essentially talking about this policy, the vaccine mandate, we need it -- we need this to stop the virus. We need to stop the spread with this vaccine mandate. Vaccinated people are catching it. Look at Geraldo and me and all of us, and spreading it. So, I just want to point out, you have a Supreme Court justice, particularly Sotomayor, that was the most egregious today, on the most important issue facing this nation and she has her facts not just wrong, but stunningly pick up my jaw off the floor-wrong.

I looked up the numbers today, how much we spend on HHS and combined with the NIAID, the National Allergy and Infection and Disease, and NIH. Right? So, you've got about two trillion and then another $50 billion. Right? And then you have this letter that comes from the six very esteemed doctors. And one of the suggestions that they have is that the United States should have a modern data infrastructure to survey the virus. Hello? I mean, wouldn't you have a natural expectation in the technologically advanced United States of America that we wouldn't have to call on Israel and the U.K. to figure out the data for how long the immune system is able to fight off these different viruses after the vaccines? Why? How could we possibly be spending over $2 trillion, and employing thousands of people at these health agencies? What are they doing if they are not figuring out a modern data infrastructure to know more about the virus and feel smart about it? Instead, you have this sort of, I compare it to the Peanuts teacher. Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, right? Coming from the top levels of government talking about challenges that we'll face and tough things that will come and how will work through the problems. And you just say no, I want actual results. I want as an American citizen to say, well, I know that there are monoclonal antibodies out there and I know that there are achievements out there. So, I would certainly expect that if someone would need them, they would be able to get your hands on them in the United States of America. So, these are really specific things that I think Americans just have an expectation that we are going to handle well, and we haven't. So, it doesn't matter how many times you're told like, gee. we get it. You know, there's a little bit of malaise and wah, wah, wah. We want more than that and should have more than that for the money that we spend."

They won't even give their own party a fair shake. Imagine being a Chicago parent. Like you worked in a butcher shop, you take a subway, you go into an office building. You have adults breathing on you all day. They are still going to work. But teachers can't go to work in one of the safest environments there is, a classroom. So, I would do this. I would threaten the Chicago teachers with a test, not a COVID test, an actual test to see if they can actually teach, to see if they are qualified enough to teach the students.
