This moderate group of senators that voted for the resolution opposing the emergency act, and now have pushed back on Herman Cain, I think we're looking at maybe the half-a-dozen most powerful senators in America right now, because what senators like Susan Collins and Mitt Romney and Murkowski and others are saying is, they're saying to the president, if you want to get stuff done, you need us. And, to me, that's the big news. Look, the world's got plenty of highly qualified people to be Fed -- to be on the Fed Board, as Herman Cain was. I mean, look, he was a CEO. He had Fed experience. He had political experience. He understood the economy. He was eminently qualified, which I understand the allegations. And I'm not -- I'm not reducing them.

I was asked my opinion and provided it. And my advice was heeded. The e-mail exchange is clear. And suggesting that indicates inappropriate pressure is absolutely inaccurate.\" The president also saying this afternoon, Neil, that he is going to send more troops to the border. Patrick Shanahan, the acting secretary of defense, said the military stands ready to assist in any way it can. We didn't know, though, the number of troops that the president would be asking the Pentagon for. And there was an incident just a little while ago. The reason we're inside here in the Briefing Room is a little while ago a man in one of those wheelchair scooters was sitting in front of the White House and ladies jacket on fire. The Secret Service -- and there's many uniform Secret Service who stand at the ready outside the White House -- came running over to the gentleman to try to help put out the jacket, but he didn't want them to. There is speculation by law enforcement officials that it might have been the man was trying to take his life in front of the White House by self- immolation. A law enforcement source tells me that there is a mental issue here. The man was injured. He's got first-degree burns, but not badly injured.

So I don't really understand what the big problem is. Let the president go through the legal examination and see if it's something that's going to work out for the country. But, all in all, seems like a good solution to me."

It was a fascinating and intriguing interview with the man who says, at least in this case -- and I will let Sadie answer that better than I -- defends Barr on how he handled the release of key findings of that Mueller probe.

He said, this idea that -- which Democrats have put forth, that Barr is trying to mislead the public, that he's withholding information or slow- walking the report, he said those criticisms are, in his words, bizarre. So I think he's just trying to say from his point of view from where he sits, which is very close to the attorney general, people should have faith and just be patient and wait for the report as early as next week."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "GURMAN",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. I mean, in defending the attorney general's actions, in some ways Rod is also defending his own actions.

He wouldn't talk about the attorney general's review that he announced this week, and it is unclear at this point if that review would include a look at some of the actions that Rod himself took.

Katie, Rod Rosenstein is essentially saying these characterizations of the attorney general overanalyzing things or doing something to cover up for his boss, that doesn't jibe with what I have seen and what I have -- what I have read.

Redactions are required in many cases by federal law for different purposes, and can be justified. Now, the extent of them, we will see if Attorney General Barr can justify each of them. And he has promised that he's going to give an explanation for each redaction that comes out. But I have never seen a report come out from a law enforcement investigation that doesn't have redactions, even when you're a defense counsel on a case. So, that's just not realistic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Because, obviously, there's justification for people who were not charged with anything, whose names might be brought up. That, I understand. So no matter what comes out of this report, it will be those specific redactions that are going to lead calls to release the whole report, release the whole report. What do you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHERKASKY",
      "utterance": "I think that there's going to be a question about a lot of the grand jury material. That's going to be the big question about what should or shouldn't be redacted. There is Supreme Court case law and there's district court case law on the idea that any information from a grand jury can be released if it's kind of related to a judicial proceeding. And the big question then is, is an impeachment proceeding a judicial proceeding? So some of that could come up with regard to redactions from grand jury material. Some of it isn't really arguable at all. If there's ongoing investigations, if there's sources and methods from the investigation, that's going to be redacted. I think it's just totally a ridiculous talking point to suggest that we're going to see a full report. Nobody's going to get a full report, nor do I think they should, because there's a lot of sensitive information that can be in there."

There are a couple different concerns for Senate Republicans. First off, they wonder if he might be too partisan for the Fed. Remember, he was a presidential candidate at one point.

For me, the real news is not really about Moore. It's about four or five senators, GOP senators. This moderate group of senators that voted for the resolution opposing the emergency act, and now have pushed back on Herman Cain, I think we're looking at maybe the half-a-dozen most powerful senators in America right now, because what senators like Susan Collins and Mitt Romney and Murkowski and others are saying is, they're saying to the president, if you want to get stuff done, you need us. And, to me, that's the big news. Look, the world's got plenty of highly qualified people to be Fed -- to be on the Fed Board, as Herman Cain was. I mean, look, he was a CEO. He had Fed experience. He had political experience. He understood the economy. He was eminently qualified, which I understand the allegations. And I'm not -- I'm not reducing them.

I would almost rather have someone that didn't think so highly of his economic or her economic background that they thought they were so smart they could navigate. Let the market run free.

Even Mitch McConnell surprised in expressing frustration with appointments that are suddenly shelved at the last second, that they don't know what the president is up to or what he's thinking, and they're getting ticked off. Do you think that's a problem for the president going forward? Dave, can you hear me? All right, I apologize for that. I will just leave you think what could -- what could happen after that. My apologies to the professor. In the meantime, I do want to look at the trend among Democratic candidates, as you know, is to bash the rich. But a lot of them are rich. Bernie Sanders is like millionaires rich. There's no problem with that. There's nothing wrong with that. And say this of Bernie Sanders.

I wonder if he's going to change that now to just billionaires. Does he have a different view of millionaires now that he's admitted he is one? But, yes, I mean..."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TORRANCE",
      "utterance": "Exactly. You know, actually, last year, about half of Senate Democrats were millionaires. That number even surprised me. I know that most people running for office, they have a lot of resources behind them. They tend to be quite richer than average. But even that surprised me. But, you know, this is actually a great opportunity. Bernie Sanders could use this, this release to talk about what a great system America has, how it provides these opportunities for people. And he could talk about how he would like it to do better in some areas, or that more people need these opportunities, but I suspect he won't. If you look at what he's told The New York Times when he -- when they asked him and he admitted he was a millionaire, he said, well, I wrote a bestselling book. If you write a bestselling book, you could be a millionaire too. The ego in that statement. And also does he realize that not everyone has the opportunity to just write a book and become a millionaire? A lot of people, they're trying to do the best they can. They're working hard in various industries. Millionaires are not just one certain group of inherited wealthy people. A lot of people work hard."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I wonder how far this goes. I mean, obviously, all of these candidates, almost to a man or woman, they're not all millionaires, but their pitch has been that it is a lopsided society, you have not benefited as much because a lot of these rich folks are not pulling their fair share. Now, if these candidates all say, yes, we're going to pull our fair share too, I'm wealthy, but I have an obligation -- I think that used to be Barack Obama's sort of take on this. There's no reason why I shouldn't and couldn't and won't pay higher taxes. I think I should. Bill Clinton argued much the same. Will that work? Because that's kind of trying to thread a needle here."

Elizabeth Warren, her tax info shows that she had a -- her and her husband had a combined income of almost a million. So people..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

And you mentioned that, talking about, what are these candidates -- talking about what they have done or what they're going to do with their wealth. But, yes, it's tough for them because they have spent all their time talking about what a terrible system capitalism is, some of them, and, obviously, it's benefited them very well. It's going to be very difficult for them to tell the American people that, hey, the system has been good for me, but I don't think -- I don't want it anymore. I don't -- I don't think it's going to -- going to help you guys. I think it's very difficult. And when they have spent their time implying that there isn't a path to improve your life in this country through capitalism, they -- they are examples of it themselves. I think it's going to come off very strange if they continue with the kind of attacks they had."

And there's a few other outliers. Florida is certainly going to be in the mix. But those are going to be the key battleground states."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

As I was speaking the former governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, that the Electoral College is supposed to make it such that you spread your wealth, candidates campaign all across the country, even in small states, otherwise, in a popular vote, the argument would be that the Democrat would spend all his or her time in California or New York and the Republican in places like Texas, what have you. The irony this time could be that it's going to be focused on battleground states like Wisconsin, a state Donald Trump surprised everyone but winning by 23,000 votes, out of about three million cast. In fact, it was a switch of 70,000-plus thousand votes in his direction in those five key industrial states we are going to outline here that proved the difference. Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer with us right now. Ari, we're going to kind of go through a lot of these key states, but they were close. And what Scott Walker was saying is, a lot of time is going to spend -- be spent by a lot of candidates in these key states, the president included and whoever the Democratic nominee is. Do you agree?"

Those are all close states as well. So it's not just the Midwest. Certainly, Midwest has some key swing states. And Pennsylvania, I would submit to you, Neil, that's a split state. That's an Eastern state and a Midwestern state and a Southern state between Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh. And all of that is contested."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

He spent an enormous amount of time in these key states, when everyone said it was silly and he was wasting his time. It turns out, in retrospect, he didn't at all. So they're going to avoid that mistake by practically living in these states. Right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Well, it depends on who the candidate is. I think some candidates have a better chance of competing in some of these states. Others don't. If Elizabeth Warren is the nominee, she's going to have a very harder time, much harder time in the Rust Belt than I think other candidates might. So, candidates have different strengths in different regions. But what we do know is the closest states in the union last time were Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Florida. All of those are very close states."

The attorney general went on to clarify that he wants to be clear that's not what happened and whether there was a strong evidentiary basis for opening the investigation, as well as securing the surveillance warrant. Democrats have seized on this spying language. It appears to be an effort to further undermine the attorney general before the Mueller report is released.
