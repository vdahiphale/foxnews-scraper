Night two of the worst infomercials ever made. Infomercials are a lot more interesting. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In just moments, we're going to dip in briefly, only briefly, let's give you a flavor. We'll give you the full one-minute remarks of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Why? Because that's all they gave her because they're hiding who they really are. We'll watch a little bit of Chucky Schumer and some of his hate Trump rhetoric, just for fun. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we're going to monitor former President Bill Clinton. Now, Bill Clinton is interesting because I'm going to lay out in a special \"Hannity\" monologue how he wouldn't even be a nominee of that party ever based on his positions and, by the way, he's embroiled in a huge new scandal today. \"The Daily Mail\" just published newly uncovered pictures, Bill Clinton reportedly getting back -- I get a little back massage of one of Jeffrey Epstein's victims. This isn't funny. What I saw in The Daily Mail should scare everybody. We reached out to Clinton for comment. We've yet to hear back. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, whatever happened to the I-believers in the Democratic Party that are outraged that Bill Clinton is about to speak in prime time at their party's convention. Do they have any real values at all? Kamala Harris, any comment at all? We'll have more, straight ahead. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, first, we're going to bring everything you need to know about last night's big DNC kickoff because if you're like most Americans you actually didn't watch it. In fact, ratings for the convention are way down. Last night, look at this, ABC, CBS, NBC, they garnered a record low 6.7 million viewers, which is down 42 percent from 2016. Now, just as a comparison, I won't talk about myself, but when FOX News alone from 2016 covered President Trump, it was well over 8 million, one channel, just one channel. Wow. Now, those who did tune in for the convention got a predictable dose of poorly produced cult-like psychotic rage, hysteria against all things Donald Trump. Oh, I thought they were the uniters, and they go high and we go low, and all that nonsense, all phony rhetoric. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Marianne Williamson, she had a pretty funny line -- that it was like binge- watching a Marriott Hotel commercial. That's pretty funny. Let's be clear, though, this is beyond a really, really bad infomercial. Yes, OK, it was boring, it was awkward, it was disjointed. What's worse is: zero substance, nothing. We heard no real solutions on how they will improve the lives of you, the American people. No policy discussions, no mention of the crisis in America's disastrous Democratic- run cities, you know, that Jerry Nadler said the myth that there's violence. A myth? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No new proposals to combat COVID-19, nothing. Remember, they were missing in action. They thought it was xenophobic and hysterical to put the travel ban in effect. They were impeaching the president in the middle of their trial during the beginnings of all this, nowhere to be found. No mentions of how to make this country more safe, more secure, wealthier, prosperous, none of that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All you got was a temper tantrum, bumper stickers, slogans about pretty much how much they hate Donald Trump and behind the hatred of him is a hatred of we, smelly Walmart shopper Trump supporters, irredeemable deplorables, the 15 percent as Biden says. You know, that the angry people that Obama talked about the cling to God, guilty, yep; our Second Amendment, guilty; bibles, guilty; and religion, belief in God, guilty again. And by the way, the try -- and I like to save money at Walmart. My book is really price low there, like Costco's. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Anyway, they're trying to bury their radical policies. That's why Ocasio- Cortez gets a minute. Andrew Cuomo, this was a meltdown and psychosis moment for him, blaming Trump for what he's calling the European coronavirus. Wow, never mind the thousands of seniors who died because of Cuomo's disastrous nursing home policy. We have a new report out today as a matter of fact, Andrew, from the \"A.P.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the true nursing home death, they, quote, is clocked in and cloaked in secrecy, they said. It could be more than 11,000 people, not the 6,000 they're saying because of Cuomo's stupid decision. Then, of course, Wolf in Pennsylvania, Murphy in New Jersey, Whitmer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we had our old pal, Ohio Governor John Kasich. It's really just a really bad case of sore-loser-it is, kind of like the recent, you know, recently deceased John McCain. He was pretty angry about losing, as is Hillary Clinton and Al Gore and Mitt Romney. They all think they're going to win. They don't win, they get angry. Anyway, he delivered -- John Kasich -- his own bitter, anti-Trump rant, and pretty much just recanted everything that he had said that he publicly believed in. Good luck with that, John. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then there was the former First Lady Michelle Obama -- praised by everybody in the mob in the media. And during what were pretty vindictive and inaccurate and untrue remarks, she was so busy trashing President Trump. It's kind of interesting, she didn't even mention Kamala Harris, the first female African-American on a presidential ticket, although according to reports, Michelle Obama apparently pre-taped the speech prior to Biden's VP announcement, couldn't be bothered to retape it. That's how all in she is for Joe. She had almost a full week to tape it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And for the record, Obama disparaged Republicans all the time. Yep, the Obama administration was very divisive. By the way, his record on the economy, 13 million more Americans food stamps, 8 million more poverty, lowest labor participation rates since the ‘70s, worst recovery since the ‘40s, I can go on. His foreign policy, really, bribing mullahs with $150 billion in cash and other currency, both disasters. Only person who actually gave any substance at all, got to give credit where it's due. There he is -- comrade Bernie Sanders, Bolshevik Bernie. Remember with Bernie, well, he used to be the -- an annoyance, on the fringe of the Democratic Party, an outlier, barely even tolerated. Everyone there thought he was a kook back then. Many Democrats embarrassed by Sanders' radical socialist agenda. Now, well, he is the signal caller. He's the leader of the Democratic Party. He controls the party's agenda. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He helped co-write or co-author Biden's economic platform. In other words, Biden plagiarized it, big portions of it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Bernie-Biden manifesto, as the president calls it, he is now the mainstream of what is now the Democratic socialist party. This is the most extreme ticket of any major party in the history of this country. By the way, don't take my word for it. Let's just listen to what Bernie Sanders had to say last night. He's the leader. He's the economic czar for Joe and Kamala. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And, by the way, you can kiss the Senate filibuster goodbye if Schumer becomes the leader, Chucky, Nancy, they'll be more than happy to ram this radical wish list right through Congress, and there is the Trojan horse as the president's referring to Joe Biden, president, he'll sign anything.

Bill Clinton, you got to remember the Democratic Party that you're talking to tonight, well, at the DNC, totally completely unrecognizable from your views not that long ago. Bill Clinton would never survive as a candidate today. That's a fact. Bill Clinton worked across the aisle, what, the end of welfare as we know it. The era of big government is over. By the way, are you really going to make the case bill that in fact Obamacare promises were kept because they weren't? He supported a border wall. Bill Clinton supported deporting illegal immigrants. Bill Clinton signed the now infamous Clinton crime bill -- you know, that's when Joe mentioned predators and stuff like that. That contributed to the mass incarceration of minorities in this country. Joe Biden supported and championed -- don't forget Clinton praised, oh yeah, like Clinton, Biden, let's see, Hillary, Pelosi and Schumer, they all praised the former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd, the guy that filibustered the Civil Rights Act and was against the Voting Rights Act. Bill Clinton's mentor, his name you might not know. His name was J. William Fulbright, a known segregationist. And now, today, things got even worse for Clinton's tarnish legacy. Never before seen pictures, go watch thedailymail.com, go take a look there, showing Clinton getting a massage from a victim of Jeffrey Epstein back in 2002 while he was on a trip on Lolita Express with Epstein to Africa. So, Bill, you can save us the lectures and the lies, which you're known for, and the fact that you're still being celebrated by the Democratic Party. That's mass hypocrisy too. We continue.

Four years ago, I was with you in Philadelphia, the Democratic convention, and we would say, wow, have you ever seen such a grievance-filled candidate nominee that's feckless and reckless and cantankerous? And the answer is yes, even more so now. You got Joe Biden who beat all the socialist radical ideas in the primary and the candidates who carry them now capitulating on congratulating to the same people. And it looks a little bit like a swamp-feeding (ph) to me, for a convention that's supposed to be about the people and for the people, you've got lots of folks who've been in and out of Washington for decades. Bill Clinton, they gave him less than five minutes tonight. If you look at the average time he spoke in the last seven or eight Democratic conventions, 60-some minutes, 25 minutes, 48 minutes. His role has shrunk in the party because the party that he tried to be a moderate in no longer exists. It has been taken over by the squad that doesn't do squat, it's been taken over by the Bernie-Biden manifesto. And I think most importantly, the person mentioned most in the Biden convention is not Joe Biden, it's Donald Trump -- Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. It's every -- it's every noun, verb and adverb out of their mouths. It tells you that the Democratic Party themselves has no confidence in the competence in their nominee Joe Biden. They missed their moment. Joe Biden is the nominee means that Donald Trump continues to run as the outsider, the underdog, the underestimated outsider, even though he's the incumbent president. Usually the challenge to the incumbent owns the mantle of outsider, that cannot possibly be true if you got Joe Biden who has done less in 47 years in Washington than Donald Trump has done 47 months in Washington.",

If you look at polling on issues which is always much more telling than horse race ballot questions because those change over time as people solidify their votes and take a look at the candidates and make their decisions. But if you look at policy questions, Americans reject everything the Green New Deal stands for. It's expensive, it's intrusive, it's invasive, it's just the worst of the federal government banning cows and gas and air travel and the like. In fact, when it went to a vote in the United States Senate, Sean, do you really how many votes the Green New Deal got? Zero. Zero, including among the Democrats who are running for president at the time who said that they wanted to support it. It got zero votes when they had to go back and tell their constituents we support this. We know abortion and the ninth month is a nonstarter, we know raising our taxes -- you know that business tax went from 35 percent down to 21 percent under President Trump, and if you raise it back up again, millions of Americans will lose their jobs. We know that people don't want the big lie of the last ten years, you can keep your plan, keep your doctor, to continue under Joe Biden. It's President Trump, the health care president, who's been trying to stabilize these changes and make health care more affordable and more accessible. So, if you look at issues polling, the Democratic Party right now is way out of step with where Americans are. That's why it's very odd that Joe Biden, who beat down all those issues, beat down all those policies and the people who stood for them, is rolling back to the -- rolling back to the hard left and doing that. Look, if you look at the all the footage of Joe Biden bragging about with Bill Clinton his vote on NAFTA, Donald Trump has done away with that with the USMCA, much better for this country, for job creators, job seekers, job holders. Much better for Mexico, much better for Canada, much better for the United States of America. Look at Joe Biden and Bill Clinton bragging about their big crime bill in 1994.

In just moments, we're going to dip in briefly, only briefly, let's give you a flavor. We'll give you the full one-minute remarks of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Why? Because that's all they gave her because they're hiding who they really are. We'll watch a little bit of Chucky Schumer and some of his hate Trump rhetoric, just for fun. Now, we're going to monitor former President Bill Clinton. Now, Bill Clinton is interesting because I'm going to lay out in a special \"Hannity\" monologue how he wouldn't even be a nominee of that party ever based on his positions and, by the way, he's embroiled in a huge new scandal today. \"The Daily Mail\" just published newly uncovered pictures, Bill Clinton reportedly getting back -- I get a little back massage of one of Jeffrey Epstein's victims. This isn't funny. What I saw in The Daily Mail should scare everybody. We reached out to Clinton for comment. We've yet to hear back. By the way, whatever happened to the I-believers in the Democratic Party that are outraged that Bill Clinton is about to speak in prime time at their party's convention. Do they have any real values at all? Kamala Harris, any comment at all? We'll have more, straight ahead. But, first, we're going to bring everything you need to know about last night's big DNC kickoff because if you're like most Americans you actually didn't watch it. In fact, ratings for the convention are way down. Last night, look at this, ABC, CBS, NBC, they garnered a record low 6.7 million viewers, which is down 42 percent from 2016. Now, just as a comparison, I won't talk about myself, but when FOX News alone from 2016 covered President Trump, it was well over 8 million, one channel, just one channel. Wow. Now, those who did tune in for the convention got a predictable dose of poorly produced cult-like psychotic rage, hysteria against all things Donald Trump. Oh, I thought they were the uniters, and they go high and we go low, and all that nonsense, all phony rhetoric. Marianne Williamson, she had a pretty funny line -- that it was like binge- watching a Marriott Hotel commercial. That's pretty funny. Let's be clear, though, this is beyond a really, really bad infomercial. Yes, OK, it was boring, it was awkward, it was disjointed."

      "utterance": "zero substance, nothing. We heard no real solutions on how they will improve the lives of you, the American people. No policy discussions, no mention of the crisis in America's disastrous Democratic- run cities, you know, that Jerry Nadler said the myth that there's violence. A myth? No new proposals to combat COVID-19, nothing. Remember, they were missing in action. They thought it was xenophobic and hysterical to put the travel ban in effect. They were impeaching the president in the middle of their trial during the beginnings of all this, nowhere to be found. No mentions of how to make this country more safe, more secure, wealthier, prosperous, none of that. All you got was a temper tantrum, bumper stickers, slogans about pretty much how much they hate Donald Trump and behind the hatred of him is a hatred of we, smelly Walmart shopper Trump supporters, irredeemable deplorables, the 15 percent as Biden says. You know, that the angry people that Obama talked about the cling to God, guilty, yep; our Second Amendment, guilty; bibles, guilty; and religion, belief in God, guilty again. And by the way, the try -- and I like to save money at Walmart. My book is really price low there, like Costco's. Anyway, they're trying to bury their radical policies. That's why Ocasio- Cortez gets a minute. Andrew Cuomo, this was a meltdown and psychosis moment for him, blaming Trump for what he's calling the European coronavirus. Wow, never mind the thousands of seniors who died because of Cuomo's disastrous nursing home policy. We have a new report out today as a matter of fact, Andrew, from the \"A.P.\" Now, the true nursing home death, they, quote, is clocked in and cloaked in secrecy, they said. It could be more than 11,000 people, not the 6,000 they're saying because of Cuomo's stupid decision. Then, of course, Wolf in Pennsylvania, Murphy in New Jersey, Whitmer. And we had our old pal, Ohio Governor John Kasich. It's really just a really bad case of sore-loser-it is, kind of like the recent, you know, recently deceased John McCain. He was pretty angry about losing, as is Hillary Clinton and Al Gore and Mitt Romney. They all think they're going to win. They don't win, they get angry. Anyway, he delivered -- John Kasich -- his own bitter, anti-Trump rant, and pretty much just recanted everything that he had said that he publicly believed in. Good luck with that, John. And then there was the former First Lady Michelle Obama -- praised by everybody in the mob in the media. And during what were pretty vindictive and inaccurate and untrue remarks, she was so busy trashing President Trump. It's kind of interesting, she didn't even mention Kamala Harris, the first female African-American on a presidential ticket, although according to reports, Michelle Obama apparently pre-taped the speech prior to Biden's VP announcement, couldn't be bothered to retape it. That's how all in she is for Joe. She had almost a full week to tape it. And for the record, Obama disparaged Republicans all the time. Yep, the Obama administration was very divisive. By the way, his record on the economy, 13 million more Americans food stamps, 8 million more poverty, lowest labor participation rates since the ‘70s, worst recovery since the ‘40s, I can go on. His foreign policy, really, bribing mullahs with $150 billion in cash and other currency, both disasters. Only person who actually gave any substance at all, got to give credit where it's due. There he is -- comrade Bernie Sanders, Bolshevik Bernie. Remember with Bernie, well, he used to be the -- an annoyance, on the fringe of the Democratic Party, an outlier, barely even tolerated. Everyone there thought he was a kook back then. Many Democrats embarrassed by Sanders' radical socialist agenda. Now, well, he is the signal caller. He's the leader of the Democratic Party. He controls the party's agenda. He helped co-write or co-author Biden's economic platform. In other words, Biden plagiarized it, big portions of it. The Bernie-Biden manifesto, as the president calls it, he is now the mainstream of what is now the Democratic socialist party. This is the most extreme ticket of any major party in the history of this country. By the way, don't take my word for it. Let's just listen to what Bernie Sanders had to say last night. He's the leader. He's the economic czar for Joe and Kamala. Take a look."

And, by the way, you can kiss the Senate filibuster goodbye if Schumer becomes the leader, Chucky, Nancy, they'll be more than happy to ram this radical wish list right through Congress, and there is the Trojan horse as the president's referring to Joe Biden, president, he'll sign anything. Dangerous agenda, dangerous possibilities. But, hey, at least Bernie Sanders got to give him credit, he had energy, he had strength, he had stamina, mental alertness, mental acuity to coherently, energetically, he gave the most passionate speech last night. Now, Bernie is a year older than Joe Biden, so the criticism about Biden's struggles, like there was criticism about Reagan and John McCain is not about age.

That's one aspect of weekend at Bernie's. But the second aspect is the guy who spoke yesterday is driving the whole train. It is Bernie Sanders, it is AOC, it is Elizabeth Warren, it is the radicals. And Joe Biden is not holding back on them at all. He is letting them drive the entire train. If these guys win, we're going to wake up in January with Elizabeth Warren as treasury secretary.

Protecting, securing the border, protecting our homes, having the police enforce law and order, all of that works. The Democrats' ideas of open borders and socialism, they're disasters, but this entire convention is all about hiding this. The Democrats want this to be a battle of personalities. What they're gambling on, their base hates Donald Trump, and they just want it to be a personality battle. Do you like what Donald Trump says or tweets? And the Democrats think they win just the personality battle. If we focus on substance, it ain't even close. Let's take something like open borders. It was only a few years ago, you know, Chuck Schumer is speaking tonight. He used to talk about wanting to secure the border. No longer, you can't say that in the Democratic Party. You remember during the debate when they asked them how many of you will support giving free taxpayer financed health care to every illegal immigrant in America, and every one of them, including poor Joe Biden, raised their hand, and Joe just sort of looked scared he was looking around going, OK, I guess I got to raise my hand. That's where their party is. And you know what they didn't talk about at all but what their angry base wants to do is abolish the police. It's not just a slogan. It's what the mob is demanding. It's what Bill de Blasio in New York City, just as leading the fight to cut a billion dollars from the NYPD, it's what Minneapolis is doing, it's what Portland is doing.

One commonality, if you look at it, New York, Chicago, Portland, Seattle, L.A., San Francisco, violent anarchists masquerading as, quote, peaceful protesters, wreaking havoc. Portland, 81 straight days. Viewer warning, the video we are about to show you is extremely graphic. A manhunt is now underway for a man named Marquise Love who is suspected of carrying this brutal -- carrying out this brutal attack that we showed you last night. This is brutal. And, by the way, thankfully, we're told the victim is recovering from this assault.

Joe Biden supported and championed -- don't forget Clinton praised, oh yeah, like Clinton, Biden, let's see, Hillary, Pelosi and Schumer, they all praised the former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd, the guy that filibustered the Civil Rights Act and was against the Voting Rights Act. Bill Clinton's mentor, his name you might not know. His name was J. William Fulbright, a known segregationist. And now, today, things got even worse for Clinton's tarnish legacy. Never before seen pictures, go watch thedailymail.com, go take a look there, showing Clinton getting a massage from a victim of Jeffrey Epstein back in 2002 while he was on a trip on Lolita Express with Epstein to Africa. So, Bill, you can save us the lectures and the lies, which you're known for, and the fact that you're still being celebrated by the Democratic Party. That's mass hypocrisy too. We continue.

Now, she got it all in as much as she can get it in a minute, got to give her credit for that. But she says it. They're trying to hide most of that. That's why she didn't get more than a minute. I'm sure they were like choking on the minute she gave because she's revealing the truth about what they're going to do. Now, remember, Biden has supported trillions of dollars for her New Green Deal and madness, including getting rid of the lifeblood of the world's economy. So the question is, is that America, are they going to buy these promises, it's unfulfillable. It is something, you cannot -- the math -- you don't need to be a Harvard or MIT scholar to add up $94 trillion, $52 trillion, for ten years, and you only make -- take in $4.5 trillion, not that hard to figure out, simple math, Ari."

Republicans have got to sign a powerful light on how bad these Democratic policies are. They need to shine a light on how weak Joe Biden is, how bad the policies are, and how radical left the Democrat Party has shifted. Keep it simple to those three themes. If they do that, Donald Trump will have a very successful convention. Democrats want only talk about empathy and President Trump's character, Republicans need to talk about Biden's weakness and how radical left they are, and that's the winning ticket for Republicans."

It's the hardest job in the world. You know, you were there. And so, my question to you is, everybody I know is talking about it privately, very few are willing to say, raise a question that they raised about Ronald Reagan in '84 and John McCain in 2008.

You are saying an environmentalist as he calls himself, Bernie Sanders, standing in front of a pile of timber talking about what a socialist vessel Joe Biden has become. You have lawn care expert John Kasich standing in an empty grass field talking about how he's a moderate. And then you have AOC hitting Kasich, and then trying to talk about how radical the party is going to be. This is the Democrat Party. But remember, Joe Biden is radical socialist. He is pursuing the Green New Deal with Kamala pairing up with AOC. Let's be clear, radical socialism is what the Democrat goal is. AOC staff said it over a year ago, the Green New Deal is about taking away capitalism and completely re-changing our economy to a socialist economy. That's what's at stake in November and President Trump stands firmly for the groundswell beliefs in this country that our Constitution is what we should be fighting for."

And, you know, Ari Fleischer did a nice job breaking down what comrade Cortez talked about, item by item. But you would need -- you need a translator to fully understand the social justice wokeness that she rammed into one minute. This is someone who absolutely loathes America, loathes capitalism, loathes freedom, loathes borders, rejects our police. The basic ingredients of what have made us free individuals and provided equal justice are something Comrade Cortez totally rejects. So, if you want to talk about rising starts, they include her amongst the list. I like ours. I like our Josh Hawleys and our Dan Crenshaws and our Michael Wahls and our Elise Stefaniks and all the young members of the House and the Senate, who are -- they haven't changed their position, Sean. It is -- it is Joe Biden who is morphing into a left-wing version of himself that is bowing to Bernie and Comrade Cortez. Their radicalism knows no bounds. It's truly anti-capitalism, truly anti- American and they -- they believe, listen, colonialism cloaked in racism. They believe America is defined by her sins, and it comes through every word that they speak. She said, reimagining America. Sounds a lot like transforming America, which Obama talked about a couple of years ago."

Four years ago, I was with you in Philadelphia, the Democratic convention, and we would say, wow, have you ever seen such a grievance-filled candidate nominee that's feckless and reckless and cantankerous? And the answer is yes, even more so now. You got Joe Biden who beat all the socialist radical ideas in the primary and the candidates who carry them now capitulating on congratulating to the same people. And it looks a little bit like a swamp-feeding (ph) to me, for a convention that's supposed to be about the people and for the people, you've got lots of folks who've been in and out of Washington for decades. Bill Clinton, they gave him less than five minutes tonight. If you look at the average time he spoke in the last seven or eight Democratic conventions, 60-some minutes, 25 minutes, 48 minutes. His role has shrunk in the party because the party that he tried to be a moderate in no longer exists. It has been taken over by the squad that doesn't do squat, it's been taken over by the Bernie-Biden manifesto. And I think most importantly, the person mentioned most in the Biden convention is not Joe Biden, it's Donald Trump -- Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. It's every -- it's every noun, verb and adverb out of their mouths. It tells you that the Democratic Party themselves has no confidence in the competence in their nominee Joe Biden. They missed their moment. Joe Biden is the nominee means that Donald Trump continues to run as the outsider, the underdog, the underestimated outsider, even though he's the incumbent president. Usually the challenge to the incumbent owns the mantle of outsider, that cannot possibly be true if you got Joe Biden who has done less in 47 years in Washington than Donald Trump has done 47 months in Washington."

      "utterance": "We already know what the public thinks. If you look at polling on issues which is always much more telling than horse race ballot questions because those change over time as people solidify their votes and take a look at the candidates and make their decisions. But if you look at policy questions, Americans reject everything the Green New Deal stands for. It's expensive, it's intrusive, it's invasive, it's just the worst of the federal government banning cows and gas and air travel and the like. In fact, when it went to a vote in the United States Senate, Sean, do you really how many votes the Green New Deal got? Zero. Zero, including among the Democrats who are running for president at the time who said that they wanted to support it. It got zero votes when they had to go back and tell their constituents we support this. We know abortion and the ninth month is a nonstarter, we know raising our taxes -- you know that business tax went from 35 percent down to 21 percent under President Trump, and if you raise it back up again, millions of Americans will lose their jobs. We know that people don't want the big lie of the last ten years, you can keep your plan, keep your doctor, to continue under Joe Biden. It's President Trump, the health care president, who's been trying to stabilize these changes and make health care more affordable and more accessible. So, if you look at issues polling, the Democratic Party right now is way out of step with where Americans are. That's why it's very odd that Joe Biden, who beat down all those issues, beat down all those policies and the people who stood for them, is rolling back to the -- rolling back to the hard left and doing that. Look, if you look at the all the footage of Joe Biden bragging about with Bill Clinton his vote on NAFTA, Donald Trump has done away with that with the USMCA, much better for this country, for job creators, job seekers, job holders. Much better for Mexico, much better for Canada, much better for the United States of America. Look at Joe Biden and Bill Clinton bragging about their big crime bill in 1994.

They're looking for something that brings a safety, security, prosperity to the country. And Donald Trump has proven he can do that. The Democrats, I think Kellyanne made a great point, all they're talking about is Donald Trump because they have no enthusiasm and no excitement for their own candidate, because they have a terrible story and track record. They have nothing else but to attack this president who, frankly, has a great story and great track record to tell, and I think you're going to see a lot of that next week."

Secondly, what he can do is he can be blank slate and on that blank slate, who is writing on it? AOC, Bernie Sanders and the radical left. When you buy a piece of artwork and you bring it home, you want a finished piece. You don't bring home a blank slate and say, paint it in my house. The problem is, you're bringing home with Joe Biden, if you vote for him, a blank slate, and everybody painting on him is painting on him stuff you ain't going to like -- defunding the police, taking more of your money through taxes and crushing the economy.
