Liberals who used to love discourse, I remember them when they used to love to debate. They now prefer the easier route. Just call someone a Nazi or a closet KKK member, and you're done. That way, you don't have to do any intellectual heavy-lifting. You don't have to be rigorous.

Well, thankfully, the tactic failed miserably there. But that didn't stop the left from continuing this line of attack. The examples appear almost daily. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This week we learned that a chef and partner at the Wursthall Restaurant & Bierhaus, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, has posted this welcoming tweet to potential customers. And it's since been deleted, but here it is. \"It hasn't happened yet, but if you come to my restaurant wearing a MAGA cap, you aren't getting served. Same as if you come wearing a swastika, white hood, or any other symbol of intolerance and hate.\" Hold the fries. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, this is the same hatred, of course, we saw hurled at those Covington Catholic High School boys. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's catchy. I'm getting to like that tune. Like lightning, the media instantly branded them as MAGA-hatted racists, products of an evil religious education who dare to disrespect this Native American protester. Only later did we learn that it was the kids who had been harassed and confronted by adults. They were guilty of only standing their ground with respect and grace, MAGA hats and all. Well, now there's a new MAGA incident, don't you know? Again, the media is rushing in to judgment before all the evidence is in. last Tuesday, Empire actor, Jussie Smollett, claims that he was walking home at 2:00 a.m. on the freezing cold streets of Chicago when he was assaulted. Two assailants allegedly beat him, poured a liquid on him, shouted racist and homophobic slurs. And then they put a rope around his neck. Authorities have been investigating and scouring surveillance video of the area. They see Smollet walking into an apartment complex with the rope around his neck, but no evidence - video evidence of the assault. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to Fox 32 reporter Rafer Weigel, Chicago PD and the Chicago FBI have been working around the clock and have found nothing to support the accusations and given the extremity - I think they mean extreme nature - of his claims, and where they allegedly took place, it has made them skeptical. In a subsequent interview with the police, Smollet added a detail he initially omitted. He claims that his attackers yelled \"This is MAGA country\" as they fled the scene. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we're glad Mr. Smollet seems to be doing OK. But unlike much of the media, we will not pronounce judgment before all the facts are in. We're not going to entertain all these conspiracy theories on the Internet. I find all of it hideous. But it is also hurtful to the country when partisans rush in to create political scapegoats for every individual crime or infraction. Reality is often more complicated than that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And another fact. Mr. Smollet has written wild things about the President. Things I will not read aloud here. Now, I don't care how nasty his tweets are, any violent attack on any American for whatever reason should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, particularly if it was motivated by race, religion, or sexual preference. And by the same token, it is irresponsible and, frankly, unjust to tar all Trump supporters as racists and haters because you disagree with the President or because some nutbag did something hateful and awful. This destructive racial narrative has infected our political life, and maybe for a reason. The renowned African-American writer Shelby Steele summed up the situation starkly on my podcast today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And they're not scary, and they're not racist, and they're not anti-woman, and they're not anti-immigrant. They're very pragmatic. Renegotiate bad trade deals, stand up to China, get NATO countries to pay their fair share, enforce the rule of law at the border, appoint judges who stay in their constitutional lane, stay out of unwinnable wars, cut taxes and red tape. Now, not only is this conservative agenda working, it's working really well for minorities if the resistance doesn't care. They want you to be angry and resentful. No pursuit of happiness for you.

Don't apologize for your beliefs. Actively engage in minority communities, don't be bullied out of them. Listen to the concerns of the people even when it's uncomfortable, and it will be. Explain your policies without the filter of an unfriendly media. The power of self- reliance, the power of strong families, single mothers in Chicago who I met back in the fall, they understand that. The power of making good choices every day. Let's all reinforce these basic truths amongst ourselves and also in those communities by showing up and actually having a conversation. Wouldn't that be nice? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The President and his cabinet should hit the road for America, travel to cities like Oakland and Chicago and Baltimore, not just the safe zones in red states.

And when doing so, be sure to show everyone around you what true tolerance, kindness, and inclusiveness looks like. And that's “The Angle.” Joining me now with reaction, Horace Cooper, Co-Chair of Project 21; and Dee Dawkins-Haigler, former Democratic member of the Georgia House of Representatives, here with me in Washington; and in Atlanta, Bruce LeVell.

Why is this broad racism brush so generously applied to Trump and his supporters? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Because it's effective. It is a very good way to stop people from being able to see how important the policies are, how effective they are, how impactful they are. It is working and will keep continuing to occur unless we can call these people out for doing it.",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, it was success. The goal, my friends, is to brand an entire belief system as a moral, evil toxic, and of course, it's racist. Liberals who used to love discourse, I remember them when they used to love to debate. They now prefer the easier route. Just call someone a Nazi or a closet KKK member, and you're done. That way, you don't have to do any intellectual heavy-lifting. You don't have to be rigorous. You just use the pejorative du jour as a baseball bat and then smash your opponents across the face and declare victory. This was the approach they hoped would pay off in the Kavanaugh hearings, where they showcased some uncorroborated accusation to get a conviction of unfitness for the high court. Well, thankfully, the tactic failed miserably there. But that didn't stop the left from continuing this line of attack. The examples appear almost daily. This week we learned that a chef and partner at the Wursthall Restaurant & Bierhaus, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, has posted this welcoming tweet to potential customers. And it's since been deleted, but here it is. \"It hasn't happened yet, but if you come to my restaurant wearing a MAGA cap, you aren't getting served. Same as if you come wearing a swastika, white hood, or any other symbol of intolerance and hate.\" Hold the fries. Well, this is the same hatred, of course, we saw hurled at those Covington Catholic High School boys. That's catchy. I'm getting to like that tune. Like lightning, the media instantly branded them as MAGA-hatted racists, products of an evil religious education who dare to disrespect this Native American protester. Only later did we learn that it was the kids who had been harassed and confronted by adults. They were guilty of only standing their ground with respect and grace, MAGA hats and all. Well, now there's a new MAGA incident, don't you know? Again, the media is rushing in to judgment before all the evidence is in. last Tuesday, Empire actor, Jussie Smollett, claims that he was walking home at 2:00 a.m. on the freezing cold streets of Chicago when he was assaulted. Two assailants allegedly beat him, poured a liquid on him, shouted racist and homophobic slurs. And then they put a rope around his neck. Authorities have been investigating and scouring surveillance video of the area. They see Smollet walking into an apartment complex with the rope around his neck, but no evidence - video evidence of the assault. According to Fox 32 reporter Rafer Weigel, Chicago PD and the Chicago FBI have been working around the clock and have found nothing to support the accusations and given the extremity - I think they mean extreme nature - of his claims, and where they allegedly took place, it has made them skeptical. In a subsequent interview with the police, Smollet added a detail he initially omitted. He claims that his attackers yelled \"This is MAGA country\" as they fled the scene. Now, we're glad Mr. Smollet seems to be doing OK. But unlike much of the media, we will not pronounce judgment before all the facts are in. We're not going to entertain all these conspiracy theories on the Internet. I find all of it hideous. But it is also hurtful to the country when partisans rush in to create political scapegoats for every individual crime or infraction. Reality is often more complicated than that. And another fact. Mr. Smollet has written wild things about the President. Things I will not read aloud here. Now, I don't care how nasty his tweets are, any violent attack on any American for whatever reason should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, particularly if it was motivated by race, religion, or sexual preference. And by the same token, it is irresponsible and, frankly, unjust to tar all Trump supporters as racists and haters because you disagree with the President or because some nutbag did something hateful and awful. This destructive racial narrative has infected our political life, and maybe for a reason. The renowned African-American writer Shelby Steele summed up the situation starkly on my podcast today."

      "utterance": "But too many Democrats don't want you to hear that. They resort to using shame, guilt, and grievance to get their political way, which basically ends up accomplishing nothing. And it ends up helping no one, except those whose pockets are lined by peddling victimhood. By any objective analysis, Donald Trump's policies are working. And they're not scary, and they're not racist, and they're not anti-woman, and they're not anti-immigrant. They're very pragmatic. Renegotiate bad trade deals, stand up to China, get NATO countries to pay their fair share, enforce the rule of law at the border, appoint judges who stay in their constitutional lane, stay out of unwinnable wars, cut taxes and red tape. Now, not only is this conservative agenda working, it's working really well for minorities if the resistance doesn't care. They want you to be angry and resentful. No pursuit of happiness for you. So what should Republicans be doing? I'll tell you what they should be doing. Don't play defense. Don't apologize for your beliefs. Actively engage in minority communities, don't be bullied out of them. Listen to the concerns of the people even when it's uncomfortable, and it will be. Explain your policies without the filter of an unfriendly media. The power of self- reliance, the power of strong families, single mothers in Chicago who I met back in the fall, they understand that. The power of making good choices every day. Let's all reinforce these basic truths amongst ourselves and also in those communities by showing up and actually having a conversation. Wouldn't that be nice? The President and his cabinet should hit the road for America, travel to cities like Oakland and Chicago and Baltimore, not just the safe zones in red states. Don't see the territory to the hucksters who stoke victimhood and market the same tired ideas that have kept generations in poverty. And as for those red hats, well, I'd continue to wear them whenever and wherever you like. And when doing so, be sure to show everyone around you what true tolerance, kindness, and inclusiveness looks like. And that's “The Angle.” Joining me now with reaction, Horace Cooper, Co-Chair of Project 21; and Dee Dawkins-Haigler, former Democratic member of the Georgia House of Representatives, here with me in Washington; and in Atlanta, Bruce LeVell. He's the Executive Director of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump. Horace, let's start with you. Why is this broad racism brush so generously applied to Trump and his supporters? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Because it's effective. It is a very good way to stop people from being able to see how important the policies are, how effective they are, how impactful they are. It is working and will keep continuing to occur unless we can call these people out for doing it."

And so what we need to do is make sure that we have civil conversations in this country. Because, to be honest with you, I kind of like the criminal justice reform, but his rhetoric throughout the campaign, trailing even now, it turns people off, and it has starting basis all worked up.

And then the cities are a disaster or the unemployment is terrible, or wages are depressed, or there's no opportunity, or there aren't 480,000 new manufacturing jobs for all people. So I think there's never any sense of balance in the coverage of these issues where race really comes to the fore, sometimes really unfairly. And I want to help this because I actually think there are a lot of people out there, that I've met them, that are tuning all of this out. They're tuning it out. They're like, guy, can we have some solutions? Bruce, I know you want to get in here. But I think the solutions are there for everyone to see if we stop shouting at each other and actually just look at what works. BRUCE LEVELL, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD: Yes. Well, Laura, thank you. Thanks for having me. The interesting thing about the gentleman earlier, the President has - when he spoke to the urban communities and said \"What the heck do you have to lose?\" you got to remember, most of these cities and counties and municipalities were under Democrat rule for over 40, 50, 60 years."

He's a former DHS special agent who actively hunts sex traffickers. And we're also joined by Sara Carter, a Fox News contributor, who just returned from the border. Tim, I want to start with you.

And the sad thing is, the wall would have likely saved her. Why? The wall is a law enforcement operation. It forces the traffickers to move their people, move their kids to a place where there's alert agents, there's high technology, and these kids can be rescued. At the same time this was happening, I was working on another case. A five- year-old boy who was kidnapped in Mexicali by an American trafficker, but there's a wall there. So he was forced to move this child through a port of entry, and we caught him.

And I can vouch for you, the Guatemalan government found seven children in the group that I was with who were not with their parents. They were being traffic for the purposes of sex trafficking, and they were able to move them out of the group and rescue them. But think of all of the kids that aren't rescued.

Better do due diligence before you collect $250,000 next time, Kendall. Now on to the Hollywood case, a hit and ski. A-lister Gwyneth Paltrow is being sued by a man who claims she smashed into him while skiing, knocking him out, leaving him with a concussion and four broken ribs. He says she didn't stick around. She just left him on the mountain."

She had people change their stories, the people that ran the resort. We just know that this guy was really hurt, you could see he could barely sleep. This guy was really hurt, there was a violation, and she should paid for that."

He says that he had a concussion and a few broken ribs. Is that worth $3.1 million? I don't think so. I can tell you how this movie ends. He's not going to get anywhere close to that. And she disputes the fact. She says that he hit her, so at the end of the day, I'll you, he is not going to win anywhere close to $3.1 million. He's not entitled to anything close to that."

      "utterance": "Hi Laura. In 2016, Abdulrahman Noorah, a Portland college student from Saudi Arabia, was charged with a fatal hit-and-run of 15-year-old Fallon Smart. The Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles paid Noorah's $100,000 bail. Then two weeks before his June 2017 trial on first-degree manslaughter, U.S. Marshals say the 21-year-old Saudi national was picked up by a black SUV and driven to an open field where he cut off his ankle monitor and disappeared. Authorities said he likely bordered a private plane to the Saudi Kingdom where he has been for the past 18 months. Watch."

      "speaker": "CHIEF DAVID ENYEART, TOLEDO, OREGON, POLICE DEPARTMENT",
      "utterance": "If you do the crime like this, you need to stay and face up to what happened no matter who you are. And so for a country coming in and paying the bail for somebody to get them out of the country, that is disgusting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "The parents of the 15-year-old are also stunned, saying, quote, \"When a child dies, it's like all the laws of physics go out the door and you spend months trying to put those things that you trusted, those constants back together. So to do all of that work and healing and then to have the killer escape, it just sets it all back to the beginning.\" U.S. Marshals are trying to get Noorah back into the U.S., but without an extradition treaty, it's unlikely. And recent history says it won't happen, because since 2013, four other Saudi nationals facing felonies in Oregon have also vanished, including Ali Alhamoud charged with raping an Oregon State student. With hours of the Saudi government paying his $65,000 bail, the FBI says Alhamoud boarded a play for Saudi Arabia. Same for Abdulaziz al Duways who was charged with rape, posted bail, and again fled the U.S. Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and fellow Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley have introduced bills targeting foreign consulates that help their citizens escape criminal prosecution. Wyden says Saudi Arabia is abusing its diplomatic privileges. Watch."
