Let's break it down with George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, also a FOX News contributor, and former Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Tom Dupree. Fancy meeting you here. We are back together to talk about what's happened and what is still to come. Okay, let's start with this -- sentencing comes on July 11th. \"Reuters\" asked the question, could Trump go to prison? In deciding the sentence, Merchan, the judge, may weigh the underlying seriousness of the charges due to their ties to the 2016 election, as well as Trump's decision to go to trial rather than accept responsibility by pleading guilty. Jonathan, you and I spent a lot of time in this in this courthouse watching this whole thing play out. Would anything surprise you from Judge Merchan?",

You've got a nonviolent offense by a first offender, elderly defendant, I would be very surprised. But there is a menu of other options from community service to home confinement. In my view, a conditional dismissal is what most judges would be thinking of which is basically a go out and send no more type of warning. You're still under supervision. So if you commit a new offense, then they get really tough on you. I -- the -- if he does go with something that is like community service or confining him to Trump Tower, I think Trump probably could get a suspension pending appeal from a higher court and that may weigh into the calculation for Judge Merchan.",

The jury was instructed along those lines. The jury clearly had some difficulty grappling with the instructions. They actually asked the judge to read those instructions back to them. And so, I suspect the Trump legal team is going to come out pretty hard on the idea that there was an underlying predicate crime that was sufficient to convert this from a misdemeanor to a felony. I think they've also got arguments on the exclusion of the bulk of their experts' testimony. I think that the Trump legal team will say look the jury needed to be able to understand the ins and outs of election law in order to decide this case and the judge prevented us from putting on the testimony the jury needed to hear.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's always Monday morning quarterbacking. I've talked to some members of the defense team. They feel that they did the best that they could and quite frankly, you could have been Clarence Darrow and lost this case because, you know, I was hoping for a hung jury. I viewed this is either hung jury or conviction case. And I said we had to wait for the instructions. Once the instructions came out, I said, it looks like an almost guarantee for conviction. There was not a lot of room there. And this is why I tell people, you shouldn't blame this jury necessarily. Those instructions were real really a poison pill instruction set. I mean they left very little room for the jury. The jury was told over and over again and the judge said nothing as the prosecutor said there were election violations in this case and they were ordered by Trump, and the defense objected to those and that Judge Merchan just overruled every one of those. So if for the -- what they heard in that courtroom, it's not too surprising in terms of a conviction. But it did create this target rich environment for appeal. But that appeal is likely to play out after the election. But for most Americans, we obviously are divided as we are politically. But this is something that we're not used to. For many of us, this was a political prosecution and in my view, we haven't had this type of politicalization of the criminal justice system since John Adams, and it's -- it's really been an awakening for many people looking at this and saying maybe this is where our rage is taking us and we have to look again at what we becoming if this will be the new norm.",

Meanwhile I want to make sure we hit on Hunter Biden's case because that gun case, unless there is a last minute deal, goes to trial starting tomorrow with jury selection. In one of the filings, the DOJ talks about what they would to include as evidence. They say this: The defendant's laptop is real. It will be introduced as a trial exhibit and it contains significant evidence of the defendant's guilt. Moreover, the evidence on his laptop is corroborated by independent sources including witnesses. It is also corroborated by the defendant's own admissions in his book.

They're going to be calling people very close to him, his friends, his family who are also going to testify that he was addicted to controlled substances at the time he filled out these forms and the time he possessed the firearm. I've seen the defense's arguments I don't find them very persuasive. I think they're going to argue that even though he was addicted, maybe he didn't know he was addicted, or maybe he was addicted on Monday, but his addiction had ended by Tuesday when he bought the gun. I don't find them persuasive but it is going to be fascinating seeing the Justice Department move forward with this prosecution next week.",

The second stage would lead to a full negotiated ceasefire and the release of all remaining hostages, and then finally, a third stage would involve a major reconstruction effort for Gaza and the release of dead Israelis that are being held by Hamas. Qatari negotiators relayed all of these details of the plan to Hamas and in a statement to FOX News, Hamas said, quote: The Islamic resistance movement positively views what was included in the speech of U.S. President Joe Biden. The president urged Israeli hardliners to accept this agreement and bring an end to the war. There is growing anticipation about the fate of this proposal, understanding that it is a last ditch effort amid failed diplomatic efforts. Back to you -- Shannon.",

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul says this: We want something that can become law. We're not really interested in a messaging bill.

And the idea that President Biden would backtrack on that, that would -- he would disagree with us that we should impose sanctions on ICC officials when they are threatening to arrest the prime minister of Israel and the defense minister of Israel in the midst of their war for survival is to us unconscionable. So, look, I hope that the White House sees the light on this. We've got to do this and we need to do it next week. And my intention is to bring that legislation to the floor.

They did it intentionally. And it has had catastrophic effects upon our country that we'll be living with for decades to come. And now he wants to issue some sort of executive order, I guess, to show that, oh, no, he really does care about the issue. The only reason he's doing that is because the polls say that it's the biggest issue in America. Every state's a border state. I've traveled to over 29 states, done events in 117 cities, as of yesterday, over the last six months. There is an energy out there. People are motivated.

We are conservatives, and we are trying to conserve the greatest country in the history of the world and its institutions are an important part of that.

You saw our Judiciary Chairman, Jim Jordan, issue requests for Alvin Bragg, the DA in Manhattan, and for the lead prosecutor, Colangelo, to show up for a hearing on June 13th in our select committee on the weaponization of the federal government, because that's what they've done. And the purpose of the hearing is to investigate what these prosecutors are doing at the state and federal level to use politics, you know, political retribution in the court system to go after political opponents, federal officials like Donald Trump. That's a really important thing for us to delve into. And we're going to look at Special Counsel Jack Smith, who we believe is abusing his authority as well. We have the funding streams. We have mechanisms to try to get control of that. We'll be doing that within the confines of our jurisdiction.

The issues that are going to drive the results of this November 5th election will be, can Donald Trump close the southern border? The answer is he already has closed the southern border. Can he bring inflation down under 2%? The answer is it was 1.4% when he left office. Can he create jobs for the poorest Americans? Good news is he created more than 7 million jobs with the highest percentage going to women, African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians. What we know about four years under Donald Trump is we had low unemployment, low inflation, high enthusiasm, law and order in our streets. And we've had the exact opposite under Joe Biden. We've had incredibly crushing inflation leading to high interest rates, crime in the poorest communities, devastating single mothers like the one that raised me.

He said, \"President Trump's retreat on the right to life is a slap in the face to the millions of pro- life Americans who voted for him. A majority of Americans long to see minimum national protections for the unborn in federal law.

Republicans are standing strong behind Donald Trump. He is their hero. And I mean, you know, it's now a civil conviction on business fraud. Convicted. He lost the defamation case for sexual assault.

A bookkeeper without ever speaking to me because she did the right thing who's been with me for years marks it down as legal expense. In other words, I paid a legal expense.

      "utterance": "In a moment, House Speaker Mike Johnson joins us with reaction to the verdict and to news that the president is expected to announce executive actions on the border by Tuesday. But first, what what's next for President Trump and his legal team as Hunter Biden's federal gun trial is also set to kick off on Monday? Let's break it down with George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, also a FOX News contributor, and former Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Tom Dupree. Fancy meeting you here. We are back together to talk about what's happened and what is still to come. Okay, let's start with this -- sentencing comes on July 11th. \"Reuters\" asked the question, could Trump go to prison? In deciding the sentence, Merchan, the judge, may weigh the underlying seriousness of the charges due to their ties to the 2016 election, as well as Trump's decision to go to trial rather than accept responsibility by pleading guilty. Jonathan, you and I spent a lot of time in this in this courthouse watching this whole thing play out. Would anything surprise you from Judge Merchan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN TURLEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "No, after watching him in court, quite frankly, I would have said that the very concept of jail for something like this would be otherworldly and ridiculous. After watching him in the courtroom, I must say I have some doubts in my mind. But it would go against the overwhelming weight of past cases. You've got a nonviolent offense by a first offender, elderly defendant, I would be very surprised. But there is a menu of other options from community service to home confinement. In my view, a conditional dismissal is what most judges would be thinking of which is basically a go out and send no more type of warning. You're still under supervision. So if you commit a new offense, then they get really tough on you. I -- the -- if he does go with something that is like community service or confining him to Trump Tower, I think Trump probably could get a suspension pending appeal from a higher court and that may weigh into the calculation for Judge Merchan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So let's talk about appeal because, obviously, that's coming. \"Telegraph\" outlines what it says are probably some of the best bright spots for the Trump legal team on that front. Stormy Daniel's testimony, the statute itself, the vagueness of the underlying crime, the fact that defense expert witness Brad Smith, that former FEC commissioner, wasn't allowed or at least severely limited in what he would be able to say, and the issue of presidential immunity which we obviously are all waiting on that from the Supreme Court. What do you think is the best option on appeal, Tom?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOM DUPREE, FORMER PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "I think they have a number of options at their disposal. I think maybe the best one is just really challenging this notion that they took. The D.A. took this kind of collection of business fraud, misdemeanors, kind of did some legal alchemy put it in a pot, add in some election fraud and presto, they've got 34 felonies. The jury was instructed along those lines. The jury clearly had some difficulty grappling with the instructions. They actually asked the judge to read those instructions back to them. And so, I suspect the Trump legal team is going to come out pretty hard on the idea that there was an underlying predicate crime that was sufficient to convert this from a misdemeanor to a felony. I think they've also got arguments on the exclusion of the bulk of their experts' testimony. I think that the Trump legal team will say look the jury needed to be able to understand the ins and outs of election law in order to decide this case and the judge prevented us from putting on the testimony the jury needed to hear."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So, everyone, it's hindsight 20/20, how the prosecution did, what the defense did. \"The New York Times\" says this under the headline \"How Trump's team blew it\". This is a guest essay, this is an opinion piece. But they write this: Instead of telling a simple story, Mr. Trump's defense was a haphazard cacophony of denials and personal attacks. It failed to focus the jury on the weaknesses in the prosecution's case and instead tried to fight everything and everyone even when it gained little by doing so. Jonathan, your response to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, there's always Monday morning quarterbacking. I've talked to some members of the defense team. They feel that they did the best that they could and quite frankly, you could have been Clarence Darrow and lost this case because, you know, I was hoping for a hung jury. I viewed this is either hung jury or conviction case. And I said we had to wait for the instructions. Once the instructions came out, I said, it looks like an almost guarantee for conviction. There was not a lot of room there. And this is why I tell people, you shouldn't blame this jury necessarily. Those instructions were real really a poison pill instruction set. I mean they left very little room for the jury. The jury was told over and over again and the judge said nothing as the prosecutor said there were election violations in this case and they were ordered by Trump, and the defense objected to those and that Judge Merchan just overruled every one of those. So if for the -- what they heard in that courtroom, it's not too surprising in terms of a conviction. But it did create this target rich environment for appeal. But that appeal is likely to play out after the election. But for most Americans, we obviously are divided as we are politically. But this is something that we're not used to. For many of us, this was a political prosecution and in my view, we haven't had this type of politicalization of the criminal justice system since John Adams, and it's -- it's really been an awakening for many people looking at this and saying maybe this is where our rage is taking us and we have to look again at what we becoming if this will be the new norm."

Moreover, the evidence on his laptop is corroborated by independent sources including witnesses. It is also corroborated by the defendant's own admissions in his book. This is both a legal and political headache now for the -- for the Biden family."

    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "Oh, for sure, Shannon, and this trial is going to be fascinating to watch play out. The Justice Department is saying that Hunter Biden basically lied on these forms that he filled out when he went to go buy a firearm, and what they are going to use to prove their case is his own testimony in his own book where he talked about how he was struggling with addiction. They're going to be calling people very close to him, his friends, his family who are also going to testify that he was addicted to controlled substances at the time he filled out these forms and the time he possessed the firearm. I've seen the defense's arguments I don't find them very persuasive. I think they're going to argue that even though he was addicted, maybe he didn't know he was addicted, or maybe he was addicted on Monday, but his addiction had ended by Tuesday when he bought the gun. I don't find them persuasive but it is going to be fascinating seeing the Justice Department move forward with this prosecution next week."

We turn now to the Middle East because there is news from overseas amid cautious hopes that a new Israeli proposed ceasefire plane could finally get the hostages still held in Gaza home to their loved ones.

On Friday, President Biden laid out a plan for a proposal that if accepted would be implemented in three stages. The first stage would see a six-week pause in the fighting with Israeli troops withdrawing from Gaza's major cities along with an exchange of female and wounded Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The second stage would lead to a full negotiated ceasefire and the release of all remaining hostages, and then finally, a third stage would involve a major reconstruction effort for Gaza and the release of dead Israelis that are being held by Hamas."

There are a number of international bodies that are condemning Israel or the prime minister in their case asking for arrest warrants. It seemed like the White House was interested in doing something that would push back on the ICC. Now it seems that they have changed course, that's not going to be the case."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, we hope to actually determine that by this afternoon these negotiations have been ongoing with our Democrat colleagues and we are working very hard as Chairman McCaul indicated there, we -- we don't want this to just be a political exercise. We think it's important for Republicans and Democrats to stand together and send a message to the international community that the abuses of the International Criminal Court, the ICC, cannot be allowed to go forward. And the idea that President Biden would backtrack on that, that would -- he would disagree with us that we should impose sanctions on ICC officials when they are threatening to arrest the prime minister of Israel and the defense minister of Israel in the midst of their war for survival is to us unconscionable. So, look, I hope that the White House sees the light on this. We've got to do this and we need to do it next week. And my intention is to bring that legislation to the floor. If we have to do it Republicans only, we will, but I certainly hope the Democrats will come along with us on it."

The -- our Democrat colleagues have to make a choice, are they going to stand with our most important ally in the Middle East, at this most desperate time as has traditionally been the case in Washington. We've had bipartisan agreement that we have to stand in solidarity with Israel. Or are they going to take this new side and stand with Hamas and the ayatollah? Bernie Sanders has chosen a side, I hope that our other colleagues in the Democrat Party will stand up and do the right thing. We desperately need it. Israel desperately needs it. I spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu as recently as Wednesday about all of this and he's deeply concerned you know we did issue that invitation for the joint address to Congress. I'm really grateful it finally went out I would note that I sent the draft of the letter the joint letter back in mid-March to Chuck Schumer. It took him quite some time to agree. But we have finally gotten that done. Prime Minister Netanyahu is anxious to come and address us, and I hope that we can get that scheduled here in the -- in the coming weeks."

We've confirmed that the White House saying the president is going to take executive action on the border. You've been pushing him on to do that for a long time. We don't know what it is yet, but do you give him credit for at least taking that step?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "I don't, Shannon, it's too little too late. Now, he's trying to desperately show the American people somehow that he wants to address the issue that he himself created. We documented 64 specific executive actions that President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas at DHS took over the -- over the course of the last three and a half years, beginning on the first day that President Biden took office, to open the border wide. They did it intentionally. And it has had catastrophic effects upon our country that we'll be living with for decades to come. And now he wants to issue some sort of executive order, I guess, to show that, oh, no, he really does care about the issue. The only reason he's doing that is because the polls say that it's the biggest issue in America. Every state's a border state. I've traveled to over 29 states, done events in 117 cities, as of yesterday, over the last six months. There is an energy out there. People are motivated. And the first question that comes up in almost every public forum is, what about that open border and why in the world would President Biden allow it? He did more than allow it. He engineered it. And everybody knows that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK, we'll see what he spins out, we think, as early as Tuesday of this week. Now, I want to ask you about the verdict. Clearly, you think it's a travesty, as many people do. And I think having watched the trial, there are many grounds, fertile territory, for the Trump team to use on appeal. But that's going to take time. In the meantime, there are a number of Republicans out there saying, you guys need to turn around and do this same thing. John Yoo writing this, \"Republicans have to bring charges against Democratic officers, even presidents. Only retaliation in kind can produce the deterrence necessary to enforce a political version of mutual assured destruction.\" The other side, Peggy Noonan, writing about how high the temperature is, says this. \"We have to ease up. We have to stop enjoying our hate so much. We can't go on indefinitely like this.\" Are you worried that Republicans will be perceived as doing the very thing you're accusing Democrats of, of using the legal system for political purposes, if you follow, John Yoo's advice?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Here's what I believe, Shannon. Listen, we are the rule of law party. Chaos is not a conservative value. And we have to fight back, and we will, with everything in our arsenal. But we do that within the confines of the rule of law. We believe in our institutions. We are conservatives, and we are trying to conserve the greatest country in the history of the world and its institutions are an important part of that. Our system of justice is an important part of that. So what we'll do with our tools that we have in Congress, in the House, is we'll use our oversight responsibility. We've already done that. You saw our Judiciary Chairman, Jim Jordan, issue requests for Alvin Bragg, the DA in Manhattan, and for the lead prosecutor, Colangelo, to show up for a hearing on June 13th in our select committee on the weaponization of the federal government, because that's what they've done. And the purpose of the hearing is to investigate what these prosecutors are doing at the state and federal level to use politics, you know, political retribution in the court system to go after political opponents, federal officials like Donald Trump. That's a really important thing for us to delve into. And we're going to look at Special Counsel Jack Smith, who we believe is abusing his authority as well. We have the funding streams. We have mechanisms to try to get control of that. We'll be doing that within the confines of our jurisdiction. And I think that can have the desired effect and show the American people we're not going to tolerate this. Shannon, at the end of the day, people are losing their faith in our system of justice itself, and that's a serious threat."

      "speaker": "BREAM",

You said, I think that the justices on the court, I know many of them personally, I think they're deeply concerned. Now, one of your critics out there, somebody who covers the court with me, part of the Supreme Court press corps, Mark Joseph Stern, wrote this. He says, \"Fascinating to hear the GOP Speaker of the House admit to having private conversations with multiple justices who expressed concern to him about Trump's conviction. I'm sure those justices will recuse from any eventual appeal to avoid sitting on a case they've prejudged.\" I didn't take your comments to mean that specific conversation, but want to give you a chance to clarify."

They are deeply concerned, as we are, about maintaining our system of justice. If you walk into the Supreme Court building, Shannon, you and I know, chiseled on the marble above the front door is equal justice under law. They are concerned about maintaining that idea. We all are, because it's a necessary ingredient to keep a constitutional republic. That's what I was referring to. I think they're concerned about using courtrooms for politics and political retribution. We all are. We all should be. Every American. That's what I was referring to.

Without any question, what we've seen is never Trumpers calling me and saying, Tim, I'm on the bandwagon now. I've seen this two- tiered justice system working against the president of the United States. It could work against me, too. I've seen donors who've been on the sidelines this entire process now jumping in. One of the reasons why we saw more than $50 million raised in 24 hours. But you're 100% right. The issues that are going to drive the results of this November 5th election will be, can Donald Trump close the southern border? The answer is he already has closed the southern border. Can he bring inflation down under 2%? The answer is it was 1.4% when he left office. Can he create jobs for the poorest Americans? Good news is he created more than 7 million jobs with the highest percentage going to women, African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians. What we know about four years under Donald Trump is we had low unemployment, low inflation, high enthusiasm, law and order in our streets. And we've had the exact opposite under Joe Biden. We've had incredibly crushing inflation leading to high interest rates, crime in the poorest communities, devastating single mothers like the one that raised me. And we've had the greatest invasion in American history across our southern border, left wide open, unsafe, because Joe Biden on day one started unraveling border security put in place by Donald Trump."

You and Doug Burgum going back and forth this week. But one of the issues where it seems like there may be a split with you and President Trump is this issue of abortion. Back when you were campaigning in Iowa, when you were running for the nomination, you name-checked him and others who you felt would not set a limit, some type of federal ban. President Trump has said now that he's not going to sign a federal ban. This is to be left to the states. Mike Pence said this when that news came out. He said, \"President Trump's retreat on the right to life is a slap in the face to the millions of pro- life Americans who voted for him. A majority of Americans long to see minimum national protections for the unborn in federal law. But today, too many Republican politicians are all too ready to wash their hands of the battle for life.\" I know you are passionate about this, and we have talked about the fact that there are states that do not have a limit on abortion up to a due date.

The former governor of Virginia, a pediatrician Democrat, said perhaps even infanticide is OK. I find that amoral. Without question, however, the Supreme Court has already ruled that this is a state's issue. President Trump and Speaker Johnson have both said that this will remain a state's issue.

Inflation is.\" They add, \"What's really killing President Biden is experienced by every voter every day. Things cost too much.\" One Democratic strategist who's worked on presidential campaigns said this, \"If the frame of this race is what was better, the three-and-a-half years under Biden or four years under Trump, we lose that every day of the week and twice on Sunday.\" As flawed a candidate I'm sure you think President Trump is, poll after poll shows us the economic reality for people at home is swaying them in his direction."

Prices are high for eggs, for milk, for gas. But the question is, who's going to make a difference on that? President Biden has an actual plan to reduce child care costs, to reduce housing costs, to take on the concentration of large grocery stores, to reduce the price of eggs and milk. And the question is, what is President Trump's plan? What is he actually going to do to lower inflation? That should be the argument."

So President Biden has fought to get that back down. There is improvement. But people are still looking at their grocery bills now compared to, you know, three and a half years ago. They're 20 percent higher. And that's a conversation that it seems isn't getting fully fleshed out because people worry that the next time they get to fill up their car or get groceries, they're, you know, they're not seeing improvement. What they're seeing is three and a half years versus the previous four."

There was bipartisan spending under both presidents. And much of a good that led to the vaccines that led to America, having the record lowest unemployment in the world that has led to America having the best recovery from inflation in the Western world. And so the question now is, how do we continue to get inflation down? And what are we going to do on housing and childcare on taking on monopolies? The president has a clear vision. And I guess what I would love to see for President Trump is, what is he going to do in the future? How is he going to get prices down?"

Now an influential cohort of billionaires and quasi-billionaires are getting ready to write checks for 45.\" Also \"Axios\" quoting tech investor, David Sacks, says, \"I have -- I'd say at this point, bigger disagreements with Biden than with Trump.\" He, by the way, is supposed to host a big dollar fundraiser in Silicon Valley this week for President Trump.

And that's what this convening was. I still believe that 70, 80 -- to 80 percent of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are for President Biden. But you're right. It's not 95 or 100 percent.

And the Ronald Reagan Institute Director, Roger Zakheim. Great to have all of you here with us. There's a lot to pick apart in that piece. But let's start about -- talking about the Larry Hogan situation because he tweeted out that people should respect the legal process and the verdict and immediately got slammed by a Trump campaign official who said, your campaign's over. Roger, they know that if they want to try to pick up that seat, Larry Hogan's going to have to be as independent and broadly appealing as he can be."

Because right now, Republicans have eight pickup opportunities, nine if you can't, Larry Hogan, which was no one had -- no one had Larry Hogan on this -- on their dance card as he pointed out Maryland on their dance card. But in the next two cycles, there are no nobody running in red and state. And Biden's Republican -- pickup opportunities in Biden's states, states that Biden lost.

I think a lot of those Democratic incumbents, in fact, are looking at abortion as an issue, are looking at corporate excesses as an issue. China. They are -- those got -- those Senate -- Democratic Senate candidates see Trump as divisive as we just discussed in Maryland. It's a problem for Hogan. But in terms of the general stuff, you would think with any ordinary politician, Shannon, a conviction, a felon -- 34 felony convictions. People will be saying, maybe we should remove this guy from the ballot going into the Republican Convention. We're not seeing any of that. But that's not even a point of discussion. Republicans are standing strong behind Donald Trump. He is their hero. And I mean, you know, it's now a civil conviction on business fraud. Convicted. He lost the defamation case for sexual assault. And now the 34. So the reality is, for Democrats, you have a different set of incentives. And the different set of incentives for the Democrats is that the verdict brings them together. I don't know how many Democrats said to me this week. Wow. Finally, finally. You know, this -- all the lies, the bullying, finally, he got caught. Finally, someone held this man accountable. They're energized on the other side of the equation. Up in the air, you know, the people who've been voting for Haley and Democratic primaries, the kind of swing voters.

And I think that was probably a smart move because we know that when voters are going to the polls, they're not thinking about Trump's trial. They're not thinking about Hunter Biden's trial. They're thinking about inflation, the situation of their pocketbook. Even foreign policy, to some extent. This just isn't on their radar in the same type of way.

But I think it would behoove the Biden campaign, and also the Trump campaign, it's a little more difficult for the Trump campaign because Trump is the center of this, but to focus - you know, to campaign and talk about the economy, to really create that split screen.
