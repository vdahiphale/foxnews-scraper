He will also update us on North Korea talks as Secretary of State Pompeo just landing there for a second visit. Plus, in another angle exclusive, the Israeli ambassador to the United States tells us what the end of the Iran deal means for his country and the entire Middle East. We are also watching important primary races around the country tonight. We are going to take you to Fox election headquarters when the results come in. And did the met gala in New York salute religion or mock it? Raymond Arroyo will tell us in our \"Seen and Unseen segment\" and Joe Piscopo is here to talk \"Saturday Night Live\" bias in the dearth of comedy. But first, when #metoo becomes he too. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Just a few hours after the New Yorker broke its story charging New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman with abusing four women, he resigned his office.

The U.S. government's most recent report card found that only 18 percent of eighth graders scored proficient or better in knowledge of U.S. history, 29 percent had less than basic knowledge. A survey in February found two- thirds of American millennials could not identify Auschwitz, 22 percent hadn't heard of the holocaust. This isn't a small issue.

He will also update us on North Korea talks as Secretary of State Pompeo just landing there for a second visit. Plus, in another angle exclusive, the Israeli ambassador to the United States tells us what the end of the Iran deal means for his country and the entire Middle East. We are also watching important primary races around the country tonight. We are going to take you to Fox election headquarters when the results come in. And did the met gala in New York salute religion or mock it? Raymond Arroyo will tell us in our \"Seen and Unseen segment\" and Joe Piscopo is here to talk \"Saturday Night Live\" bias in the dearth of comedy. But first, when #metoo becomes he too. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Just a few hours after the New Yorker broke its story charging New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman with abusing four women, he resigned his office. Now isn't it rich that he set himself up as the hero of the #metoo movement by using his office to sue Harvey Weinstein?"

I've got to say, he did like to dress up apparently, so maybe this superhero thing does work. Well, Schneiderman tries to explain away the charges against him this way, he said, \"In the privacy of intimate relationships I've engaged in role- playing and other consensual activity. I have not assaulted anyone.\" Superman didn't beat the hell out of Lois Lane, Eric. Four women romantically involved allege that Schneiderman abused them, including claims that he smacked, spit on, choked, and demeaned his victims. What a guy. He threatened to tap their phones or have someone follow or even kill them if they attempted to leave the relationship. As New York's highest-ranking law enforcement official this is the guy who attended the Women's March alone, by the way, with Harvey Weinstein. And he would later use his prosecutorial authority against Weinstein and fought to get his victims greater compensation. It was Eric, thank you, thank you, thank you. As his profile rose as a leader of women in the wake of the \"Me Too Movement,\" his victims were persuaded somehow to come forward. But they met their own resistance from the left."

Take one for the team. What's a little collateral damage, right? It reminds me of how Harvey skated for so many years. Sure, he had money and he had power to make or break a career, but he also had the right political views. He had the coolest friends and all those politicians he raised millions for, valuable commodity. But back to Schneiderman. Most of them knew or should have known about his history, a lot of the Democrats, people were championing him. A lot of the allegations against him. But they kept on their blinders, again, how convenient. If this were a Republican, he would be decried on every cable show with barely a break for breaking news on the Iran deal.

How about is this a tipping point for the left and the people who claim to be protecting America's women or is slapping, choking, spitting, making women of color call him master acceptable behavior? Well, until it's discovered. White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway certainly reached her tipping point yesterday. She nailed Schneiderman's hypocrisy when she tweeted out, \"gotcha\" above a Schneiderman tweet where he wrote no one is above the law and I will continue to remind President Trump and his administration of that every day. Instead of acknowledging Schneiderman's loathsome and perhaps even criminal behavior, Planned Parenthood action, that's the political arm of the abortion giant decided to go after, wait for it, Kellyanne. They tweeted out, \"Kellyanne, delete your account.\" OK. What all this tells us is what so many of us have thought really for a long time. The left, while claiming to be the true honest champions of women at many times at many points consider them to be disposable, especially when they become politically inconvenient. Eric Schneiderman was a stalwart political ally of the left, but he's out of the picture now, so move on, quickly, move on. And it's back to vilifying Trump and any woman who supports his agenda. Are any of you fed up with this rank hypocrisy? We too. And that's \"The Angle.\" Joining us now for reaction is Harmeet Dhillon, an attorney and RNC committeewoman in California along with Monica Crowley from the London Center for Policy Research. OK. We have so much news to get to, Ladies. Let's start right here. The resistance loved Schneiderman because he represented for them this kind of superhero. You saw that Samantha Bee absurd little cartoon skid that you try to scrub off of her website until someone grabbed it first. He was a hero and then when he was exposed, literally and figuratively, they kind of brushed that aside and quickly move on. We get rid of people fast and you Republicans, you defend Donald Trump.

For example, Senator Al franken from a reliably Democratic state, Minnesota. If, for whatever reason, his seat was somehow in play for a Republican they would have fought tooth and nail to preserve the guy. I mean, that kind of argument really doesn't hold a lot of water. The Democratic Party now for decades has protected men who have advanced the left-wing agenda and in particular the pro-abortion. You go back to Ted Kennedy, who actually kills a woman and yet when he died he was praised as a lion of the Senate and a real champion for women. Same thing with Bill Clinton until just recently. It is a remarkable thing that the Democrats for so many years have said we embrace humanity in the abstract, but when it comes to actual individuals, actual people and actual women, they tend -- not everybody, I don't mean to make a sweeping generalization here, but some of their most high-profile men that they have celebrated have abused and assaulted women who have been closest to them."

The big difference between a consensual relationship in a private settlement versus sexual assault and violence as multiple Democrats have been accused of as Monica mentioned. The fact that this guy was forced to resign within three hours, you know what that tells me? It tells me that Democrats knew. Democrats were silent. They did not have any qualms about rushing to judgment because he's been doing this for eight years. The fifth woman came out today in \"The New York Post\" and told a story about a story in 2010 when he drove drunk, slapped her, choked her, demeaned her, et cetera. Don't tell me for a minute that Democrats close to this guy didn't know, his staff knew. Staff transportation was used sometimes with these women and his staff was used to deny the story to the New Yorker. They should be looking in the mirror today. The reason that Democrats quickly got rid of him in the evening was to hope that there wasn't going to be a news cycle around this today, but we do need to talk about it. We need to talk about the fact that this man was allowed to get away with this for so many years, that he was hiding in plain sight with all the statements. There were a lot of people, (inaudible) one of the famous people mentioned in the story who know about this because he dated one of the women who was abused by this guy. All of these people kept silent because of the greater good, the moral relativism."

When you have a politician running for high office who professes to be a champion of family values, essentially a choir boy and then they are caught in something like this, the whole thing blows up. Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, they never professed to be a choir boy. Neither did Eric Schneiderman, but the difference with him is he was the chief law enforcement officer of the state of New York. He was the attorney general, very close to the governor, obviously wanted higher office. This is the man whose hypocrisy came in a different form. He was attacking Donald Trump in a whole range of ways. He was attacking Harvey Weinstein and using his legal authority as attorney general to go after these men. Properly so, but you know what? Those who shout the loudest are often the ones with the biggest skeletons in their closet and that's the problem with Eric Schneiderman."

The real reason the left loves Schneiderman is they thought his neck he would take Donald Trump. Eric Schneiderman is gone but the New York legal resistance to Trump will go on. They think this new acting Attorney General Barbara Underwood would be a breakthrough attorney general if she received the permanent nomination from I guess the governor appoints her, Harmeet. She has argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court. She clerked for Thurgood Marshall. She's a reliably liberal. These cases against the president will go on. Some people think on legal blogs that I was reading, all of it should be considered fruit of the poisonous tree in a way because of this tainted figure who was running these investigations and running these prosecutions. But the cases against Trump and I think treating Trump as the big nemesis and maybe you can take some of the Mueller investigation under New York jurisdiction, so he couldn't fire anybody.

There are Democrats who opposed Trump around the country, but they haven't been as vicious and personal as Eric Schneiderman and I have to think that the skeleton in his closet is one reason why he couldn't come to terms that he's that person and he sort of focused it on Donald Trump instead. A lot of even liberal commentators have pointed out that a lot of his anti- Trump legal actions have been sort of a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.

Here with answers, New York Times bestselling author and FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo. Now, we are just spoil sports here, because honestly, as Cardinal Dolan said in New York, there's nothing offensive here about this, Raymond. I'm sure if they did a gala representing the Prophet Mohammed in curious ways everybody would be celebrating it over at CAIR tonight, right?"

There were other fashion, these designers created other items including a bondage mask with rosaries on it. You can't see it, it's on the righthand side there. And look at this other thing.

I grew up watching all the greats, Jane Curtin and Phil Hartman, Eddie Murphy. This is comedy to end all comedy. Your era of the show was great. Now it's so political that I think it turns a lot of people off. And then this weekend reality hits comedy I guess and Stormy shows up.

I'm on the radio every morning, I'm going to bed now, I've got to get up in a couple of hours on AM 970. And the one thing we always say. We say what we want, I don't care about the political correctness, the people don't care about Stormy Daniels. We don't care about Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. I don't care about LBJ.

You've got to laugh a little bit, and I would suggest, and I've said this before, when I did Ronald Reagan and we took shots at Ronald Reagan, we did it with respect. But what did they do? And I said this before on the network here, Laura, Ronald Reagan invited me to the White House. And then when I met the great gipper and I shook hands with his great man, it changed my life. It changed my whole political outlook. You know what I'm saying? I'm saying everybody has got to lighten up. Donald Trump should invite Alec to the White House. Everybody has to stop the hate.

But how many public school students, private school students for that matter, learned about this historic sacrifice that the day represents, one of the most important days in American history? The answer, sadly, is not many. The U.S. government's most recent report card found that only 18 percent of eighth graders scored proficient or better in knowledge of U.S. history, 29 percent had less than basic knowledge. A survey in February found two- thirds of American millennials could not identify Auschwitz, 22 percent hadn't heard of the holocaust. This isn't a small issue. Either we learn history, our nation's founding, our constitution, or my goodness, about the mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them. Remember to tweet me your thoughts @IngrahamAngle about the show. Things you want us to cover on the show, or just criticisms of Raymond. That's all the time we have tonight.
