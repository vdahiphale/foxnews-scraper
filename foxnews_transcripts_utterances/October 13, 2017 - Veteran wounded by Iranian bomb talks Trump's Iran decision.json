We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of Iran's nuclear breakout. That is why I'm directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons. In the event, we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The original report was that he took -- Mr. Campos took fire at 21:59, 9:59. And then there was a six- minute delay between that time and the firing on the mass shooting. So in essence, what the sheriff said today was that 9:59 wasn't when he was shot, but when he first encountered because Paddock had blockaded a door that led to the 32nd floor. That radio communication was what he is referring to. It's not when he was shot. When he got up to that 32nd floor, that's when he was shot. And then apparently, that's when the mass shooting took place. So, in essence, the MGM's timeline is the accurate one, the 21:59, 9:59 is not accurate. That's from a radio -- that's when he radioed that he had encountered the barricaded door. But here is something that wasn't mentioned, Martha, and this is something that should have been mentioned. That there was a maintenance worker who also reported that there was a man with a rifle firing shots. That hasn't been address. What time was that? That's really critical information.

So it also moves up the timeline in terms of the shooting coming out into the hallway, and then it seems like 40 seconds later, which is the timeline that MGM put out, he just turned around and started firing out those windows.

That is why I'm directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons. In the event, we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated."

The president's stepping out sort of off of the -- out of the shallow end of the pool and getting into what could be potentially the most consequential questions that his administration has faced. Not just on Iran, yes, of course, but also on the question about health insurance. He dove all the way into the deep end of the pool on this one by saying that the people who basically were victimized by ObamaCare one time in the sense that they were given health insurance but put in a fairly precarious position in these exchanges that don't work that the president said we're taking your subsidies away. So, he has got to figure out -- so, he is taking these steps forward."

What are they going to do now?"

And you know, obviously, throughout the course of the campaign, this was the structure of it, this was the substance of it that he would deconstruct the things that President Obama had put in place -- the Iran deal primary, the healthcare arrangement primary as well. So, as you say, now he's got to implement these things. He's taken executive privilege. He's done the actions that he can do. Because he feels hemmed in, Chris, there's no doubt, by what Congress has been able to do and all of the advice that he's been given against pulling out of this Iran deal in any way, shape or form. He's saying these are the things that I can do on my highway. How will he succeed?"

In the case of Trump on this, so he says OK, we're going to take in both cases what could be considered something of a middle course. We don't know how things are going to work out for the health insurance. He's really trying to force Democrats to the negotiating table by making them willing to believe that he really might do this to the people who are going to lose their health insurance. That he might be OK with using them in this way. With Iran, he has to convince the Mullahs that he is willing to blow up the whole thing and risk a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and all of that because he's not satisfied with the deal. OK, you got him at the table, now, can you deliver? Now can you deliver? Is the art of the deal a book, just a book on a shelf, or is it really something that he can make good on? He's taking some really big risks in getting us to this point, and really, the teeth and health of the nation and the world in some part hang in the balance."

President Trump did remove the subsidies which were not authorized by Congress. And here again, and let me just note, I'm amazed by the fact when you speak the truth in this town sometimes it's controversial. The president has rightly called out the Iranians both on the history of their bad acts. Look, I faced off against them. I ran operatives, IRGC in 2003. It's in my book \"Operation: Dark Heart,\" as well as, Martha, pointing out the fact that they have failed to meet their obligations within the framework of the agreement. The Pentagon, I got from my sources, the Pentagon three months ago, they were not complying. So, simply put, the president, I think, has outlined a very strong both policy, the well-reasoned arc of why we had to step a back, why he's not certifying the deal. And frankly, talking about what we need to do to now push them into some level of compliance is not doing the bad acts against the neighbors, and frankly, tried to kill American citizens."

And I'm sitting there, sitting in a seat, and I'm sitting between two ladies. One lady was visiting, younger girl, she was visiting from Sweden and this other lady was next to me. And you could see that she was Middle Eastern descent. And so, I, of course, you know, I'm a single guy, started talking to the one on my right. When I should have been talking to the lady on my left. Because by the time the plane landed, I talked to her and she was an Iranian born American, and now a professor at ASU in the math department. And she had actually said to me, she said she loves this country and she was willing to die for it. And then, you know, six months later, I'd be hit by an Iranian bomb. So, when I heard the president talk about the good Iranians that are there and it's not just -- it's not grouping them all into one, it's the regime."

Late last night, the White House announced that it will scrap seven billion dollars of ObamaCare government subsidies that go to insurance companies to help them cover people who can't pay. Democrats immediately sounded the alarm with the help of some in the media, despite the fact that those same members of Congress never approved spending this money in the first place at a federal court ruled that those subsidies are illegal. It is simply not the way that we allocate taxpayer funds, they have to go through a process and be approved by Congress. But the response has been largely ignoring that fact. This is The Washington Post article; it took them nine paragraphs to get to that point. And in this New York Times article, 11 paragraphs down. They talk about the fact that these were illegal, these subsidies. So, how can members be outraged at something that they never authorized? Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry joins us now from the White House with more. Hi, Ed."

Let's get to the point in the first graph this time, which is that President Trump is deeply frustrated with his fellow Republicans for failing to repeal and replace ObamaCare. But also, with Democrats because he believes they haven't come to the table to try and meet with him, meet him halfway on drastic fixes to ObamaCare. So, what he's saying is he is going to dismantle this law piece by piece. First, yesterday, we saw this executive order he signed to try and sell insurance across state lines and have other fixes. Today, he spoke to reporters and said he's going much further. Ending these subsidy payments to insurance companies because he believes they're nothing more than a sweetheart deal for these big companies trying to adopt some of that Steve Bannon style drain the swamp rhetoric to rally his base and suggest it's time just to blow up ObamaCare altogether. What democratic critics like Schumer are saying is what the president is really doing is sabotaging the law, and that these cuts of billions of dollars will hurt the poor and the vulnerable and result in more people being uninsured. Left out of the attacks though, as you noted, is the fact that Congress never actually codified these payments. In fact, speaker Paul Ryan today backing up the president by saying the power of the purse belongs to Congress, not the executive branch whether it's Obama or Trump administration. So, the president, making the case this is a giveaway to insurance companies while Democrats are warning by doing this, the president and Republicans will now own the problems to ObamaCare."

They said, you know, you try to provide healthcare for everyone, it's going to cost us a fortune. So, the Obama administration engaged with them. They got together and came with this deal, where there would be these subsidies that the insurance companies would get to help them cover the cost.

You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone in Hollywood who doesn't think the scandal of rampant sexual harassment, assault, and rape has a long way to run yet and will implicate many more powerful men before it is over. One of the latest to be accused Roy Price, head of the increasingly powerful Amazon Studios. He was put on an immediate leave of absence after two separate allegations. One claimed that he sexually harassed a producer and another from actress Rose McGowan that when she told him, she had been raped by Harvey Weinstein he dismissed her claims outright. In a series of tweets, McGowan called out Amazon Head, Jeff Bezos, and criticized Amazon for working with the Weinstein Company. Amazon responded with the action against Price and in a statement said, \"We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with the Weinstein Company.\" Meantime, the NBC network continues to face questions about its ties to Harvey Weinstein, and whether the network was reluctant to air, reporter Ronan Farrow's investigation of Weinstein. He eventually published the details including three allegations of rape in the New Yorker. And via our corporate cousins tonight at the Wall Street Journal, we're hearing the Weinstein Company is exploring options for a complete sale or breakup. As for Harvey Weinstein last night, he was spotted dining at a restaurant near the five star resort in Arizona where he's staying. He's so far, apparently, refused to go to rehab because he can't take his cell phone with him. Also worth remembering that on Wednesday, when TMZ cameras found Weinstein here in Hollywood, Martha, he admitted he needed help, said he's not doing OK. But ended his comments railing against those he considers disloyal and saying he is, quote, a good guy. Long way to go for that rehab, Martha."

Great to have you both with us tonight. You know, this sort of Hollywood symbiosis with the Democratic Party is something that people have been looking at.

You know, I don't think it was like this in the 40's and 50's and the good old golden age of Hollywood, but there's like a holier than thou, and yet they are reluctant it seems to sort of turn this same kind of judgment on -- against a man that they obviously all, many, many of them knew was violating and committing violent acts potentially against women."

      "utterance": "Right. Hollywood is not the only industry where you have these problems. But I do think it is uniquely bad situation because of the amount of money and the amount of power that's in play. But one of the more disappointing things to come out of this is finding out how many people did know and didn't have the courage to speak publicly, thereby allowing more and more women to be harmed by this particular individual, but also that it's not just Harvey Weinstein. It is so much bigger than that. And there are so many more stories that the people have been trying to tell in recent years, and just seeing that journalist and actors and all sorts of people with ties to this industry have let this go on and have not been good citizens helping their fellow men and women who've been persecuted by these men who take advantage of their power."

The party that now has to distance itself from celebrity spokespeople who are content to lecture the rest of the country about their religion, their guns, or their politics, but who couldn't seem to bring themselves to clean up their own house by calling out one of their closest friends and business colleagues for preying upon vulnerable young women for years. Your thoughts?"

I don't think that this hurts Jane Fonda or Meryl Streep or Glen Close. I think it hurts the industry overall. I think that we're going to be having these incredibly important discussions. I know that, certainly, in liberal circles these are going on not just what donation money has to go back but how can we really change this. Judd Apatow speaking out on it. George Clooney --"

So are people pulling away from a Harvey Weinstein? Yes, absolutely. Are they taking a closer look at people? But I think as an industry, as a whole, no, I don't think that will ever be divorced in this way. I think that the values the Democratic Party values, which a lot of people like to joke now in light of the Harvey Weinstein debacle, that our values about treating women in this way, which is not the case whatsoever. But, you know, equality and social justices and things like that. Those are the parties the Democratic Party values and the values of Hollywood. And I think those will reign in sync."

You know, some of the allegations throughout there actually involve assaults against children. I mean, last year, Corey Feldman talked about how Corey Haim was rape as an 11-year-old. He himself said he was rape by a man -- or was assaulted by a man on set, an adult man. And he says he can't talk about it because of statutes of limitations. We need to help these people get their stories out and really make sure that people aren't hurting people more."

Through investigation, we have determined that Mr. Campos had encountered the barricaded door adjacent to the suspect's door at approximately 21:59. In his attempt to gain entry to the 32nd floor, it required him to ascend to another level and eventually make access to the 32nd floor. When you culminate that time line associated from the initial 21:59 to the 22:05, timeline that we're still stand by as the initial volley of fire, Mr. Campos received his wounds in close proximity to 22:05. There is no conspiracy between the FBI, between LVPD, and the MGM. Nobody is attempting to hide anything."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, I watched Sheriff Lombardo. We watched him throughout the course of this entire tragedy and the massacre that happened in Las Vegas. It is so clear today that he feels so deeply offended by the suggestion that there was any delay on the part of the Las Vegas police department. What did you take away from that news conference this afternoon?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "utterance": "Well, a couple different things. One is that on the timeline that was so critical, the six minutes that were, you know, we were talking about, he actually did contradict himself. The original report was that he took -- Mr. Campos took fire at 21:59, 9:59. And then there was a six- minute delay between that time and the firing on the mass shooting. So in essence, what the sheriff said today was that 9:59 wasn't when he was shot, but when he first encountered because Paddock had blockaded a door that led to the 32nd floor. That radio communication was what he is referring to. It's not when he was shot. When he got up to that 32nd floor, that's when he was shot. And then apparently, that's when the mass shooting took place. So, in essence, the MGM's timeline is the accurate one, the 21:59, 9:59 is not accurate. That's from a radio -- that's when he radioed that he had encountered the barricaded door. But here is something that wasn't mentioned, Martha, and this is something that should have been mentioned. That there was a maintenance worker who also reported that there was a man with a rifle firing shots. That hasn't been address. What time was that? That's really critical information. And it wasn't addressed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, you're right. And, you know, you would make the assumption but, of course, assuming anything is very tricky in these circumstances that when he came out of the door and started firing at Jesus Campos, that is when this other worker heard the gunfire because you can hear Campos and the maintenance worker as he's telling him to get down, to move out of the way. So it also moves up the timeline in terms of the shooting coming out into the hallway, and then it seems like 40 seconds later, which is the timeline that MGM put out, he just turned around and started firing out those windows. But it may have triggered him to move more quickly in the shooting of the concert than he had originally planned, no?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "utterance": "It's very possible. We don't know what he originally planned as far as, you know, he clearly had to be done within a very short proximity because it was the last act of the show. So that's --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "There was some speculation by Mark Fuhrman that he might have wanted to wait until the lights came up and the show was over, which is what we saw happen in Manchester --"

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "-- and it's possible that was (INAUDIBLE). I do want to get your thought on the fuel tanks because that's another thing that he confirmed this afternoon that the fuel tanks at the McCarran Airport were intentionally fired upon, your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And that's very disturbing, of course. This guy wanted to commit as much mayhem and murder as he possibly could. And I guess he figured out after he fired a couple rounds at the tanks and they didn't explode that that was a waste of time, which in essence it was because of the design of those tanks. But one thing I really want to impart here is what the sheriff said about the bravery of the metro law enforcement officers. It was exceedingly brave. What those officers encountered was something unprecedented in law enforcement history. And I know personally from some of my friends who were there and partook in this incredible tragedy that this was going to have a tremendous long lasting effect, and those men and women who responded did so with great professionalism --"

      "speaker": "PERKINS",

And why he has so much support now is that he has consistently kept the promises that he made during the presidential campaign. Promised to promote the sanctity of human life. Promised to defend and promote religious freedom. And he's been doing those systematically in his policies. And so, he continues to have enthusiastic support among social conservatives in this country."

And he has made some stellar nominations. His team has worked great to put some up there, and I think the point that probably is the most contentious here is that the senate has not been moving forward and people want the senate to get in line and get these things done because there's a sense that we have a narrow window to make it happen."

You know, the executive order he did in May. Last week, the guidance from the Department of Justice. That still has to be carried out in a third phase where there is specific guidance to given to the various federal agencies. Department of Defense has been horrible on this in the past administration. The Department of State has been promoting this stuff abroad, which is contrary to religious freedom. So there's still a lot of work to be done. And I think that's where we're saying, Mr. President, this is what needs to happen practically, and his administration is on it."
