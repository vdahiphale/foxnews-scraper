A federal district judge in Tampa has vacated Biden's CDC national mask mandate for planes and other modes of public transportation. We're going to have more on this monumental ruling, ruling for freedom in just a bit. But for now, sayonara sucker. We begin tonight with the old debate trap. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Now imagine asking Nick Saban to tolerate a game where all the referees are known to hate the Alabama football team. Now in fact, these referees have made public statements saying how much they despise the Crimson Tide. Well, that's pretty much has been the situation with Republican presidential candidates and the moderators chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates. And after years of conservatives urging the RNC saying please cut ties with this ridiculous organization on Friday, it finally did. Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement, we are going to find newer, better debate platforms to ensure that future nominees are not forced to go through the bias CPD in order to make the case to the American people. Now, the gnashing of teeth that you can imagine that followed was predictable.",

And as you can see from the way they treated old Romney and Gingrich and Santorum, so many others, this isn't limited to Trump. The notion that democracy somehow requires that conservative candidates submit to a horribly biased questioning every four years. That is ludicrous.

Not to say otherwise looking at these fools, laughable. The press shouldn't complain though. They have only themselves to blame. Had they actually made the effort to call balls and strikes to report the truth about the results of both Democrat and Republican policies, on domestic and foreign affairs? Then most Americans would consider the debates important to preserve. Exciting, tough, but fair to both sides. Look at just the last few years, look at the press did. They sold the phony Russian collusion narrative. They buried Hunter's laptop, they silenced those who are actually reported on it. Then they pushed the destructive lockdowns and vilify those who question the lockdowns. They touted universal masking even of little kids. They sided with BLM at the same time covered for violent ANTIFA and anti-government protesters. And of course, can't forget this, they obsessed endlessly over January 6th, and then they downplayed inflation. And come on, they're still covering for China, we know that, even when they're starving, China is, tens of millions of their own people. So unfortunately, as we've seen in so many other areas of American life, the media lost its prestige and credibility long ago, just like the public health sector has lost the respect of a huge segment of the American people, just like the courts, just like the prosecutors, just like the Intel agencies, even the Pentagon, they've all become hyper partisan. But remember, they're supposed to work for us. But too often, it seems like they're working against us. And the ideals that made our country great. For many years, the GOP was run by the Bush's and the Cheney's and those folks have proven over and over, that they would rather lose to the Democrats than actually do what the Republican voters want. So, I think they were kind of happy to live with a bias press corps, because they hated their own voters more than they feared the Left. Even Romney who was treated horribly in 2012, you just saw that clip, he was happy to go down quietly, rather than rock the bipartisan establishment vote. But my friends, those days are over. Republicans have new leaders now. Leaders who actually think we're right and that giving power to the hard Left is bad for America. So, the GOP is finally, finally beginning to stand up for itself. And the country as a result will be better off. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Ronna McDaniel, Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee as well as Mike Huckabee, man who stood on that Dyess that stage as a presidential candidate, former Arkansas Governor.

Rule one of politics, Laura never help load a gun if it's pointed at your own head. And every one of these debates have basically been asking Republican candidates for President to help load the gun that was pointed at their own heads. And it's insane. And I'm glad that it's going to stop. There are a lot of things that we can do to improve this process. The first one is, who needs a moderator, you only need a clock keeper, give everybody exactly the same amount of time, don't let the networks for their own purposes of getting ratings decide who gets the most time, give everybody exactly the same amount of time, put it on a clock and when their time is finished. It's over. They're mics cut off. That's one way that would improve it a lot. And I've got a lot of other things that could do it. But the big step has been done today.

You know that this, the finding by the CIA, is quite telling because we know that the law firm Perkins Coie had two of the critical figures here, Sussmann, who's under indictment and the General Counsel of the campaign, Mark Elias. Mark Elias is the figure most associated with the Steele dossier. And the campaign was just sanctioned by the FEC after they hid the funding of the Steele dossier as legal costs at that firm.

If we had a true labor shortage, wages would be rising faster than inflation. Instead, it's the other way around. Well, that doesn't seem like a very difficult economic concept. But apparently it's in some corners to be the case. Now, it should also be noted that the results of a true labor shortage, wages rising faster than inflation is what we had under President Trump. And that's what most of us think of as prosperity. And the other editorial, the journal claims that we could fight inflation and help Ukraine by eliminating tariffs. Well, first off, the tariffs were in place in 2019. And we did not have inflation. So, it makes no sense to say that that's what's causing inflation now. Second, making China richer and more powerful and causing our supply chains to depend more on the CCP. That's not going to help Ukraine. It will hurt Ukraine since China is supporting Russia behind the scenes. Now many Republicans have stopped listening to media outlets that don't seem to reflect the reality on the ground. These two editorials may provide an explanation as to why that is happening. Look, we all have to grapple with what's happening, the real thing that's happening on planet Earth, and at some point leave the old libertarian idealism of the past behind. Most Americans are not pro-China. They're not pro-open borders. They don't want unlimited trade with China, even if many on Wall Street still want that. Now, something interesting caught our eye this morning, the Washington Post released their 2024 Democratic presidential power rankings. Now think about that. Just 15 months into his first term. OK, into Biden's first term and an influential liberal publication finds Biden's performance so troubling that it's already handicapping a potential successor. Now, they were kind enough to put Joe on the top of the list. That's just to be nice, but that's not the most interesting part. His natural successor of course, is the Vice President Kamala Harris. But she is in third place behind Wonder boy Mayor Pete. Now someone who shared the debate stage of the Democratic debate stage with these three Democrats. We just mentioned, of course 2020, presidential candidate former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi, first there seems to be this palpable concern, not just among the downs, but all their media boosters, about Biden and Harris. So, they're leapfrogging kind of both to go right to Wonder Boy, what do you think about this? TULSI GABBARD, FORMER 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Laura, well, first of all, this Washington Post article is just another example of how the mainstream media is essentially the propaganda arm of the Democratic Party elite. It doesn't really matter, kind of how they're ranking these people because ultimately we know that they'll never nominate anybody or promote anybody who you know believes in and supports the Constitution or Bill of Rights. They'll never nominate anybody who doesn't toe the line. Their woke cancel cultural, pushing their policies, things like taking away parents' rights, making sure that they have open borders and canceling our free speech as Americans. They will never nominate anybody who doesn't bow to the interests of the military industrial complex. So you mentioned we're 15 months into this administration. We're going to keep seeing more articles like this from the mainstream media as they push different candidates or promote people that they like. And we've just got to know, every time we see this, this is propaganda coming from the Democratic Party elite.",

Now in fact, these referees have made public statements saying how much they despise the Crimson Tide. Well, that's pretty much has been the situation with Republican presidential candidates and the moderators chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates. And after years of conservatives urging the RNC saying please cut ties with this ridiculous organization on Friday, it finally did. Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement, we are going to find newer, better debate platforms to ensure that future nominees are not forced to go through the bias CPD in order to make the case to the American people.

Steve Scalia was caught seeking advice from the mooch, remember that, who'd become a Never Trumper when his direct message was mistakenly put out as a tweet. Of course, Trump called him out and he ended up being right. Now I can go on and on, but why bother? We all know that these so-called journalists, well, I mean how they feel about conservatives. And as you can see from the way they treated old Romney and Gingrich and Santorum, so many others, this isn't limited to Trump. The notion that democracy somehow requires that conservative candidates submit to a horribly biased questioning every four years. That is ludicrous. Unless democracy of course, was meaningless back in 1858, when Lincoln faced off against Douglas in one of the most storied debates in U.S. political history, with no moderators and no panelists. I'd say the American people learned a lot more just by reading exactly what the candidates said back then. Now the modern day candidate concept didn't really begin till 1960, when for the first time in history, the debate between two major presidential candidates, back then John F. Kennedy and Nixon was televised. Remember, people who listened on the radio thought that Nixon had won. But on camera, it was the opposite. Kennedy looked really cool and polished, Nixon looked kind of sweaty and a little bit shifty. After that, there was a debate lull for 16 years. It picked back up in 1976. But by 2012, it was beyond obvious that the moderators were dead set against whoever the Republicans nominated. Obama was their Lord and Savior, and he had to be venerated and protected at all costs. The bias then worsened over the next few presidential cycles in 2016, the commentariat hated Trump so much, that there were serious demands by supposedly respected media figures that the press had a duty not to be objective when covering Trump."

Not to say otherwise looking at these fools, laughable. The press shouldn't complain though. They have only themselves to blame. Had they actually made the effort to call balls and strikes to report the truth about the results of both Democrat and Republican policies, on domestic and foreign affairs? Then most Americans would consider the debates important to preserve. Exciting, tough, but fair to both sides. Look at just the last few years, look at the press did. They sold the phony Russian collusion narrative. They buried Hunter's laptop, they silenced those who are actually reported on it. Then they pushed the destructive lockdowns and vilify those who question the lockdowns. They touted universal masking even of little kids. They sided with BLM at the same time covered for violent ANTIFA and anti-government protesters. And of course, can't forget this, they obsessed endlessly over January 6th, and then they downplayed inflation. And come on, they're still covering for China, we know that, even when they're starving, China is, tens of millions of their own people. So unfortunately, as we've seen in so many other areas of American life, the media lost its prestige and credibility long ago, just like the public health sector has lost the respect of a huge segment of the American people, just like the courts, just like the prosecutors, just like the Intel agencies, even the Pentagon, they've all become hyper partisan. But remember, they're supposed to work for us. But too often, it seems like they're working against us. And the ideals that made our country great. For many years, the GOP was run by the Bush's and the Cheney's and those folks have proven over and over, that they would rather lose to the Democrats than actually do what the Republican voters want. So, I think they were kind of happy to live with a bias press corps, because they hated their own voters more than they feared the Left. Even Romney who was treated horribly in 2012, you just saw that clip, he was happy to go down quietly, rather than rock the bipartisan establishment vote. But my friends, those days are over. Republicans have new leaders now. Leaders who actually think we're right and that giving power to the hard Left is bad for America. So, the GOP is finally, finally beginning to stand up for itself. And the country as a result will be better off. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Ronna McDaniel, Chairwoman of the Republican National Committee as well as Mike Huckabee, man who stood on that Dyess that stage as a presidential candidate, former Arkansas Governor.

Rule one of politics, Laura never help load a gun if it's pointed at your own head. And every one of these debates have basically been asking Republican candidates for President to help load the gun that was pointed at their own heads. And it's insane. And I'm glad that it's going to stop. There are a lot of things that we can do to improve this process. The first one is, who needs a moderator, you only need a clock keeper, give everybody exactly the same amount of time, don't let the networks for their own purposes of getting ratings decide who gets the most time, give everybody exactly the same amount of time, put it on a clock and when their time is finished. It's over. They're mics cut off. That's one way that would improve it a lot. And I've got a lot of other things that could do it. But the big step has been done today.

So, we just said to them, we don't need you. We can negotiate on our own. We're removing the middleman and we're removing the bias. And we're going to put it in the hands of the American people and Republican voters and make sure that our nominees given a fair platform, because if we're given a free and fair debate, we're going to win. And thank you, Governor Huckabee, for your great suggestions. I look forward to talking to you more, because we're going to use those as we go forward. But we are absolutely committed to debates.

But that's the way to do it. But Governor, they are so afraid of this. And I want to put this on the screen for everyone to see.

Let's cancel them forever. They didn't want any of this. And now suddenly, how can you do this, democracy is over. We had salon, we had Vox. The list goes on and on New Republic.

People forget that the purpose of the debates, particularly in the primaries is not to give the network's high ratings for a TV show. The purpose is to let the voters of that particular party hear their candidates and make the decision, it's the party's primary, not the network's primary. The party ought to take total control of it. They ought to control every aspect of it, where it's held. Who gets to broadcast it? Who gets to ask questions, if there are questions, maybe don't have questions, maybe just let each candidate make statements and react to each other? But they have the same amount of time, quit having an A and a B, the so-called kiddies table, that's insulting. It's also destructive. But keep in mind more than anything else, we've got to educate the American voter that the purpose of these debates is to give them the voters the opportunity to hear about what the candidates think, Laura, I can't tell you how many times a reporter or a questioner on the debate stage would ask me a question would spend two minutes asking the question and then say to me, OK, there's my two minute question. You've got 30 seconds to answer it. Are you kidding me? I'm running for president, you're not, I want to say, shut the heck up and let me have the two minutes, you take the 30 seconds."

In other words, it's phony. Durham also alleges that in February 2017, Sussmann provided an updated set of allegations including the Alfa Bank claims that additional allegations related to Trump to a second U.S. government agency that Fox News confirmed was indeed the CIA.

And so that has forced the hand of the Special Counsel who told the court why this is all important. And these are very important disclosures we haven't seen before. You know that this, the finding by the CIA, is quite telling because we know that the law firm Perkins Coie had two of the critical figures here, Sussmann, who's under indictment and the General Counsel of the campaign, Mark Elias. Mark Elias is the figure most associated with the Steele dossier. And the campaign was just sanctioned by the FEC after they hid the funding of the Steele dossier as legal costs at that firm.

If we had a true labor shortage, wages would be rising faster than inflation. Instead, it's the other way around. Well, that doesn't seem like a very difficult economic concept. But apparently it's in some corners to be the case. Now, it should also be noted that the results of a true labor shortage, wages rising faster than inflation is what we had under President Trump. And that's what most of us think of as prosperity. And the other editorial, the journal claims that we could fight inflation and help Ukraine by eliminating tariffs. Well, first off, the tariffs were in place in 2019. And we did not have inflation. So, it makes no sense to say that that's what's causing inflation now. Second, making China richer and more powerful and causing our supply chains to depend more on the CCP. That's not going to help Ukraine. It will hurt Ukraine since China is supporting Russia behind the scenes. Now many Republicans have stopped listening to media outlets that don't seem to reflect the reality on the ground. These two editorials may provide an explanation as to why that is happening. Look, we all have to grapple with what's happening, the real thing that's happening on planet Earth, and at some point leave the old libertarian idealism of the past behind. Most Americans are not pro-China. They're not pro-open borders. They don't want unlimited trade with China, even if many on Wall Street still want that. Now, something interesting caught our eye this morning, the Washington Post released their 2024 Democratic presidential power rankings. Now think about that. Just 15 months into his first term. OK, into Biden's first term and an influential liberal publication finds Biden's performance so troubling that it's already handicapping a potential successor. Now, they were kind enough to put Joe on the top of the list. That's just to be nice, but that's not the most interesting part. His natural successor of course, is the Vice President Kamala Harris. But she is in third place behind Wonder boy Mayor Pete. Now someone who shared the debate stage of the Democratic debate stage with these three Democrats. We just mentioned, of course 2020, presidential candidate former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi, first there seems to be this palpable concern, not just among the downs, but all their media boosters, about Biden and Harris. So, they're leapfrogging kind of both to go right to Wonder Boy, what do you think about this? TULSI GABBARD, FORMER 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Laura, well, first of all, this Washington Post article is just another example of how the mainstream media is essentially the propaganda arm of the Democratic Party elite. It doesn't really matter, kind of how they're ranking these people because ultimately we know that they'll never nominate anybody or promote anybody who you know believes in and supports the Constitution or Bill of Rights. They'll never nominate anybody who doesn't toe the line. Their woke cancel cultural, pushing their policies, things like taking away parents' rights, making sure that they have open borders and canceling our free speech as Americans. They will never nominate anybody who doesn't bow to the interests of the military industrial complex. So you mentioned we're 15 months into this administration. We're going to keep seeing more articles like this from the mainstream media as they push different candidates or promote people that they like. And we've just got to know, every time we see this, this is propaganda coming from the Democratic Party elite."

And that's why to hear them in the media so upset over the last few days about the Republicans finally pulling out of these obscene debates was just laughable. You got completely hosed in the debates, as I recall, and I think you said something at the time on stage, like hello, I'm here."

As you said, having been on that stage and hearing the rhetoric coming from the organizers and the mainstream media news channels they partner with, like, oh, this is going to be fair, this is unbiased, all the candidates will get an equal shot. That's B.S., Laura. I think on average in every that I participated in, usually they went two hours, maybe I got seven total minutes of talk time on there. And so to say that this is an unbiased service to the American people, upholding our democracy, it's nonsense. Really what it is is a political theater that's being organized by the propaganda arm of this permanent Washington establishment, the Democratic Party elite. And so good for the Republican Party for walking away. By the way, looking at the things the Republican Party was asking for, very reasonable request, very reasonable requests. And the fact that they rejected them kind of shows their hand about their bias."

Number one, Congress has not debated, the American people have not had their chance to say that this is what they want or they don't want. So they're defying the Constitution even putting this forward. Number two, how does it serve our interests as the United States? How does it serve our national security? It does not. It will undermine it. I think of my brothers and sisters in uniform who would be the ones whose lives that are put on the line in what would essentially kick off World War III and a direct challenge to nuclear armed Russia. Risking nuclear war, that is exactly what he's proposing, and everyone should be very clear-eyed as they hear this kind of rhetoric coming from Washington."

It's that Michelle Obama has been immune to impressions or satire throughout the entire eight years she was the first lady and continuing. So now you have an Academy Award winner who sees the mannerisms and the little ticks, and she exaggerates them, and it's an offensive act."

Lots of people online were attacking Viola Davis's makeup as well, her eyebrows. But early this is how Michelle Obama's eyebrows actually looked. Are we going to see it? Yes. So a big deal.

The officer repeatedly ordered him to let go of his taser, at one point demanding drop the taser. As with all of these incidents, it's a horrible tragedy.

We have liberals who have been telling African Americans for years that the only way that we can survive is dependence on government. The reality is America's not the home of systemic racism, Laura. It's the home of systemic opportunity. And the reason African Americans are waking up to the fact that Democrats have tried to keep us on the Democrat plantation for so long, it's really because of the legacy of Donald Trump. It was Donald Trump who provided the lowest unemployment rate for African Americans. And right now public safety is the order of the day, and the Democrats have no credibility because Kamala Harris and Joe Biden ran on lawlessness of defunding the police, and they had the full support of BLM, the \"black lying Marxists.\""

But liberals would have you believe that guns of the problem. Guns aren't the problem. The problem, Laura, is really fatherlessness in the homes. When you don't have fathers in the home, it creates all sorts of issues. And this violence that we see that liberals only answer to it is more government intrusion, bigger government, more taxes.
