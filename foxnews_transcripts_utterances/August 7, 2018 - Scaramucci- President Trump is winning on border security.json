Perhaps, because it does not involve President Trump and Russia, instead, it's all about China infiltrating the office of a very powerful Democrat in Diane Feinstein. It turns out her longtime staffer Russell Lowe who was a driver, as you said, and also liaison to the Asian-American community in California visited relatives overseas several years ago.

The source told the San Francisco Chronicle. He just thought it was some friend.\" Well not exactly. So, five years ago, FBI agents showed up at Feinstein's office in D.C. and revealed her staffer was under investigation for possibly spying for China. In fairness, it does not appear the driver actually revealed anything of major substance though, we still don't know all the details so the jury's out on that. But the contact with China was certainly serious enough that Feinstein forced the aide into retirement and tried to keep all this hush, hush until the Chronicle blew the lid off of it. And the president has been trying to keep the heat on ever since.

Just effing kill me, I want to die.\" When detectives later asked about the voices inside his head, Cruz claimed it was his evil side and blamed the voices for making him listen to evil music ordering him to kill animals and making him buy guns though he did admit that he bought the ar-15 assault rifle because it \"looked cool.\" When he was asked what the voices would tell him to do, he responded burn, kill, destroy. Police then tried to turn the tables telling Cruz that he was using the demon in his head as an excuse. Cruz responded quoting \"I'm not. I promise I don't like the demon. I don't like the demon.\" The 260-page transcript was released one week after a judge ruled that a redacted version could be made public. The redacted parts include Cruz's detailed confession and his plan to commit the worst school shooting in Florida history. In the unredacted part of the transcript, Cruz talks about occasionally doing drugs like marijuana and Xanax. he describes his failure with girls, the constant cutting of his own skin and how before the shooting he tried to kill himself with Advil but it only made him sick. The defense calls Cruz a damaged and broken human being and argued that releasing the transcript would unfairly sway at potential jurors. Defense attorneys could also use Cruz's claim of hearing voices to argue that he's not guilty by reason of insanity. But that would also mean proving he did not know right from wrong and legal experts say that's a reach. The Broward County schools also released what was supposed to be a redacted report on Cruz's troubled school years. But because of the mistake, the report was not blacked out and detailed his numerous run-ins with teachers and school administrators, including at least two failed efforts to get him help.

We will bring you those results live as soon as we get them. But first, our top story tonight. New reports that a Chinese spy infiltrated the offices of one of our nation's top Democrats are being swept under the rug. This says the left rails against President Trump trying to find some evidence of collusion with Russia. Yet, Senator Dianne Feinstein's former aide and driver allegedly committed espionage relaying political information to China's top intelligence agency while she was chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee here at home. But no one in her party seems to have a problem with this. President Trump thinks the hypocrisy needs more attention."

      "utterance": "Sandra, great to see you. It's the collusion story, the media does not want to cover obsessively. Perhaps, because it does not involve President Trump and Russia, instead, it's all about China infiltrating the office of a very powerful Democrat in Diane Feinstein. It turns out her longtime staffer Russell Lowe who was a driver, as you said, and also liaison to the Asian-American community in California visited relatives overseas several years ago. And became acquainted on the trip with someone who was connected to the People's Republic of China's Ministry of State Security. \"He didn't even know what was happening that he was being recruited. The source told the San Francisco Chronicle. He just thought it was some friend.\" Well not exactly. So, five years ago, FBI agents showed up at Feinstein's office in D.C. and revealed her staffer was under investigation for possibly spying for China. In fairness, it does not appear the driver actually revealed anything of major substance though, we still don't know all the details so the jury's out on that. But the contact with China was certainly serious enough that Feinstein forced the aide into retirement and tried to keep all this hush, hush until the Chronicle blew the lid off of it. And the president has been trying to keep the heat on ever since. Charging first on Twitter Friday night, and then, at a campaign rally Saturday in Ohio that Feinstein is the former chair of the Senate Intel panel. The president tweeted, \"Dianne is the person leading our nation on collusion with Russia, only done by Democrats. Will she now investigate herself?\" Well, then at the rally, he noted that despite all the focus on Russia, there are many countries spying on us."

Hey, we're doing well with North Korea but they're probably there. We got to stop everybody, we got to stop. But think of that, and I like Dianne Feinstein, I have to tell you. But I don't like the fact that she had a Chinese spy driving her. And she didn't know it."

      "utterance": "The Senator fired back with tweets of her own declaring that after being contacted by the FBI, she jumped on it, removed the staffer adding, \"Compare that to your actions, attacking the FBI, refusing advice of your national security team, sad. I appreciated then and now the diligent work of our law enforcement, and Intel agencies, and acted in the best interests of the country. Give it a try.\" She said to the president. Now, remember, that in comparison how the FBI handled Feinstein staffer, Carter Page, the low-level Trump advisor who's put under surveillance by the Obama administration for alleged ties to Russia has never been charged with anything despite two years of investigations that yes, are still ongoing.

There's no evidence that Donald Trump had anything to do with any of it, yet, we've been hearing these calls for his impeachment now for two years and there's barely a peep about Dianne Feinstein.

The refusal to give the Trump campaign a defensive briefing and instead, opening a sprawling counterintelligence investigation of American citizens is one of many alarming ways intelligence leaders drastically diverged from normal procedures in their Trump campaign investigation. Those normal procedures in the case of Dianne Feinstein, Austan, was to provide a defense -- a defensive briefing to her. And then, she was able to terminate the employee."

And we know this from all the texts that we've seen that a lot of the people in the FBI that were -- that have been conducting this investigation were horrified at the prospect of a -- of a Trump presidency.

That means in offices with 150 attorneys responsible for assault, gun-running, white-collar crime, cybercrime fraud, environmental crime, drug trafficking, 16 out of 17 cases dealt solely with immigration. And this graph will show you in March 86 percent of all cases handled by the U.S. Attorney for New Mexico and Arizona for South Texas and Southern California were immigration related. By June it was 12 out of 13,000 cases dealt with entering U.S. illegally, harboring illegal immigrants or visa fraud. So why so many? Well according to the Syracuse University study, it's the administration's zero-tolerance policy. So what does it mean? Well, critics say this is a big deal because the President is so obsessed with immigration they claim more serious crimes go unpunished.

He set a plan, he's executing the plan, we talked about this Friday on your show about it's cutting the slack in the labor markets which is very, very good for the African-American and Hispanic American unemployment numbers. There is a reason why those numbers tighten the way they did and wages have started to go up. One thing that we should share with people is that wages in the United States over the last 35 years have actually flatlined but during this administration, they're up about 2.5 -three percent. That's another sign that the President's program is working. And so, I'm very happy to get rid of the child separation policy, abolished that, but the Zero Tolerance Policy is something that is actually helping working-class families and middle-class Americans and so this is super important that he stays on track with this."

You have to also remember the legendary economist Milton Friedman once said that if you're going to have a welfare state, you have to have a very tight and secure border. The United States has a welfare state which obviously we're all fine with. We need to protect the people that are poor in our country but if you have an open border and a welfare state, free market forces dictate that people are going to run across the border or to use the President's lines they're going to pour across the border. And so, this policy is actually working and let me tell you something. It's going to mean more economic progress for these families going into November, going into 2020. And so, the President's instincts are correct on this and as long as it's under the humane and fair and judicious way I don't think the American people have a problem with it. If anything, I think the President's instincts are right here that this will be something he'll be able to campaign on in 2020."

He's anchor to this position and he'll be speaking about the position. I think the people that have tied themselves to the President, those seem to be winning these elections. And so, I'm here in Cleveland tonight. I know the race is close but it looks like (INAUDIBLE) will probably get out. People have asked me here does that mean a good news or bad news for the midterms and I would say it doesn't mean either because we're 90 days out, Sandra, and a lot -- 90 days out is like three lifetimes or let's face it, it could be 33-34 mooches if you're measuring the 11-day units. So, you know, for me it's too long to really make the prediction but I do think that the President has got the mojo in his favor. If we can get the content right and the style, the campaign strategy right he should do very well in the midterm elections."

You know, I do believe that Paul Manafort will now have his day in court and give his side but boy it looks very, very ugly. And listen, people are innocent until they're proven guilty, Sandra, but this is not a great case. It's not a tidy case but I don't think either of these men did anything that could implicate the President. It seems like these activities were happening well before they joined the Trump campaign. And so hopefully this will get resolved shortly. It's a nasty thing to see and since they're both friends of mine or at least good acquaintances I felt bad about the situation."

It's very hard to understand that case the Manafort-Gates case, the indictments have already been out. And so, once the indictments are out on Michael Cohen it'll be much easier to offer strategy, much easier to see where the case could unfold. But let me tell you something. When the Feds -- the feds want you, they go with a mail fraud direction and they go in a tax fraud direction. That's how they obviously got Al Capone so it's a tough thing to see. I'm sure he'll either have a defense or he'll plea it out but again is the President of target or is the President somehow implicated in these things, it doesn't seem like he is."

He repeatedly called himself stupid and lonely and when the detective left the room Cruz said, \"kill me. Just effing kill me, I want to die.\" When detectives later asked about the voices inside his head, Cruz claimed it was his evil side and blamed the voices for making him listen to evil music ordering him to kill animals and making him buy guns though he did admit that he bought the ar-15 assault rifle because it \"looked cool.\" When he was asked what the voices would tell him to do, he responded burn, kill, destroy. Police then tried to turn the tables telling Cruz that he was using the demon in his head as an excuse. Cruz responded quoting \"I'm not. I promise I don't like the demon. I don't like the demon.\" The 260-page transcript was released one week after a judge ruled that a redacted version could be made public. The redacted parts include Cruz's detailed confession and his plan to commit the worst school shooting in Florida history. In the unredacted part of the transcript, Cruz talks about occasionally doing drugs like marijuana and Xanax. he describes his failure with girls, the constant cutting of his own skin and how before the shooting he tried to kill himself with Advil but it only made him sick. The defense calls Cruz a damaged and broken human being and argued that releasing the transcript would unfairly sway at potential jurors. Defense attorneys could also use Cruz's claim of hearing voices to argue that he's not guilty by reason of insanity. But that would also mean proving he did not know right from wrong and legal experts say that's a reach. The Broward County schools also released what was supposed to be a redacted report on Cruz's troubled school years. But because of the mistake, the report was not blacked out and detailed his numerous run-ins with teachers and school administrators, including at least two failed efforts to get him help. Sandra?"

They let him down at every possible angle. They let him down. They had him sign, if you read that report, they had him sign the document that gave up his right of more mental health and allowed him to come back to the school. They actually wrote it for him and had him sign it. The kid has a, you know, he has the attention span of a poodle or an I.Q. and they are letting him sign a document that allowed him to come back to the school, which was disturbing.

It's an open seat, the incumbent if he'd ran for re-election, Pat Tiberi would be comfortably head this November. But it is a horse race, and the question is going to be who wins, Democrat or Republican, and then if the Republicans win, how close is the election. Because so far in all the special congressional primaries and competitive races the Democrats have done basically about five points better or nearly six points better than they have historically been expected to do in those districts.

And then they all -- the Democrats got all behind him. I mean, he had, O'Connor has outspent the Republican Balderson by a pretty significant margin because Democrats across the country understand they win here and it's a big psychological blow to the Republicans and a big boost in momentum for them. We've seen this before. It happened in Georgia. Remember the Democrat there raised a jaw-dropping $33 million for a congressional seat. We've seen it elsewhere in these special elections.

They smartly brought the president not into Columbus where it would stir up sort of the Democratic vote, but they took him to a more rural part of the district. Balderson won the primary by winning the rural part of the district that he represented by a huge margin. And the hope I think by the White House and its political operation was to drive up the turnout in the rural part of the district. We'll see if that works out. Watch tonight the returns in Delaware Country. This is where if the Democrats are going to win, they are probably going to carry Franklin. They will carry Franklin.

Claire McCaskill, the incumbent Democrat is going to be opposed by Josh Hawley, the attorney general, the Republican attorney general. I would be interested tonight to see what are the comparative numbers in the Republican and Democratic primary and then what's the outcome of the referendum on the right to work. Washington State, there's only one contest that everybody is paying attention to and that is who is the Democrat. They have a jungle primary. The top two vote getters going to the general election and the question is, in the Washington district given up by a Republican Dave Reichert, who is the Democrat who will get to face Dino Rossi? A very popular Republican former state senator, raised a lot of money, looking good. But who's the Democratic gets into to run off with him. So those two states, not much going on. Michigan, a Senate primary on the Republican side and Republican and Democratic gubernatorial primaries, going to be a lot going on there. One test is going to be the Donald Trump endorsement. He endorsed Attorney General Schuette for governor and he endorsed a candidate name John James for the Senate.
