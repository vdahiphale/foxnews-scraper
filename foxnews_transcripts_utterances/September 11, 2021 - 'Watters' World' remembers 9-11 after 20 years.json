Nearly 3,000 people lost their lives on the morning of September 11, 2001. The deadliest act of terror in the U.S. history. In Manhattan, planes crashed into the World Trade Center's North and South Towers, sounds and images New Yorkers can never forget. Those watching around the nation, even the world, knew this wasn't an accident: The greatest country in the world was under attack. That morning the heartache and chaos continued, a plane crash into The Pentagon and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, Americans fought back against the hijackers, and the plane crashed into a field instead of the terrorists' intended target. The Twin Towers then collapsed. One of the most iconic skylines in the world was changed forever, and so were our lives. We were at war. Here's a look back at the sights and sounds of these past 20 years.",

You know, the bombing of the Cole and that type of thing, we had not done everything that we could to try and deter future terrorism, but I will tell you that as far as I am concerned, I agree with Bernie. I think that the fact that we pulled out of Afghanistan after 20 years in a dishonorable way, that was not an honorable departure -- a dishonorable way -- that we have now lost a lot of allies. But more importantly, we've encouraged the terror network around the world because the message that they are getting is that Islam wins.

We all remember after 9/11 when there was a segment of the American left that said that we had brought it on ourselves. It was twisted, it was demented, it was insane, but they said it. You know, I went to a very far left high school. I was a junior in high school when we were attacked by terrorists on 9/11, and I vividly remember the anti-American propaganda that swept through my school from the teachers, from people in administration and amongst some of the students as well, too. And now we're seeing that same kind of anti-American propaganda take root through things like critical race theory, as an example. And here's why it matters so much. Because if we don't teach our young people to love our country, if we don't teach our young people that America is a righteous nation, then we will not be able to maintain the defense of our nation. We will grow apathetic to our defense, to our security, to our sovereignty, to our borders, to all of it, and that alone will be what makes it possible for our enemies to defeat us.",

We've been at war in Afghanistan for half of my life, but it did not have to happen like this. I mean, think about this. Who takes -- a five-year-old as President Trump said knows this -- who takes the military out of a country that you know you're withdrawing from before American citizens and our allies? He closed Bagram Airfield, 13 Americans are dead, hundreds more of our allies are hurt, wounded, and dead. On the way out America's last act in Afghanistan, he killed an aid worker and an entire family and then had the gall to trot out to the podium and say that all of this was an extraordinary success. So today, on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, Joe Biden basically installed a terrorist super state in one of the most rugged hostile places on the planet.

The Democratic Party can't be screaming racism at Republicans when they're actually the racist under a gorilla mask. You don't ride around on a bike with an egg in your hand. And this wasn't some random attack, this was the Democratic campaign of Gavin Newsom sanitizing this thing, acting racist with this egg. This is a violent attack. It was only because she had a poor arm that this egg didn't hit the back of Larry Elder's head. This would be very painful to have something like this happen. They wanted it to be embarrassing, but the embarrassment is on Gavin Newsom. He has to explain why he has a racist campaign.",

What bothers me today is that less than two weeks ago, just before the anniversary, the 20th anniversary, we basically surrendered Afghanistan and gave it back to the Taliban.

We had let to many of these attacks go really unpunished, I guess. You know, the bombing of the Cole and that type of thing, we had not done everything that we could to try and deter future terrorism, but I will tell you that as far as I am concerned, I agree with Bernie. I think that the fact that we pulled out of Afghanistan after 20 years in a dishonorable way, that was not an honorable departure -- a dishonorable way -- that we have now lost a lot of allies. But more importantly, we've encouraged the terror network around the world because the message that they are getting is that Islam wins. The Great State has been brought down after 20 years of persistence. And that, I think, makes us more vulnerable."

And we went out that way each and every night, lost friends, lost brothers, saw them come home without their eyesight or burned across massive percentages of their body, or missing limbs, or to have their family be handed a folded flag, and we didn't go out with the same determination. Nobody could say that man, America really left Afghanistan unintimidated as they went on in on September 12th, of 2001 -- September 12th of 2021.

It comes from the idea that really started back in the 60s and in the 70s with the Marxist left about the idea of America as an evil colonial imperial power. And unfortunately, that idea has become mainstreamed inside of the progressive movement. We all remember after 9/11 when there was a segment of the American left that said that we had brought it on ourselves. It was twisted, it was demented, it was insane, but they said it. You know, I went to a very far left high school. I was a junior in high school when we were attacked by terrorists on 9/11, and I vividly remember the anti-American propaganda that swept through my school from the teachers, from people in administration and amongst some of the students as well, too. And now we're seeing that same kind of anti-American propaganda take root through things like critical race theory, as an example. And here's why it matters so much. Because if we don't teach our young people to love our country, if we don't teach our young people that America is a righteous nation, then we will not be able to maintain the defense of our nation. We will grow apathetic to our defense, to our security, to our sovereignty, to our borders, to all of it, and that alone will be what makes it possible for our enemies to defeat us."

There was something very special about today, and it was the day to hear from the President of the United States whether you voted for him or not. It was a real shame that Joe Biden did not address America in a live speech. But I think you're right, Jesse. He is doing everything possible to distract Americans from the complete and total disaster that was the withdrawal he directed from Afghanistan. We know there are still Americans left behind. We know that now we have opened up a Pandora's Box basically of terrorist activity in the Middle East. And when you hear General Mark Milley say it is not a question of if, but when we are attacked on American soil once again by terrorists, today is a day that it really, really remind you just how horrific that could be."

I just turned 40 in July. I've been out front with President Trump saying it's time to draw down in that country and it is time to do it responsibly. We've been at war in Afghanistan for half of my life, but it did not have to happen like this. I mean, think about this. Who takes -- a five-year-old as President Trump said knows this -- who takes the military out of a country that you know you're withdrawing from before American citizens and our allies? He closed Bagram Airfield, 13 Americans are dead, hundreds more of our allies are hurt, wounded, and dead. On the way out America's last act in Afghanistan, he killed an aid worker and an entire family and then had the gall to trot out to the podium and say that all of this was an extraordinary success. So today, on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, Joe Biden basically installed a terrorist super state in one of the most rugged hostile places on the planet. So, we're talking about Joe Biden aiding and abetting terrorist groups like the Taliban, the Haqqani Network, Hekmatyar, al-Qaeda -- they are all running the show in Afghanistan right now and Joe Biden owns all of it. And I'll tell you what's even more offensive than that, Jesse, is that he is trying to normalize relations with the Taliban and these terrorists on the 20th anniversary of 9/11.

You know, he says nice things about the Taliban. They're efficient, they're courteous. They're getting the job done. We can rely on them. And then he attacks Americans, which on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 is sort of the opposite of what you'd expect. You'd think the President will be anti- Taliban and pro-American.

They face the reality that they've had about as many COVID cases in a year where they had vaccines as Trump did in an entire year where he did not have any vaccines. So, they have not made any progress that Biden had promised us in the campaign, and I think they are enormously frustrated. But I think it goes deeper than that. You have to recognize that Biden really resents the American people. He resents their independence. He resents their concern about the border, which they're not supposed to talk about. He resents their anger about Afghanistan, which you're supposed to forget. So every time you turn around, Biden has this feeling, I think, snubbed and kind of betrayed. He thought everybody would love him. He'd be Uncle Joe, it would all work. That's not what's going on right now. And I think that they're about to face in Congress a real crisis, because they had this Big Government socialist bill of $3.5 trillion. They just had the second bad month in a row of producer price inflation, and more than two-thirds of all Americans think that it's crazy to increase spending at a time of inflation that just drives prices up. So, I'll be very curious to see the Democrats come back from this distinct period and what they heard from back home, because I think a lot of it is very negative."

If they don't spend their way out of this jam, they're going to have nothing, and it's shaping up to be a bloodbath in the midterms.

He is throwing rocks at the other car, barely escapes into the bushes. Joining me now, FOX News contributor, Raymond Arroyo. Raymond, you know when a road rage scene happens, you never leave the vehicle."

And you know, on 9/11, we should reflect on what's happened to us? Our civility? You and I covered a story in Baltimore a few weeks ago. Now that was a love spat where the woman was trying to run down her boyfriend. Here we go again, trying to kill Americans. What is going on? What's going to happen when the Biden bucks dry up?"

      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "Well, a piece of it is, you know when you go to Waffle House, you can always get a side of concussion with your breakfast, Jesse. I mean, this is not the first time this kind of thing has happened. You've got these people hazing each other, then the employee grabs this guy punches the hell out of him. He punches back. But look, last year, seven people were in a brawl. Then in 2019, there was a knife fight between employees. And then I covered a story where a guy fell out of the ceiling tiles butt naked. Stay away from Waffle House. Be very careful if you go."

      "utterance": "Well, you know he could have gone to Waffle House and splattered all over the place. People fall out of the ceiling all the time from there, but I don't quite know, what do you do with this? First of all, why are they dropping? Are they dropping the cat? Or did it throw itself off the balcony because it can't be that bad."
