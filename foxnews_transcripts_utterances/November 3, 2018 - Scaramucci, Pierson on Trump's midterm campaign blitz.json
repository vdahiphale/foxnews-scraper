They would be way smarter, Jesse, if they said, \"Whoa, whoa. He did that, let's fix that.\" But they are not willing to admit the mistake that they made over the last 30 years of abandoning what was their core constituency and now that core constituency is showing up at those rallies and they all call them xenophobic, they'll call them nationalistic.

What these organizers of the caravan would do would put maybe 100 to 200 women and children, and some disabled, some elderly at the front of the group. And then the rest of the group, and this is what I saw with my own eyes were men. I mean, there were roughly 1,400 to 1,500 men behind them. They would start pushing against the women and children. The Guatemalan government was telling them, \"Please turn around and go back. You will not be allowed into the United States,\" but as in Europe, Central America has a process by which if you have papers, you can cross through the border system.

I mean, with the financial services committee, we are the plummet of free enterprise. I mean, we are what makes the economy. Look, this is capital markets, banks and insurance and she is a radical leftist, so she'll be the first socialist to actually chair this committee and they want more rules, they want more regulations.

They all want to impeach Donald Trump and the House Republicans, we fought to give more power to the American people, giving them power and control over their money and their lives and their jobs and their business. Democrats see this winning and because they are socialists, they go, \"No, no. We've got to stop the winning. We want to re-empower Washington, and so to do that, they have to distract Donald Trump, to try to destroy Donald Trump and if they do that, and can stop the winning for the American people, they hope that they can win in 2020.

This economy is getting too good. We have got to pump the brakes.\" All right, you mentioned - I think they want to go after the President's taxes. Now, as you know, the President has not released his taxes. I don't think he is going to release his taxes. If the Democrats do take the House back, can they subpoena President Donald Trump's taxes?"

Taxes, Trump taxes. He is fighting releasing his taxes. It's just gamesmanship. Do you think if they do retake the House that the American people are just going to get sick of all the games?

You need Democrats to vote for it so we've been a few votes shy. But if we pick up seats in the Senate and we keep the House, we're going to get the border wall built. But if Democrats take control, that's absolutely off the table and I think you'll have mass chaos at the border."

It's okay to disagree in the marketplace of ideas, that's exciting, but it is also important to find solutions that unify and not divide. And that's what makes a big difference between Democrats ..."

This election cycle, the balance of power in Congress could swing either way though. Thirty five Senate seats are up for grabs. Democrats need to win two to retake the Senate and pick up 23 additional seats in the House to get control there. Here with the key two the races, the Editor at Large for Ballot PD, and pollster at ScottRasmussen.com, Scott Rasmussen and senior elections analyst of Real Clear Politics, Sean Trende, which is a great name for a political analyst. All right, Sean, we've seen wave elections in the past, 1994, 2006 - do you historically - are you getting those signals that you're seeing, a 40, a 50, a 60-seat Democratic wave in the House?"
    },

      "speaker": "SEAN TRENDE, ELECTIONS ANALYST, REALCLEARPOLITICS",
      "utterance": "Like they say, there is a reason we hold the elections. So we'll only have to wait about 48 more hours now, but look. You look at the generic ballot, it has Democrats up seven and a half points, and Republicans traditionally do not always over perform it. You look at enthusiasm. Republicans and Democrats are about equally even enthused right now. You look at party registration. There hasn't been a drop off in Republican Party registration like you usually see in wave years. You just look at the number of factors that you expect to see in a wave year and they don't really line up. Again, I don't know exactly what's going to happen, but something just seems off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Right, it does seem off because when you have everybody on the left, the media, the Democrats and even Colbert saying, it's a lock, and then that's what they did in 2016, so you're thinking if they were wrong in 2016, could they be wrong again, Scott?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR AT LARGE FOR BALLOT PD",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, the 2016 challenge was the analysis. It wasn't really the polling data, just everybody looked at it and said, \"This can't be right. There is no way Donald Trump will end up close.\" Right now, people have been expecting a blue wave for a very long time, and as Sean mentioned, there are some indications that maybe things are a little tighter. What is missing from this entire discussion is a one or two-point swing in the turnout and either direction could have a profound impact. If it swings one or two points towards the Republicans, they could keep the House. If it swings one or two points further into the Democrats favor, we could be looking at a 40-seat win."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "That's right. This thing is not guaranteed and as you said, there is a few days left. All right, let's look at these some of these Senate races, Scott. We have Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada - all of these seem very, very tight and a lot of people are predicting the Republicans to do very well in the Senate. How do you see it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RASMUSSEN",
      "utterance": "All five of the toss up races in the Senate, it wouldn't shock me if either candidate won any of the races. But when I look at it collectively, Republicans are more likely to pick up seats than to lose. I guess my best guess would be that net a couple, the Republican that I'm - I guess, I would say has the best chance of winning right now is Martha McSally in Arizona, followed by Hawley in Missouri and Braun in Indiana. Those last two just because the states are so heavily Republican. Rick Scott in Florida in a very competitive race, but Florida is always close and it's not a great year to be a Republican campaigning there. Dean Heller in Nevada, he has the toughest fight he has all year. He's the only Republican running in a state - only Republican incumbent running in a state won by Hillary Clinton."

      "speaker": "TRENDE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I see it about the same as Scott. I think the interesting thing is that you have all of these races that are on a knife's edge. They tend to fall altogether in these elections, because of what Scott said. If the polls are just a little bit off, it's make a big difference. It's very possible we could wake up on Wednesday and Republicans haven't moved, but I think it's important to emphasize, we could wake up Wednesday morning and the Republicans have picked up four or five seats in the Senate.  It's that close."
