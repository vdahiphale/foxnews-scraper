      "utterance": "Thank you very much Sean. Well I'm Mike Huckabee in for Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. We've got a powerful lineup for you. In moments, President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani is going to be here to deliver a message to Hillary Clinton. Plus, Joe diGenova, Robert Ray, Ari Fleischer, Doug Schoen, Michelle Malkin and more on a jam-packed news night, and if we don't dive right in, we're never going to come up with all the treasure we've got tonight. Well first, there are two constants at the Democratic Party and the media, but then I repeat myself can seemingly never get rid of, Hillary Clinton and their obsession with Russia. Now, those who came together at one event yesterday, it was the TIME 100 gala where Hillary took the stage and said, \"It's just so dang unfair that Donald Trump won't be indicted in the wake of the Mueller report\"."

And we are going to walk away and pretend it didn't happen. Any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted, but because of the rule in the Justice Department that you can't indict a sitting President, the whole matter of obstruction was very directly sent to the Congress."

She wrote in part \"The Mueller Report isn't just a reckoning about our recent history, it's a warning about the future. Unless he's held accountable, the President may show even more disregard for the laws of the land and the obligations of his office. He will likely redouble his efforts to advance Putin's agenda\". Now never mind that President Trump has confronted Putin on a level that she never did as Secretary of State. So one of the President's lawyers think of Hillary Clinton's latest comments. Here now is Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mayor let's get your response to what madam Clinton has had to say."

Her crooked foundation got 150 million - 150 million. Her husband got a $2.5 million speaking fee. I don't know it kind of looks like bribery, it smells like bribery, it sounds like bribery. I'm not saying it is,, but it comes awful close. Plus if anybody was guilty of obstruction of justice it's her. I mean she did away with 33,000 e-mails. She destroyed phones. She had a guy doing with hammers and she BleachBit her server. President Trump didn't do any of that. In fact, she's not telling the truth. He turned everything over to the Special Counsel, didn't obstruct anything. There's no obstructive act that was found even by Mueller."

But her intent wasn't there\". But basically he outlined a criminal case for her and then for her to come and do it, I mean that takes some real audacity, don't you think?"

There's nothing more powerful in an obstruction case than destruction of evidence, which wasn't present in the Trump situation, nor was there an underlying crime. He was found to be exonerated of collusion. That whole Russian thing turned out to be a hoax. She - her campaign played a role in in promulgating that hoax. They paid $1.1 million for the phony Steele Dossier. The only person who actually apparently has done business with the Russians is Hillary, and I think she's going to be in for quite an extensive investigation and she doesn't have Jim Comey to fix the case for her this time."

I thought after two years we'd be finished with it. No, now the House goes and starts subpoenaing. They want to know every deal I've ever done. We're fighting all the subpoenas.

And unfortunately because they have inability to control their mouths, we have plenty of statements that he's a guilty of obstruction, guilty of collusion. Adam Schiff has evidence of collusion that he never turned over to Mueller apparently or he was lying, and one of the other. So this is - these are not impartial arbiters and there's a very good ground to resist these subpoenas as illegitimate hearings by the by the Congress. This is a political hearing. It doesn't serve any legislative purpose. It doesn't really even serve an investigative purpose. Mueller investigated it to a fairly well. And by the way, it's the second time an FBI investigation cleared the President of collusion. How many times does he have to be cleared of it? So I would resist those subpoenas and let them fight for anything they get and prove their legitimacy."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIULIANI",
      "utterance": "Well, I find it to be extraordinary. Their requests defy every constitutional norm I can think of. The reality is that Cohen trashed the attorney-client privilege when he taped his client and lied to him about it, and then actually doctored the tape. And there's no reason to interrogate McGahn any longer. He was questioned for 29 hours. He must have given his entire history going back to birth for 29 hours. And if Mueller couldn't get out of him what he wanted, it just isn't fair. So this becomes now harassment. It becomes really a violation of separation of powers. Congress is going so far here they are interfering with the ability of the executive branch to function. 81 subpoenas before the report was even filed? I mean, they decided this before they read the report. Jerry Nadler was overheard on the train, coming down from New York to Washington, plotting and impeachment. And a week ago one of his aides was heard doing the same thing. So they can go try to fool somebody else, but not Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "So, I guess, I'm having a hard time understanding, impeachment is not going anywhere, not with the Senate in Republicans hands, and it's going to be a bigger failure than it was with Bill Clinton in 1998. Why did the Democrats want to push it because it actually helped Bill Clinton, do they not think the same thing will happen with Donald Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIULIANI",
      "utterance": "And let me make a distinction. Bill Clinton was guilty of a crime, it's called perjury. When the dress was produced, he had to stop lying about it, otherwise they'd still be lying at about it now and he and Hillary would be trashing Monica Lewinsky. But he got caught, and he had to admit that he committed perjury - lying under oath. Now maybe it wasn't serious enough, maybe it was more personal, but it sure was a crime. So in this case, the President was found not to have committed the underlying crime. And the reality is that the President's conduct is easily explainable. This is a man who was falsely accused - and everything they'd like to say is obstruction, is the man trying to defend himself against very unfair, exaggerated falsified charges."

The Trump World is now ramping up a campaign to turn the collusion tables and targeting undercover Democrats who were involved. It's not just the Trump World, award-winning journalist Bob Woodward, taking on the Intel agencies."

      "utterance": "The dossier, which really is got a lot of garbage in it, and Mueller found that to be the case. Early in building the intelligence community assessment on Russian interference, I think it was the CIA pushing this. The idea that they would include something like that in one of the great, stellar intelligence assessments, as Mueller also found out, is highly questionable. Needs to be investigated."

Joe, let me start with you. Bob Woodward, who was no Trump fan, for sure, and certainly not a card- carrying member of the Republican National Committee, basically was saying this was the work of John Brennan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, there's no doubt this is pretty simple stuff for career prosecutors like Rudy and myself. It has been evident from day one that there was a brazen plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton illegally, and then if she lost the election, to frame Donald Trump. This dossier was a knowing part of that. It was created by Hillary Clinton. It was created knowingly by John Brennan as part of a scheme to do everything they could to harm Donald Trump. The problem for Brennan and Clapper and Comey and Baker and all of them now is, is that the FISA Court has already communicated with the Justice Department about its findings and their findings are that for more than four years before the election of Donald Trump. There was an illegal spying operation going on by FBI contractors - four of them, to steal personal information - electronic information about Americans and to use it against the Republican Party. There are going to be indictments. There's going to be grand juries. John Brennan isn't going to need one lawyer. He's going to need five."

Do you have confidence that we're ever going to get to the bottom of this? And by the bottom of it, find out just who was feeding at the bottom of the - of the river here. And that people are going to be held accountable for the violation of civil liberties, for the corruption, the cover-up and the attempted coup of a sitting elected President?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERT RAY, FORMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "The start of getting to the bottom of it is going to be, as expected, the release of the Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report sometime - I think the Attorney General indicated in either May or June of this year. I think that will have to happen first before the Attorney General then conducts the investigation that he has indicated in testimony before the Congress that he intends to conduct. So, yes, Governor I do think eventually we will get to the bottom of this. And I think to put sort of a bow on this so that it's clear to the American people why they should care. This is a instance, an example, which is dangerous in a democracy when the full powers of the United States government are mixed up with politics in order to effect an election. That ought to be something that is equally of concern to a 22 month investigation to determine whether or not there was collusion between Russian government officials and the Trump campaign and the candidate. I mean, this is something that, of course, has been completely passed over while the country has been occupied for the last two years with one investigation. And I'm not necessarily suggesting that a Special Counsel is necessary in order to get to the bottom of it. But I think the Justice Department is fully capable of looking at this. And I - frankly, I trust Bill Barr and he knows both the intelligence community and the Justice Department well enough to understand what is going to be necessary to find out where the truth is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Mayor you and Joe both have also been prosecutors, I would think that a lot of people would be concerned about the civil liberties violations here. If this can happen that people at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the FBI and the intelligence agencies can use their power as political weapons, then none of us are safe, our processes aren't safe. Frankly, I worry a whole lot less about what the Russians did - and let's face it, they tried and they did everything they could, but what they did was way less of impact than what these federal agencies did and we as taxpayers paid for it. So help me understand why aren't we hearing cries from the civil libertarians?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIULIANI",

They've covered it, they just don't want to really go into detail on it. And I think it's the white - the investigation is going to end up being very, very intense. I agree that Attorney General Barr is exactly the right guy to do it. He's got a great sense of justice and there's nobody that knows much more about the FISA Courts than Joe diGenova, who's one of the original lawyers on the FISA Court. And--"

      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "And I think that's what scares us. So Joe, Rudy just mentioned that your personal knowledge and experience with the FISA Court is legendary, we know that, why does this matter to the average American sitting in a home with bowl of popcorn and a soft drink. Why does it matter to them what happens in this entire investigation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DIGENOVA",
      "utterance": "Because it's about the rule of law and privacy. The Obama administration, for more than four years, before the 2016 election, allowed four contractors working for the FBI to illegally surveil American citizens illegally. The FISA Court has already found that. By the way, Robert Ray mentioned that there is the Horowitz report coming out in May or possibly early June. There's another report that everybody has forgotten about, involving James Comey alone. That will be out in two weeks. That report is going to be a bombshell. It's going to open up the investigation on a very high note and there will be criminal referrals in it. The FISA Court abuse is the center of this entire abuse of governmental power and the Chief Judge of that Court has already ruled that FBI broke the law and that the people at the head of the Justice Department, Sally Yates; John Carlin, the Assistant Attorney General for the National Security, all knew about it and lied to the court - the FISA Court about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Robert, if you were advising Jim Comey, Sally Yates and some of these other folks that we've heard so much about, would you tell them to lawyer up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "I think, you know - look, I mean not to be funny about it. But I mean that is an understatement. The core of this - Joe is absolutely right. What I want to know is, who at the Justice Department knew about what disclosures were going to be made to the FISA Court and who specifically withheld information. Because they did know about the origins and the derivation of the Steele Dossier, how come the political connection to the Clinton campaign wasn't disclosed at least in a footnote in the FISA application? Now there were people at the Justice Department who knew about that. I think the point of the investigation - who knew it, when did they know it, and why didn't that information make it in to the FISA application, which was delivered to the court. Because, look, we've all recognized now with the benefit of hindsight that is kind of a rather important thing to have known. And I will say in addition to all that, one of the things also - separate apart from prosecutions, is there's a real question here about procedures within the intelligence community and the FBI - the Justice Department about how to deal with presidential campaigns when this sort of thing happens. And you know, frankly, what I saw - at least initially now, from the Mueller Report, is there was an awful lot of leveraging going on by the Justice Department, the intelligence community of Donald Trump in the period after the election and when he first took office. That, frankly, the President is right, should never happen to another President again."

      "utterance": "There's a hero in this entire story, and it's not a lawyer. All the bad people in this story are lawyers. There's a hero, his name is Admiral Mike Rogers. He was the Head of the National Security Agency. He discovered the illegal spying. He went personally to the FISA Court and briefed the Chief Judge and worked with her for months to uncover the people who did it. The FISA Court has already been told and has already told the Justice Department who lied to that court and that has been given to Bill Barr already."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Very powerful. Let me add something. If we ask this question, what does it matter to the person at home? If the highest levels of government can trample the constitutional rights and the Constitution that through which we elect a President, and step all over an elected President, imagine what it can do to you? Think about that. If the President of United States can be walked all over by the powers of our government, then you're not safe - I think that's what we have to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIULIANI",
      "utterance": "Mike, Joe and I have probably looked at a 100 FISA applications at different times and the reality is that you take this very seriously, because they can't be contested on the other side. If you read the Steele Dossier, which I've done, and you don't figure out in two pages that it's a piece of phony crap, you don't belong being an investigator. And I'd like to ask Jim Comey, when he said it was unverified, after having it for five months, why the heck didn't you verify it? You could have checked whether Cohen was in Prague on a specific date. All you had to do was call the passport office and you would have found out he's never been in Prague. You could have found out that Steele hadn't been in Russia for seven years. He didn't bother to find that out. We call that being grossly negligent. Remember, who else was grossly negligent? The one he let off the hook for obstruction of justice. So I think Jim Comey has got a lot to answer for, because you don't sign those things cavalierly. And you could not have read that as a trained professional and not become extremely suspicious. It reads like a lurid, silly novel."

I think his problem is much more structural, bigger and fundamental, Governor. Look, Joe Biden to me is like a - your old pair of shoes - your favorite old pair of shoes that you keep in the closet. You probably bought them when you went to the junior prom in 1988, the first year Joe Biden ran for the presidency. And you liked those shoes they were comfortable, they were they were enjoyable to look at. And now you try to put them on again, they're not as comfortable as you thought. They don't really fit anymore. And I think that's where Joe Biden is. He doesn't fit anymore the modern-day Democratic Party. He has to denounce all the positions he used to take as a Senator in the 70s and the 80s and even into the ‘90s.

And he was able to defeat Hillary Clinton, much to people's surprise. And that is where I just think the Democratic Party, as Doug has indicated, has really shifted. The energy is so far on the left. There is a tension with the people who want pragmatic to beat Donald Trump. But I don't see enough of that yet to make me think Joe Biden can win. And what is Joe Biden's constituency? Bernie Sanders have a powerful, devoted constituency of liberals and progressives. What does Joe Biden have? He has none of that. There's no institutional, inherent Joe Biden constituency, other than remnants, memories, and that is what I meant about the old shoe. And that won't last."

They somehow fail to understand that if those are truly unjust laws, it's up to Congress to change them. Here to debate, David Bossie, former Trump deputy campaign manager and FOX News contributor, and attorney Allen Orr.

We have the Son of Sam, Sirhan Sirhan is still in prison. Are we expecting that these people, the worst of the worst, are now going to be able to vote? It is insane policy.

And in terms of unconscious bias and unconscious sexism and misogyny, well, it certainly was conscious on the part of her misogynistic husband. And I think a lot of conservative and independent woman will not forget the misogyny that Hillary Clinton showed in her bitterness after her second loss about blaming them, and in the most sexist way saying that independent woman voted for Donald Trump only because their husbands did, dripping with explicit misogyny.

Meantime, Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli want the legal process against them to stop until the feds turn over all the evidence. They are facing money laundering charges for allegedly funneling their $500,000 bribe through a charity. Legal experts say the government likely has bank records and wire transfers, et cetera, at the attorneys will want to see how damaging the evidence is before proceeding. As for their defense strategy, it appears to be the old I didn't realize I was giving bribe money, with sources saying Loughlin had no idea how the $500,000 would be used, and certainly didn't think it would grease the hand of the women's soccer coach, Laura Janke, except the criminal complaint says Mossimo Giannulli sent at least $100,000 directly to the USC assistant athletic director.
