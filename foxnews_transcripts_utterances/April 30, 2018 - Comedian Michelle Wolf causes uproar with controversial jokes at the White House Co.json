President Trump has come in and defeated the ISIS caliphate, brought the two people to the table on the North Korean peninsula, and launched a few tomahawk missiles against the Assad regime, so pretty impressive. And when you add on the top of the fact that the black unemployment is at the lowest levels, a lot of the things that you would necessarily give Obama credit for that he talked about happening are actually happening on President Trump's watch. I don't think liberals can handle it because it defeats their entire narrative about how evil and corrupt and ineffective President Trump is, but Trump will always be viewed as results driven. Obama was about hope, and he's about speeches, and he was about lofty ideals.

There was nothing to be gained for her saying these types of things that were directly targeted at Sarah Sanders. I think the majority of what she had to say went against her. This isn't advancing women. This isn't even advancing the first amendment. This is just proffering cruelty. And I think if you were sitting in a chair like that to listen to that, and everybody, basically, some people, I guess, laughed, etcetera. But to allow her to even to continue to go on in this way, I thought it was absolutely terrible. I admit, we were all invited, we didn't go. Well, you went. I think you're the only one of the five of us, right? OK. And -- so, Juan will say with his, you know, personal experience was being there and actually listening in the room. Sometimes it's a little different. But at home, and I re-watched it so many times and I felt so sad for her. It's just one of those things that Sarah conducted herself, you know, beautifully and really handled herself well. To sit there and listen to these things, so mean-spirited, bullying, that's what it is. I wouldn't like it if she said that about, you know, a man, a woman, a child. But to do that, what did Sarah Sanders ever do to hurt to deserve those kinds of personal attacks on that level of vitriol? I mean, she should feel horrible about herself when she goes to bed and she wakes up in the morning, Michelle Wolf, because none of that was funny whatsoever."

What they say on Morning Joe. The swear words on CNN. It's been despicable throughout the entire year. No one has ever condemned that. And here's the reasons why they condemned it this time. It was done in their room. It was done at their dinner by a comedian who they hired, and it was done to the person's face. All the other hateful stuff was on twitter. It was on someone else's show. They didn't have to take responsibility. The reason they had to condemn this comedian now was because it was a P.R. problem for them. They were only doing it for that reason and that reason alone."

I believe she was two people removed from the lectern and she's sitting there, and even the TV cameras then enlarged the perspective so you could see Sanders reacting to Ms. Wolf. And the problem was that it just felt unfair to her. I thought -- you know, I saw Sarah Huckabee Sanders later and I held her hands and said I think you have a great sense of humor because in the moment you worry that she was going to burst into tears or stand up and walk out and there would be a whole deal about that, and that's not what the White House correspondents association want to their event. Where I disagree with you guys that she was hilarious, I think she was genius funny. I mean, you don't understand, she was picking on the press a lot. She was picking on Democrats.

But I think that wanting a Nobel Prize to rub it in the face of your political opponents it's probably not the best way to go into a negotiation, and I don't think that's what President Trump is doing. I don't think he has grandiose ideas about getting the Nobel Prize. And I think that -- and also, you know, needling the Nobel Prize committee and say, oh, you'll never give it to him, you'll never give to him, it becomes like another thing that is just -- we have an amazing opportunity right now, mostly due to his strategic instincts to get this to the place where we have this moment. But we all know there's a catch. Kim Jong-un is getting to come to the table now as an equal, because he now has nuclear weapons, so their idea of denuclearization and our idea is very different. And so, let's just see what happens. And President Trump is very cautious when he talks about this. He should sound a hopeful note and then says, but we'll see. I don't know. Maybe I'll walk away. I don't care. Let's just see. And so, I think he's got the right attitude of people trying to push in for a Nobel Prize before they even, you know, basically, pour the water is a little premature."

When you look at what happened in the years under President Obama, you have the crisis in Syria, where he didn't enforce the red line. Chemical weapons were used on people. There was a migration crisis, and half a million people have died. North Korea nuked up. And then, ISIS took over third of Iraq. President Trump has come in and defeated the ISIS caliphate, brought the two people to the table on the North Korean peninsula, and launched a few tomahawk missiles against the Assad regime, so pretty impressive. And when you add on the top of the fact that the black unemployment is at the lowest levels, a lot of the things that you would necessarily give Obama credit for that he talked about happening are actually happening on President Trump's watch. I don't think liberals can handle it because it defeats their entire narrative about how evil and corrupt and ineffective President Trump is, but Trump will always be viewed as results driven. Obama was about hope, and he's about speeches, and he was about lofty ideals. But when you look at the actual results of this president compared to the last president, only in 16 months, I mean, the proof is in the pudding."

And when you look at the groups, there's a lot of young, able-bodied men showing up. And you think, \"These are not refugees.\" This is a symbolic political gesture that is backfiring.

That is the business plan. And of course this is a country founded on immigrants, wonderful people from all over the world. So we want to have open arms and be welcoming, but we want to do it with an eye towards public safety and national security and securing the border, because it makes for a safer situation for everyone and for a lawful process that should be followed and abided by. So the president is fulfilling his campaign promises. We understand his reasoning, and then it's also important, if you're going to try to work on it, to make it more of a -- you know, a cooperative understanding.

And one great example, just two weeks ago Kevin Williamson, a fantastic writer from National Review, a conservative, gets hired by the Atlantic. I was so excited. I was like, \"Oh, I'm going to re-subscribe to The Atlantic.\" So I did. He starts -- he wrote one piece for them. It was a fantastic piece. But they looked back and they say, \"Oh, he wants to basically have -- women who have abortions should be hanged.\" They don't give him a chance to explain his position. He actually was willing to explain it all. He didn't say, \"I don't actually think I wrote that.
