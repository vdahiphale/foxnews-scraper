      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. The Biden administration was supposed to restore America's prestige on the world stage. Instead, Biden has been careening from one crisis to another, leaving our international reputation in tatters. And most importantly, increasing the suffering of American citizens and others around the world. Now, in moments, my angle explain how we got here, and how we can turn the page. But first, some grim updates from Ukraine tonight that Russian military convoy that had been stalled north of Kyiv for over a week has now progressed to 10 miles from the city. Additionally, a senior defense official is noting that a different advance on Kyiv is now 25 miles to the east of the city. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said half the population of the Ukrainian capital has now fled, and that the city is a fortress with every street building and checkpoint fortified. For what the coming days might look like, we go to Kyiv, Ukraine, where Fox's Trey Yingst is standing by Trey, tell us what you're hearing tonight about why this convoy might have broken up into now smaller groups you're hearing an hour or so ago.",

These are satellite images showing that that 40 mile long Russian convoy just to the northwest of this capital city has now broken up. They were sitting there for a long time and analysts were wondering how long they could stay there without getting hit by Ukrainian forces. So, it may be part of the reason they're breaking up into smaller factions within this larger convoy that is operating outside the city. Now on the eastern side of Kyiv, we did see overnight some new video indicating that the Ukrainians are hitting these convoys quite hard. You can see in these images here. The Ukrainians hit both the front and the back of this convoy trying to basically ambush these Russian soldiers who are approaching very quickly on this capital city. Over the past 24 hours, we've heard explosions in the distance, anti- aircraft batteries going off here in Kyiv, and those areas sirens continuing throughout the day. Staying in the city though is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who spoke today directly to Russian troops who invaded his country.",

And you can see from this video, there is evidence of a civilian area hospital with women and children being targeted. The Deputy Mayor of Mariupol detailed other disturbing actions by the Russians in this city since the invasion began, say more than 1200 people had been killed with dozens buried in mass graves. There's simply no time to bury the dead and these lifeless bodies just thrown into the ground, a gut wrenching reminder of the brutality being inflicted on the civilian population here. But again, tonight the capital city is bracing with those forces within 10 miles of the downtown area where we are at right now and concerns that Russian forces any day could start that ground offensive into Kyiv.",

And when the Biden team suggested that they stopped buying Russian energy, Germany said no, Germany needs Russian oil and gas. And frankly, I don't care what Joe Biden thinks. There once was a time when American president called our allies would listen, or at least they'd pay attention. Now they're just tuning Biden's team out altogether. Now take India, supposedly the centerpiece of our diplomacy in the Indo Pacific region. India refused to condemn the Ukraine invasion at the United Nations despite our lobbying. Now, if India is worried about offending anyone, it seems they're most worried about offending Russia, while also keeping an eye on China's ever looming presence. They certainly don't care about what Joe Biden thinks. The Biden team so-called diplomacy is nothing more than a series of photo ops. It certainly never yields any results, take Saudi Arabia. Now under Trump, diplomacy over years was deft enough to produce the Abraham Accords. Well, looks like Biden has squandered that working relationship as well.",

We have never seen anything like this, at least maybe not since 1979 or so. Now, veteran negotiators who really wanted to help the Ukrainians, instead of simply trying to move the poles at home, they would recognize that the only practical way to stop this invasion now is by getting China's President Xi to stop Putin. Because without China's help on trade, Russia couldn't sustain its barbaric and inhumane assault against Ukrainian cities. But to the CCP, the Biden team, it's just a little more than a joke at this point. And I've got to say, who can blame them for thinking that because for years, Biden was a cheerleader for the CCP. He's climate czar and his treasury secretary are still on Team China. In fact, today, we learned that Biden is rewarding China by delaying a key trade investigation, which would have been the trigger for tariffs like those Trump had put in place. So, the pro-China forces in the administration at Treasury and Commerce, they won out, as we predicted they would be signaling more weakness to Beijing. So, why would China ever take America seriously, when our own government is so easy to intimidate? China lied about COVID. China's supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but Joe and his team, they just don't care. And poor old Secretary Blinken, I must feel bad for him, knowing his boss will never use or even look for leverage over China, he can only basically do wishful thinking diplomacy.",

Now, if Biden was really the leader of a Democratic establishment, and what they sold him as, he would have assembled a team of foreign policy realists who would have provided a frank assessment of the options available in Ukraine, they would have told them that the entire idea of a rules based international order is folly when you have China and Russia smashing up your global playpen. But of course, Biden's never been a leader. He's been a glad handing grifter, a creature of Washington, where so much of what passes as leadership is really just choreography. You got the big desk, you have the conference room, you have the lectern with the presidential seal. It's all props, zero substance. And in the real world where serious people play for keeps. He has been measured, and well, found to be weak. No one, not one single bad guy on Earth fears Joe Biden. So, the grownups, the countries who understand power and how the world really works, they'll make the key decisions in Ukraine. So, the Europeans, the Russians, the Ukrainians and the Chinese will be at the table, we'll just have to take whatever arrangement they eventually make. And after all, anyone who would send Kamala Harris to Eastern Europe at this moment in history cannot be taken seriously. And so, they aren't. But someday, America will again, have a president who stands up for our interests, and someday will again have a cabinet filled with serious leaders who know how to use our leverage to make the world a better place. But that's not going to happen until after 2024. And in the meantime, America is going to continue to drift as sad as it is to see and the world will continue to become more dangerous. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator, is it just me or is the angle somehow off here?

We should shut down Russia's oil and natural gas sector. We should open ours up. I mean, it's as you said, before, its power politics, it's about is America strong or not? Does America have the strength to stand up and represent the free world or not? And under Joe Biden, sadly, the answer is increasingly no, but that's Joe Biden's fault.

Instead, Biden has been careening from one crisis to another, leaving our international reputation in tatters. And most importantly, increasing the suffering of American citizens and others around the world. Now, in moments, my angle explain how we got here, and how we can turn the page. But first, some grim updates from Ukraine tonight that Russian military convoy that had been stalled north of Kyiv for over a week has now progressed to 10 miles from the city. Additionally, a senior defense official is noting that a different advance on Kyiv is now 25 miles to the east of the city. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said half the population of the Ukrainian capital has now fled, and that the city is a fortress with every street building and checkpoint fortified. For what the coming days might look like, we go to Kyiv, Ukraine, where Fox's Trey Yingst is standing by Trey, tell us what you're hearing tonight about why this convoy might have broken up into now smaller groups you're hearing an hour or so ago."

These are satellite images showing that that 40 mile long Russian convoy just to the northwest of this capital city has now broken up. They were sitting there for a long time and analysts were wondering how long they could stay there without getting hit by Ukrainian forces. So, it may be part of the reason they're breaking up into smaller factions within this larger convoy that is operating outside the city. Now on the eastern side of Kyiv, we did see overnight some new video indicating that the Ukrainians are hitting these convoys quite hard. You can see in these images here. The Ukrainians hit both the front and the back of this convoy trying to basically ambush these Russian soldiers who are approaching very quickly on this capital city. Over the past 24 hours, we've heard explosions in the distance, anti- aircraft batteries going off here in Kyiv, and those areas sirens continuing throughout the day. Staying in the city though is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who spoke today directly to Russian troops who invaded his country."

Officials say three people were killed there, including one child, at least 17 others were wounded in the attack. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy calling this attack a war crime. And you can see from this video, there is evidence of a civilian area hospital with women and children being targeted. The Deputy Mayor of Mariupol detailed other disturbing actions by the Russians in this city since the invasion began, say more than 1200 people had been killed with dozens buried in mass graves. There's simply no time to bury the dead and these lifeless bodies just thrown into the ground, a gut wrenching reminder of the brutality being inflicted on the civilian population here. But again, tonight the capital city is bracing with those forces within 10 miles of the downtown area where we are at right now and concerns that Russian forces any day could start that ground offensive into Kyiv."

Just a few years ago, they had to contend with a different type of American president who knew how he wasn't afraid to flex our muscle and our economic might, when necessary, who knew how to do that? DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: I've been very, very direct with Secretary Stoltenberg, and members of the alliance in saying that NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations.

And when the Biden team suggested that they stopped buying Russian energy, Germany said no, Germany needs Russian oil and gas. And frankly, I don't care what Joe Biden thinks. There once was a time when American president called our allies would listen, or at least they'd pay attention. Now they're just tuning Biden's team out altogether. Now take India, supposedly the centerpiece of our diplomacy in the Indo Pacific region. India refused to condemn the Ukraine invasion at the United Nations despite our lobbying. Now, if India is worried about offending anyone, it seems they're most worried about offending Russia, while also keeping an eye on China's ever looming presence. They certainly don't care about what Joe Biden thinks. The Biden team so-called diplomacy is nothing more than a series of photo ops. It certainly never yields any results, take Saudi Arabia. Now under Trump, diplomacy over years was deft enough to produce the Abraham Accords. Well, looks like Biden has squandered that working relationship as well."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "This is totally humiliating; they wouldn't take his call. Now think about it. The Saudi government is literally too busy to answer Biden's call. We have never seen anything like this, at least maybe not since 1979 or so. Now, veteran negotiators who really wanted to help the Ukrainians, instead of simply trying to move the poles at home, they would recognize that the only practical way to stop this invasion now is by getting China's President Xi to stop Putin. Because without China's help on trade, Russia couldn't sustain its barbaric and inhumane assault against Ukrainian cities. But to the CCP, the Biden team, it's just a little more than a joke at this point. And I've got to say, who can blame them for thinking that because for years, Biden was a cheerleader for the CCP. He's climate czar and his treasury secretary are still on Team China. In fact, today, we learned that Biden is rewarding China by delaying a key trade investigation, which would have been the trigger for tariffs like those Trump had put in place. So, the pro-China forces in the administration at Treasury and Commerce, they won out, as we predicted they would be signaling more weakness to Beijing. So, why would China ever take America seriously, when our own government is so easy to intimidate? China lied about COVID. China's supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but Joe and his team, they just don't care. And poor old Secretary Blinken, I must feel bad for him, knowing his boss will never use or even look for leverage over China, he can only basically do wishful thinking diplomacy."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Stand up and make your voice heard, China. It's more embarrassment. Now, if Biden was really the leader of a Democratic establishment, and what they sold him as, he would have assembled a team of foreign policy realists who would have provided a frank assessment of the options available in Ukraine, they would have told them that the entire idea of a rules based international order is folly when you have China and Russia smashing up your global playpen. But of course, Biden's never been a leader. He's been a glad handing grifter, a creature of Washington, where so much of what passes as leadership is really just choreography. You got the big desk, you have the conference room, you have the lectern with the presidential seal. It's all props, zero substance. And in the real world where serious people play for keeps. He has been measured, and well, found to be weak. No one, not one single bad guy on Earth fears Joe Biden. So, the grownups, the countries who understand power and how the world really works, they'll make the key decisions in Ukraine. So, the Europeans, the Russians, the Ukrainians and the Chinese will be at the table, we'll just have to take whatever arrangement they eventually make. And after all, anyone who would send Kamala Harris to Eastern Europe at this moment in history cannot be taken seriously. And so, they aren't. But someday, America will again, have a president who stands up for our interests, and someday will again have a cabinet filled with serious leaders who know how to use our leverage to make the world a better place. But that's not going to happen until after 2024. And in the meantime, America is going to continue to drift as sad as it is to see and the world will continue to become more dangerous. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator, is it just me or is the angle somehow off here? Does it seem like we're just observers on the world stage, taking a backseat to pretty much everyone else and seeking a resolution here with this Ukraine crisis?"

And you really do have to go back to the 1970s. As you were saying a minute ago, I mean, for those of us who missed out on the 1970s, I mean, I guess this is our chance to relive it because that is what Joe Biden is trying to bring us back to. Listen, what America needs to show the world right now is American strength. We're the strongest country on the face of the earth. Let's act like it. Let's produce our own energy. Let's open up our drilling, our pipelines, let's show Putin that we're not going to be dependent on him.

Who supplies 40 percent of Europe's overall energy, Vladimir Putin? Why? What is the reason for that? Well, one of the reasons is Joe Biden has let him, Joe Biden has said, go right on ahead, Pump that gas, Russia, go ahead, ship the pipeline, he should have been doing just the opposite. We should shut down Russia's oil and natural gas sector. We should open ours up. I mean, it's as you said, before, its power politics, it's about is America strong or not? Does America have the strength to stand up and represent the free world or not? And under Joe Biden, sadly, the answer is increasingly no, but that's Joe Biden's fault.

There's very little confidence in their competence and every poll out there shows major disapproval, majority disapproval on their handling of all these diverse issues, from immigration, to inflation, to the crisis in Ukraine, to obviously, what we're paying in the grocery store, the gas pump, the supply chain crisis. And Joe Biden - he has this way Jen Psaki of playing the blaming game, name and shame, nonsense of Washington. But it would rely on the American people believing it and they've lost credibility, not just in their message and their messengers. You know, Laura, I like to say the Democrats don't have - this administration doesn't have a messaging problem. They have a fact problem and is reflected in the polls. They don't seem to do anything well. Finally, blaming Putin for the gas prices completely forgets that gases was about $2 a gallon on election day 2020. It's more than doubled now and it had gone up 40 percent before Russia invaded Ukraine. Hakeem Jeffries at the Democratic retreat is telling everybody, oh, it's Putin's fault. It's not and none of it works. People are smarter than that. And people are fearful. They're fearful."

Because of these policies, you cannot kill 42,000 energy jobs on day one of your administration, and out the door with that goes 800,000 barrels per day in domestic oil production, and convince people that it's not your fault. You can't have supply chain crisis when people see the containers stuck on our own waterways. You can't have a president who looks the other way when people and drugs are coming over our southern border, who just this past Tuesday, Laura, two days ago said his budget next year will include $2.6 billion for gender equality.

Laura, I went to the train station stumbled on this working party, dozens of volunteers packing food and critical supplies on the train. As the refugees had just disembark, they're sending the supplies back east of the capital into other cities besieged by Russian forces.

And everything that we're trying to do on an emergency basis the last 15 days in Ukraine, like providing them weapons, we should be doing now with Taiwan. Everything we're doing to break away from the Russian economy, to put a distance between our economy and theirs, to get our companies out of Russia, we should be doing in China, again, right now. We should be doing these in a careful and deliberate fashion so we are never in the position with China and Taiwan that some countries in Europe found themselves with Russia and Ukraine, and we don't empower and embolden the Chinese communists to go for the jugular in Taiwan because they think they have America over the economic barrel."

It was extremely detailed, and it set the groundwork for the tariffs that are still in place against various Chinese goods. Well, we're now up for review, but they've just decided, no, we're not going to do that. What does that portend on the Senate, the Senate leadership, especially if we take control of one or both houses of Congress next year, on continuing tariffs and investigations into Chinese practices?"

We've seen the kind of halting and hesitant half measures they've used in Ukraine for the last 15 days. They've been doing that with China for the last 15 months. As I said at the Reagan library this week, it's time that we examine free market orthodoxy when it comes to things like trade and immigration. Ronald Reagan knew this. That kind of free market orthodoxy has contributed importantly to domestic debates about tax policy or regulation. He brought taxes way down, he made regulations a lot more sensible. But it often falters when it gets to a world of borders. There's no obvious or natural number of people or goods or the amount of money that should cross borders. That's a decision for a sovereign people to make. It's vital that the Republican Party recognize that principle of Reagan's presidency and that we move away what became after Reagan's presidency, which is a slavish devotion to that kind of free market orthodoxy when it comes to trade policy."

This is someone who had it all -- a medical degree from Georgetown University of Medicine, the status of retired colonel in the U.S. Army. She could have had a lucrative career, a life of comfort and privilege. And she tossed it all aside to devote herself to the life of a religious sister, devoted to providing medical care to the needy and the undocumented in the District of Columbia. So this denial of a religious exemption to someone who says quite clearly that she can have nothing to do with abortion-connected vaccines developed from fetal cell lines, or tested from fetal cell lines, is just inexplicable. The only thing explanation I can think of is that this represents yet another example of an intersection of politics and bureaucratic intransigence, and religious liberty.

And I should say that the form letter, it's apparently a form letter, that denied the exemption request, doesn't dispute the sincerity of the Sister's beliefs, doesn't dispute her documentation of those beliefs, but instead appears to have inserted outside of the check boxes on the form the grounds that to grant the religious exemption to Sister would be an undue hardship on the D.C. health, meaning the D.C. health department, which is absurd. That's an employment standard. The employer, for example, says it would be an undue hardship if you don't work on Sundays. But D.C. health doesn't employ Sister. So it makes no sense.
