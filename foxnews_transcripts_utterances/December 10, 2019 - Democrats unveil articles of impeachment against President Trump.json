      "utterance": "The House Committee on the Judiciary is introducing two articles of impeachment charging the President of the United States Donald J. Trump with committing high crimes and misdemeanors. The first article is for abuse of power. This gives rise to the second article of impeachment for obstruction of Congress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "So that's it, two accusations that are so vague they can mean anything and nothing, which is the point. After all, when there is no crime, you've got to leave it to the imagination. And boy, is this open to interpretation. It's like a Rorschach test for the blind, which suits the media perfectly. Remember how this process was reverse engineered. It wasn't, \"Here is a crime, let's impeach.\" It was, \"Let's impeach and hope we find the crime.\" It's the holiday reboot of \"let's pass the bill to see what's in it,\" Pelosi's last big hit, and what a flop. Worse than Angry Birds 2. And we knew it, yet we still had to carry the farce, despite it featuring clowns who joked about Baron and played dishonestly edited clips of Trump. But while the press tortured viewers by pretending it mattered, one question remained; why didn't the Republicans just bolt? After all, we all knew it was just a stupid skit designed to make Dems feel good since they're immune to feeling stupid. The rest of us are left with what cops call the mess, meaning when thieves break into a house and find zilch, the only thing left to do is trash the place; hence, the amorphous abuse of power which anyone can now use on the Dems. And they should. I mean, when you move forward with a three-year witch trial, knowing the only sport will be partisan and therefore doomed to fail, while boasting that you'll keep doing it forever, isn't that an abuse of power? It's certainly an abuse of America's patience, institutions, trust, and cohesion, which makes it another media-assisted hoax, collusion, Covington, Kavanaugh, now this. If you want to find the lie, just look where the media points its cameras. I have a theory, Dana, I would like to share with you."

It reminds me of CNN and MSNBC, primarily Morning Joe, doing nonstop mocking coverage of Trump which the media and their ratings enjoyed, but got him elected. So, are they too stupid?

Both sides are completely locked in except in one place, and that is in the key battleground states; Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. And those states, in the last three months, impeachment has absolutely hurt the Democrats, and it has helped President Trump. If president -- if President Trump were to lose next November, it will not be because of impeachment."

First you have no collusion, and then there was no extortion, no bribery. They're just settling on things, Juan. They say, \"Obstruction of justice,\" because Trump said, \"I'll see you in court?\" Every president tells Congress, \"I'll see you in court.\" You can't impeach someone for saying, \"Let a judge decide.\" And then the other one, \"Abuse of power.\" By that standard, every single president could have been impeached by that very low standard. They tried to rush this thing. The American people saw that it was flimsy, and then they lost interest in it, and now everyone's just talking about football and the Irishman. This is what's going to happen: 10 of these Democrats in Trump districts now in the House, they want to censure. They don't even want to vote on impeachment. They're nervous. And like you said, you're right, Trump was losing to these three Democratic contenders in these battleground states a month ago."

But I think that's what is difficult for the average citizen to rap their brain around, is the fact that this writing is very amorphous. It is ambiguous. What does this mean? \"Wherefore President Trump, he's demonstrated he will remain a threat to national security.\" I'm used to a strategy that hits elements of a crime, that presents to a jury, \"Here are the elements of this crime, here is the code that is the law, and here is therefore why this defendant committed a crime.\" What we have here is literally a thesis."

And with these counts not being mutually exclusive, they're not joint -- or sorry, they're not joint, they're several, meaning, why don't we -- why isn't there more? If they were that intent on catching someone who was abusing power, then why wouldn't they try from A to Z and hoping one would stick because just one is enough to remove him from power if it's persuasive. The answer is, it's not."

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "What he's saying is that when you open up an investigation into an opposing political campaign, and if you're the FBI and you open it up based on foreign rumors, that is a very thin predicate to base that on. And not only did you just open up an investigation onto one 28-year-old who has a drunken conversation at a bar, you all of a sudden open on Flynn, open on Manafort, and open on Page. That is dramatic to do at that point. All he's saying is why didn't the FBI give a defensive briefing to the Trump campaign? People say, \"Oh well. You don't want to tip the Trump campaign off.\" Well, you went to the Russians."

You don't think they could've gone to Jeff Sessions and say, \"Hey, there's going to be some infiltration opportunity. Better watch out, there could be some issues. Let me show you how to deal with it?\" No. They investigated the Truman's campaign and not the Russians. Okay. Second point, the spying occurred. There was wiretapping and there was undercover agents that went in and secretly recorded Trump campaign officials. The dossier, according to the inspector general, was the \"central and essential document used to wiretap the campaign.\" The FBI lawyer said this was essentially a single-source FISA. And they drew almost entirely from the Steele dossier. That means Hillary bought a warrant. That means Hillary paid for foreign interference in an election. And they knew almost immediately the dossier was bogus because when they interviewed the source of Steele's ridiculous report, he said, \"Yeah, it's all, it's all nothing. It's all hearsay. It's all junk. Steele doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.\" And they continued for a year to lie about Steele, and to deceive the court, and to forge documents to make it look like Page was a bad guy when, in fact, he was a good guy."

They knew for years there was no collusion, yet they put the country through hell to build an obstruction case. This was not an unbiased investigation. I don't care what they say, they had no evidence of bias. That's just because they didn't even admit it. Of course, they're not dumb enough to admit it."

So, one of the things in the report the I.G. said is that there, that the warrants were justified, that there was evidence for it, and that they couldn't say what the other evidence is and that that, apparently, is because it must come from another source, like the CIA, perhaps?"

And this is not -- you know, Bill Barr's great at spin, apparently; I think better at spin than at being attorney general. And what he did with the Mueller report was he was able to preempt it and to try to define it before it was out in public. With this case, you know, you couldn't do it, Bill Barr, because guess what? Bill Barr, you have Robert Mueller working for you. You've got John Durham, who's report you're now going to control, working for you. But you don't have Michael Horowitz, the inspector general, working for you. He's independent. So, his analysis comes out and, as I said, the report is very clear: There was no political bias. None.

You know, the attorneys for the OIG, they take as testimony. True. They take as testimony fact. Meaning if someone says, nope, I am not biased. Then they will put that down and say, OK, then there was no bias. And I think the most important part, the crucial element to this is the fact that the attorney general has come out and said that there are gross and clear abuse of their surveillance process. And what we see here in these mistakes, which I refuse to call them, that they are clear omissions. As you said, it was always to one side. This includes these consensually monitored statements from both Page and Manafort that that was exculpatory if that if one of us was being prosecuted. And you learned that prosecution withheld consistently exculpatory evidence. And then the attorney general and says comes out and says during the investigation, it was consistently exculp -- everything we uncovered was to one side. Where do we stop? Where does the investigation stop? Why then did they keep going until they found a modicum, a tiny bit of evidence that went to the truth that they had already concluded?

There's never been this enthusiasm, in my opinion but the Republican Party. The Republicans have stuck together there's a witch hunt. It's a terrible thing. But even the Democrats, they couldn't find very much because they put up two articles that, frankly, are very weak and they're very weak. Also, they approved today of all days we've been waiting a year and they approved today, the USMCA and I call that the silver lining to impeachment, because without the impeachment, they would have never approved it, in my opinion. The impeachment is the reason they approved it and interestingly, one hour after the news conference, they went out and did a news conference on the big trade deal, the great trade deal, one of the greatest trade deals ever made for our country. And the reason is they wanted to muffle down the impeachment because they're embarrassed by it and they couldn't get the votes. And that's exactly what happened. So, it's a terrible thing when they do something like that. But now it goes to, I guess, a vote and I assume they will probably have to have the votes are very weak articles, but very importantly, today we get USMCA. And that's going to be a great thing for our farmers, our manufacturers, for our -- for just about everybody. That's good for everybody. Unions included. I spoke with Richard Trumka, I spoke to James Hoffa and we had good talks at the union people. I did that a few days ago. We had some very good talks. And everybody is really loving the USMCA so we're very happy about that. Very, very happy. Say it. Go ahead."

They've analyzed my conversation every way you can, and when you talk about, you know, the word \"favor\" was mentioned, and it was mentioned not me a favor, you just saw the way it was. And it was nothing to do with me. This has to do with the United States. The word was \"us,\" \"Can you do us a favor?\" Then we talked about the country. And we talked about seeing the attorney general of the United States. When you look at it -- and that was just a part of it. It was a congratulatory call. And there were two of them. Nobody even mentions the other one. We had another one where they won -- originally, he won the election. And I think it's a disgrace that people can make impeachment out of nothing. That was a perfect conversation. If you look at Mark Levin, he analyzed the conversation, one of the great Constitutional lawyers. Many of them have. They were perfect conversations. There's nothing to impeach on. And I think it's a disgrace. I think it's an absolute -- I think it's an absolute disgrace. So, let's say they vote on it. I don't know when they're going to vote. Who knows? All I know is they were very embarrassed by it, and that's why they brought up USMCA an hour after, because they figured it'll muffle it a little bit. And if you look at -- if you looked at the poll numbers, the Fire House poll just came out, and we're way ahead of everybody in every state, every -- you know, most of the -- I think most of the swing states, we're way ahead. And, you know what? I don't know if that's impeachment or the fact that we have the best economic numbers that we've ever had in our country, and the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers. We have the best numbers we've ever had in our country, so I think that has something to do with it. You saw on Friday 266,000 jobs, new jobs.
