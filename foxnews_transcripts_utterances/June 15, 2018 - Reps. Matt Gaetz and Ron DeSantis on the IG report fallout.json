Without a doubt this has been a momentous past few days for President Trump, his agenda and the nation. The President kicked off the week in Singapore for a historic and successful peach summit with North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-un. This was something that many analysts and ponders (ph) thought was totally impossible. But now we have hope that the total verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is possible. Next we learn that Trump successfully negotiated the U.S. bid to co-host the 2026 World Cup. Remember Obama pushed hard to host the World Cup but ultimately failed to win the bid. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This week we also got some very good news on the economic front.

Tonight he is in federal custody on this way to jail, where he will spend the next several months until his trial in September. Now the president is calling it a very tough sentence for someone who's represented Ronald Regan, Bob Dole and very unfair. But the reason a federal judge did this. Revoked his bail and put him in jail is because he's just been accused of attempting to tamper with witnesses in his federal tax and money laundering case. Last week the Special Counsel Robert Mueller accused Manafort of trying to contact witness by phone and through an encrypted messaging program. Mueller asked the Judge to either revise the terms of his bail, or send him to jail until trial. Well today in court the Judge said \"this isn't middle school. I can't take away his cell phone.\" So instead she took away his freedom for a few months. Well the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani responded by telling the New York Daily News when the Mueller probe is over \"things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons.\" He also said there was a good chance that President Trump will decide next week if he will sit down with the special counsel. Giuliani told the hill today that his mind is made up the president should not agree to an interview, especially after the IG's report. But Giuliani says that the president has not made up his own mind. Also next week there is a huge hearing on Capitol Hill. On Monday the FBI director and the Inspector General who just issued that blistering report. They will both be testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

It's an argument that so based on hyperbole that it's not a winning argument clearly because you don't want to -- you are arguing the facts and policy. But you mentioned that the president is having a pretty good week. I don't think too many people would disagree with that. Objective ones, anyway. I would also argue that he is having a pretty good year. When you think about the tax bill that was passed in late December, when you think what just happened with North Korea, obviously the ISIS that Sean mentioned 98 percent of it destroyed. And then I look at the polling numbers. And he was at 37 percent in the Real Clear Politics average. That's an average of eight polls. That is now going up seven points which is a lot considering how polarize we are to this point. And look, I made this point a couple of days ago. It's worth repeating. Ninety percent of the punditry in terms of North Korea was negative. And then I look at a poll today from Monmouth and it shows that 7 in 10 think it was a good idea. Reuters, the majority a proof. You want talk about a contrast between what we are saying in New York and Washington in the media capitals and what the rest of America is thinking in terms of polling you can't see a better disconnect than that in terms of the sentiment on the ground and the sentiment in newsrooms by pundits who are experts from former administration who probably are little bias in this situation because obviously they got nothing done with North Korea whether talking Bush or Obama.",

Donald Trump said let's get it done. Fly over there, I want to meet with this guy face-to-face and kind of deal. I can look into his eyes to figure out whether he is a man that wants to make a deal and explain the benefits that his country and his people will yield if we can do this in a constructive way, and I can make the world a safer place. And he did it. And the problem is, is everyone's head is spinning because he didn't do it the way that he was supposed to. And the reality is and this is the irony of it and Joe alluded to this a second ago. But everyone who has came before him got nothing done.

Without a doubt this has been a momentous past few days for President Trump, his agenda and the nation. The President kicked off the week in Singapore for a historic and successful peach summit with North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-un. This was something that many analysts and ponders (ph) thought was totally impossible. But now we have hope that the total verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is possible. Next we learn that Trump successfully negotiated the U.S. bid to co-host the 2026 World Cup. Remember Obama pushed hard to host the World Cup but ultimately failed to win the bid. This week we also got some very good news on the economic front. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta just increased its second quarter GDP growth forecast of 4.8 percent. That's more than double the average quarterly growth under President Obama. And yesterday the all-important IG report was released and its findings vindicated Presidents Trumps decision to fire Comey. And confirmed what we all know to be true about the deep state.

But the idea that you're going to have an obstruction of justice investigation. Because Trump fired the FBI director who the IG acknowledges had no business being FBI director is a farce. And then the other thing I think it undercuts is the whole genesis of this so called collusion narrative. They did not give that text message to the congress when we asked.

And you're in a position like that you probably can't go. If we just put a resolution on that floor Rosenstein should go and that passed he would be done. So it could happen.

And Congressman Gaetz thanks so much for being with us. And joining us now with more are the authors of the book, those great guys who wrote \"Let Trump Be Trump\". The inside story of his rise to the presidency, Fox News contributor David Bossie and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. All right guys. The inspector general's report for me, it was very sad. I-- you know I had seen and followed very closely for so many months all of the -- all of the wrongs, all of the biases that where so obvious.

This is outrageous that he is the center of this. He is clearly biased, somebody who hated this president and still does to this day. It is outrageous that he's still employed by the FBI. But more importantly, did the Judge who issued the FISA warrant know that he was involved? Did -- was this man involved with leaking the Manafort information two years ago? This investigation has been going on two years August. And he was involved 11 days later. We know that Strzok -- that there was a leak of the Manafort information.

All right that guy didn't work for the FBI. He wasn't biased. He wasn't handling Hillary Clinton and the anti-Trump and exposing his biases.

Hillary Clinton took classified emails, put it on an unclassified server, and those emails were hacked or at least accessible by a foreign entity. Why is there not a criminal referral for Hillary Clinton for not protecting classified information? You can think whatever you want of Paul Manafort. And you Paul and I aren't the best of friends. But the fact that Paul Manafort went off to jail today, when Hillary Clinton continues to walk free. When the IG says that she took classified e-mails put them on an unclassified server, and it says in the report that someone accessed that server from a foreign country, a foreign entity."

Through deregulation, though these tax cuts through and entrepreneurial spirit that he has brought to the presidency. It has been a great week on the economy. It has been a great week in him dealing with North Korea. Trying to denuclearize the Korean peninsula is something that is generationally important. And let me just say about the World Cup.

How does this guy fly back and forth to Singapore, do all the negotiating, all the stuff that he's doing and he's walking outside the White House today just greeting a bunch of press and people and answering every question.

They said you'll never get there. Now the Fed is saying maybe it's 4.8 percent. Because he never stops, he never gives up, he keeps fighting. He walked out and did that impromptu press conference with Fox today and I'm sure some of the staff said oh no, sir don't do that. Donald Trump is the best when he is Donald Trump. The book that Dave and I wrote \"Let Trump Be Trump\" is why he is successful, because he does things outside the norm. He stayed up for 25 hours strait on that airplane.

      "utterance": "Hey Judge. Well things just got very uncomfortable for Paul Manafort. Tonight he is in federal custody on this way to jail, where he will spend the next several months until his trial in September. Now the president is calling it a very tough sentence for someone who's represented Ronald Regan, Bob Dole and very unfair. But the reason a federal judge did this. Revoked his bail and put him in jail is because he's just been accused of attempting to tamper with witnesses in his federal tax and money laundering case. Last week the Special Counsel Robert Mueller accused Manafort of trying to contact witness by phone and through an encrypted messaging program. Mueller asked the Judge to either revise the terms of his bail, or send him to jail until trial. Well today in court the Judge said \"this isn't middle school. I can't take away his cell phone.\" So instead she took away his freedom for a few months. Well the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani responded by telling the New York Daily News when the Mueller probe is over \"things might get cleaned up with some presidential pardons.\" He also said there was a good chance that President Trump will decide next week if he will sit down with the special counsel. Giuliani told the hill today that his mind is made up the president should not agree to an interview, especially after the IG's report. But Giuliani says that the president has not made up his own mind. Also next week there is a huge hearing on Capitol Hill. On Monday the FBI director and the Inspector General who just issued that blistering report. They will both be testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. So Judge I know there's been a lot of must see TV hearing on Capitol Hill over the last year or so. But this one would defiantly be toward the top of the list."

You shut down the Manafort investigation and really everything kind of flitters away. Because the Trump investigations is going nowhere, there is no Russian collusion. And again it's a nice distraction from that IG report that confirms the Mueller operation was generated as a result of these crooked FBI agents who hated Donald Trump. Who set this thing in motion and where working for Mueller for a good period of time. Frankly the whole things been tainted. I'm thinking back to the Whitehurst scandal with the FBI labs.

So you'd expect him to be in defiance of everyone that he is a private citizen. Look, I have thought and I wrote a piece in the Hill, a higher disloyalty. I think that he really, you know, brought down the FBI. This clear to me that Hillary Clinton was the winner in this report because they said the actions were reasonable. I think Trump was a winner because the Strzok test really show the anti-Trump animus and I think Comey and the FBI were losers. They didn't operate in an even remotely professional way."

Sean, I mean, you had to work with those people for a significant period of time. Don't you think that they are losing their credibility? I mean, the facts are the facts. There's good news. I mean, we were supposed to have a nuclear war with North Korea. Now there is a promise of denuclearization. And we just got the World Cup, you think they'd be happy about that. But instead talking about concentration camps for kids what -- is this working to Donald Trump's benefit?"

      "utterance": "I think it is. And I would argue that they, in many cases, lost their credibility. It's not that they are losing it. I think that's why the president's numbers continue to tick up. The American people are smart enough to understand that the president is fighting for them, but more importantly he's getting results for them. And you know, whether it's economy, North Korea, ISIS, et cetera, the president is getting things done. People understand that their lives are better, their lives and safer. And I think what you continue to see expose is that these journalists in so many cases actually are really exposing their personal biases against not just conservatives, but against him. They continue to throw road block over road block in front of him because it will never be good enough. There will never be a bar high enough that Donald Trump will hit that they will give him the credit that he deserves. So, i most cases, half of what he has done would have been heralded as a huge triumph. But no matter how good the economy does, no matter how safe we continue to make this country under this leadership it will never be good enough."

      "utterance": "I think, judge, any time you bring up Nazi or you bring Hitler or you bring up the Third Reich, suddenly people their eyes glaze over. It's an argument that so based on hyperbole that it's not a winning argument clearly because you don't want to -- you are arguing the facts and policy. But you mentioned that the president is having a pretty good week. I don't think too many people would disagree with that. Objective ones, anyway. I would also argue that he is having a pretty good year. When you think about the tax bill that was passed in late December, when you think what just happened with North Korea, obviously the ISIS that Sean mentioned 98 percent of it destroyed. And then I look at the polling numbers. And he was at 37 percent in the Real Clear Politics average. That's an average of eight polls. That is now going up seven points which is a lot considering how polarize we are to this point. And look, I made this point a couple of days ago. It's worth repeating. Ninety percent of the punditry in terms of North Korea was negative. And then I look at a poll today from Monmouth and it shows that 7 in 10 think it was a good idea. Reuters, the majority a proof. You want talk about a contrast between what we are saying in New York and Washington in the media capitals and what the rest of America is thinking in terms of polling you can't see a better disconnect than that in terms of the sentiment on the ground and the sentiment in newsrooms by pundits who are experts from former administration who probably are little bias in this situation because obviously they got nothing done with North Korea whether talking Bush or Obama."

Maybe in six months I'll say I was wrong. I mean, it's that kind of honesty where he just comes out and says, look, right now I have every reason to believe there is going to be denuclearization. Every reason to bring back the tens of thousands of troops that we have over there. And you think that people would support him. Not a chance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Well, because look, this president is a disruptor. He is not following the norms of Washington. Had this been the previous administrations, number one, they would not have done it. But number two, they would have circulated 18 Power Points among 42 assistant secretaries that would have, you know, passed it on to the undersecretaries who would have 14 meetings. Donald Trump said let's get it done. Fly over there, I want to meet with this guy face-to-face and kind of deal. I can look into his eyes to figure out whether he is a man that wants to make a deal and explain the benefits that his country and his people will yield if we can do this in a constructive way, and I can make the world a safer place. And he did it. And the problem is, is everyone's head is spinning because he didn't do it the way that he was supposed to. And the reality is and this is the irony of it and Joe alluded to this a second ago. But everyone who has came before him got nothing done. So they may have followed all of this amazing process that's supposed to happen in Washington but that process has not yielded results. Donald Trump did it his way and he has with so many other things and gotten results that the American people can see are very, very tangible."

That explains why in fact his poll numbers are going up. I think the question of a trade war starting what he did at the G7 all too me as a Democrat are troubling. But to me, the largest questions can the president bridge the divide in the country and start to bring people together with say a compromise on immigration, the wall for DACA? If we can get there, then his numbers go from 40, 45 percent to over 50."

We have the same thing with Horowitz. We've got all of this evidence but we're going to give the FBI the benefit of the doubt and no criminal referral. Does that make sense to you?"

The same thing specifying specific misconduct and in the end saying we're not going to do anything about it. And Director Wray the audacity of just spending two minutes saying the FBI did some things and using this as an opportunity to glorify the FBI and shame us, patronize us about how wonderful the FBI is and not talk about how terrible this is and then talking about sensitivity training for FBI people to learn not to be biased when they're not supposed to be biased in the first place. But let me just say this, Judge Jeanine, people talk about this bias and that there was no nexus between the bias and the decision. There was pervasive bias. Don't -- don't make any mistake about it. It was widespread. Other people have said on your show it's all through the report. Regardless of what Horowitz says at the end, because he's afraid. He's given the benefit of the doubt to the FBI instead of the American people they're supposed to be protecting. But this isn't just a question of bias. This is a question of these people in the upper echelons of the FBI charged with this investigation of steering an investigation to a desired result."
