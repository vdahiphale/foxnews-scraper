      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "sentences": "-- has been made. Vice president, thank you very much for being here. You were here last here, and we're here again, Mike. Let me begin by saying our hearts go out to everyone affected by the devastating storms in Alabama, Georgia, and the surrounding states, and especially to the families of those who have tragically lost their lives. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I have spoken with Governor Ivey, and we are working closely with officials throughout the region to get our communities back on their feet. Attorney General Marshall and Attorney General Carr, when you get home, please tell the people of the great states of Alabama and Georgia that America has their backs. We have a call into Brian Kemp and we have let them know and the governor and everybody that we are with you 100 percent. Thank you very much. Hundred percent, we'll be there. Thank you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I want to thank your National Association president, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a friend of mine. We are also very grateful to be joined by our fantastic new attorney general, Bill Barr. Bill, thank you. Today, we join together to reaffirm and strengthen the vital partnership among state, local, and federal law enforcement. Only by working together can we ensure security for every community and deliver justice for every citizen. I want to take a moment to send a message this afternoon on behalf of everyone in this room to all law enforcement personnel across America. You are loved. You are cherished and respected by the American people more than you will ever know. So true, more than you will ever know. When I took office two years ago, one of my highest priorities was to reduce violent crime. In the two years before my inauguration, violent crime was up substantially, very substantially, and murders had increased by more than 20 percent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For this reason, my administration resurrected project safe neighborhoods, bringing together citizens groups, sheriffs and police departments to put dangerous offenders behind bars while supporting crime prevention and re- entry programs. Part of the reason we are doing well is that people are getting jobs because the economy may be the strongest it's ever been. All of your states are doing very well. I think we have the strongest economy perhaps ever. The lowest unemployment rate we've ever had. You could say 51 years or you could say ever, but groups, if you look at African-American, Asian- American, Hispanic-American, the lowest unemployment rate historically ever. So that helps a lot with what you do. We deployed 200 new violent crime prosecutors. We charged a record number of firearms offenders. Last year, we prosecuted the most violent criminals ever, the most ever in our history also. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } With your help and leadership, violent crime is now going down for the first time in a long time. Murders in America's largest cities have dropped by seven percent between 2016 and 2017. Last year, we passed historic legislation to combat the devastating opioid and drug crisis. I'm dealing with China right now on a very big trade deal, as you probably ever had heard. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Some of you are a little bit involved, but I can tell you I stood to President Xi that we cannot let fentanyl into our country. Almost 100 percent comes from China. It's devastating, as you know better than I do. It's devastating. He has promised to -- and they are in the process of doing. So, when I take him for his word, make it a criminal act with the highest level, which in China means the death penalty. That should have a massive impact on fentanyl coming into our country from China. This legislation expands life-saving treatment and authorizes funding for our local law enforcement to help those badly addicted get the treatment they need. Our state attorneys general are launching bold initiatives to fight this epidemic. In Arkansas, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, thank you. Thank you, Leslie. Great job you are doing. She has taken on the drug companies, launched a groundbreaking education program, and trained local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the opioid epidemic. So, Leslie, I want to thank you very. Everyone is talking about it. Great job. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But to defeat this deadly epidemic, America's southern border must be urgently and very strongly secured. We fight wars 6,000 miles away. We spend billions and billions of dollars, but we don't control our own border. Drug trafficking and human traffickers exploit our porous border to finance the ruthless operations across our hemisphere. One in three migrant women is sexually assaulted on the very dangerous journey north. Criminal cartels terrorize innocent people on both sides of the border. Thousands of our citizens are killed by lethal narcotics. Eight-eight thousand people just with certain types of drugs, most of which come through the southern border, 88,000 people die, and that's just a small portion of it. Hardworking people of every background pay the price for a lack of border control and security. In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults. These are new numbers, hard to believe. Thirty thousand sex crimes and 4,000 murders. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Every day, our brave ICE officers are on the front lines protecting our communities. We must always support the heroes of law enforcement, and we all support law enforcement in every way. Sanctuary cities that release known criminal aliens put all Americans at risk. I urge everyone here today to make sure that your states and cities are fully cooperating with the Department of Homeland Security in their life-saving mission. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We all share the same righteous goal: to build a future where every American, both immigrant and U.S.-born, can thrive in safety, dignity, harmony, and peace. Before Christmas, I was proud to sign historic bipartisan criminal justice reform into law, and I want to thank the National Association of Attorneys General for everything you did to help pass this first step act. And a special thanks to Attorney General Karl Racine. Where is Karl? Karl, Karl, Karl. Hi, Karl. Great job. Thank you very much. You were very helpful. Everyone said Karl. I feel like I know you.

Worse, it's a vegan steak not made from vegans, the ink from its cartridge is made from rice, peas and seaweed. Yes, seaweed, scrimp delicious. I don't know if that's a word. Well, take a look at that. Who needs a cow when you can have a beefy ribeye made by the same thing that prints your expense reports? The fake meat comes from a company in Spain takes 10 minutes to print, two minutes to cook, one minute to vomit. That sounds like the name of a cool movie, one minute to vomit, but it's better for the environment. And as you know that takes priority over real joy. Great taste or human need. The makers claim that this thing not only looks like steak, but has the same nutritional value and consistency meaning they're lying. If that looks like steak, I look like Brad Pitt. If that looks like steak, I've got a pair of old flip flops that looked like steak too. It's a lie, a lie meant to help the planet. It's like how they lie about other failed promises. Solar power, windmills, socialism, things that we are told would work, but can only exist as long as they leech off actual good stuff. I have a better idea. Instead of 3D printing a steak, 3D prints a cow and then kill it and make steaks from it. I'm really wasting my talents here.

      "utterance": "-- has been made. Vice president, thank you very much for being here. You were here last here, and we're here again, Mike. Let me begin by saying our hearts go out to everyone affected by the devastating storms in Alabama, Georgia, and the surrounding states, and especially to the families of those who have tragically lost their lives. I have spoken with Governor Ivey, and we are working closely with officials throughout the region to get our communities back on their feet. Attorney General Marshall and Attorney General Carr, when you get home, please tell the people of the great states of Alabama and Georgia that America has their backs. We have a call into Brian Kemp and we have let them know and the governor and everybody that we are with you 100 percent. Thank you very much. Hundred percent, we'll be there. Thank you. I want to thank your National Association president, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a friend of mine. We are also very grateful to be joined by our fantastic new attorney general, Bill Barr. Bill, thank you. Today, we join together to reaffirm and strengthen the vital partnership among state, local, and federal law enforcement. Only by working together can we ensure security for every community and deliver justice for every citizen. I want to take a moment to send a message this afternoon on behalf of everyone in this room to all law enforcement personnel across America. You are loved. You are cherished and respected by the American people more than you will ever know. So true, more than you will ever know. When I took office two years ago, one of my highest priorities was to reduce violent crime. In the two years before my inauguration, violent crime was up substantially, very substantially, and murders had increased by more than 20 percent. For this reason, my administration resurrected project safe neighborhoods, bringing together citizens groups, sheriffs and police departments to put dangerous offenders behind bars while supporting crime prevention and re- entry programs. Part of the reason we are doing well is that people are getting jobs because the economy may be the strongest it's ever been. All of your states are doing very well. I think we have the strongest economy perhaps ever. The lowest unemployment rate we've ever had. You could say 51 years or you could say ever, but groups, if you look at African-American, Asian- American, Hispanic-American, the lowest unemployment rate historically ever. So that helps a lot with what you do. We deployed 200 new violent crime prosecutors. We charged a record number of firearms offenders. Last year, we prosecuted the most violent criminals ever, the most ever in our history also. With your help and leadership, violent crime is now going down for the first time in a long time. Murders in America's largest cities have dropped by seven percent between 2016 and 2017. Last year, we passed historic legislation to combat the devastating opioid and drug crisis. I'm dealing with China right now on a very big trade deal, as you probably ever had heard. Some of you are a little bit involved, but I can tell you I stood to President Xi that we cannot let fentanyl into our country. Almost 100 percent comes from China. It's devastating, as you know better than I do. It's devastating. He has promised to -- and they are in the process of doing. So, when I take him for his word, make it a criminal act with the highest level, which in China means the death penalty. That should have a massive impact on fentanyl coming into our country from China. This legislation expands life-saving treatment and authorizes funding for our local law enforcement to help those badly addicted get the treatment they need. Our state attorneys general are launching bold initiatives to fight this epidemic. In Arkansas, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, thank you. Thank you, Leslie. Great job you are doing. She has taken on the drug companies, launched a groundbreaking education program, and trained local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the opioid epidemic. So, Leslie, I want to thank you very. Everyone is talking about it. Great job. But to defeat this deadly epidemic, America's southern border must be urgently and very strongly secured. We fight wars 6,000 miles away. We spend billions and billions of dollars, but we don't control our own border. Drug trafficking and human traffickers exploit our porous border to finance the ruthless operations across our hemisphere. One in three migrant women is sexually assaulted on the very dangerous journey north. Criminal cartels terrorize innocent people on both sides of the border. Thousands of our citizens are killed by lethal narcotics. Eight-eight thousand people just with certain types of drugs, most of which come through the southern border, 88,000 people die, and that's just a small portion of it. Hardworking people of every background pay the price for a lack of border control and security. In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults. These are new numbers, hard to believe. Thirty thousand sex crimes and 4,000 murders. Every day, our brave ICE officers are on the front lines protecting our communities. We must always support the heroes of law enforcement, and we all support law enforcement in every way. Sanctuary cities that release known criminal aliens put all Americans at risk. I urge everyone here today to make sure that your states and cities are fully cooperating with the Department of Homeland Security in their life-saving mission."

They are not telling them what it is. Also capitalism makes it possible to have really destructive ideas because capitalism, we are in the greatest system ever, allow idiots to entertain foolish ideas until they become adults and realize it's really capitalism that works and socialism that's destructive. I will give advice to Republicans which they will not take. Why don't you co-opt the promises of socialism? So socialism, that did they promise? They promised free health care, free education. A capitalist could figure out how to make things so cheap that they are almost free. When you look at TVs, let's say a 50-inch screen TV 20 years ago, was 10 grand, it's now like 150 bucks.

It's always somebody else's fault, which I don't think is the best way to show leadership. I also have to wonder, what is the crisis? She says we are a country in crisis. Where is it? I know that there are Democrats who are so upset and they think there is crisis. But every time that the president has walked up to a line that might actually get you to a place where you think that's not constitutional, the system kicks in and says, oh, actually, OK, fine. He knows now he can fire the so-and-so. The last thing I would say is the Clintons are not being sought after for advice this time around. We are entering a post-Clinton era, and it's very difficult.

You're seeing what I would call - for most of the world, peace, we still have issues in the Middle East, but we are seeing peace. We've seen it a demonstrated reduction in threat in North Korea, whether you like it or not. But yet we are told to believe by a segment of society, the media and Democrats combined that this country is under the control of a psychopath. So, we are a gateway - we are having a historic period of economic growth and low unemployment. People seem to be doing OK. If you turned off all politics, you wouldn't have any idea that we were living a life of hell. So, it's kind of when I said I hope that historians will look back and see this and talk about this thing like they were talking about, I don't know, a period of the tulips, a period of hysteria. Right. But I don't think they will, because historians are part of the same club that historians also believe right now that we're in a period of historical panic.

Worse, it's a vegan steak not made from vegans, the ink from its cartridge is made from rice, peas and seaweed. Yes, seaweed, scrimp delicious. I don't know if that's a word. Well, take a look at that. Who needs a cow when you can have a beefy ribeye made by the same thing that prints your expense reports? The fake meat comes from a company in Spain takes 10 minutes to print, two minutes to cook, one minute to vomit. That sounds like the name of a cool movie, one minute to vomit, but it's better for the environment. And as you know that takes priority over real joy. Great taste or human need. The makers claim that this thing not only looks like steak, but has the same nutritional value and consistency meaning they're lying. If that looks like steak, I look like Brad Pitt. If that looks like steak, I've got a pair of old flip flops that looked like steak too. It's a lie, a lie meant to help the planet. It's like how they lie about other failed promises. Solar power, windmills, socialism, things that we are told would work, but can only exist as long as they leech off actual good stuff. I have a better idea. Instead of 3D printing a steak, 3D prints a cow and then kill it and make steaks from it. I'm really wasting my talents here. All right, I'm going to say that even though I made fun of it I'm actually Dana for this idea, because I like the idea of making your own food. It's almost like cooking."

They were found safe and sound in a wooded area by their home on Sunday. Eight-year-old Leah and five-year-old Carolina were discovered by two fire fighters who were able to follow their tracks. You can see some of the video here from when they were discovered. They're dehydrated and cold but were in good spirits. Wilderness survival training apparently that they learned at their 4H club helped them survived uninjured, a good news story. Often these stories do not end well. This is a happy ending."
