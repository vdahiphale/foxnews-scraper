That he paid them to participate in this hoax attack and paid with a personal check. You ran down some of the information that he directed them to beat him up but not too bad.

We learned a lot of the bizarre details, and remarkable detail today through the Assistant State's Attorney Risa Lanier. Some of the things we learned is that one of the Osundario brothers who ended up key witnesses in this case, one of them was his source for the party drug, Molly. That he paid them to participate in this hoax attack and paid with a personal check. You ran down some of the information that he directed them to beat him up but not too bad. That he wanted the whole thing to play out in front of a security camera. And his awareness of that security camera is part of what tipped police off to the idea that something was fishy. Now, Smollett was scolded by Judge John Lyke, who said if all of this is true, it is utterly outrageous that you conjured up some of the greatest evil from our country. Specifically, the judge was referring to his use of a noose in this hoax attack. Now, Smollett's status with the show, \"Empire\" appears to be unchanged thus far. His attorney announced in court that he was scheduled to shoot this afternoon and indeed, when his SUV left the courthouse here, it went to the Cinespace studios, where Empire is shot. Martha?"

And you know, to contextualize you this way, Martha, as well, is that -- you know, there is never been trust between the black community and law enforcement in this country. We just didn't come here and get that when we got here. So, we're working on that. So, what this case epitomized by convicting -- you know, a Chicago police officer of murder, might had some kind of start there. And so, for this young man to be so socially blind, death and apathetic, and selfish if you will, that with all of this going on and everything happening, all he could think about was a pay raise.

Of 550 murders in 2018 in the city of Chicago.

Is the interpretation of why, why he would do this, and why we live in a -- in a world that as one writer, John McWhorter has branded victimhood chic where it's more impressive to people if you have been the victim of this kind of attack, then that you have made it onto a T.V. show, that you're talented, that you're singing, that this makes a bigger mark, Richard even than that."

I think first here, I mean, if this is a hoax and I think the words are used the word \"if\" is because just like you and everybody and them across the country, I believe in due process. And I think Jussie deserves his day in court to prove his innocence if he's indeed innocent. But if this is a hoax, you can't defend it. And here's why, because there are actually real crimes that happen to real people, right? They're real victims out there and these are people who I know personally. It happens in Washington, D.C., it happens in New York City, it happens in Atlanta where LGBTQ people of color are victimized. And when you lie about it, what you do is you put all of their stories at risk. And just think about the case of Ed Buck, who is the DNC super donor who has killed two black men."

And what he did also is that he disrespected the people, his fan base, the straight, the gay, the black, red, yellow, rich, poor, you know. He disrespected them. I mean, he makes probably as much money in one episode as most of those folk doing one year. And so, the greed factor there was so great. And this about him, it isn't about him being a black man, it isn't about him being a gay man, it's about him being a man without character. And I agree with Mr. Fowler, you know, he's innocent until proven guilty. But, my common sense and what my country mother would call mother with, this didn't smell right from the beginning.

And Jussie Smollett and the crime -- that are whatever we're dealing with here and what had went how this court case shakes out. What his character was able to do was have a conversation about homophobia in the African-American community in a real way. The season finale ended this season with him and his HIV-positive partner coming out to their family. And in dealing with that, which is something that the black community does not talk about. Now, with that being said, it doesn't take away from the reverend's comment. It doesn't take away from the fact that the CPD diverted resources to his case instead of cases of other cases in Chicago that deserved their attention.

Did they overstay that visa? And is that issue about birthright citizenship only when you have a job? If you're here on a diplomatic visa, if you're -- are you only a diplomat if you're employed at that moment? These I'm sure the questions the State Department has looked at. Mike Pompeo seems to be very firm in his understanding of where this stands and I think that we'll get more answers on this. But even separate from that, even if -- and this does have to be addressed because this is a unique dynamic for her. If there are American citizens in this case, I think Ted Cruz had a bill at one point that -- because you know, you can renounce your citizenship but it has to be very specific and formal. It seems to be a renouncing of your citizenship when you flee your country, condemn it, encourage people to kill other Americans, join with the enemy, give them aid and comfort, and who knows what else to facilitate war on America and the Western world.

The bottom line is Kamala Harris' story is the story of the American dream. She is the daughter of two immigrant parents, her father from Jamaica, her mother from India. She is an extraordinarily well-educated family. She has risen to become a U.S. senator, possibly the next president. And, in fact, we should not really and I know the right wing will focus on those comments and try to create an issue because we are dealing with an administration it's the most anti-family values administration in our country's history and that's really what the debate is going to be about in 2020."

And then my mom took me to get tested and we found out I had dyslexia and then I met a tutor that helped me figure out how I learned best. And I figure out I'm a kinesthetic learner, so I started to adjust. I started to do this with playbooks. I started to do with math. I started to do with English. All these things of how we wanted to learn. By the time I got to the University of Florida which is a very good academic school, I knew how I learned. I knew how I would want to study. I knew how I would want to practice. I knew how I could overcome these obstacles. That's also something I love sharing with young people is that just because you have a setback, it doesn't mean that you are not going to be better for it. Honestly, that could be one of the biggest blessings in your life because you have to learn how to overcome that and how to adapt. But when you do that, you are that much better for the long run."

Aaron was someone that for six months in a row did devotional with me and Coach Meyer. And he was someone that honestly probably went to the hospital to visit kids with me as much as any other teammate that I've ever had. But, you know, there is all things that we're all dealing with and you don't know what someone is going through. That's why it's so important to be there to help people because you don't know what's going on in the inside. And so, I just know that that was someone that we loved and cared for very deeply."
