Shoppers pulling back, as inflation takes a toll, retail sales dropping nearly 2 percent from the prior month, with department stores taking the biggest hits. Stocks also getting hit today, the Dow dropping almost 200 points, although it was down much more than that earlier. Now, today's report is raising worries about the economy and earnings. So how bad will this get? Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" To FOX Business' Gerri Willis. She's keeping track of all of it -- Gerri.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Charles. That's right. Retail sales falling 1.9 percent in December, a big slowdown at the holiday season's end, as both the Omicron variants and inflation surged. Retail shares today selling off, with Macy's, Target, Bath & Body Works falling, as you can see here. Also trading lower, bank stocks, after J.P. Morgan Chase lowered its earnings guidance, saying headwinds of higher expenses and moderating revenue will cause returns to fall. Citigroup shares were lower as well, as the company reported lower net income. Meanwhile, the lower retail numbers revealed troubles for Americans and their budgets. Wages are increasing as workers face high demand in the tightest labor market in years. But families are also facing high inflation and rising household debt. As a result, the U.S. worker is actually worse off than they were a year ago. Here are the numbers, the Labor Department reporting on Friday that average hourly earnings for employees declined 2.4 percent from the same month a year ago, when factoring in rising consumer prices. Debt also playing a role here. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the average family as of the third quarter of 2021 owes $155 -- $155,622 -- pardon me -- that's up 6.2 percent from a year ago, when you combine mortgages, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, auto loans, and student loans. All of this as government aid in the form of sweetened jobless benefits and stimulus checks have expired. And if you needed any more evidence of the difficulty for Americans right now when it comes to their money, credit card debt is rising and savings rates, well, guess what, they're falling -- Charles, back to you.",

And let's bring in economist Steve Moore, along with retail watcher Hitha Herzog. Steve, let me start with you. And I will add one other thing before you start. Consumer sentiment was out today as well, the second lowest number in a decade. So what's it all pointing to?",

      "sentences": "Well, I call it, Charles, the big squeeze. And this is the squeeze on workers' incomes, which actually were up by about 4.5 percent it last year. The problem is, they faced 7 percent inflation. So they lost -- workers basically lost almost 2.5 percent of their purchasing power when it comes to the money they make in their paychecks. And that's causing a lot of economic anxiety. You can see it, by the way, when you go to the gas station. I was in the checkout counter yesterday at the grocery store. People were grumbling about how much they're paying for everything from milk to bananas to eggs and steak. And I don't see any end in sight right now, Charles. When you have prices up by 7 percent at the consumer level, and you have got the producer prices up 10 percent, it means that eventually those higher costs are going to get passed on to consumers. So the Federal Reserve Board better get going quickly in dealing with this crisis. And one other quick thing, Charles. We do not need another $5 trillion spending bill. That would be like giving a cancer patient a pack of Marlboro cigarettes. It'd be terrible for the economy.",

So, just to give you an idea, Charles, there was a grocery store CEO that was saying that about 8 percent of his labor force is out. And during this time -- this is because of the Omicron variant. People are sick and people are just not coming to work. But during this time period, usually, it's around 2 percent. So, 8 percent doesn't sound like a lot, but when you compare it to the 2 percent, it's significant. And then, as we were talking about, rising prices of product, and you're seeing the short supply just on the supply chain as well. That becomes a real issue for the consumer.",

As you point out, the major cities are seeing the biggest spikes. On Wednesday here in New York City, in just about one's hour span of time, there were three separate carjackings. The aftermath of one of the most brazen was caught on video in Midtown at the start of rush hour. The driver of an Audi SUV was threatened with a Taser. A police officer tried to stop the thief. But he was able to speed off, but smashing into another car. He's still being sought. In Philadelphia that same day, two carjackers were not as lucky. They were taken into custody after rear-ending a Chevy Impala, only to discover the driver was an off-duty city cop who took them into custody. And only yesterday in Philadelphia, a driver opened fire, seriously injuring an armed teenager who attempted to take his white Pontiac. Now, anyone can be a target. In December, Pennsylvania Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon had her car taken at gunpoint. And in suburban Chicago, an Illinois state senator and her husband had their Mercedes stolen after three masked men open fire. The latest statistics show that, in 2021, there were 757 carjackings in Philadelphia. And that's a 34 percent increase over the previous year. In New York City, 511 carjackings, that's up 56 percent. In Chicago, 1,836 incidents, a 30 percent spike. And in the nation's capital, 426, up 18 percent.

      "sentences": "Hey, Charles, yes. Rare when you get a storm that has such big impacts for so many people. This is one of those storms that we're going to be talking about that has really big impacts for about three to four days. We're already in the middle of it. Now, first off, there's one storm you see here off the coast of the East Coast. That is kind of a fish storm, because that's setting the initial stage and it's going to bring really cold air. Get ready for temps that are going to feel below zero this weekend again across parts of the Northeast. This, however, is a storm that's brought already about a foot of snow to parts of North Dakota. And that's the storm that is our next three-day-or- so storm maker, starting off tonight into tomorrow morning, more snow, up to about a foot of snow, across some spots of Central Iowa. Then we transition to the Southern portion of the storm that's going to have snow again, places like Nashville that have seen a ton of winter weather already. We're going to get another storm here. But you will notice here winter storm watches, warnings in effect where you see that purple? And that pink there is an ice storm warning in effect. And that I think could be some of our most damaging piece from this entire storm, areas around Greenville, South Carolina, up towards Greensboro, North Carolina. Charlotte, we're going to be talking about some very significant icing with this. Some of that could be really damaging and probably have some big power impacts. Power outages will be very, very significant. That's what you're looking at, that pink there. That happens for us into the morning hours throughout the day on Saturday. Then, by Sunday afternoon, storm moves in across parts of the Northeast. You will notice, though, storm looks at this point that it takes a little bit farther westerly track. That brings warmer air back in along the cities of I-95 Corridor, and probably where we will see a little bit of snow to start, likely crossing over into some rain afterwards. That would probably melt any of that snow, maybe make some of that slushy issue that we deal with across the city sometimes. Notice where the winter weather watches are in effect, winter storm watches all across the interior sections. For now, it is not across the I-95 Corridor, because we expect this from take a little bit further westerly track. When you look at the snow forecast, you see the heaviness of the snow, some spots over a foot, again, once you get up across the higher elevations of the Appalachians and in across parts of the Northeast. The cities I will tell you, Charles, we're still about three days out from where the cities are going to have these impacts from the storm or, say, 2.5 days. Storm deviation 30 miles or so, could have much bigger impacts for the cities. A little bit of time to watch that, but, overall, a lot going on this weekend in weather -- Charles.",

Shoppers pulling back, as inflation takes a toll, retail sales dropping nearly 2 percent from the prior month, with department stores taking the biggest hits. Stocks also getting hit today, the Dow dropping almost 200 points, although it was down much more than that earlier. Now, today's report is raising worries about the economy and earnings. So how bad will this get? Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" To FOX Business' Gerri Willis. She's keeping track of all of it -- Gerri."

      "utterance": "Hey, Charles. That's right. Retail sales falling 1.9 percent in December, a big slowdown at the holiday season's end, as both the Omicron variants and inflation surged. Retail shares today selling off, with Macy's, Target, Bath & Body Works falling, as you can see here. Also trading lower, bank stocks, after J.P. Morgan Chase lowered its earnings guidance, saying headwinds of higher expenses and moderating revenue will cause returns to fall. Citigroup shares were lower as well, as the company reported lower net income. Meanwhile, the lower retail numbers revealed troubles for Americans and their budgets. Wages are increasing as workers face high demand in the tightest labor market in years. But families are also facing high inflation and rising household debt. As a result, the U.S. worker is actually worse off than they were a year ago. Here are the numbers, the Labor Department reporting on Friday that average hourly earnings for employees declined 2.4 percent from the same month a year ago, when factoring in rising consumer prices. Debt also playing a role here. According to the New York Federal Reserve, the average family as of the third quarter of 2021 owes $155 -- $155,622 -- pardon me -- that's up 6.2 percent from a year ago, when you combine mortgages, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, auto loans, and student loans. All of this as government aid in the form of sweetened jobless benefits and stimulus checks have expired. And if you needed any more evidence of the difficulty for Americans right now when it comes to their money, credit card debt is rising and savings rates, well, guess what, they're falling -- Charles, back to you."

And let's bring in economist Steve Moore, along with retail watcher Hitha Herzog. Steve, let me start with you. And I will add one other thing before you start. Consumer sentiment was out today as well, the second lowest number in a decade. So what's it all pointing to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEPHEN MOORE, FORMER DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER",
      "utterance": "Well, I call it, Charles, the big squeeze. And this is the squeeze on workers' incomes, which actually were up by about 4.5 percent it last year. The problem is, they faced 7 percent inflation. So they lost -- workers basically lost almost 2.5 percent of their purchasing power when it comes to the money they make in their paychecks. And that's causing a lot of economic anxiety. You can see it, by the way, when you go to the gas station. I was in the checkout counter yesterday at the grocery store. People were grumbling about how much they're paying for everything from milk to bananas to eggs and steak. And I don't see any end in sight right now, Charles. When you have prices up by 7 percent at the consumer level, and you have got the producer prices up 10 percent, it means that eventually those higher costs are going to get passed on to consumers. So the Federal Reserve Board better get going quickly in dealing with this crisis. And one other quick thing, Charles. We do not need another $5 trillion spending bill. That would be like giving a cancer patient a pack of Marlboro cigarettes. It'd be terrible for the economy."
    },

      "utterance": "You know, we're looking not just at department stores and retailers that are selling clothing and items that people were buying during the holiday, but also the grocery stores. And while we're seeing this increase in product, we're also seeing a labor shortage. So, just to give you an idea, Charles, there was a grocery store CEO that was saying that about 8 percent of his labor force is out. And during this time -- this is because of the Omicron variant. People are sick and people are just not coming to work. But during this time period, usually, it's around 2 percent. So, 8 percent doesn't sound like a lot, but when you compare it to the 2 percent, it's significant. And then, as we were talking about, rising prices of product, and you're seeing the short supply just on the supply chain as well. That becomes a real issue for the consumer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Steve, I find it amazing, because you got economists, particularly those who are advising the White House -- and I'm going to say Mark Zandi out loud, because he's the main one -- who keep saying how great this economy is doing. And yet we saw retail sales missed by a mile. We saw the jobs number, another complete disaster, consumer sentiment a disaster. The banks reported earnings. J.P. Morgan's stock was down the most today than it's been done in any single session in 20 years. I feel like the markets are telling us we should be doing something different than what we're doing now. And maybe -- and maybe it's time, like you said earlier, to put a halt to this sort of free money economy, because it's backfiring."

      "speaker": "MOORE",

Biden comes in, spends another $3 trillion or $4 trillion. He wants another $5 trillion on top of that, I mean, we're just deluging the economy with cheap money and debt and with -- of course, the Fed is accommodating that by printing more money. And, obviously, that's going to lead to inflation. I mean, it was so predictable. And now the Fed -- by the way, if you notice, Charles, the Fed is finally saying we're worried about the idea that it's not transitory now. They say it might become entrenched."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",

I mean, is there any -- it's tough in this environment to really be able to say to people, hey, buy a cheaper cut of meat when you go to the butcher. But, I mean, that's the solution, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERZOG",
      "utterance": "Well, that and also shop local. So we were talking about -- on FOX Business earlier about the small businesses. A lot of these small businesses, especially the grocery stores, have a 79 percent brick-and-mortar presence, according to the Data Catalyst Institute. So these small businesses are way more nimble than the big box stores. They are able to sell things online, get groceries to people more quickly. There are shorter lines. So if you are a small business and you have local grocery stores near you, or you have small businesses, that you need to get those -- those significant supplies for your home, you hit -- you go to them, instead of going to the big box stores."

And they didn't want an agency to make such a sweeping decision affecting over 80 million workers, basically, on their own fiat, on their own discretion. They said Congress needs to make these decisions. That's where the representatives of the people reside. And I think that what they were worried about is that agencies can become a type of fourth branch. And that's one too many in a tripartite constitutional system. And so while everyone is -- not everyone, but many people are vilifying the court, they were actually trying to use the democratic process to say that's the process where you make tough decisions, where you have to justify them and get the votes to support them."

And intelligence today suggests he's putting in place both of those things to move ahead.

And what he's gotten a response is weakness, appeasement and mere words. You remember he allowed Russian hackers to shut down a pipeline inside the United States. For several days, we couldn't get gasoline in the Southeast part of the United States from the Colonial Pipeline. It seems like a long time ago. It's not. It happened on President Biden's watch. We have we have watched him push us around in Southeast Ukraine. We have watched his work in Belarus and in Kazakstan. He has made very clear that he is going to push until he sees word -- excuse me -- deeds, not words from the administration. When we say, you shut our pipeline down, well, don't do it again, or you -- you act in a way that says I'm going to dominate European energy by completing a pipeline, and we say, sure, go ahead, we're not going to sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, when he sees that from America, he's not going to stop until steel meets steel and he sees that there is real American resolve. They need to take this on immediately. They can't wait. I don't think there's much left to talk to the Russians about. Everybody's staked out their positions.

It was an enormous mistake, although I was glad to see that there were a handful of Democrats that opposed their own president, their own party's president, and decided to support what would have made sense, which is what we did in the Trump administration, sanction that pipeline and make sure that Russia can't dominate Ukraine and Germany when it comes to energy."

So this is why he's highlighting the infrastructure bill. And I think he's going to try to find more like-minded Republicans, because, right now, you cannot simply let Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema control the entire agenda of the American people. We have an agenda that 81 million people voted for just last year. So he wants to make sure that he's able to execute that for the American people."

If you're going to do it, stand up and speak for 20 hours straight if you want to actually filibuster, instead of just writing a little letter. I think the American people want a Washington that works. They want to actually have the machinery of government moving, and they need a president who's willing to do what it takes to get that happening.

They better be careful that, yes, let's stand up, because they might find themselves after the midterm having -- maybe just having to skip the whole thing altogether.

And I think this is the one area that a lot of people are a little bit frustrated with, even we heard some Democrats this week, with the tone that President Biden has been using.

He's lashing out against conservatives and Republicans, by the way, the people who saved him on infrastructure.

As you point out, the major cities are seeing the biggest spikes. On Wednesday here in New York City, in just about one's hour span of time, there were three separate carjackings. The aftermath of one of the most brazen was caught on video in Midtown at the start of rush hour. The driver of an Audi SUV was threatened with a Taser. A police officer tried to stop the thief. But he was able to speed off, but smashing into another car. He's still being sought. In Philadelphia that same day, two carjackers were not as lucky. They were taken into custody after rear-ending a Chevy Impala, only to discover the driver was an off-duty city cop who took them into custody. And only yesterday in Philadelphia, a driver opened fire, seriously injuring an armed teenager who attempted to take his white Pontiac. Now, anyone can be a target. In December, Pennsylvania Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon had her car taken at gunpoint. And in suburban Chicago, an Illinois state senator and her husband had their Mercedes stolen after three masked men open fire. The latest statistics show that, in 2021, there were 757 carjackings in Philadelphia. And that's a 34 percent increase over the previous year. In New York City, 511 carjackings, that's up 56 percent. In Chicago, 1,836 incidents, a 30 percent spike. And in the nation's capital, 426, up 18 percent.

He had seven previous arrests for violent crime. We are letting things get out of control. District attorney Bragg doesn't understand what his job is. It's not to legislate the law.

The police have to become more assertive even in the face that their crimes are not -- that they arrest people for are not going to be prosecuted. Richmond did an interesting thing a few years ago, when they were overrun with gangsters carrying guns. They did something called Operation Exile, where they got the U.S. attorney to prosecute all of these criminals and send them far, far away from their homes to prison. I don't know if the U.S. attorney in the district, Southern District of New York, could do that. But we really have to come up with something creative, because the district attorney is going to cause more and more people to be victims of crime. It's going to come to the Upper East Side. It's going to come to the Upper West side. Just be prepared."

I hope we can -- unfortunately, I think we will have to, but I want to -- so many more things I want to talk to you about this, because I also want to get into the sentencing. I just think it's nuts how quickly some of these violent folks get out of prison or don't go at all. Commissioner, thank you so much."

    },

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Snow no, a major storm set to deliver a wintry wall up over the weekend. And it could impact as many as 75 million Americans. FOX Weather chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth has more on where it's headed -- Rick."

      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Hey, Charles, yes. Rare when you get a storm that has such big impacts for so many people. This is one of those storms that we're going to be talking about that has really big impacts for about three to four days. We're already in the middle of it. Now, first off, there's one storm you see here off the coast of the East Coast. That is kind of a fish storm, because that's setting the initial stage and it's going to bring really cold air. Get ready for temps that are going to feel below zero this weekend again across parts of the Northeast. This, however, is a storm that's brought already about a foot of snow to parts of North Dakota. And that's the storm that is our next three-day-or- so storm maker, starting off tonight into tomorrow morning, more snow, up to about a foot of snow, across some spots of Central Iowa. Then we transition to the Southern portion of the storm that's going to have snow again, places like Nashville that have seen a ton of winter weather already. We're going to get another storm here. But you will notice here winter storm watches, warnings in effect where you see that purple? And that pink there is an ice storm warning in effect. And that I think could be some of our most damaging piece from this entire storm, areas around Greenville, South Carolina, up towards Greensboro, North Carolina. Charlotte, we're going to be talking about some very significant icing with this. Some of that could be really damaging and probably have some big power impacts. Power outages will be very, very significant. That's what you're looking at, that pink there. That happens for us into the morning hours throughout the day on Saturday. Then, by Sunday afternoon, storm moves in across parts of the Northeast. You will notice, though, storm looks at this point that it takes a little bit farther westerly track. That brings warmer air back in along the cities of I-95 Corridor, and probably where we will see a little bit of snow to start, likely crossing over into some rain afterwards. That would probably melt any of that snow, maybe make some of that slushy issue that we deal with across the city sometimes. Notice where the winter weather watches are in effect, winter storm watches all across the interior sections. For now, it is not across the I-95 Corridor, because we expect this from take a little bit further westerly track. When you look at the snow forecast, you see the heaviness of the snow, some spots over a foot, again, once you get up across the higher elevations of the Appalachians and in across parts of the Northeast. The cities I will tell you, Charles, we're still about three days out from where the cities are going to have these impacts from the storm or, say, 2.5 days. Storm deviation 30 miles or so, could have much bigger impacts for the cities. A little bit of time to watch that, but, overall, a lot going on this weekend in weather -- Charles."

A new poll finding 11 percent of adults are drinking alcohol more than they were before the pandemic, but is that all? \"FOX Across America\" host Jimmy Failla and FOX Nation host Abby Hornacek with us now. Only 11 percent, Jimmy, that seems low, I got to be honest. You buying that? JIMMY FAILLA, HOST, \"FOX ACROSS AMERICA\": I actually am buying that. You want to know why, C.Payne? Because at this point in the lockdowns, I think more people have moved on to much stronger stuff than alcohol."

You thought jumbo shrimp was an oxymoron. Hard seltzer. Drinks you some hard seltzer. Give me a break. Go ahead, Jimmy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAILLA",
      "utterance": "Oh, no, it's so -- it's so true. All of that hard seltzer junk is catered to people who don't want to drink. Like, if you want to drink, drink alcohol. Like, that's the kind of stuff I would have snuck when I was in high school, not that a high school kid should ever do that. But if you have seen my grades, there's no way I'm going to be able to deny my high school activities."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "All right, the mask, right? The mask might be doing a lot more than protecting your health, folks. There's a new study finding that women rated men wearing face masks as -- quote -- \"significantly more attractive.\" Jimmy, significantly more attractive. Maybe reason to keep them around."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAILLA",
      "utterance": "Yes, I know. And I will say this. I will say this, C.Payne, OK? Here's the mask. Look at how much of my face is covered right now, OK? And what that means -- and everybody at home has had this experience where you meet someone, you think they're good looking with the mask on, and then the mask comes off, and you're like, who let the creature from the Black Lagoon in here? This is terrible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAILLA",
      "utterance": "And if you haven't had that experience, that means you were the person who took off your mask and freaked somebody out."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Abby?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HORNACEK",
      "utterance": "Well, this was such a funny study to me, because I remember when masks first started being implemented, all of my single friends were like, oh, my gosh, how am I going to find my person? They can't see my face. I can't see their face. And now it turns out that both of them are more attractive, so that I would love to see the dating numbers at this point. But here's here's my theory. I think that people find other people more attractive with the mask because they love intrigue, right? It's like, what's underneath the mask? Do they have a beard? Do they have a strong jawline? Are they a baby face? I don't know. And so I think that's what it all boils down to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "So, when you make that -- Abby, what happens when, OK, because Jimmy is like, hey, I got the mask. I'm doing great. We're hitting it off pretty good. Do you break someone's heart when they take it off, and you're like, whoa?"

      "speaker": "FAILLA",
      "utterance": "No."

Let me tell you, where we're going right now with these tattoos, that's the only thing left, is to tattoo the whole face, the whole grill. Jimmy, you look good with it or without it, though, my friend. Thank you both very much. Have a fantastic weekend."
