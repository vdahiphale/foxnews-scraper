They would like to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, by force, if necessary. Xi Jinping keeps saying this, and a lot of people in the elite Wall Street world, in the elite big tech world, in the elite Hollywood world keep discounting it, despite the fact that he keeps saying it. But, of course, Xi Jinping would love to achieve that reunification without force if possible. And the way to do that is through psychological warfare. It's through economic coercion. It's through political warfare. And that's really what President Tsai of Taiwan has been warning us about. It's what she calls cognitive warfare. So it's important for the American people not to be intimidated. And the fact that the Chinese were throwing a temper tantrum about the speaker of the House meeting with the democratically elected leader of Taiwan on American soil just shows you how sensitive they are. We need not to back down. We need to stand up for freedom. And we need to support our friends in Taiwan, specifically by giving them the weapons that they have purchased from us, which have been backlogged. We have a $19 billion backlog of weapons. That's unacceptable, Sean. We need to be moving heaven and earth to surge power out to the Indo- Pacific before it's too late, before we have another war on our hands.",

We could also explore licensing certain weapons systems so the Taiwanese could produce them domestically. But, at the end of the day, it just comes down to energy and focus and prioritization from the executive branch. We need the secretary of defense himself to get involved, to make this a daily priority for the backlog to get cleared. And I have seen no evidence of that from the Biden administration thus far.",

We have seen it in a variety of domestic institutions that have been corrupted by the Chinese Communist Party and by economic incentives. So, we have -- in many cases, we have become addicted to access to the Chinese market. And so, luckily, those protesters didn't disrupt the actual event. The event was a very positive one. It was a bipartisan event. We had legislators on both sides of the aisle. Speaker McCarthy did a fantastic job standing up to CCP coercion. And, again, it gets back to the basic point. We can't allow ourselves to be intimidated by these united front work tactics. It's just -- it's not going to work here in America. That's the message we need to send.

I cannot fathom just their willingness to do this. And look at what happened on the world stage after our shameful surrender in Afghanistan. Well, Vladimir Putin took one look at that and decided, you know, America looks really weak right now. I'm going to invade Ukraine. And for them to brag about the success of our effort in Ukraine ignores the simple fact that deterrence failed in Ukraine. And even in the best-case scenario, tens of thousands of people are going to die, hundreds of thousands of people are going to be displaced, and hundreds of billions of dollars are going to be lost because deterrence failures are costly.

So this blaming of Trump, this passing of the buck to the previous administration, we have seen it time and time again. And here's why I think this is very important, Sean. It's not just a matter of the blame game. It's a matter of learning the right lessons from the failure of deterrence in Ukraine, so that we don't repeat those same mistakes in Asia across the Taiwan Strait. We need to understand why deterrence fails, so that deterrence can hold in Taiwan, so we don't find ourselves fighting a kinetic war with the Chinese Communist Party, which is far more powerful than Russia right now. Russia is merely Xi Jinping's junior partner in a new Cold War that they have launched against the West.

What does this mean for Chicago's municipal government? Will now be a fully owned subsidiary of the Chicago Teachers Union. Can you imagine what the union contracts are going to look like? This is in a city where roughly two dozen schools, zero children can read or write at a proficiency level.\" For more, let's bring in former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. Matt, good to see you. So, here, I have got to tell you what. I love the statement from that sheriff, finally, an elected official standing up and going, you know what? Gun laws don't save lives. Guns aren't the problem. It's people who pick up guns and cause the crime.",

But it's also a lack of enforcement of the low-level -- what the left would call low-level crimes like burglaries, how these people obtain this gun in the first place? And you -- as a prosecutor, Sean, you know that it's those early crimes in a criminal's career that, if they're punished for them, and if that -- if they understand that there are consequences for their actions, that you might be able to change the behavior.

So, one of the things we're going to do is going to leverage and build on those energy jobs. When people talk about the amount of electric cars that might come into the marketplace, how do people think that that those cars are going to get fueled up? You're going to need good old-fashioned coal. You're going to need natural gas. You're going to need a lot of the fossil fuels that are currently online. And so, in West Virginia, we produce with abundance. So one thing we do is, we leverage our energy resources. Then we're going to drive educational attainment and work force and population growth.

It's a plan out of the liberal playbook, but the courts can be very useful, very effective. Also in West Virginia, it's going to be fascinating to watch if Joe Manchin runs for reelection as the next senator of that state. He was one who voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, which has nothing to do with inflation reduction. It actually is Joe Biden and AOC's effort to bring in the Green New Deal. He voted for it.

      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Well, Sean, clearly, the Chinese Communist Party is trying to intimidate us. They're trying to bully us. They're massive bullies on the world stage. They would like to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, by force, if necessary. Xi Jinping keeps saying this, and a lot of people in the elite Wall Street world, in the elite big tech world, in the elite Hollywood world keep discounting it, despite the fact that he keeps saying it. But, of course, Xi Jinping would love to achieve that reunification without force if possible. And the way to do that is through psychological warfare. It's through economic coercion. It's through political warfare. And that's really what President Tsai of Taiwan has been warning us about. It's what she calls cognitive warfare. So it's important for the American people not to be intimidated. And the fact that the Chinese were throwing a temper tantrum about the speaker of the House meeting with the democratically elected leader of Taiwan on American soil just shows you how sensitive they are. We need not to back down. We need to stand up for freedom. And we need to support our friends in Taiwan, specifically by giving them the weapons that they have purchased from us, which have been backlogged. We have a $19 billion backlog of weapons. That's unacceptable, Sean. We need to be moving heaven and earth to surge power out to the Indo- Pacific before it's too late, before we have another war on our hands."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "I think, if you look at the $19 billion, there's many different items involved in that. I think the Harpoon anti-ship missiles are the most important. I remain convinced that there's more we can do to move Taiwan to the front of the line, ahead of Saudi Arabia, for example, when it comes to Harpoon deliveries, as well as take the Harpoon missiles that we're putting into deep storage, that we're de-milling, and change around a few aspects of them so that we can deliver them to Taiwan. We could also explore licensing certain weapons systems so the Taiwanese could produce them domestically. But, at the end of the day, it just comes down to energy and focus and prioritization from the executive branch. We need the secretary of defense himself to get involved, to make this a daily priority for the backlog to get cleared. And I have seen no evidence of that from the Biden administration thus far."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "I want to go back to the Taiwan meeting, because China trying to use our laws and our norms to protest. They were paying $400 per protester to go to the Ronald Reagan ranch and break up, bust up your meeting, try to show that people were organically opposed to you all meeting with the Taiwan president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is a perfect microcosm of the way the Chinese Communist Party operates through something called United Front Work. They basically bribe people on American soil to do their bidding. We have seen this in industry after industry. We have seen this in higher education. We have seen it in Wall Street. We have seen it in a variety of domestic institutions that have been corrupted by the Chinese Communist Party and by economic incentives. So, we have -- in many cases, we have become addicted to access to the Chinese market. And so, luckily, those protesters didn't disrupt the actual event. The event was a very positive one. It was a bipartisan event. We had legislators on both sides of the aisle. Speaker McCarthy did a fantastic job standing up to CCP coercion. And, again, it gets back to the basic point. We can't allow ourselves to be intimidated by these united front work tactics. It's just -- it's not going to work here in America. That's the message we need to send. The other thing, Sean, it's further evidence that this isn't just an over-there threat. This is a right-here-at-home threat."

      "utterance": "I don't know what universe Kirby is living in. I mean, it was the definition of chaos. It was dishonorable. It was shameful. It was humiliating. And Kirby, as a military officer, should know better. We're talking about 13 Americans dead who didn't need to die, Sean, hundreds of Americans that we abandoned behind enemy lines. And for them to minimize this, for them to try and just dump this report on a Thursday night, hoping nobody would notice, and then, if you read the contents of the report, it's quite literally insane, Sean, trying to gaslight the American people. I cannot fathom just their willingness to do this. And look at what happened on the world stage after our shameful surrender in Afghanistan. Well, Vladimir Putin took one look at that and decided, you know, America looks really weak right now. I'm going to invade Ukraine. And for them to brag about the success of our effort in Ukraine ignores the simple fact that deterrence failed in Ukraine. And even in the best-case scenario, tens of thousands of people are going to die, hundreds of thousands of people are going to be displaced, and hundreds of billions of dollars are going to be lost because deterrence failures are costly. And as the old saying goes, Sean, war is hell. This is nothing to brag about. This is just complete, shameful lies from the White House that we're seeing on Afghanistan."

      "utterance": "Listen, the Biden administration didn't follow any of our plans that we had as we did the transition in January from the Trump to the Biden administration. They basically ripped them up. They didn't do anything that we said. And, by the way, they also gave up Bagram Air Base, when we said we should actually keep."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yes, Trump was in fact not the president on February 20 -- at the time of the Afghanistan surrender. So, I don't know what they're talking about. And, of course, Trump did not box them in into abandoning Bagram, which was a massive mistake. So this blaming of Trump, this passing of the buck to the previous administration, we have seen it time and time again. And here's why I think this is very important, Sean. It's not just a matter of the blame game. It's a matter of learning the right lessons from the failure of deterrence in Ukraine, so that we don't repeat those same mistakes in Asia across the Taiwan Strait. We need to understand why deterrence fails, so that deterrence can hold in Taiwan, so we don't find ourselves fighting a kinetic war with the Chinese Communist Party, which is far more powerful than Russia right now. Russia is merely Xi Jinping's junior partner in a new Cold War that they have launched against the West. And so, if we refuse to learn these lessons, we're doomed to repeat them in a far more difficult military environment across the Taiwan Strait."

I mean, we're talking about a liberal state Supreme Court that can now overturn all the things that Wisconsin conservatives have fought so hard for, all the reforms of the Walker era. I mean, we're talking about Act 10. We're talking about redistricting. I mean, this is a very concerning situation. So how did we lose, Sean? We need to figure that out. We're getting outraised by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. We need to figure that out. We obviously missed an opportunity to do commonsense election integrity reform because we lost the governor's race in the last election. And, honestly, we need to figure out how to get our people to vote through early voting, through absentee voting. I know that makes a lot of conservatives mad, but that's what the Democrats are doing right now. And until such a day as we reform our election system in Wisconsin, we have to get more votes than the Democrats do. So, this is a time for short soul-searching, because we also need to take action, so we don't continue to lose statewide elections."

I mean, it's not just abortion laws in Wisconsin. We're talking about control of the White House going forward. Obviously, Wisconsin is going to be a pivotal state for the 2024 presidential election. So we need to get our act together so that we can put this in the win column going into 2024. And, obviously, every issue is on the line in the 2024 presidential race.

What's happening in many of our places, including our major cities, is you do have this eruption of crime, and a lot of it's because of exactly what the sheriff points out. It's bad guys with guns who aren't going to ever follow any laws, even if you pass more laws. But it's also a lack of enforcement of the low-level -- what the left would call low-level crimes like burglaries, how these people obtain this gun in the first place? And you -- as a prosecutor, Sean, you know that it's those early crimes in a criminal's career that, if they're punished for them, and if that -- if they understand that there are consequences for their actions, that you might be able to change the behavior. But if they're allowed to develop into ruthless, lawless thugs, then you're going to have a hard time preventing these horrific crimes like you saw in this county in Florida."

What's happening in society that's causing young people or any people to pick up a gun and take someone else's life? I think this by the Democrats is just to take the freedom of our ability, our constitutional right to own a gun, away from us, to defend ourselves away from us. And I go -- where do they do this, Matt? They did it in the old Soviet Union. In China, you can't have a gun. In Cuba, you can't have a gun. In Venezuela, you can't have a gun. And they don't want you to have a gun."

But, today, they're picking up guns and killing people. Something's happening in our culture. Something's happening with the way that we are raising our children that are forcing them or bringing them to such violence. They're angry. They're detached. What's going on here?

How do we get back to a place of strength to get these rogue actors back in line like China and Russia?"

Blame it on Trump. Afghanistan was a colossal failure. That probably led to Putin getting a green light in Ukraine. We have no plan in Ukraine. We're just -- have a blank check, as you know. And then you look at Taiwan. I thought Speaker McCarthy did a great job. China should not dictate who the speaker of the House talks, but to engage to prevent a conflict in the South China Sea, I think, was encouraging. There's actions we need to take. But this administration only looks through two things. They look through globalism, that America should not have sovereignty. We should be one of many flags, rather than the leader of the West. And they look at global warming. Those two lenses are what directs this administration. And both lenses have flaws. But this is where this administration wants to head. And we see the consequences of that action."

      "speaker": "REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL)",

We have stepped up pressure, and we have called for action by the United States to stop this flow of fentanyl coming into our country, which is killing tens of thousands, if not over 100,000 Americans every single year. There's 300 Americans that are dying from fentanyl overdoses every single day. Can you imagine, if a terrorist group came over here and killed 300 Americans every single day, what we would be doing about it? Well, the president of Mexico is starting to fear that. And so he sends this letter saying, please stop all these shipments that you're giving to our cartels over here, and they're producing the fentanyl, which -- and then they're shipping it over to the United States and killing Americans. That has to stop. And the president of Mexico is doing absolutely nothing about it. But, again, neither is President Biden. And so the blame lies -- I do agree with China. It does lie with the United States, because President Biden is not doing a damn thing about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, to that point, Ryan, I mean, instead of the president of Mexico reaching out to China to say, hey, please stop sending the drugs, where's Joe Biden? Joe Biden should be putting pressure on Xi Jinping to go, you know what, there will be real consequences if you continue to allow those drugs from your controlled economy to come through Mexico in the United States and kill American citizens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZINKE",
      "utterance": "Well, there's no doubt that fentanyl is a crisis, but we have a crisis on our border because there is no border. I mean, you have human trafficking, sex trafficking, child trafficking, drug trafficking. The cartel -- the cartels are now probably stronger than the federal government of Mexico. And then, of course, you have the Northern border. There isn't no border up north. So, if you don't want to travel across the desert, why don't you get on a first-class flight to Calgary and just walk across? Because I can tell you, it's a lot easier to get into Canada and then go to a B&B and have a wonderful trip into the U.S. because no one's looking. So our assets -- most of the problem is down South. I think that's recognized. But we have a problem up North because no one is looking. Our Border Patrol agents, they're discouraged. Their morale is at rock bottom. They can't do their job. They're told not to do their job. And so, basically, they're just observers at both the North and South border."

They're a terrorist organization. We should treat them like a terrorist organization. They're killing Americans. We need to go get them. The Mexican government won't. We need to do that. That's our duty. It's the duty of the president of the United States to protect American lives. And American lives are being lost every single day because of his inaction. And we need -- and we know where they are. We know who they are. We need to go and stop them and take them out if that's what is necessary."

Are you going to be successful in Montana prohibiting these kind of purchases, which, by the way, the U.S. government should stop that, but thank God that Montana is trying to get that job done?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZINKE",
      "utterance": "Well, you look at across the board, right? China is not only buying land. They have critical minerals. They have the control. We're vulnerable in pharmaceuticals. We're vulnerable across the board. So I think Montana did action, take action, said, enough is enough. We need to protect number one, the U.S. Two is, we need to protect Montana and our sovereignty. And what we're seeing with this administration, for some reason, they have a blind eye of what China is doing. And, look, China is the number one polluter. China -- 90 percent of the plastic in oceans comes from four rivers in China. China is the world's largest violator of fishing, and they harvest organs from political dissidents. I mean, come on. We have to look at what China is. China is a great nation. They are emerging and impressing, but they're also a very aggressive nation. And, lastly, you look at our policy. Our policy is one China, two systems. But what happened and what we see in Hong Kong, it's one China, one system, and, if you're not part of that system, we're going to go after you and, in some cases, harvest organs. I mean, come on. This is China that we should -- we -- this administration needs to push back hard."

Always see what they're doing. They talk tough, but then they're really, really weak. And so, even though I think he should be impeached because he's not doing his job, we're not going to -- it's not going to get any better, because whoever they replace him with is just going to do Biden's bidding."

One of them is our next guest, Bob Fu. He was a student leader during the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989, and he and his wife later on -- later on, the church -- were imprisoned -- OK -- the church -- they were in prison for illegal evangelism in China. After his release, he had his wife -- he and his wife fled to the United States as religious refugees. In 1997, they founded China Aid, a nonprofit that assists Christians and other people of faith persecuted in China. Bob, good to see you. Happy I got through that read.

And they're not only satisfied by enslaving millions of Chinese, including concentration camps, but also they are -- extend their long arm beyond its border. So the kind of transnational threats against me and others have already reached to the American shore, and they have established even overseas police station. All of a sudden, I was contacted by MIPD, AOEPD, FBI for the so-called bomb threats, and even taxis were booked on my behalf.

Many people watching may know that we took on the EPA. We have defeated large chunks of the Biden Green New Deal radical policies that would really target our jobs here in West Virginia. So, one of the things we're going to do is going to leverage and build on those energy jobs. When people talk about the amount of electric cars that might come into the marketplace, how do people think that that those cars are going to get fueled up? You're going to need good old-fashioned coal. You're going to need natural gas. You're going to need a lot of the fossil fuels that are currently online. And so, in West Virginia, we produce with abundance. So one thing we do is, we leverage our energy resources. Then we're going to drive educational attainment and work force and population growth.

But it's fascinating to see what they're doing going after President Biden, not legislatively, but going after President Biden through the courts. It's a plan out of the liberal playbook, but the courts can be very useful, very effective. Also in West Virginia, it's going to be fascinating to watch if Joe Manchin runs for reelection as the next senator of that state. He was one who voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, which has nothing to do with inflation reduction. It actually is Joe Biden and AOC's effort to bring in the Green New Deal. He voted for it. He brought it. And now it's affecting his home state, West Virginia, interesting state to watch as we come into the 2024 elections.
