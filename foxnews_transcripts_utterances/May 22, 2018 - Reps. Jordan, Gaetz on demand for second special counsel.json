Now, two days before CNN ran a story about the dossier, even in existence, Andrew McCabe, deputy FBI director, sent this email subject line that read, 'flood is coming.' And then he goes on to write, 'CNN is close to going forward with the sensitive story. The trigger for them, CNN, is they know the material was discussed in the brief and presented in an attachment.'

As several congressional Republicans, led by the House Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows are now renewing their call for a second special counsel to basically investigate the investigators. And Fox has learned that on Thursday, House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes will finally get his meeting with officials to review some of the sensitive intelligence involved in all of these allegations while Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is lashing out tonight and calling that meeting a partisan move that shows Nunes is really trying to interfere with the special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.

      "sentences": "First of all, the seed was planted with me by hat tipped the professor, Stephen Calabrese, an old friend of mine who worked for Attorney General Meese. We have in the Constitution something called the Appointments Clause. And it applies to principal officers of the executive branch. There's interior officers, you know, like a chief of staff, an administrative assistant who reports to a principal, then there's principal officers. As an example, every single United States attorney in the United States has to be nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate because our founders made clear that they wanted both branches of government involved in appointments of the senior level people. You have assistant secretaries in departments, deputy secretaries in department, and of course, cabinet secretaries, and as I said U.S. attorneys. Here's the problem. The appointment of Mueller is utterly unconstitutional for a number of reasons. Rod Rosenstein gave him an agenda that is so broad, not a specific individual, not a specific statute, not even a specific matter, and not only was the initial appointment incredibly broad, he keeps expanding it. So this special counsel's different than past special counsels. He's more like a roving U.S. attorney. Also, we learned something today that's absolutely incredible. In Politico, it says several court filings indicate that when lawyers for Mueller's office appeared in federal court in Alexandria earlier this year, they did so not only as representatives of Mueller's office but they received an appointment, a special assistant United States attorney appointment in the eastern district of Virginia. They are, in effect, assistant United States attorneys. Robert Mueller wanted to expand their power. They report to him. If they're assistant United States attorneys or special assistant United States attorneys that makes Mueller, without question, the equivalent of the United States attorney. So what's unique about him and past independent counsel and special counsel is the massive breadth of his investigation. He's going into bank fraud, wire fraud, he's going into Russia, he's going into a number of other countries. He's interviewed hundreds of individuals, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of documents. He's not an inferior employee, like an administrative assistant or anything of that sort. He is a principal officer. And under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, Article 2, Mr. Rosenstein usurped the authority of the president of the United States to nominate whomever he wants as a prosecutor. And Mr. Rosenstein usurped the power of the United States Senate which has the control of a confirmation or not. Mr. Mueller is serving unconstitutionally in violation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because of the way Rosenstein appointed him, because of expanding his authority, because Mr. Mueller has expanded his own authority with these four now assistant United States attorneys. And every defendant in this case, every witness in this case, everybody who receives a subpoena in this case, whatever federal court it is, should raise the issue of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution that Mr. Mueller is conducting himself and his appointment is unconstitutional. See, here's the deal. These career bureaucrat prosecutors, like Rosenstein, and Mueller, and Comey, they don't understand the Constitution. They understand parts of it, like due process, warrants, subpoenas, probable cause.",

If we as a country do not get to the bottom of this and expose everything about these deep-state actors spying on an opposition party during a presidential campaign, rigging one candidate's email investigation, lying repeatedly to FISA court judges, we will lose the country. We will destroy the rule of law. We will shred our Constitution completely. But there is good news tonight. That finally the facts, the truth are all starting to come out, as we've been predicting, after what is unprecedented stonewalling, obstruction, slow-walking for Rod Rosenstein and the dodge, while a meeting for Congress to finally see the documents that they have been demanding is set for Thursday. The House GOP chairmen Devin Nunes, Trey Gowdy, they're sitting down with FBI Director Chris Wray, the director of national intelligence Dan Coates and Rod Rosenstein's, the deputy, of course, and for the record, I do not trust Rod Rosenstein. I'll explain. Also, Sara Carter reporting that these documents could hold the key and uncover every single thing about what was done to the Trump campaign and the Trump presidency and being spied on. And we believe that is exactly why Rod Rosenstein and the DOJ have been obstructing and concealing what really happened. Rosenstein is trying to run out the clock. He hopes that Democrats will regain the House and this will all end and go away. What is now apparent is that Rosenstein is aiding and abetting in what is nothing short of a cover-up of the single biggest instance of abuse of power and corruption in American history and the media's right there with them. We have famed Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, been on the show many times, calling out the stunning hypocrisy surrounding this deep-state scandal. Take a look."

But since it's Donald Trump and the media doesn't care, and they hate Donald Trump, well, they have actually been missing in action in covering up this biggest abuse of power/corruption scandal. They've ignored every single crime that Hillary Clinton has committed and the fact that she bought and paid for a dossier, put together by a foreign national, filled with Russian lies and propaganda to influence you, the American people and steal an election. The FBI then takes this Clinton-funded piece of garbage, Russian propaganda, use to it get a FISA warrant to surveil on a Trump campaign associate and they did it by lying to multiple FISA judges. This is the worst form of corruption. All of that information is why tonight, there's over a dozen House Republican lawmakers. They need support. They're signing on to a resolution that calls for a second special counsel to be appointed to investigate all of these abuses. Congressman Ron DeSantis, he's one of those congressmen supporting this and explaining why this must happen, which we've been saying now for a long time. Take a look. REP. RON DESANTIS, R—FLA.: We also need to get people to be held accountable for any FISA abuse that occurred, and then how did this investigation into the Trump campaign start? And were -- was it on the up and up from the very beginning? There's always a lot of questions about that. And I don't think that the Justice Department is going to be able to investigate themselves. I think they've resisted our inquiries here in Congress for long enough. And so, it's time that we did have a special counsel."

But, first, we know that days after the FBI put in the fix and exonerated Hillary Clinton, exoneration before investigation, they immediately, the same actors launched a surveillance operation against the Trump campaign. And it gets worse. Byron York tonight reporting these new revelations about the FBI targeting the Trump campaign is now leading to very serious questions about when this FBI investigation actually started. We've been told that it began at the end of July 2016. George Papadopoulos, you know, drinking in a bar, four-way drunken hearsay. That's not even admissible, hearsay, in a courtroom, nevermind four-way. And, by the way, it never made any sense. \"Washington Post\" now reporting that this informant met with Carter Page a few weeks before the FBI says it officially launched the probe. Their timeline isn't matching up. This is exactly why we need the second special counsel. And most importantly, we need an investigator appointed who has prosecutorial powers. The DOJ inspector general is now looking into all of this. Rod Rosenstein wants the inspector general. He cannot hold these deep-state actors accountable. Michael Horowitz doesn't even have the ability to convene a grand jury or issue indictments. The Clinton investigation, we still haven't gotten the report. It's 18 months later. Guess what? We don't have that kind of time. What we need is a full, thorough, complete criminal investigation right now because you the American people, you deserve to know the truth. This has to be done for the sake of this country. And tonight, we're learning even more stunning details about what really happened. This is pretty shocking. Former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo, he's now saying that there could have been multiple informants, multiple spies targeting the Trump campaign. Here's what he told our own Laura Ingraham last night. Take a look."

This was May 6th that he heard that in 2016. I was told by the intermediary on May 9th that they wanted to get them to me. I gave this information to the House Intelligence Committee. I gave this information to the Senate Intelligence Committee two weeks ago. And I gave this information to the Mueller team and they never reached out to the intermediary to check on it."

That is explosive information. And according to Caputo, Robert Mueller, you don't care about that? Really? Maybe too busy thinking about Paul Manafort's 2005 taxes. It explains everything you need to know why this is a witch hunt. Their goal has been to get candidate Trump and now President Trump. It's plain and simple. The great one Mark Levin, he has something very important to say about all of this later tonight. But, first, even more breaking news to tell you about. Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman, Ron Johnson, he is demanding more information about the FBI's apparent awareness that media outlets had information about Christopher Steele, the foreign national with Russian sources, before the President-elect Trump was even briefed about it. And according to FBI emails, that Johnson's committee has obtained, the FBI had what they called a, quote, 'sensitive matter team' that was actually communicating about the Steele dossier. Now, two days before CNN ran a story about the dossier, even in existence, Andrew McCabe, deputy FBI director, sent this email subject line that read, 'flood is coming.' And then he goes on to write, 'CNN is close to going forward with the sensitive story. The trigger for them, CNN, is they know the material was discussed in the brief and presented in an attachment.' What do you know? CNN then runs the story. And then \"BuzzFeed\" publishes that entire phony Hillary Clinton dossier. Senator Johnson is now demanding to know who was a part of this sensitive matter team. He's also asking for all of the documents, all the communications between Comey, James Clapper and their staffs regarding the Trump Tower dossier briefing. Remember the House Intel Committee's report on Russia, it found that Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, leaked information to CNN. He now works for them, about the dossier. That becomes a contributor now on the fake news network. Predictably, he recently denied any wrongdoing. Of course, we already know he lied under oath. Take a look."

Demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr is another one of these deep state minions who's feeling the heat tonight. The Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, he wants to see all the communications between Ohr and the former British spy and dossier author Christopher Steele. Remember, Ohr was the guy who was in communication with Steele, both before and after the election. It was Ohr's wife, Nelly, she actually worked to for Fusion GPS to help put together the op research that turned out to be lies. And Grassley now wants to know if Ohr was given the FBI information that Steele provided after Steele was fired by the FBI for lying about his contacts with the media. Another big story we're following tonight. We do have an update on the nuclear showdown with little rocket man in North Korea, Kim Jong Un.

As Trump said in his own book, \"The Art of Deal\", you have to be willing to walk away up to the last second. I get it. You liberals, you're upset because the president isn't bowing and kissing the ring of Kim Jong Un and offering pallets full of cash and other currencies like the $150 million Obama gave the mullahs. If Kim Jong Un wants to come to the table, then -- well, the president is willing to listen. And if Kim Jong Un wants to threaten the world, like he was before, well, the president will show a -- the force that he showed the last time and we'll be back to where we started. The president is reacting from a position of strength. Let's see. He's given up nothing. Kim Jong Un is making every concession and speaking of those concessions, North Korea is now inviting international media to watch their dismantling of their nuclear test site. And he crossed the DMZ and he released the hostages. And we didn't pay him anything. Also, great news for the president tonight and Republicans in Congress. Look at this. The GOP now holds an edge over Democrats in the generic midterm ballot for the first time in a brand-new \"Reuters\" poll. Look at that. And back in late April, Democrats had a 10-point advantage in that poll, and in another poll, they were 17 points back, Republicans were, in January. And Nancy Pelosi may want to cancel those plans about becoming the next speaker. This will be the most important midterm election in our lifetime.

It's unraveling on the DOJ, on all the people that were involved in this investigation. Let's just go back. In March 2016, President Trump makes that announcement that Carter Page, George Papadopoulos were a part of his foreign policy team. And then if you look at that, then it goes into May 2016, Papadopoulos, he meets with Downer and let's just put this -- lay this out. July 2016, Carter Page, he attends this event. Halper is there. Halper approaches him for the first time. But, remember, it was April 2016 when Christopher Steele, Christopher Steele gets hired by Fusion GPS, which was paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign, and the DNC to begin the investigation. And most importantly, in the early spring, after Trump made that announcement in March 2016, Loretta Lynch and James Comey, along with senior officials of the Obama administration -- and this is in the report - - in the unredacted report, have a meeting about Trump's announcement."

That's when they have a meeting about Carter Page. And that's when they debate whether or not to tell the Trump campaign at the time that Carter Page at one point was approached by the Russians.

Walk us through why this timeline you put out is so important. SHARYL ATTKISSON, \"FULL MEASURE\" ANCHOR: Well, it's simply a listing of facts that happened over the course of the last couple of years that perhaps made what we now see happening more easy to occur. I mean, if you look at surveillance on a U.S. citizen, whether it's a journalist or a political figure, is supposed to be one of the most sensitive things we do under the strictest of oversight, under the rarest of conditions. And if you look at what we know of what happened with the Trump campaign, we know that either as many as perhaps more than seven Trump associates were either wiretapped or otherwise electronically surveilled, that at least one informant or spy was placed with the campaign and I have seven other features of a counterintelligence operation perhaps used for political purposes that I've outlined. You put all that together and you think was this the go-to, really, the government thought there would be Russian interference in an election? Or was it a logical thing to do if that were really the concern, would be to go to each campaign and brief them and warn them, which would be more effective?

I'll summarize one of them where the president says, follow the money to that first informant that's been talked about, quote, the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with Russia because there was no collusion. He was only there to spy, the president says, for political reasons and help crooked Hillary win. So, that from the president tonight. Just over a year ago when the president first raised allegations that the Obama administration had surveilled the Trump campaign and transition team, he was met with all the skepticism and derision. But now, all of a sudden, there are signs that he could be vindicated especially because of what happened today with former Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo, who told our own Neil Cavuto that, fact, he was approached by a second informant in the Trump campaign beyond the first one that I just mentioned. As several congressional Republicans, led by the House Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows are now renewing their call for a second special counsel to basically investigate the investigators. And Fox has learned that on Thursday, House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes will finally get his meeting with officials to review some of the sensitive intelligence involved in all of these allegations while Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is lashing out tonight and calling that meeting a partisan move that shows Nunes is really trying to interfere with the special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "First of all, the seed was planted with me by hat tipped the professor, Stephen Calabrese, an old friend of mine who worked for Attorney General Meese. We have in the Constitution something called the Appointments Clause. And it applies to principal officers of the executive branch. There's interior officers, you know, like a chief of staff, an administrative assistant who reports to a principal, then there's principal officers. As an example, every single United States attorney in the United States has to be nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate because our founders made clear that they wanted both branches of government involved in appointments of the senior level people. You have assistant secretaries in departments, deputy secretaries in department, and of course, cabinet secretaries, and as I said U.S. attorneys. Here's the problem. The appointment of Mueller is utterly unconstitutional for a number of reasons. Rod Rosenstein gave him an agenda that is so broad, not a specific individual, not a specific statute, not even a specific matter, and not only was the initial appointment incredibly broad, he keeps expanding it. So this special counsel's different than past special counsels. He's more like a roving U.S. attorney. Also, we learned something today that's absolutely incredible. In Politico, it says several court filings indicate that when lawyers for Mueller's office appeared in federal court in Alexandria earlier this year, they did so not only as representatives of Mueller's office but they received an appointment, a special assistant United States attorney appointment in the eastern district of Virginia. They are, in effect, assistant United States attorneys. Robert Mueller wanted to expand their power. They report to him. If they're assistant United States attorneys or special assistant United States attorneys that makes Mueller, without question, the equivalent of the United States attorney. So what's unique about him and past independent counsel and special counsel is the massive breadth of his investigation. He's going into bank fraud, wire fraud, he's going into Russia, he's going into a number of other countries. He's interviewed hundreds of individuals, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of documents. He's not an inferior employee, like an administrative assistant or anything of that sort. He is a principal officer. And under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, Article 2, Mr. Rosenstein usurped the authority of the president of the United States to nominate whomever he wants as a prosecutor. And Mr. Rosenstein usurped the power of the United States Senate which has the control of a confirmation or not. Mr. Mueller is serving unconstitutionally in violation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because of the way Rosenstein appointed him, because of expanding his authority, because Mr. Mueller has expanded his own authority with these four now assistant United States attorneys. And every defendant in this case, every witness in this case, everybody who receives a subpoena in this case, whatever federal court it is, should raise the issue of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution that Mr. Mueller is conducting himself and his appointment is unconstitutional. See, here's the deal. These career bureaucrat prosecutors, like Rosenstein, and Mueller, and Comey, they don't understand the Constitution. They understand parts of it, like due process, warrants, subpoenas, probable cause."

      "utterance": "Which has?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "They've never read the Appointments Clause. They've never read the Supreme Court decisions involved in that like Morrison v. Olson and so forth. I have. Professor Calabrese he has. I want your audience to know this, too. So, Mr. Mueller, unlike any past special counsel, unlike any past independent counsel, his breadth of his investigation is so massive, it's so broad by the initial appointment, the subsequent expansion and now four of his own people getting dual appointments as effectively an assistant United States attorneys, Mr. Mueller, his conduct, his appointment is unconstitutional."

Believe it. REP. AL GREEN, D—TEXAS: I'm not sure that there will be members who are going to wait for someone else if that someone else, doesn't matter who it is, is declining to do it.

Sean, you can't win a Democrat primary in these radical far-left districts, congressional districts if you don't go, you know, full psychopath and start calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump.

Let's not be honest with the American people. But they are honest about, yes, we're running on the platform, let's raise everybody's taxes dramatically. I don't know if that's going to work."

We want the economy to tank. We don't want five million people to be given cash bonuses because of the tax reform. They have nothing to run on. But, Sean, 2018 is even more important than 2016 because if they get the majority, they will begin impeachment and all the incredible things that the president has done in just 15 months will be stopped. They will be obstructed for the next seven years. So 2016 was an act of God, yes, absolutely. But we need to make sure that the flotilla comes up behind this icebreaker who is Donald Trump and make sure the make America great again agenda is implemented for the next seven years."

The American people do not want the results of a fair and sound election overturned by a bunch of politicians up on Capitol Hill.

Don't want to reveal my plans. A lot of copycats and uncreative people in television and radio. So here's my point, this will be a defining, historic moment, this midterm election, the most important midterm perhaps in American history. Because this is going to be about an election to destroy this president. That is all they have, that and raising taxes and gutting our military. That's it. That's what they stand for, but they won't even be honest with the American people about that agenda."
