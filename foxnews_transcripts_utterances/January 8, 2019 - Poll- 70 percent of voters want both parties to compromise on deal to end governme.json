You're looking live at the White House, everyone, where the president of the United States in just about five hours, from the Oval Office, a first for him, will deliver a national address on what he deems to be the crisis at the border. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president is expected to make his case to the American people for a border wall and could declare a national emergency to build that wall. Democrats, without having seen it, are already slamming it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will deliver their own response to the president's speech. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Still, if Wall Street is worried about any of this and the ongoing shutdown, it had a funny way of showing it, stocks racing ahead today, more on optimism about China trade talks that appear to be going somewhere, rather than progress on a government shutdown that does not. Welcome, everybody. Glad to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's begin with John Roberts at the White House with the very latest on this -- John.",

It's likely that that will not happen tonight. The chances, we're told, are very slim.

And the reason I say it's not that trivial, if you take a look at federal government spending, just broadly speaking, federal government spending as a percentage of our economy, well, it's 7 percent. Now, 7 percent doesn't sound like a big number. But it is a big number. And, of course, that this drags on, we're talking about taking out or shaving off some of the growth, which is going to slow in 2019 -- we all expect that -- it's going to take some of that away. So instead of talking about, oh, say, 2.5, 2.4 percent growth, we're going to, over time, start to be talking about 2.2 percent growth in the economy. And that means that the growth rate of earnings, which is so dear to all of us as investors, is also going to be lower than it already -- it already has been marked down to.

We talked to over 10,000 millionaires all across this country to really dig in and find out, are they trust fund babies? Are these people that got lucky, that hit the lottery? Or are these hardworking men and women that believed the American dream was still alive?",

You're looking live at the White House, everyone, where the president of the United States in just about five hours, from the Oval Office, a first for him, will deliver a national address on what he deems to be the crisis at the border. The president is expected to make his case to the American people for a border wall and could declare a national emergency to build that wall. Democrats, without having seen it, are already slamming it. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will deliver their own response to the president's speech. Still, if Wall Street is worried about any of this and the ongoing shutdown, it had a funny way of showing it, stocks racing ahead today, more on optimism about China trade talks that appear to be going somewhere, rather than progress on a government shutdown that does not. Welcome, everybody. Glad to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto. Let's begin with John Roberts at the White House with the very latest on this -- John."

It's likely that that will not happen tonight. The chances, we're told, are very slim. The president wants to negotiate an end to the impasse, rather than pulling the trigger on something that radical. But the White House is still holding out the possibility that the president could do that unilaterally and build his steel barrier, if Democrats do not come to the table and negotiate some money for the wall. Listen to what Kellyanne Conway said earlier today."

The White House also pointing out that many Democrats who are in Congress now voted all the way back in 2006 to build 700 miles of secure fencing along the southern border. And now they want nothing to do about it. But as much as the White House is blaming Democrats for the continuing government shutdown by not being willing to negotiate on national security, Democrats are blaming the White House for insisting an agreement to open government include funding for a wall. Listen to California Senator Kamala Harris."

It's the same data that the secretary of homeland security tried to share with Pelosi and Schumer, but they refused to hear it, which you think about that, the House speaker refused to be briefed by the homeland security director on the state of affairs on the southern border. So, after that happened last week, you know, on several shows here on FOX, I implored the president, forget about Nancy and Chuck. Go around. Talk to the American people and give them the data and educate them on what's going on, on the American border, on the southern border."

      "speaker": "HOMAN",

We finally have got a president who says enough. I'm done -- we're done kicking this can down the road. We're always promised more border security in exchange for amnesty, in exchange for DACA or some other thing. I have been here a long time. They put a few more Border Patrol agents on the border and they call it border security. We have a president who is going to secure that border. And I'm proud he's our president. But one thing I shared with the White House yesterday, you got to give them real data that the American people can look at and make their own judgment. And, for instance, I said you have got to talk about the wall. The Democrats say the wall is medieval, it's ineffective, when, in fact, that's a stone cold lie. Every place they built a border barrier, illegal immigration has decreased. So, I asked the White House, you have got to provide that data to the American people. Show them that this talking point by the Democrats is just false. Walls work. They have worked every time we build a barrier, and that's why he wants a wall. Walls work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Director, the president was very close to scoring sort of a comprehensive deal, if you think about it, a little more than a year, 14 months ago, where they would address not only some security barrier or wall, whatever you call it, along the border, maybe, maybe deal with DACA, the kids of illegals who came in through no fault of their own, are kind of stuck in this legal limbo. And it all fell apart. Now, Republicans blame Democrats. Democrats blame Republicans. I'm not here to refight that battle, but that we were very, very close. And that is the underpinning of getting a deal, even now. Do you agree with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, I'm glad it fell apart, because you know what, I understand the DACA situation. But you can't give hundreds of thousands of people amnesty and reward illegal behavior, unless you address the reasons DACA even happened. Unless you close the loopholes that cause families to come to this country illegally, you are going to never solve DACA. Yes, you can give 800,000 people some sort of status, but how about the 200,000 family units that came across the border in the last two years much? That's your next DACA population in five years. So, you just can't keeping putting a Band-Aid on this. So, I have no problem with fixing DACA, as long as you fix the underlying reason, close the loopholes why families are coming, close the loopholes why UACs, unaccompanied children, come, close the loopholes in the asylum process to finally fix this once and for all. Stop putting a Band-Aid on it. And I think this president understands that."

The '76 law was written to clean up all the emergencies Richard Nixon declared and LBJ had declared which were technically still on the books. That definition says an emergency is a profound threat, an immediate and palpable threat."

That would be unseemly, but there's the -- there's the authority -- there's authority to do that. If your question is, can he go to another judge, the answer is no, because the injunction would stop him from doing what he wanted to do. Will he do this even if his advisers tell him he will lose? He may want to do it for political reasons, because then he goes, it's not me. It's that unelected black-robed person who was appointed by so-and-so that stopped me.

Would a court adjoin that? Probably yes. So he's got a tough road tonight. He's got to make a very difficult case. He's got to justify why he's willing to keep half the government shut down over the issue of the wall, because, remember, both houses passed continuing resolutions to keep the government running until the wall issue was injected.

This will also be the first time you will get a vantage point of how our stock futures trade on this and how foreign markets respond to this. I say foreign markets, because I was reading a lot of the English versions, Le Monde and elsewhere, the French press, the German press, Der Spiegel and some of these others, where they are terming this to be a constitutional crisis in our country. So while we might be largely ignoring this, they are largely riveted by this and what this portends for Donald Trump and the next at least two years for this president and this Congress.

Of course, that will be Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. It is unusual for, although not unprecedented, for a non- State of the Union speech to get an opposing party response. It is again not something that hasn't happened before, however. Back in September 2007, a Rhode Island senator responded to President George W. Bush's Iraq Afghanistan speech. In 2009 of September, former Representative Charles Boustany of have Louisiana responding to the Obama health care speech. So there have been examples, but they are few and far between. This is that unusual and maybe that controversial. Manhattan Republican Party CEO Andrea Catsimatidis. We have got Democratic strategist Kristen Hawn and political commentator Ashley Pratte.  The very fact that we are going to have this sort of double response to what the president outlines, and both Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi taking the position ahead of time that they're going to try to correct what they consider to be the president's falsehoods, what do you make of that?"

It's unusual. But given the number of misstatements and mistruths that the president has perpetrated over the course of the past year -- I think The Washington Post counted it at around 1,000 -- the Democrats have a responsibility to take a look at this speech and talk to the American people about what might or not be the mistruths that he's -- that he's portraying to the American people."

This isn't a Republican or a Democrat shutdown. But the language we keep hearing on both sides is, it's the other party, it's this party. And the problem is people want to get back to work. We want the government to be working. And we want things to move along. We elect people to Congress to get a job done. And sometimes that means compromise. Sometimes that means bipartisanship. And, at this point, we all need to come together and our lawmakers need to come together to do what is best for the American people. And I'm not seeing that happen right now. I am seeing a president who's being extremely stubborn over something. And I'm seeing lawmakers be extremely stubborn in the other direction. But I'm hearing some talks of compromise. And that's around the idea of immigration reform, putting something forward to try to fix that issue, as well as border security. So if two parties can, again, come together to find some alignment there, then maybe we can do something to fix the crisis, as well as the forthcoming crisis, which is those that are already here and how do we address that problem, which I have not really heard much about yet."

And one of the things I found interesting is, we are looking at this as the drama is unfolding. Most of the market shrug it off, thinking that it's just business as usual, no business as usual. And -- but the foreign markets are interpreting this as almost a constitutional crisis here, that this could drag on a while, it could jeopardize the president's authority, nothing gets done in America, et cetera, et cetera, hence their anxiety that's building, more so than here.

People sort of have a hell with both of you attitude when all is said and done.

I mean, this could potentially put us down in a spiral here, as things start to spin out of control. And with the president not budging and saying this could be months, years, there's a lot of people in flux right now not knowing where their next paycheck is coming from.

Wall Street must agree, the Dow up about 256 points. With this gain today, it's the first three-day winning streak the Dow has put together since back in November. So what to make of that? Let's go to the chief investment officer of the firm bearing his fine new, Hugh Johnson, and Empyrion Wealth Management president Kimberly Foss. Kimberly, your thoughts on what the markets are saying? Not worried about a shutdown. OK with everything else. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "KIMBERLY FOSS, EMPYRION WEALTH MANAGEMENT",

And it really kind of shaved off about a half-percent from GDP. So while that's not terrible, it wasn't catastrophic at all either. So I think this is discounting the shutdown, although there is some slowdown there, or there could be, with mortgage applications slowly, and publicly funded companies aren't getting their capital that they need. So at day 17, it could be an issue down the road, if we don't get some things resolved. But I think, overall, the consumer is very, very strong and the investor is strong. They don't like this. But at the same time, they're putting capital to work."

And indifferent though it might have seemed to the plight of 800,000 federal workers and other contractors not getting paychecks, in the scheme of things, it's happened so often, it's a nonevent.

And there isn't that much of a shutdown. There isn't much alarm here at all. And I think that's exactly -- your guest got right at the point, is that the expectation is, given the history of the shutdowns that we have been looking at, Neil, is that it's not going to last for a very long time. And I think everybody kind of expects or thinks that this is not going to last a very long time either."

      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, you got a good point. It's a good question, because it's really not that trivial. And the reason I say it's not that trivial, if you take a look at federal government spending, just broadly speaking, federal government spending as a percentage of our economy, well, it's 7 percent. Now, 7 percent doesn't sound like a big number. But it is a big number. And, of course, that this drags on, we're talking about taking out or shaving off some of the growth, which is going to slow in 2019 -- we all expect that -- it's going to take some of that away. So instead of talking about, oh, say, 2.5, 2.4 percent growth, we're going to, over time, start to be talking about 2.2 percent growth in the economy. And that means that the growth rate of earnings, which is so dear to all of us as investors, is also going to be lower than it already -- it already has been marked down to. So, if this lasts a long time, Neil, you're absolutely right. Your instincts are right. It then becomes an issue for the stock market."

That means that, yes, again, like your guest said, if we continue with this shutdown, that's an issue. But we have got these headwinds that keep coming into the play for uncertainty with the clients. But the bottom line is our earnings are so near and dear to us, then we can actually have great earnings that actually will propel the markets further. And I think -- I think we have still got room to grow in this market. We're cautiously optimistic here, but anything that's going to be a positive with China is going to be -- they're going to buy on the rumor and sell on the fact."

We don't know exactly what could be in the making here, or whether those reports are wrong. And what we're hearing, though, is the president will address the country.

And both Republicans and Democrats, they are digging in their heels on this border wall stance. So President Trump, as we know, wants more than $5 billion to put towards his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats insist no money will be allocated towards a wall.

For decades, we have seen politicians talk about this, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer.

The other thing, Neil, is, where we do have borders, where we do have fences, crossings are down, in Yuma, El Paso, Tucson, and San Diego, down 90 percent. So walls do work. Fences do work.

      "utterance": "Obviously, President Trump has given lots of addresses to the country. And there have been lots of exchanges with the press, planned and unplanned. But for an Oval Office address, that is significant, the first of his presidency. And that is something that gets this next fellow's attention, historian Doug Wead. Doug, as far as Oval Office addresses, I was startled, yesterday, I remember, when we first heard about this, that it would be the president's first from the Oval Office. Ronald Reagan had 33 from the Oval Office, Barack Obama three. It depends on the president, but a lot of them in double digits when it comes to number of addresses from that august room. Why is that a big deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOUG WEAD, FORMER ADVISER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, it was a big deal because originally television was controlled by government in France and Britain and other places. And the dawn of television in America., Eisenhower cut a deal. He said, OK, OK, you guys, Sarnoff, Paley, you can -- we will let corporations own television. And they're accountable to no one but their stockholders. We will allow that. But when the government wants TV, you give it to us. And Paley and Sarnoff said, oh, absolutely, Mr. President. So that was the deal. And when the president gave a speech, Eisenhower, than later, young, sexy Kennedy, when they gave a speech, America was united. That was our president. You couldn't turn to football or cartoons. You had to watch. The whole country had to watch the president, and there was no choice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And you think about it, an Oval Office address is meant to unify a nation, right, whether it's President Bush after 9/11, President Kennedy in the middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis. There's great gravitas to that, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEAD",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And it did unify the nation. Now, by the time Reagan came along, there was more diversity and the media was much more aggressive. And so Reagan's speeches were bracketed on either side by this -- these tearing apart of the speech. Now, the president is going to say this, and he's going to use this and that's a wrong statistic. And then after it was over, they would tear it to pieces again. So Reagan had to thread a needle. He had to somehow communicate in between those brackets to the public. There was no fair and balanced. There was no FOX that would show different opinions. And he had to somehow speak to the Americans in that brief period before it got taken away. So it was a suburb high-wire act."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, it's interesting too. We usually associate opposing party responses to a presidential address to something like a State of the Union address, although at times presidential speeches have a prompted a Democratic response, whether it would be on the Iran-Afghan war back in 2007, or the responding to President Obama's health care speech back in 2009. So there is some precedent to this, but not much. What do you make of the fact that you're going to have two people responding to the president, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, a little later?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEAD",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's interesting to me. Over the years, as you know, we have had laws passed. We had the fairness doctrine, we had equal access, and it just got out of hand. Somebody could make a comment on radio, you had to let somebody else come on and make a comment if it's pro-abortion or pro-life or whatever it may be. Back and forth, it went. So they changed a lot of that. They still try to control and influence TV through the FCC, the number of stations that a company can own, but crony capitalism allows the big corporations to cheat in that regard as much as they can. The biggest development has been FOX News, has been the free market and the audience that you have been able to pull here. And now I notice FOX is moving into new territory. It is truly fair and balanced. So in the evening, you have got one conservative show, one libertarian show, but during the day, you have got people with diverse opinions. That's very healthy, I think. But that's going to take a big share of the market."

All right, you're hearing the story that better than 800,000 federal workers, many of them, just like a lot of Americans, go paycheck to paycheck, will have to wait for that paycheck, maybe a while.

It's a reminder, in a country where a good many of us go paycheck to paycheck, that that's a dangerous position to be in anyway. Chris Hogan is the author of \"Everyday Millionaires,\" just that, \"How Ordinary People Built Extraordinary Wealth and How You Can Too.\" A lot of is just good practical guidance. And he has such a powerful voice. As I like to remind people that if you don't listen to what he says, he will beat you up."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "No, they really aren't. Neil, we wanted to know the truth, right? Is it is it possible for regular men and women to be able to build wealth nowadays? I mean, you have some media tell you that you can't. And you have got a 14-year-old congressman out West that says you can't, right? And so what's the reality? So we did the biggest study that's ever been done. We used a research firm to help us walk through this to find out the truth. We talked to over 10,000 millionaires all across this country to really dig in and find out, are they trust fund babies? Are these people that got lucky, that hit the lottery? Or are these hardworking men and women that believed the American dream was still alive?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And what you discovered is that they just are good with not going crazy and spending too much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "They really are. They're regular men and women. These are people, a third of them never had a six-figure household income, OK? Sixty-two percent of them went to public state schools. Only 21 percent of these millionaires inherited anything; 83 percent didn't inherit a dime, right? So you look at this and you start to realize these are people that are living next door to you, people that you work with that you don't know it, because they're not flaunting it. They're staying focused in what they do, because they're committed to a process."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But so many of us do this paycheck-to-paycheck thing. And there are a lot of themes in your book here. But I do want to go to the core of what your ideas -- what I like to think are your ideas. One is do a monthly budget. In other words, get an idea of the money going in and the money going out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's so important. Ninety-four percent of these millionaires are budgeting. They're living on less than they make. That means they're intentional with their money. They're making decisions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "That's a very important point. Live on less than what you make, because we have discovered that even multimillionaires, if they're living like multi-hundred-millionaires, they're going to lose it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "You really are. And that's the reality. And a lot of people, Neil, want to wait until their income grows before they get intentional. The problem is, is that your lifestyle will increase. And so what you have to do is draw a line in the sand that says, I'm going to be in charge of my money. You work hard for your money. I want you to make your money work hard for you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. Debt is another big problem for you, because you argue, people see out hot investments, but forget that 18 percent, 24 percent credit card, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "No, I mean, debt is a thief. And, according to our research, 73 percent of these millionaires never carried a dime of credit card debt; 68 percent of them never took out student loans. So the reality is, is that they understood that, if I have debt, I'm paying interest."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But a lot of people can't avoid that, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, and, again, there are options out there, right? And I'm not saying, if you have student loan debt, that you can't get there. What I'm saying is, is if we as parents can start to educate young people, to let them know that there are scholarships and grants available, that they can go to community college -- 62 percent of these millionaires went to a public state school; 9 percent of them didn't go to college at all; 8 percent went to community college. So there are options available. We just have to know them and make the right choice."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, you can believe what you want. I'm looking at these dynamics. And we as a country, Americans, we love to show off. We love to show our wealth and all of that. And you argue all that's fine, whatever you want to do. Just don't overdo it, right, and keep an idea of the money coming in and the money going out. It's central to your theme, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, it is. It is. There's nothing wrong with you having some nice stuff and doing some fun stuff. But the reality is, you're right. Do it with cash and do it with a plan. Now, these millionaires..."

    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
