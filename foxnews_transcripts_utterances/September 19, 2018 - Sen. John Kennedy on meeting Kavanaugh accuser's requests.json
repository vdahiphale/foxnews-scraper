Earlier, she told NBC News that she's a classmate of Dr. Ford and had heard about this incident many years ago. But then, later put on social media that she doesn't have first-hand knowledge of such an incident. So, it's very confusing about whether any of these potential witnesses will add anything new or corroborate anything.

Republicans say they're trying to let her be heard Monday at the hearing but she's adding all of these new conditions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, what Republicans believe is all of this is a push for an FBI investigation that will never happen. And so, ultimately it's just trying to delay all of this process beyond the midterms. The key tonight is that three Republican swing votes not always supportive of the president all calling for Dr. Ford to testify. Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, Susan Collins insisting she should appear Monday. Corker saying, if she doesn't show the Senate should go forward with a vote on Kavanaugh. Collins, a pivotal moderate woman giving Republicans cover this afternoon saying, quote, \"It is my understanding that the committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable.\" Contradicting a claim by Democrats that Dr. Ford is being pressured or forced into public testimony as Chairman Grassley made clear today they are doing everything they can to make it as easy as possible for her to come forward.

And as Dan said, they just ask people and take down what they say about the candidate. So, this is not a role. It's not a federal offense. So, if there was to be a criminal investigation, it would be by a state legislature. And this comparison with Anita Hill is not true either because when the investigation -- when the FBI got involved on Anita Hill, her name had not become public. This woman went to the Washington Post and raised it publicly. So it's all -- it's all a smoke screen. Look, the fact, the main facts are that Democrats cannot defeat this nomination. Only Republicans can, meaning if an errant Republican goes, and they are trying to peel one off. Chuck Grassley has been scrupulous about following the rules for this.

Earlier, she told NBC News that she's a classmate of Dr. Ford and had heard about this incident many years ago. But then, later put on social media that she doesn't have first-hand knowledge of such an incident. So, it's very confusing about whether any of these potential witnesses will add anything new or corroborate anything. What White House officials believe is really going on is that Democrats are moving the goalposts. Republican Chuck Grassley, today, chair of the Judiciary Committee saying, look, on Sunday when the Washington Post reported this story, the push from Democrats was Dr. Ford needs to be heard. Republicans say they're trying to let her be heard Monday at the hearing but she's adding all of these new conditions. So, what Republicans believe is all of this is a push for an FBI investigation that will never happen. And so, ultimately it's just trying to delay all of this process beyond the midterms. The key tonight is that three Republican swing votes not always supportive of the president all calling for Dr. Ford to testify. Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, Susan Collins insisting she should appear Monday. Corker saying, if she doesn't show the Senate should go forward with a vote on Kavanaugh. Collins, a pivotal moderate woman giving Republicans cover this afternoon saying, quote, \"It is my understanding that the committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable.\" Contradicting a claim by Democrats that Dr. Ford is being pressured or forced into public testimony as Chairman Grassley made clear today they are doing everything they can to make it as easy as possible for her to come forward.

They even had follow-up calls with the Senators to go over the new information. Guess how many Senate Democrats were on that call? Zero. They are saying they want an investigation, they're saying they want the FBI, but they're not even participating in it as it is happening before them. I think, it's important as they said to have a hearing. I think Senator Collins is correct, there's lots of options. The Senator Grassley has his offer here. You can do it -- you know, in a confidential setting as well, and I think that would be great. I think it would have been great if the Senate Democrats had followed the proper procedure she wouldn't be in this position right now because they could have done it confidentially."

And he looked me in the eye and told me, I'm not going to do that because it's too close to Hillary Clinton. And that is not equal justice under the law. And he did that time after time after time and it's not just him. It is this bureaucracy of 110,000 people at the Department of Justice.

Welcome to all of you. Good to have you here. The Wall Street Journal has been very outspoken, very strong on this issue, believing that the right thing to do is to go ahead and have this hearing, criticized on social media a bit, Dan, for not, sort of, indulging the idea that this woman who says she's a victim should have her opportunity to speak out and perhaps, to have an FBI investigation."

      "speaker": "DANIEL HENNINGER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",

Let's understand, it is the Senate's role, constitutional role, to conduct advice and consent on these nominations. And they are basically asking the FBI to open this investigation to perform that role for them. They are supposed to make the judgment. In addition, the FBI does not to do \"investigations\" of Supreme Court nominees. They do background checks. They don't make pass judgment on this people. That is the job of these senators. Senator Schumer is trying to offload it onto the FBI."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I asked today because I was wondering, because this is such an old allegation, it goes back 36 years. You know, when the FBI does do a background check, how far back do they go? And interestingly, they go back to the age of 18. This is an issue that deals with two adolescents, potentially. That's the charge. If these are two adolescents, then we know that adolescents are under different rules under the law, regardless of what -- we don't know actually what happened. But there's a reason that it starts at 18 though."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL MCGURN, EDITORIAL MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "Well, there's a reason. I think as Dan points out, what the Democrats are asking for is against years of process and what the FBI does. My dad's a former FBI agent who still does background checks in the State Department. As you say, it starts when you're 18. So I consider it kind of the family business. And as Dan said, they just ask people and take down what they say about the candidate. So, this is not a role. It's not a federal offense. So, if there was to be a criminal investigation, it would be by a state legislature. And this comparison with Anita Hill is not true either because when the investigation -- when the FBI got involved on Anita Hill, her name had not become public. This woman went to the Washington Post and raised it publicly. So it's all -- it's all a smoke screen. Look, the fact, the main facts are that Democrats cannot defeat this nomination. Only Republicans can, meaning if an errant Republican goes, and they are trying to peel one off. Chuck Grassley has been scrupulous about following the rules for this. And so the Democrats just want to dance it, they want to light. They don't want to take a tough vote in election."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But Mary O'Grady, I can see a scenario where it looks like right now the plan on the Republican side is to go forward and to vote on Wednesday. If they do that and this woman, who is accusing Brett Kavanaugh, goes public in a different venue, she says I don't want to do a hearing, I'm going to do something else that I want to speak out, it could politically continue to damage the Republicans, no?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "I don't know. I think that the very fact that she is not willing to come forward and testify -- because initially they asked for the delay so that she would be able to testify and once she won that, then she said, no, I'm not going to testify. So the very fact that she won't come before the committee and talk about what her allegations are, and that she is lacking in a lot of substance in terms of what she's alleging. I mean, she doesn't know where it happened. She doesn't know how she got home. She really is not giving a lot of detail. I mean, to the point where people who want to believe her are saying well, maybe it's a case of mistaken identity because her memory is so fuzzy about it. So I think that that mitigates against empathy for her. Because, you know, while we're trying to say we want to believe her, we also know that we are in the process of destroying another person if we are not fair about this."

But for almost two years, Brown and California have become opponents of the president and vice versa. For example, the administration sued California for its sanctuary laws and in turn, California sued the administration for its stance on environmental policies. And beyond the big picture governmental aspect of dispute, the governor and the president have made it clear they really just don't like each other very much. Back in March, the president tweeted, quote, \"Governor Jerry \"Moonbeam\" Brown pardoned five criminal illegal aliens, whose crimes include kidnapping and robbery, badly beating wife, and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize, dealing drugs.

For the record, Governor Brown and President Trump have also battled over National Guard troops along the border, the Paris climate accord and of course the wall.
