On March 19th, 2017 Watson writes quoting here, \"This is absolutely disgusting! This dude raped me.\" An unknown contact response, \"Was it reported? And is there something that could be said?\" Meredith Watson responded that she didn't report the Fairfax assault because a year earlier when she accused then Duke basketball star Corey Maggette of raping her, Watson claims, Duke University discouraged her from reporting it.

She claims Fairfax later told her the reason he assaulted her is because he knew she'd be too afraid to say anything. Fairfax denies the allegation. During the Virginia 2017 election, Watson also wrote on Facebook \"of course I want to say something he shouldn't be running for office. I just don't know what I can do. The unknown contact advises Watson to report it anonymously to which Watson says \"nothing is anonymous anymore. Besides, anonymous allegations carry no weight. And on Election Day, Watson wrote to a contact \"I see you've been promoting Justin Fairfax on Facebook despite knowing he raped me which is mind-blowing to me. Are you seriously voting for him today? #MeToo. Meredith Watson hasn't detailed the alleged rape but did say it was similar to Vanessa Tyson. That's the first accuser who says Justin Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex.

There are also Republican congressmen and Republican senators who would object because their projects are being defunded. They want -- they need that money for their districts. And on top of that if you declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress to pay for the border wall, what's to stop a liberal Democrat one day from declaring climate change is in the national emergency and implementing the green new deal. So, we don't want to set that precedent. But there is a way that the president can get the full $5.7 billion without a shutdown and without national emergency. And that is by shifting the debate away from the shutdown and towards the sequester. So, in December of this year, there is going to be an automatic sequester of spending if Congress doesn't act. If the president doesn't improve increasing the spending cap, the Budget Control Act that President Obama signed in 2011 has been, is going to go into effect. And if he, if Trump doesn't agree to lift those spending caps, then there is going to be an automatic $55 billion reduction in domestic spending that Democrats consider priority. There'll also be a $71 billion cut in defense which won't make conservatives happy. But Democrats are going to have to decide. And there is no shutdown involved. There is just an automatic reduction in spending. Are we willing to sacrifice $55 million in domestic spending to deny Donald Trump a measly $5.7 billion for the border wall? So, right now --",

Though Democrats say they continue to be concerned about what they characterize as suspicious contacts between Russians and the Trump campaign. And also tonight, there may be new legal exposure for the president's former personal attorney Michael Cohen. After his lawyer, Lanny Davis issued this statement. \"The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has accepted Mr. Cohen's request for postponement of tomorrow,\" that's Tuesday's hearing, \"due to post-surgery medical needs. A future date will be announced by the committee.\" The issue is that Cohen who was last on The Hill two years ago, according to Senator Burr was seen publicly over the weekend.

Juan, let me just get your reaction, first of all, you know, you saw that the response when the in -- when the Republican side House Intel report came out.

And I think that's why, Martha, you saw that group of people, the Democrats saying they did not have confidence in the findings. I think it's very different with the report coming from the Senate. I think that what we've seen from Richard Burr of North Carolina, Mark Warner of Virginia, is an investigation -- it has a high level of credibility. And when they say they can't find any evidence of collusion, I think it carries a great deal of weight. I would make one point to you very quickly that I think there's say that there is no collusion, doesn't mean there's no conspiracy. I think we know that from intelligence officials and others that there were efforts by the Russians to interfere in our election and to help Donald Trump."

      "utterance": "And I think, at some point -- but I think at some point that look, the reality is, is that Democrats have been in search of a reason why they lost this election. The bottom line is they ran a poor campaign. Hillary ran a poor campaign, Donald Trump spoke to so many forgotten Americans, and we ran a campaign that most people didn't think -- didn't give us the respect that we deserve. The bottom line is we won they lost. And the collusion that they've been searching for to make up the excuse as to why they lost doesn't exist."

And even Senator Burr left the caveat at that there could be -- you know, something else that comes up along the way. But as you point out, Sean, they've been at this a long time. They've been looking -- you know, under every rock, they can find for two years. And I thought this was an interesting comment by the president's former attorney John Dowd, who said, \"I would be shocked if there is a report or anything other than we're done from Robert Mueller.\" Would that shock you, Juan?"

    {
      "speaker": "WILIAMS",

Essentially, when he indicts people and he's indicted I think they're 33 plus, including that large group of Russians. But also indict -- when he indicts, that's his basic report to the people. Here is what I know and here is who I'm going after. I must quickly say in response to what Sean was saying, you know, I think there are lots of Republicans who even if there was a proof of coordination and conspiracy, say we shouldn't impeach this president. I -- but, if there's obstruction, it's only like a third of Republicans who say that could be a basis."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But to put off that -- that's Juan is referring to, just so everybody has. This is the Washington Post poll. If the Mueller report concludes that Trump tried to interfere with the probe in a way that amounts to obstruction of justice, would you support an effort to impeach Trump? And 60 percent in this Washington Post poll say no."

So, if there's no collusion that if he did this, and if he did this, the bottom line is, so far, two out of the three entities looking into this, say there's no collusion. My guess is that we go three for three. But we've got it, we're losing sight of the bigger fact. And this is something else that Mueller has a charge with. Which is making sure that any entity, foreign or domestic that tried to interfere with our election is brought to justice. He's already indicted over 20 individuals who did that. And we need to make sure that we don't lose focus. There was no collusion, but we need to take steps to make sure that every entity that tries to interfere with our election understands that they will be caught and brought to justice. And that is similar -- that is also part of Mueller's charge. So, I believe that there will be a report --"

I thought this was interesting, though John Dowd did an interview with the investigation, a podcast for ABC Radio. And he was asked, and this was one of the reasons, you know, why there was a bit of disagreement on the legal team about whether or not the president should answer questions verbally or should sit down. And here -- here's what John Dowd said. I wanted to get your thoughts on this Sean, and then -- and then, Juan."

The way that if you don't answer it in a -- in a way that's exactly how you're supposed to, then they go down a rabbit hole. And they start saying, \"Well, if you didn't know that, did you know this, and did you know that? I think its sage advice that he was given because once you started going down one hole, and the bottom line is in one touched on this a little bit with his answer, which is once there was no collusion, then was it a conspiracy?

I think that what we've got to remember is that when the Democrats l find out that there was no collusion, they're not going to admit that they were wrong. They're going to pivot to the next thing, and that's the reality. Look for that. Because once they strike out, and go three out of three that there was no collusion you need the House to Senator Mueller, they're going to move on to something else. But they won't admit that they were wrong on the first charge, they're going to find the next one, and the next one, and the next one, until they can find something that sticks in their opinion."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. The Facebook messages are from Meredith Watson, she is the second woman to accuse Justin Fairfax of sexual assault when they were students at Duke University. And they show that in March 2017, Watson was commenting on Fairfax's candidacy, and telling her context about the alleged rape. On March 19th, 2017 Watson writes quoting here, \"This is absolutely disgusting! This dude raped me.\" An unknown contact response, \"Was it reported? And is there something that could be said?\" Meredith Watson responded that she didn't report the Fairfax assault because a year earlier when she accused then Duke basketball star Corey Maggette of raping her, Watson claims, Duke University discouraged her from reporting it. Duke says it is now reviewing what policies were in place at the time and Corey Maggette who played in the NBA until 2013 and now works for Fox Sports denies the allegation, though Fox Sports is looking into the claim. And Meredith Watson says when Maggette assaulted her, one of the people she confided in was her friend Justin Fairfax. She claims Fairfax later told her the reason he assaulted her is because he knew she'd be too afraid to say anything. Fairfax denies the allegation. During the Virginia 2017 election, Watson also wrote on Facebook \"of course I want to say something he shouldn't be running for office. I just don't know what I can do. The unknown contact advises Watson to report it anonymously to which Watson says \"nothing is anonymous anymore. Besides, anonymous allegations carry no weight. And on Election Day, Watson wrote to a contact \"I see you've been promoting Justin Fairfax on Facebook despite knowing he raped me which is mind-blowing to me. Are you seriously voting for him today? #MeToo. Meredith Watson hasn't detailed the alleged rape but did say it was similar to Vanessa Tyson. That's the first accuser who says Justin Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex. And we should note that while the pressure is increasing on Fairfax, it is decreasing on Virginia Governor Ralph Northam as Northam begins his listening/apology tour. A new Washington Post Char School poll says 58 percent of African-American residents in Virginia want Northam to stay, only 37 percent want him to resign. Martha?"

      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Martha, I've been covering this stuff, politics, one way or another for more than I have a century and I have never seen anything like this. This is the most remarkable confluence of events coming together that I've ever seen. I mean, we're looking here now at three leading politicians, the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the attorney general of the state of Virginia against whom allegations and indeed in the case of a couple of them factual charges are -- have come out that would unhorse any one of them. But because all three of them have been charged in the way they've been charged, and under the circumstances it looks to me at the moment as if all three may very well survive. Northam looks like he's not going anywhere for sure. His situation looks to be getting stronger. If he doesn't go down, that's hard to see how the attorney general who was involved in a blackface incident is going to down because of his. In the middle -- in the middle of it all, you have Justin Fairfax, the lieutenant governor who would be next in line to succeed Northam who stands accused by two different women of sexual assault but the mechanism for getting him out of office, he's denying the charges, seems not to exist. Impeachment looks like a long shot because it's supposed to be four things that you did while in office. It's a little bit like a building held up by three pillars, and all of them begin to crumble, and then they seem to fall together in just such a way that they are -- that the whole thing remains standing, and the situation looks --"

The only recourse legally would be these women bring criminal charges which the statute of limitations does not run out on. And that of course would present potentially a different situation for Justin Fairfax. I want to get your thoughts on governor Northam listening tour. He has signaled that he would be willing to take down all the Confederate statues as you know, sort of I don't know, some sort of penance, I guess. He's been given a reading list of things that he's supposed to read by his staff including the Case for Reparations by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Roots by Alex Haley.

So I mean, my sense is he gets stronger by the day in terms of surviving in office. I'm not sure that he's going to be as you know, what will become his governorship but he will be there. And of course what the Democrats nationally are looking at, Martha, is if these three guys are still in office in Virginia having been charged as they have and having in the case of Northam and the Attorney General having acknowledged these blackface incidents, the effect that that may have one the ability of the Democrats they used the race issue as they have done against the Republicans may be diminished. And of course the #MeToo movement is looking at this this lieutenant governor with a jaundice eye as well I would think and we'll see how all that plays out. But this is -- this is looks like an ongoing problem for the Democrats and because of the way this it's all falling into place, it doesn't look like any of these guys is going anywhere for now."

Among other things, this new deal would allocate $1,375,000 for 55 miles of more -- of new wall, new fence, whatever you want to call it, along the southern border. But now there may be another deal on the table. The President tweeted this moments ago. \"Was just presented the concept and parameters of the border security deal by hard-working Senator Richard Shelby looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources will be getting almost $23 billion for border security. Regardless of wall money, it is being built as we speak.\" Here now with the inside story two congressmen involved in the border deal negotiations, Republican Tom Reed and Democrat John Garamendi.

All of it absolutely essential to protect lives in the communities all across the nation. Could the President do it? He'd have to declare a desire a national emergency to do so. At least in the Army Corps of Engineers, there is some military construction projects that have in the past been re-allocated for work in Afghanistan and Iraq.

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",

That would be a good decision because the deal is not going to get better with a second shutdown, if anything it will get worse. And a national emergency would be a mistake. You just saw Democratic congressman talking about some of these projects in his district that would get - that would get defunded. There are also Republican congressmen and Republican senators who would object because their projects are being defunded. They want -- they need that money for their districts. And on top of that if you declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress to pay for the border wall, what's to stop a liberal Democrat one day from declaring climate change is in the national emergency and implementing the green new deal. So, we don't want to set that precedent. But there is a way that the president can get the full $5.7 billion without a shutdown and without national emergency. And that is by shifting the debate away from the shutdown and towards the sequester. So, in December of this year, there is going to be an automatic sequester of spending if Congress doesn't act. If the president doesn't improve increasing the spending cap, the Budget Control Act that President Obama signed in 2011 has been, is going to go into effect. And if he, if Trump doesn't agree to lift those spending caps, then there is going to be an automatic $55 billion reduction in domestic spending that Democrats consider priority. There'll also be a $71 billion cut in defense which won't make conservatives happy. But Democrats are going to have to decide. And there is no shutdown involved. There is just an automatic reduction in spending. Are we willing to sacrifice $55 million in domestic spending to deny Donald Trump a measly $5.7 billion for the border wall? So, right now --"

Howie Kurtz has the scoop, the very latest on this tonight from his reporting after this. Don't go anywhere."

      "utterance": "What a story this is, the salacious text message saga between Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, takes an interesting turn tonight after being widely assumed that Sanchez's brother, Michael, was the source of the leak to the National Enquirer. My next guest has new reporting that suggest that Bezos' girlfriend had intimate details shared of their relationship with several of her friends. And even had the contents of her computer downloaded onto an assistance computer for safekeeping, so who is to blame the circle widened? Joining me now Media Buzz host, Howard Kurtz. Howie, good to see you tonight. Thank you for being here. So, she shared some of these messages with her friends, and her assistant had access to almost everything on her computer."

    {
      "speaker": "HOWARD KURTZ, HOST",
      "utterance": "Right. And this is a bit of a game changer, because the source close to the couple confirms that to me, the investigators for Bezos know this to be true. It pretty much knocks down the theory that somebody's phone was hacked before the leak of the salacious material to the National Enquirer. And it also means that in these high stakes who done it, you know, how the supermarket tell they get a hold of this stuff, and at a time when Bezos is accusing the Enquirer of blackmail, and the tabloid is denying it, we have a different playing field here because a number of people could have been responsible for that leak."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "AMI has to keep those clean because of the agreement that they entered into with the federal government over the whole Trump issue, and the two women that were paid off to silence their stories, are they in more trouble because of this development, or less?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, it depends on exactly how the American Media, the parent company of the Enquirer got a hold of this stuff, there is no hacking involved, and probably it was done lawfully. The question of blackmail or extortion as Bezos charges is a separate situation. But by the way, the notion that Lauren Sanchez's brother, Michael Sanchez is a Hollywood talent manager, was somehow responsible of this, it didn't just sort of bubble up out of nowhere. Sources at AMI and even the lawyer for David Pecker, the Enquirer owner, who is a close friend of President Trump, have kind of tried to finger him. But Michael Sanchez told me on the record that there are, in fact, multiple suspects and he has not never seen any of the salacious pictures or text, and that in fact, any attempt to implicate him this is 100 percent false. Those are his words."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, the other part of this story that's been swirling around is that he has friends in the Trump circle, and that perhaps he was using this story against Jeff Bezos because President Trump and Jeff Bezos aren't exactly the best of friends, to nail him through the National Enquirer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. Could this get any weirder? Even if it were a movie. So, Michael Sanchez is a Trump supporter, he is friendly with both Carter Page and Roger Stone, two of the people who had been caught up in the Mueller investigation. Stone, of course, pleading not guilty to criminal charges. But what Sanchez maintains -- or what I'm told is that he communicated with both of them for advice on security after the Enquirer leak not some crazy conspiracy theory that Stone and Page were involved in the Enquirer leak. And even I've seen correspondents, Martha, suggesting that Michael Sanchez tried to set up a meeting in a secure location, maybe even aboard a plane between Carter Page, Jeff Bezos himself, and Bezos' top security guy. That never materialized, but it does show you many subplots there are here, as now federal prosecutors are going to have to determine in part because of that immunity deal you mentioned just who did what to whom."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Not to mention the obvious, which is Stone shared text messages shared with several people, including assistance when you are in the middle of this kind of situation. Howie, thank you."
