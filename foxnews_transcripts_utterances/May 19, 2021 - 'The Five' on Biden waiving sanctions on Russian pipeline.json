What is going through your mind? This doesn't make any sense. And we were talking about liquified natural gas by them. America has a great system. And it has done a really good job of innovation and technology for liquified national gas. It is here, it is fundable, t is available. We could have actually provided that. It is sort of strange, to say the least, that the former chairman of the foreign relations committee is pushing our NATO allies further into the arms of Putin. That part of me -- it doesn't make sense. I'm baffled by the decision still on that first day inauguration day to cancel the Keystone Pipeline. They had to have that in the works for a long time leading up through the transition into that decision that day. We want to jobs here, but here's what I'll end on, Greg. What was one of the main reasons for cancelling the Keystone Pipeline? The cause of global climate change.",

And that begins with the alliances, our relationships with western democracies. And at the front of that line would be Germany and Angela Merkel. And it's pretty clear that President Trump, you know, he was dismissive of her, but also didn't understand that Germany, for whatever reason, didn't develop their own energy sources, and needs - needs that pipeline from Russia for their energy needs. So, that's what President Biden is doing. He -- he -- President Biden said on the campaign trail that he did -- he opposed the pipeline because he has a lot of discomfort with Russia's behavior towards us, towards the western allies. But he is putting America's interests ahead of his discomfort with Russia and saying you know what? If we can get Germany and the rest of Europe back in line with our agenda, especially in terms of NATO, then let's do that, let's repair the relationship of America's allies. Same thing by the way in Asia, you know, with Australia, Japan, South Korea. Let's prepare those alliances to take on China. But this is putting something ahead of his own political agenda.

That's just brings us right back into action because they are a NATO ally. That's the real truth to the story. And I think you're losing the focus of what's going on. Why is this international interest? We have 30,000 American troops in Germany protecting the Germans from the Russians, and the Germans then save that money on defense, and then send the money to Russia. It's gas prom, Juan, it's state owned. That's the Kremlin. They are paying money to the Kremlin, which the Kremlin then uses for, I don't know, hacking.

Nine presidents promised energy independence in the United States, energy dominance, and we got it under Trump, and Biden has completely wiped that away. It is making -- it has diminished our financial strength and our geopolitical heft on the world stage, just in four months. He killed the Keystone XL Pipeline, band new oil and gas leases on federal land. Within a month, he rejoined the Paris climate accord. As you pointed out, Greg, China is continuing to build coal-fired plants, enough energy, enough electricity to power Germany, and we've yet to get an answer about the Wuhan plague that killed about 3.5 million people around the globe. On top of that, we have people in Vienna getting ready, or trying to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. What in the hell is the wrong -- is wrong with this White House?

That this is a problem due to a failed war on drugs. The war on drugs has driven millions of people to streaked concoctions, like fentanyl, which are poorly measured, poorly controlled and kill you. You have absolutely no idea how many Americans have died over the last two decades. Famous people in which the coroner always said overdose, or died in his sleep, when it was a drug laced with fentanyl which is a far more complex description than just saying they died from heroin. This is something that when you put it into anything, it kills you, but people are willing to take the risk because they are seeking their own particular brand of oblivion which they can't buy legally. Unfortunately, they're not into tequila or cigarettes, they want to get high. So, you have 50,000 dead a year, in this case 90,000 because of the pandemic, all is coming through the border and through these ports of entries, but it's made in China. It's made in China. So, the solution is, if you legalize drugs, you would create clean, manageable product just like the tequila, just like the cigarettes. That would kill the black market, which would dramatically reduce the gory violence in every country and at the border because we are no longer their best customer, because we are always going to be their best customer.

What is going through your mind? This doesn't make any sense. And we were talking about liquified natural gas by them. America has a great system. And it has done a really good job of innovation and technology for liquified national gas. It is here, it is fundable, t is available. We could have actually provided that. It is sort of strange, to say the least, that the former chairman of the foreign relations committee is pushing our NATO allies further into the arms of Putin. That part of me -- it doesn't make sense. I'm baffled by the decision still on that first day inauguration day to cancel the Keystone Pipeline. They had to have that in the works for a long time leading up through the transition into that decision that day. We want to jobs here, but here's what I'll end on, Greg. What was one of the main reasons for cancelling the Keystone Pipeline? The cause of global climate change."

      "utterance": "I don't know about the need to spin it, Greg. I just think that when you look at this situation, the number one priority in U.S. foreign policy is rebuilding alliances that were, in fact, you know, damaged by Trump. And that begins with the alliances, our relationships with western democracies. And at the front of that line would be Germany and Angela Merkel. And it's pretty clear that President Trump, you know, he was dismissive of her, but also didn't understand that Germany, for whatever reason, didn't develop their own energy sources, and needs - needs that pipeline from Russia for their energy needs. So, that's what President Biden is doing. He -- he -- President Biden said on the campaign trail that he did -- he opposed the pipeline because he has a lot of discomfort with Russia's behavior towards us, towards the western allies. But he is putting America's interests ahead of his discomfort with Russia and saying you know what? If we can get Germany and the rest of Europe back in line with our agenda, especially in terms of NATO, then let's do that, let's repair the relationship of America's allies. Same thing by the way in Asia, you know, with Australia, Japan, South Korea. Let's prepare those alliances to take on China. But this is putting something ahead of his own political agenda. It's not hypocrisy. It's smart."

This just carves Ukraine out of the picture, and they don't get the transit fees so Russia is just going to gobble them up and whose doorstep are they on next? Poland. That's just brings us right back into action because they are a NATO ally. That's the real truth to the story. And I think you're losing the focus of what's going on. Why is this international interest? We have 30,000 American troops in Germany protecting the Germans from the Russians, and the Germans then save that money on defense, and then send the money to Russia. It's gas prom, Juan, it's state owned. That's the Kremlin. They are paying money to the Kremlin, which the Kremlin then uses for, I don't know, hacking. Paying Assad, selling weapons to Iran, invading Ukraine, and then we have to babysit the Europeans again, take their eyes off the Pacific. How is that in our strategic interests?"

Wait, Biden is genuflecting to Putin in Russia, to China, to even Iran. He has taken a hatchet. He is demolishing our energy economy, handing power and control and wealth to nations that hate us. Nine presidents promised energy independence in the United States, energy dominance, and we got it under Trump, and Biden has completely wiped that away. It is making -- it has diminished our financial strength and our geopolitical heft on the world stage, just in four months. He killed the Keystone XL Pipeline, band new oil and gas leases on federal land. Within a month, he rejoined the Paris climate accord. As you pointed out, Greg, China is continuing to build coal-fired plants, enough energy, enough electricity to power Germany, and we've yet to get an answer about the Wuhan plague that killed about 3.5 million people around the globe. On top of that, we have people in Vienna getting ready, or trying to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. What in the hell is the wrong -- is wrong with this White House? Biden is a feckless weakling, what is -- just like the press corps who won't ask any questions about this. What is going on? Why is he afraid of all of these nations?

There will always be new flus, but a vax tax could be something like 100, 200, 300 bucks. It's not as exciting as the lottery, because a lottery is this outsize the possibility.

That was a really costly pause. And it's been all over the map on the masks. He has no idea what he's doing. Governors have to get a little incentive to get the vaccination levels up.

Border agents have seized more fentanyl in the last seven months than in the entire year before. So far this year, Customs and Border Patrol have seized nearly 6,500 pounds of the synthetic opioid, which rockets passed the over 4,000 pounds seized all last year. And keep this in mind. We've had over 90,000 overdoses in the U.S. over the last year, largely due to fentanyl, which is around 50 times more potent than heroin. Just one kilogram has the potential to kill a half million people. That's according to the DEA. All right. It's clear what the strategy to the cartels is. You know, you distract border patrol with the children and families, because Biden does catch and release now, and you just send massive amounts of single men over the border and border patrol agents are stretched thin at the ports of entry, so fentanyl is just pouring across, Juan. What is the strategy of the Biden administration to actually deter these types of crossings?"

That this is a problem due to a failed war on drugs. The war on drugs has driven millions of people to streaked concoctions, like fentanyl, which are poorly measured, poorly controlled and kill you. You have absolutely no idea how many Americans have died over the last two decades. Famous people in which the coroner always said overdose, or died in his sleep, when it was a drug laced with fentanyl which is a far more complex description than just saying they died from heroin. This is something that when you put it into anything, it kills you, but people are willing to take the risk because they are seeking their own particular brand of oblivion which they can't buy legally. Unfortunately, they're not into tequila or cigarettes, they want to get high. So, you have 50,000 dead a year, in this case 90,000 because of the pandemic, all is coming through the border and through these ports of entries, but it's made in China. It's made in China. So, the solution is, if you legalize drugs, you would create clean, manageable product just like the tequila, just like the cigarettes. That would kill the black market, which would dramatically reduce the gory violence in every country and at the border because we are no longer their best customer, because we are always going to be their best customer. This will never go away until it's legalized."

But will the Chinese incentivize to do that? No. And then when we talk about the border issue, being more than just something that's happening on the Southwest Border, it's that all of these drugs and these cartel members that are able to get across, they are flooding the rest of the country with it. And here's an idea. I mean, if I were Kamala Harris, the first woman vice president who had a background in law enforcement, this is the issue I would take on. I would raise my hand and say, I'll do the triangle diplomacy stuff. But this issue, this matters to American families right now and I would try to get in front of that and lead."

She would be -- she would happily ruin anybody's day. And remember, she was a model married to a massive singer who would do this. But she still got off on the power. And that power infected her followers who also enjoyed the entertaining. She was a true mean girl. So, that's why she's the true test of forgiving, because I'm going to forgive her because I want to see her second act.

When he got busted and that New York Times expose came out, remember how his statement read? It was like, I'm one of you. I'm anti-Trump, you better not turn on me. Eventually, they did. But Hollywood covered up for him for decades as he abused and raped woman after woman after woman. So, I find that even more disgusting in terms of Hollywood liberals."

If you want to do yoga, you should have a partner like this young woman did. It's an amazing -- he can even -- he can even unroll the mat and he can actually do some of the moves. He's as good as any Peloton instructor, slightly furrier than most of them though. Look at that, downward dog. You got a dog doing a downward dog lifting his leg without --"

This was the day where we can get 100 percent back to restaurants and theaters are allowed to open -- it's probably going to be a couple more months for them to get back. But also, we did our show, \"AMERICA'S NEWSROOM\" outside on Fox Square, and Jasper joined us. He was very well behaved. I think Bill was kind of mesmerized by Jasper. Look at that dog. He -- the camera loves that face. Yes, and that tongue, absolutely. Hey, I also want to just thank everyone that works on \"AMERICA'S NEWSROOM,\" all the support we've got throughout the building as well. This is our crew this morning, first pandemic -- post-pandemic event, so that's all."

Let's go down to South Africa where Celine was instructed by her sister to videotape the engagement proposal, not just once, three, two, one, and we have another fall too. It's very difficult in the beach situations like this. Sometimes you just can't really get your balance right."
