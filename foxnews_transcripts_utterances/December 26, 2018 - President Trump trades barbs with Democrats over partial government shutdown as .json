Border security is different than amnesty for millions of people who are either here illegally or who brought their children over when they were children without having gone through the proper process for citizenship. And so, when the president talked about wanting a wall or a barrier, he's correct when he says that where we built these things in Yuma, Arizona, for example, and places in El Paso and San Diego, the traffic there has stopped. And if you look at the criminal element that is bringing these children and these people up through Mexico and using them as human shields to get into the country, you have to take a look at the real issue of the lobbying change there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I've always said that open borders are inhumane borders.

That is a result of a sick kid showing up at the border and the United States giving them care that they have not seen for 2,000 miles along their journey.

You're looking at brand-new video of the president's first visit to a combat zone as commander-in-chief. President Trump making the 11-hour flight under the cover of darkness on Air Force One, the lights were off, the window shades drawn, and with a military jet escort, President Trump addressing the troops and praising their efforts in the fight against ISIS."

I mean, it's obviously a lot safer in Iraq than it was in years past, a lot of because of the great work the men and women in uniform have done there."

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "But to your question about Iraq and the situation there, I thought the most important thing that he said was about striking ISIS from Iraq. He specifically said that we're not going to be taking troops out of that country, which I think reassures allies in the region that, look, although we're taking our troops out of Syria, we're allowing the Israelis to bomb Iran to take care of the Iranian problem. Saudi Arabia stepping up with money. There are concerns still about the way Turkey is going to handle the Kurds as an ally against ISIS in the region. However, him saying today we're not leaving Iraq, there are 5,000 troops there, we're going to strike ISIS if we need to from this position. It shows we're still in the fight despite -- they're very specific about their language. They say territorial caliphate which indicates the fight is not over. We've taking a lot of their land back, a lot of the cities have been taken back thanks to the United States and people in the region. However, the fight is ongoing. We saw Christmas day ISIS attack in Iraq just yesterday. But one fun thing too that is joyful as that -- the Iraqi government declared for the first time officially just before Christmas a national holiday for Christians there after ISIS tried to wipe them out in a genocide over the last couple of years. So, lots to celebrate and I think lots of calm nerves in some ways from the president on what he said today."

And as an American, I'm very proud of the president for going particular at a time, as Katie said correctly, there are questions about our foreign policy vis-a-vis, the pullout completely from Syria, and half the troops from Afghanistan. I think this is real good for America. And I just think on a day like today, we ought to just say thank you to the president. Again, I've many differences with him, we'll hear -- but thank you for standing up for our troops. The battle against ISIS is not over. I'm glad he made that clear. And hopefully we hit them not only territorially but where ever they are."

And so, yes, this was an opportunity for him to go meet with our troops because they're -- obviously, they're serving while everyone else is celebrating the holidays. But the president -- this was a moment for him as well because a lot of people wanted to hear with him on what exactly his military strategy is. And, you know, there is this conflicting view of the more libertarian point of view of having a strong military presence but also not getting involved with every single country. But the thing that people are going to run into when it comes to this and I don't -- we'll get to it later on the show is what happens when you're already there in a nation and fighting that war and you have this war, not wanting -- this view of not wanting to nation build but you're there and you cannot withdraw those troops and open up a vacuum like the last administration did."

I know the president gets criticized for maybe not taking the advice of people around him, but he does go and meet with people and listen and then makes his decision. So getting that information from the ground --"

      "speaker": "SHILLUE",
      "utterance": "Yes. And a lot of -- I thought the overreaction to -- you know, the fact that he announced it, Mattis resigned, and then the talking heads were saying, this is it, everything is imploding. Mattis is the only one we've ever trusted. He was the only adult. I thought it was overdone. But, just for the -- if I want to second-guess the president's decision, this might have been a nice time to announce a serious strategy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Well, when he made the announcement to take the troops out, you know, the reason there was confusion is because there wasn't this explanation that he gave today. He didn't say when he announced this that, look, we still have this place in Iraq. He did generally talk about allies being able to take care of these problems not on our behalf but stepping up to the plate in their own backyard and defeating ISIS in a way that is beneficial to their own countries. So, it would have been helpful at the beginning if he said, look, we're getting out of Syria because we have plenty of resources in Iraq to deal with the ISIS problem. We're going to continue to fight ISIS, to start taking away their territory. Of course, that war against the terrorist group is not done because they do exist in places like Europe and the United States. So I think he could have avoided some of that by putting --"

Border security is different than amnesty for millions of people who are either here illegally or who brought their children over when they were children without having gone through the proper process for citizenship. And so, when the president talked about wanting a wall or a barrier, he's correct when he says that where we built these things in Yuma, Arizona, for example, and places in El Paso and San Diego, the traffic there has stopped. And if you look at the criminal element that is bringing these children and these people up through Mexico and using them as human shields to get into the country, you have to take a look at the real issue of the lobbying change there. And I've always said that open borders are inhumane borders. You have the report today of the second child dying while in border patrol custody. That is not a result of border patrol. That is a result of a sick kid showing up at the border and the United States giving them care that they have not seen for 2,000 miles along their journey. So it complicates things enormously when you throw in comprehensive immigration reform when the president is trying to solve a problem that is an emergency right now."

They're not having it. And so the Democrats, you've got to give me some wiggle room right here. What you guys want to put on the table is let's just talk about DACA. Well, that doesn't solve the problem that's on the border, and we went through this with Ronald Reagan before where we gave you amnesty and said, hey, you're going to get border security and it never came.

This is a problem when you pick and choose, right? This is a college campus. All these people are adults. Maybe they can make the case that because it's being displayed from a dorm room that not everybody should have to look at the F-word, but the bottom line is universities completely try to redraw the rules every time, and therefore, nobody knows what the rules are. The first amendment covers it everything. And the point is when a phase is de-sign -- a sign is defaced, excuse me, you have freedom of speech which allows you to then condemn that action."

The yearly tradition is a part of a fundraiser for the Florida Surf Museum and also a charity for cancer patients that has been continuing off the Florida coast for an entire decade. About $40,000 was raised this year as thousands of spectators cheered on the surfers, donned in their best Santa suits, elf costumes and Christmas sweaters.
