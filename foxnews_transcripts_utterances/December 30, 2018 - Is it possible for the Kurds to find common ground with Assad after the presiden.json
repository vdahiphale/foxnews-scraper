Our objective was never to take down Assad. Obama said, he must go, but then they never did anything about it. And that was never our choice to make. If we could turn Syria into Beverly Hills, if we could sever Iran's land connection with Lebanon, make it harder for them to supply Hezbollah, that would be good, that would help Israel.

We have been there that long. As for the neoconservatives, they're terrible -- terrible about politics, both here and abroad.

Are we going to see it adopted, or is Nancy Pelosi going to play games, hold it up, write in provisions or seek permissions to protect foreign workers in terms of how much they're getting paid?",

What will it take to break a very bitter stalemate? Plus, former Justice Department prosecutor James Trusty is weighing in on the legal battle over immigration. Democrats outraged after the death of two migrant children in U.S. custody, while President Trump points to the murder of a California police officer, allegedly by an undocumented migrant, to push for that border wall. And former State Department senior adviser Christian Whiton will join us to discuss the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Syria, the president vowing to fulfill his campaign promise by pulling troops out of the region. But how does this affect the containment policy toward Iran? All this more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" We began with the White House blaming Democrats for this partial government shutdown. The standoff over the wall funding is expected now to stretch into the new year, presenting a day one challenge for the next speaker of the House, presumably Nancy Pelosi. Here now to talk about it, Republican Congressman from Texas Louie Gohmert, who's a member of the House Freedom Caucus and the House Judiciary Committee, where he's the vice chairman on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security.

And when you have people that are here legally from Mexico, from Central America saying, get the wall where we need it, secure the border, you have got to make this country safe, I don't know why they're not being listened to. And when you hear Democrats saying, oh, no, it's immoral to have a wall, and they say that while they're living behind a wall around their house -- this is like President Obama -- I read his new home has a 10-foot wall around it. Walls matter. They do make a difference. And this isn't like the Iron Curtain that kept people in to deal with what Natan Sharansky called a fear society. If we're going to have a free society, it's got to be protected.

And she ended up ruling that that wasn't a legitimate use of the money and she nullified what we appropriated money to do. Now, there was escape provision in case she felt like it was better spent elsewhere. But the fact is, she declared that wasn't a proper use of the money. So this is total hypocrisy for Democrats to come along now, after they squandered that money -- we haven't been able to find out where -- and say, oh, no, this would be where we put it now.

But when we look at whether this thing is -- the shutdown, how long before it ends, you look at each party's priority. And I loved Justice Scalia. I was having lunch with him one day, and he said -- and I don't remember who the attorney general was, but when he worked for me, he came in one day and he said, hey, I heard a great definition for the difference between Democrats and Republicans. He said, Democrats want to control everything and everybody, and Republicans don't want them to. Now, when you're plotting a strategy like that, it's more of the defense than anything to another party that wants to control people's lives, think they're not smart enough.

Stay ahead -- we take a look ahead, this on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Senate Democrats are calling for a hearing into the deaths of two Guatemalan children who died while in custody of Customs and Border Patrol Protection, this as President Trump sites the killing of a California police officer, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant, to further push for border wall funding. Let's bring it former Justice Department prosecutor James Trusty. He's also a partner at Ifrah Law. James, obviously, some -- a lot of tragedy surrounding this issue and the mounting legal issues that also are beginning to reverberate. Explain to the audience where we are from a legal standpoint, as Congress hopefully can cut a deal with President Trump."

I don't have a problem with that concept. I also don't leap to the conclusion that Border Patrol is just heartlessly standing by and letting children die. So I suspect that there's at least room for some sort of lawmaking, some sort of compromise where people get together and speak rationally, not just emotionally or on anecdotes, and say, what can we do to fix this entire system? There's a lot of stuff that's broken. But if there are small standard operating procedures that can be tinkered with to allow for the better safety of people in caravans, then I think Border Patrol would probably welcome that, as long as it doesn't affect their safety. So, small things can be done, but big things need to be done about asylum, about the processing time, about the resources that go in, all at the same time trying to protect the safety of American citizens and American Border Patrol."

And then you have folks that might have been healthy at the beginning of their journey that are coming to the U.S. after weeks or months of travel. So there's a lot of operational difficulties that make this a challenge. I know, at least in one of the two children's cases, there was hospitalization and clearance. And so even the best doctors sometimes are not going to see just how severe the problem is. But, again, if there's ways to tinker with the checklist and make things a little bit safer, I think everyone reasonably should welcome that."

If you have been to an airport and you travel internationally, and you get in line to come back home, and you may sit in line for an hour, you're filling out forms, you're showing your identification multiple times. And nothing would be more aggravating and doing all that and then watching a lane open up where 500 people just blow past you without any identification. So, we need to find a way to make lawful integration smoother, more efficient, have the resources devoted to it to make it happen, while shutting back on kind of the unfair line-jumping of being an illegal immigrant. No matter how sympathetic the basis may be, no matter how tragic the lifestyle might be in Central America, it doesn't really make it right compared to the other folks that are trying to do everything right to get into the country."

And it's got a very high murder rate, one of the highest murder rates in the Western Hemisphere, if not the highest. It has economic problems. It has gang problems. And so when you really kind of play the percentages as a parent, it makes sense to try to get to the U.S. But, at least originally, the idea of asylum was based on persecution by the government. That's been stretched to include things like domestic violence or gang violence.

I would rather see some sort of joint group come together, with law enforcement participation, and figure out, what are the most pressing problems with asylum, with illegal alien crossing? And, again, the big picture, human trafficking and human smuggling is killing an awful lot of people. And that's something that deserves a lot more focus than it gets.

A recent report is raising questions about President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. McClatchy reporting that Cohen's cell phone was detected near Prague in the summer of 2016, supporting claims that Cohen met secretly were Russian officials there. Cohen tweeted a denial hours after the story was published, saying -- quote -- \"I hear Prague, Czech Republic, is beautiful in the summertime. I wouldn't know, as I have never been. Mueller knows everything!\" We're back now with former DOJ prosecutor James Trusty. James, you were so good, we had to bring you back."

      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Well, I'll tell you, you're putting your -- putting your finger right on the problem, which is Mr. Cohen. Everything about Mr. Cohen, from that sentencing memo that was filed in Manhattan the other day, screams liar. So he's not a particularly reliable source for anything. I think it's interesting that he didn't get credit under a 5K motion, which is the typical vehicle for giving him credit for cooperation. They said he had not come clean on all of his own dirt. And so one -- you have to wonder a little bit, is this part of that equation? Is there something where they felt very confident that he was attached to that phone near Prague, and that they therefore didn't give him the full credit for cooperation? But the bottom line is, I'm a big fan of admissible evidence, not just conjecture, not just anonymous sources, citing foreign intelligence authorities for some small proposition. So I think the issue is going to be how much of this actually sees daylight, either in a courtroom, which I'm kind of doubting, or in some sort of report. And that's what I think the White House has to be fearful of, which is a report that doesn't really go through the process of making evidence admissible or reliable or even determining credibility, but just throws out every bit of fact from every bit of source they can find in a pretty compelling and bad narrative."

      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, look, I'm as far outside as everyone. I mean, we're kind of guessing from what we see procedurally. But you do see the sentencings taking place for various people that cooperated or partially cooperated. That tends to show that this -- that this investigation is winding down. You're starting to hear bits and pieces of litigation from the grand jury side making daylight too. But I think we're heading towards an endgame. And I think there's a good chance that it's not going to be something where the president's indicted - - he was a subject after all -- but where there could be a report that could be used for political purposes that's pretty damning, depending on how they write it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's interesting, because you mentioned the sentencing memo. The Southern District had 35, 36 pages of scathing, I mean, just scathing - - their animosity towards Michael Cohen was -- they wore it right on their sleeves. They were pretty upset, to your point, that he didn't cooperate, that he lied, whereas Mueller seemed -- it felt like maybe there was a different interpretation. And, again, that led to the media jumping more on the Mueller interpretation of whether or not Michael Cohen was trustworthy and honest and really had cooperated with respect to the Southern District, which seemed pretty clear that this guy -- throw the book at him, because he's a liar and he doesn't serve anyone well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Well, it was interesting. The Southern District said, he's a liar, he's a terrible human being, with all these things he's done, of either being dishonest or being a bully, being a bag man. But then they did kind of grudgingly say, he should probably get a little bit of credit for cooperation. They invited the judge to go a little below the 42-month guideline. So I'm not sure that the two sides are all that far apart. The Mueller case was a much smaller potato case in terms of what the exposure was for Mr. Cohen, so they were kind of necessarily in a backseat to Manhattan. But I think it's interesting. I'm not sure they were that far apart."

But these are not interesting -- not easy areas of law for prosecutors to establish the willful intent when it comes to campaign finance fraud. So there's a lot that's on the table for prosecutors to sift through. I'm not convinced that the president is going to get indicted.

Experts are saying that the removal of U.S. troops makes the goal of rolling back Iran's influence in the region more difficult, even as the Trump administration pushes forward on imposing sanctions against Iran. Joining us now, Christian Whiton, former State Department senior adviser and Trump and George W. Bush -- in both those administrations. Christian, it's a complicated situation, obviously, in the sense that President Trump ran on pulling us out of these -- out of the Middle East. He ran on defeating ISIS. We know ISIS really has been largely defeated in these areas like Raqqa. And some of these other strongholds are gone. So it's a complicated situation. How do you see it going forward?

Iran is aligned with Assad, the dictator. And by basically containing the jihadists, it made it easier for Assad to consolidate the control over the areas that are under his control.

Our objective was never to take down Assad. Obama said, he must go, but then they never did anything about it. And that was never our choice to make. If we could turn Syria into Beverly Hills, if we could sever Iran's land connection with Lebanon, make it harder for them to supply Hezbollah, that would be good, that would help Israel.

I don't know of a single hearing. We created a Kurdish state, de facto, in Northern Iraq. To create another one in Syria that will very much irritate our Turkish allies, who are also fair-weather friends, but nonetheless allies, this is just a complication. This is something we never signed up for. I'm sorry if some generals made promises to the Kurd that they didn't have the authority to offer.

And I'm going to get a little personal here, but today would have been my father's 75th birthday, Christian. When he came back from the Vietnam War, he was never the same, never the same human being. And he wouldn't have died perhaps 20 years too soon if it hadn't been for that.

And then the psychological scars. We lose 20 veterans, 20 veterans a day to suicide. That is skewed heavily toward younger veterans who have fought in these recent wars. Been in Afghanistan 17 years. I don't know what we're going to accomplish in another year or two that we haven't accomplished and 17 years. One interesting statistic, next year, if we're still there, you may have the case where someone who wasn't even born on 9/11 goes to serve in Afghanistan, and they have a father or mother who served, same country, same war. We have been there that long. As for the neoconservatives, they're terrible -- terrible about politics, both here and abroad. If they were good at politics abroad, they would know the best way to fight Iran is politically by encouraging dissent within that country, not by putting forces in Afghanistan and Syria. And, domestically, they don't understand how horrendously unpopular their policies are. If you poll the American public, should we go up in Afghanistan or down, 2-1 people want fewer troops there.

Took us five years to get that bill, five years. And Ronald Reagan finally said, make it happen, make it happen. The votes are not there today to make it happen. And the bottom line here, we want security. They want basically more access. And until you have some comprehensive plan here, you're not going to get it."

And the only problem with DACA is, you create a two-system -- in which you let the young people in, but the people who brought them in here, their parents, don't get the right of citizenship. So it's a comprehensive thing. You have got to look at both the security side, which Democrats have never basically given up, including '86. They promised security. They promised the endgame."

The Dow Jones industrial average losing 9.7 percent so far this month. Nasdaq is more than 10 percent off, and the S&P 500 down 9.9 percent. Back with us, Ed Rollins and Al D'Amato. And, gentlemen, it's -- I do want to state, first and foremost, that there's a bifurcation with the stock market and with the economy. The economy is going gangbusters. This last jobs report, we saw non- supervisory workers get a bigger pay raise than their supervisors, first time in four years. And it's the first time they started making money in a decade. How critical is it, though, that, whatever the market is flashing, Senator, that it doesn't seep into this economy, as we head into 2020 for President Trump?"

And much of this has to do with the uncertainty that people see as it relates to our trade relationships with our partners. Now, the president, let's give him credit. His people and he negotiated a terrific deal as it relates to Canada and Mexico. It's fantastic. Are we going to see it adopted, or is Nancy Pelosi going to play games, hold it up, write in provisions or seek permissions to protect foreign workers in terms of how much they're getting paid?"

Now, if indeed we make a deal with China, many people do believe -- and you have mentioned this -- the Chinese economy is in trouble. They need to make a deal. We are in a much stronger position. Let's give Trump credit for that, because they have been taking advantage of us for years, stealing our own intellectual property, as well as dumping. If that deal comes through, a deal that makes sense for the United States and China, this economy is going to demonstrate it in the stock market as well. So I think there's a harbinger of some good things to come."

When we leave the studio today, we're going to have a hard time getting to our cars. It's going to be packed with people. The economic enthusiasm out there, seen so far in this shopping season, seen in the confidence numbers, seen in consumer spending, seen in corporate profits, really been phenomenal."

The problem is, Washington is a different place now. It's not -- no longer Republicans -- for the first time in eight years, we don't have the House. The members that are there are going to find out, the Republican members are going to find out they're second-class citizens at best, at best. They're not going to have anything to do with anything at this point in time. Nancy Pelosi is going to drive this agenda. Mitch McConnell doesn't have the 60 votes he -- so he has to deal from a position of weakness. And the president has to understand, he's got to do this alone. He doesn't have a Congress. And the Republicans in the Congress need to be a -- sort of a loyal opposition, and they can't be out there doing their own thing. They have got to basically say, all right, here's what our consensus is we're going to try and do. And the president has to do things by either internationally do things, which presidents are free to do, or, as Obama did in the closing days, by executive orders. If he does that, then he can have some play."

We cannot - - and Mattis mentioned this, former secretary of defense. And I hate to see him go. You cannot take on your allies publicly, the way the president has been doing. It creates jitters, not only in terms of our defense, but also economically. It's not good. So he's got to cut it out. If you're going to take them on..."

If I take you on behind the scenes -- and, indeed, Mattis was doing that and saying to them, hey, guys you got to come up with more -- you don't do it publicly. You don't chastise them, because what you do..."

We have been complaining about NATO not paying their fair share for a long time. And what they do is, they have these meetings in these great places, with great food, and great room service, and first-class flights, and then they agree to do it again in six months. And next thing you know, a few years go by, Ed, and they haven't fixed anything."

The critical thing here, though, is, if you want this president to get reelected, again, with very serious opposition in the House today, which he has never seen before, he's got to make friends around the world. He's got to make some friends in Congress, got to make some friends in the Senate."

He needs to go to Manchin, people like that, who should be Republicans anyways, and get three or four or five of those. And he's going to lose a couple of his own. There's a couple of ours that are going to go south on us. So you got to be very careful."

You still have -- you got a whole bunch of things coming at you, the Mueller report, all the rest of it. The economic news will become very insignificant if he doesn't basically seem like he's governing. And he needs to basically bring back women. We lost women by an overwhelming margin this time.
