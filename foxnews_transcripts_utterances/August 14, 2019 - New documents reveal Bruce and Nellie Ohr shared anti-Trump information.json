So there's been a dehumanization and depersonalization of these very heroic people that keep us secure. The question is, Mark, though, why is it happening now this spate of attacks? I think the answer is that I.C.E. is actually starting to turn the corner because they are starting to deport people who have criminal records. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We're not issuing green cards to people who are going to go right on to public assistance.

That should be good news, but we've got to remember where we are in the in this Jacobin Party that's now taken over the old Democratic Party.

It's direct and constant supervision 24/7. I believe up to that juncture, they had done everything right, in terms of the suicide attempt and the suicide watch. The problem, frankly, from my perspective, is that he was taken off suicide watch. And I don't know why that would be.

Let them eat kale, as Marie Antoinette actually said before they mistyped her. Our cutting edge Democrats want taxes on meat and want humans to eat bugs for the sake of lowering the sea levels in the Maldives in the year 2200. But now almost every Democrat who is over 35 and holding elective office is running for President and to become President, those Democrats have to go to Iowa and try fitting in with the proletarian masses and they're grotesque appetites. And that means visiting the Iowa State Fair to eat State Fair Food. Bill de Blasio tried to ban hot dogs from old city run establishments in New York, but in Des Moines, he has to pretend to look happy chowing down on a corn dog. Kamala Harris tweeted out a photo of her eating a pork chop, and then probably made up for it with a follow up tweet commemorating Eid al-Adha, a Muslim pork-free holiday. Andrew Yang was seen walking around with a giant turkey leg, the giant turkey leg is actually out polling him in Iowa. These are the states that the Democrats have got to, maybe we could throw in one of those along with $1,000.00 a month he wants to give every American, and everybody in D.C. and New York City is eating expensive handcrafted Italian gelato. But in Iowa, Kirsten Gillibrand had to make do with just plain old ordinary vanilla ice green. Pete Buttigieg maybe had the wildest time of all. Over the course of four hours, he chowed down on a pork chop, a fried bacon bowl, BLT, a root beer float and of course several fried Oreos. Cory Booker refused to compromise on his vegan principles. So he stayed away from all the pork and turkey and instead contented himself with a deep fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Of course, as soon as the caucuses are over, Democrats will go back trying to get Americans to eat soybeans and silkworms. That's not too bad actually, if you deep fry them. If it works, though some of them will get rich, Al Gore is the single biggest investor in the meat substitute company, Beyond Meat.

Nobody was hit by gunfire, but officials say Federal employees were in the building at the time and we're narrowly missed. The F.B.I. says the location of the shots was no accident and that the shooter or shooters targeted certain floors of the building occupied by I.C.E. Both I.C.E. and the F.B.I. point to heated political rhetoric and discourse as the motive behind the attack. And remember, just one month ago, a man with a rifle attacked an I.C.E. Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington tossing incendiary devices at cars and trying to blow up a propane tank. The man was shot and killed by responding officers -- Mark."

Victor Davis Hansen is a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and we always appreciate his insights. Victor, Kamala Harris has compared I.C.E. to the Ku Klux Klan.

So, they have and that's a reference to perhaps DACA, then they must be as well, Nazis, and we all know what we're supposed to do about Nazis. But we're also told by the left that we're not supposed to connect violence with political rhetoric in some cases. Of course, when Trump said the word \"invasion\" that was used by everybody that was the grounds for charging him with a desk basically of people in El Paso. But I think in this case, this was a targeted ambush. It wasn't a mass shooting as was the Tacoma incident. And it comes on the wake of a lot of people that are running for President who, as I said, want to abolish I.C.E. or reform it to such a degree that it would be impotent, or we should remember as well that I.C.E. agents are persona non grata in most states and cities and jurisdictions, 500 of them. So there's been a dehumanization and depersonalization of these very heroic people that keep us secure. The question is, Mark, though, why is it happening now this spate of attacks? I think the answer is that I.C.E. is actually starting to turn the corner because they are starting to deport people who have criminal records. We're not issuing green cards to people who are going to go right on to public assistance. We've redefined refugee status. Mexico is helping out. Some of the Central American governments are feeling the heat and are worried about exporting human capital. And I think the result is we're about 25 percent down in crossings and up on apprehensions. That should be good news, but we've got to remember where we are in the in this Jacobin Party that's now taken over the old Democratic Party. They see open borders as central to their Electoral College strategies, and indeed, if they can't convince the electorate of 51 percent agenda, then they want to change the Electorate, so they're panicking."

Especially they could say that because they've told us again and again that rhetoric that can incite violence, at least in some cases, but they're not doing that because it's almost as if they feel that these attacks on I.C.E. offices might deter a little bit the purview of I.C.E. and then that might spike illegal immigration up a bit.

You've got to keep him alive until the trial. You don't just take him off suicide watch, and then treat him like any other guy who happens to be detained in there for a month or two?

That would entail direct and constant supervision by a trained Correctional officer or a specially trained and certified inmate companion member that would sit right outside the locked cell of Epstein and stare directly into the cell. It's direct and constant supervision 24/7. I believe up to that juncture, they had done everything right, in terms of the suicide attempt and the suicide watch. The problem, frankly, from my perspective, is that he was taken off suicide watch. And I don't know why that would be. It's conjecture on my part, but I'm thinking that there's probably a decent chance that Epstein was able to convince or perhaps manipulate a mental health professional into believing that he was no longer a threat to himself and was therefore removed from the watch. So that's the real problem. Once an inmate is removed from suicide watch, he is or she is traditionally moved back to the special housing unit and into administrative detention, where they're only supposed to be checked on -- well, at least once in every 30 minute interval on a near regular basis, but at least once within every 30 minute timeframe, It sounds like based on what you're telling me that did not happen that would add insult to injury, and that's extremely unfortunate."

The Justice Department argued and Chief Justice Beryl Howell agreed that access to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's grand jury material and the enforcement of a subpoena for former White House counsel Don McGahn are separate issues. Because the grand jury material involves Criminal Procedure and the McGahn subpoena is a civil enforcement issue. That means the McGahn case has been randomly assigned to another Federal judge, and it's another indicator that the court action could go well beyond the 2020 election. That timeline matters because it conflicts with Chairman Nadler's recent public statements about moving quickly and voting on impeachment before the end of the year.

I'm also told a girlfriend is involved in these ongoing negotiations trying to talk him down or talk him out. But he has fired, by some reports, at least a hundred rounds, possibly more, and the situation continues here in Philadelphia -- Mark."

Also, it seems weird to me that they need to be shipped off somewhere to go to college like, that's a weird concept to me, like with all the information in the world at your fingertips, on your smartphone, the idea that you're going to get in a plane and go across country and go into a brick and mortar building. I mean, you think about these colleges, are there older buildings in the country than the college campuses? I mean, when you -- look, look, I grew up in North Hollywood, the oldest building we had was a Kmart from 1974. Like, you go to Harvard or Yale or Princeton, I mean, these things -- some of these buildings are 300 years old, right? I mean, as far as this country goes, those are the oldest structures."

I didn't go to college. I'm vastly more successful than everyone in my family. Dad, are you -- where's dad? The point is, I'm insanely, insanely more successful than everyone who went to college. So you're talking to the wrong cat, like my thing is like, get to work, work early, work off and get a job, fight to keep it and see if you can better yourself along the way. But this notion of dropping them off somewhere in a time when we've made the concession that there is no more brick and mortar anymore. I mean, you want to buy a book, you buy it on the internet. You want to buy a DVD or whatever it is you want, everything is -- there's no more brick and mortar. Why is the last brick and mortar thing literally bricks and mortars from 300 years ago?"

And they go, \"Because that's what you do.\" And then at some point in 1988, the parsley went away, and nobody was outraged. Nobody went like, \"Well, where's the parsley? How am I supposed to enjoy my succotash with no parsley?\" And it just went away and nobody knew it. I feel like college -- I feel like we could do that with college. If you want to be a doctor or if you want to be an oral surgeon, we all know those caveats. Of course, you need training. You need the sciences. You know, engineering, whatever it is, but for just the humanities and general education and all that kind of stuff, that's the parsley by the side of the plate."

Safe to say, the President can have a lot of fun with how his rivals eat, so he is no doubt salivating, if you'll pardon the expression, while surveying the Democratic field. The Democrats have become the party of smug, coastal elitism, and everything that it comes with it and on food, that makes them the party of veganism, artisanal arugula on a bed of even more artisanal arugula and paying 27 bucks for a small plate of aspic Tuvalu and fusion cuisine. Let them eat kale, as Marie Antoinette actually said before they mistyped her. Our cutting edge Democrats want taxes on meat and want humans to eat bugs for the sake of lowering the sea levels in the Maldives in the year 2200. But now almost every Democrat who is over 35 and holding elective office is running for President and to become President, those Democrats have to go to Iowa and try fitting in with the proletarian masses and they're grotesque appetites. And that means visiting the Iowa State Fair to eat State Fair Food. Bill de Blasio tried to ban hot dogs from old city run establishments in New York, but in Des Moines, he has to pretend to look happy chowing down on a corn dog. Kamala Harris tweeted out a photo of her eating a pork chop, and then probably made up for it with a follow up tweet commemorating Eid al-Adha, a Muslim pork-free holiday. Andrew Yang was seen walking around with a giant turkey leg, the giant turkey leg is actually out polling him in Iowa. These are the states that the Democrats have got to, maybe we could throw in one of those along with $1,000.00 a month he wants to give every American, and everybody in D.C. and New York City is eating expensive handcrafted Italian gelato. But in Iowa, Kirsten Gillibrand had to make do with just plain old ordinary vanilla ice green. Pete Buttigieg maybe had the wildest time of all. Over the course of four hours, he chowed down on a pork chop, a fried bacon bowl, BLT, a root beer float and of course several fried Oreos. Cory Booker refused to compromise on his vegan principles. So he stayed away from all the pork and turkey and instead contented himself with a deep fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Of course, as soon as the caucuses are over, Democrats will go back trying to get Americans to eat soybeans and silkworms. That's not too bad actually, if you deep fry them. If it works, though some of them will get rich, Al Gore is the single biggest investor in the meat substitute company, Beyond Meat. Marc Morano is the publisher of the excellent climate depot and author of, \"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change.\" And he joins us now and Marc, Al Gore is basically online to become the world's first post meat billionaire."

Obama puts $2.5 billion and 14 firms get Federal money from Obama. Fast forward, this year, Al Gore invested in the fake meat substitute. It's made of 22 ingredients including bamboo and potato starch, and now it's the most successful IPO at the same time Gore associates are writing reports condemning meat and climate. Gore is essentially lobbying for regulations that will enrich him once again."

At my general store, they have two buggers for a buck. So that's 50 cents apiece, but the Beyond Meat burger is like $17.00, so Al Gore is getting a pretty nice royalty of every one of those Beyond Meat burgers."

This was time -- the IPO -- the most successful of 2019 thus far, was timed on the eve of this big UN report. Al Gore steeped in politics and regulatory powers was involved in this IPO, with his company investment and then it explodes. Now you have all of the world talking about meat regulations. The UN Chief himself said a successful UN agreement will result in skyrocketing meat costs. That's what they want to do. So what's the alternative? Pea protein. That's what in this Al Gore burger. It's made of all kinds of weird ingredients like that."
