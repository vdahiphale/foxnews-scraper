Building the border wall was not just the president's signature campaign issue, it's what the American people want. Remember that new Harvard-Harris poll we told you about last night? A lot of people haven't focused on it. It showed that 61 percent of those surveyed feel border security today is inadequate, 54 percent of respondents want a wall or other barrier built across the U.S.-Mexican border.

Now why are they doing this? Because they want to see the dawn of a new governing majority, and it's coming across the border. In the spring of next year, we will talk about this later on with Coulter. California will begin automatically registering any adults who obtains or renews a driver's license to vote in the state. California has been granting driver's license to illegal since 2015. Fox News estimates that a million illegal immigrants already have secured a license to drive in the golden state, by the end of last year. So, now turning them into instant voters is sure to change the outcome of any election, now that there is a super majority in the state for Democrats, but still that is shocking. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And speaking of these issues that the president and so many of us, and I know so many of you really care about, you hear a lot about chain migration. I thought it was really important for you to understand what it is, how it transforms the country, and why it must end, also part of the Trump must haves on immigration. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is a White House graphic that we share with you exclusively tonight. For every hour the U.S. settles enough migrants to fill a small auditorium. That's really small print. Every day, enough to feel a large high school. Every month, we settle enough to fill an entire football stadium to capacity. Every year, an immigrant population larger than the size of Washington, D.C. Every year, we resettle 174,000 parents of foreign born, naturalized citizens. Most of those are older, elderly. They're not going to be paying a lot of taxes. They will be taking a lot of services out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They are paying basically nothing in the system once they are naturalized and immediately qualify for all the wherefore programs that you pay for their retirement. In all of this, probably -- and at Harvard-Harris poll, 65 percent to 35 percent of Americans support a doctor a DACA deal that ends chain migration, eliminates the visa lottery, and secures the border wall. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Seventy nine percent of the people in the same poll want immigration based on merit, not family ties so 79 percent agree with the president. It's time for the Democrats to start putting the hopes and dreams of the American people first. It is now crystal clear that Schumer and the Democrats are going to run over the American worker and risk their safety, if that's what it takes, to tilt local and national elections in their favor.

He's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. We have a lot to get to, Congressman, on these text messages, disappearing, the secret society, all of it. I want to get you first on this issue of chain migration because I hear a lot from Democrats about how Republicans are now anti-family, Congressman. But as you saw with that very difficult to read graphic, we are resettling huge populations into the United States, not based on merit but based on distant family relatives. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

You can't take their word for it given their breach of the rules.

The other real problem is Rod Rosenstein. I don't think there is any, any doubt whatsoever that Rosenstein is too close to Comey, too close to Mueller, too close to Wray, and too close to a whole bunch of people.

The DOJ and the FBI, they have to be purged of anyone actively working to undermine the Trump administration with a political agenda and be purged of anyone who refused to remove those or report those committing this type of wrongdoing, who is serving from the government. They shouldn't be serving the government at all. I'm not talking, just don't transfer them to another office, they should be fired. And now onto Schumer's revenge.

Unfortunately, the Flake-Graham-Durbin agreement does not meet these benchmarks. In fact, it would not secure our border, encourage more illegal immigration, increase chain migration, and retain the visa lottery system. In short, is totally unacceptable to the president and should be declared dead on arrival."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I love hearing dead on arrival when it comes to a bad immigration bill. Building the border wall was not just the president's signature campaign issue, it's what the American people want. Remember that new Harvard-Harris poll we told you about last night? A lot of people haven't focused on it. It showed that 61 percent of those surveyed feel border security today is inadequate, 54 percent of respondents want a wall or other barrier built across the U.S.-Mexican border. It couldn't be clearer. And while Americans do want to help the DACA people, I guess, and give some kind of protection to them, they don't want to be left defenseless to do it. That makes sense. Look, Chuck Schumer is under enormous pressure these days. A host of left-wing interest groups are insisting that he resist the president and fight him on everything, including immigration. Now why are they doing this? Because they want to see the dawn of a new governing majority, and it's coming across the border. In the spring of next year, we will talk about this later on with Coulter. California will begin automatically registering any adults who obtains or renews a driver's license to vote in the state. California has been granting driver's license to illegal since 2015. Fox News estimates that a million illegal immigrants already have secured a license to drive in the golden state, by the end of last year. So, now turning them into instant voters is sure to change the outcome of any election, now that there is a super majority in the state for Democrats, but still that is shocking. And speaking of these issues that the president and so many of us, and I know so many of you really care about, you hear a lot about chain migration. I thought it was really important for you to understand what it is, how it transforms the country, and why it must end, also part of the Trump must haves on immigration. This is a White House graphic that we share with you exclusively tonight. For every hour the U.S. settles enough migrants to fill a small auditorium. That's really small print. Every day, enough to feel a large high school. Every month, we settle enough to fill an entire football stadium to capacity. Every year, an immigrant population larger than the size of Washington, D.C. Every year, we resettle 174,000 parents of foreign born, naturalized citizens. Most of those are older, elderly. They're not going to be paying a lot of taxes. They will be taking a lot of services out. They are paying basically nothing in the system once they are naturalized and immediately qualify for all the wherefore programs that you pay for their retirement. In all of this, probably -- and at Harvard-Harris poll, 65 percent to 35 percent of Americans support a doctor a DACA deal that ends chain migration, eliminates the visa lottery, and secures the border wall. Seventy nine percent of the people in the same poll want immigration based on merit, not family ties so 79 percent agree with the president. It's time for the Democrats to start putting the hopes and dreams of the American people first. It is now crystal clear that Schumer and the Democrats are going to run over the American worker and risk their safety, if that's what it takes, to tilt local and national elections in their favor. That's The Angle. Joining us for a reaction from Roanoke, Virginia is Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte. He's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. We have a lot to get to, Congressman, on these text messages, disappearing, the secret society, all of it. I want to get you first on this issue of chain migration because I hear a lot from Democrats about how Republicans are now anti-family, Congressman. But as you saw with that very difficult to read graphic, we are resettling huge populations into the United States, not based on merit but based on distant family relatives."

But these extended families do not benefit the United States, in the sense that a merit-based system would where people come here based upon education, job skills, job offers, and training.

Of course, now, the understanding from an informant that there was a secret society discussed in text messages. I'm not sure what secret they were talking about, but it doesn't sound too good to me, specifically the text messages, Congressman.

Here in studio is former deputy independent counsel, Sol Wisenberg, the man who conducted the grand jury questioning of former President Bill Clinton. We will get into the possible questioning of Donald Trump in the coming weeks as well. Let's start with you, Hermit, on this. You now know the facts. We have missing texts covering a period of critical five months when Michael Flynn was questioned up to the day that Comey was actually -- Mueller was appointed to special counsel.

When the FBI actually found out about Strzok's behavior in this affair between him and Lisa Page back in July, to me as a lawyer it's shocking that the United States Marshalls didn't go in right away to seize the devices of both of these FBI employees to find out what was on them. You can't take their word for it given their breach of the rules. So, even a civil case where there is some evidence missing or something like this happens, you go in and get a warrant or you get a subpoena in this case and you take a hard drive or phone and forensically examine them. So, it's shocking to me that today, the attorney general comes out and says we will look into this. Who's been watching the shock over the last six months? Why wasn't that done back in July? So, that's one thing that concerns me. Then, of course, you have the memo and the troubling revelations about FISA. I mean, to me, no way. I have a very hard time believing that it's a coincidence.

Look at all these fancy- schmancy people. In a new Gallup poll, if it's to be believed, worldwide approval of America's leadership is a down under Trump, dropping 18 points from Obama's last full year in office. Perhaps the president is unpopular with some leaders in the world because he's boldly defending America on the world stage.

I have enormous respect for the street agents, the guys who pound the bricks at the FBI, but there is something wrong at the top of the institution. And I don't think that Director Wray, the new director, understands that yet. I don't think Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a longtime friend of mine, has taken aggressive enough action. The only way we are going to cure this rot within the bureau is to get all the facts out. It is going to be unpleasant for a lot of people.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Under a new California law people will be allowed to register to vote and it will happen actually automatically when they obtain or renew their driver's license regardless of whether they are U.S. citizens. Unless the politicians import voters, they still don't seem to understand that they are actually dangers when this happens. In the latest evidence, an illegal immigrant Uber driver was arraigned just yesterday. He is alleged to have and robbed four young women in San Luis Obispo. Let's get into this now with New York Times bestselling author Ann Coulter in New York and here in studio with me in Jose Aristimuno who is a former deputy national press secretary for the Democratic Party. Jose, let's start with you on this. Registering people to vote who are here illegally, explain that one to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOSE ARISTIMUNO, CEO OF NOW STRATEGIES",
      "utterance": "Let's be clear here. Supposedly it's going to be implemented in April, this is what's going to happen. Voters, if you are in the country and you're undocumented you can gain a driver's license in California. But there are federal limitations, including you cannot register to vote if you are an undocumented immigrant in California. And they were very clear. The state of California has been very clear, you will not be eligible to vote if you are an undocumented immigrant. It's that simple."
    },

      "speaker": "ANN COULTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, illegal aliens are big rules followers. Even before California was issuing driver's licenses to illegals and automatically registering them to vote, their big Hispanic organizations and leftist organizations generally in California in the 90s that managed to steal an election from Bob Dornan. They found hundreds of illegally registered to vote illegal aliens who were voted for. Already 60 percent, or about 60 percent of all ballots in California are sent in by mail. It's not even illegal aliens who need to go and vote. Don't worry, they will be voted for. You just need them registered to vote."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Ann, why did Trump close that voter commission? Because the states would not cooperate? The voter fraud commission, they made a big deal of it. The left kind of mocked him and then they closed it. Was that because states just wouldn't give the information or they couldn't find any evidence? What was it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COULTER",
      "utterance": "I'm not sure, but I don't think it was a good idea, except that I think it might've just been moved to an official investigation with the Department of Justice. Incidentally because of California's giving driver licenses to illegal aliens, people are always saying it so burdensome for people to have to get an I.D. in order to vote. Now all legal residents of California are required to now get a secondary I.D. in addition to their driver's license because of a federal law that says all of these states that are issuing phony I.D. laws, we need a real one now. So there is now the real driver's license. You have to go into the inner circle of hell and register for all over again. When they start giving that to illegal aliens, you have to have the real, real I.D. So they don't mind burdening their citizens that way. But yes, this is all about voting. Illegal immigration, legal immigration, but certainly illegal immigration, DACA, it is 100 percent about voting, at least in California."

This is about registering people to vote. There are four to five million people in California who are eligible to vote and we need to get them registered. That is about democracy. It's not about undocumented immigrant communities, it's about the United States of America."

So we are not talking about spouses and minor children, that's always been respected and time-honored tradition of American immigration. But what the president is very concerned about is that of the million green cards that are given out every year, annually, more than 400,000 of those are this kind of extended family chain migration. I know you originally came from Venezuela or your parents came from Venezuela. But that's a minor child with parents. We're talking about uncles, cousins. And most Americans are against that. That's going to be a big part of this ongoing immigration debate. What you stand on it?"
