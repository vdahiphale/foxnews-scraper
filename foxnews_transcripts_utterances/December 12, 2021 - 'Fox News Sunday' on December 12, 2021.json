The two years of COVID have created immense problems and I agree with Commissioner Shea. There's some changes that we need in the laws in Albany. We need our court system back and running, which it hasn't been over these last two years. But the NYPD is doing their job and they're doing it with the community. And this is crucial, Chris, that bond between police and community got really hurt deeply last year. But that's being fixed and healed now. And it's making a difference. We're getting guns off the street. We are going to turn this situation around. I have confidence and the NYPD has confidence that we're going to get back to the pre-pandemic level soon and then surpass and become even safer. And the statistics show it in most of the city. There are a few places where we're struggling. There's no question we have more work to do, for example, in the Bronx.

And he believes that we need to improve the relationship between police and community as key to safety. That's what we did with the strategy of neighborhood policing. So I think there's a tremendous amount of continuity. You know, Commissioner Dermot Shea believed we needed to change that plain clothes unit and I agree with him. Those officers are now in uniform and they're taking more guns off the street this year than we've seen in decades. So I want to say Commissioner Shea had a view strategically of what would work and he proved it and I backed him on it. I believe that was the right way to go.

Parents need a much better situation for their kids then they have right now. The school day does not account for parents' schedules at work. Summer is tough for parents.

If you don't feel safe, if you don't feel like your family is safe in a community, then there's almost nothing else that matters. So, from a purely political perspective, you know, there are the statistics and then there's how people feel. And if people feel like they're living in an era where crime is increasing, then they're going to perhaps react at the ballot box there. When it comes to actual actions, you know, there are some things that the administration is considering in terms of federal assistance, federal advisory groups for local police officers. But often, this is really a state and local issue. But for Democrats, obviously, this trickles down, if people like Democratically elected officials are not taking crime seriously enough are not doing enough to prosecute as some of what we're seeing, then, certainly, I think there could be some blowback there.",

But if that's seen as a Democratic issue, that could trickle up to the White House, and certainly two congressional races coming up, in 2022. I see Republicans hammering on this -- on this general issue set virtually every single day, and I think a big element of it, Chris, is the recidivism, the re-offending of people who in many cases get out with no bail or very low bail from that horrible series of killings up in Waukesha, Wisconsin, at the Christmas parade, all the way to the guy who burned down the FOX News Christmas tree in New York.

Chris is, I spoke to Adams during his campaign, and he told me that if working class people in New York are told by any candidate that they were that they plan to defund the police, he said, that candidates going to need intense police protection. This is not a Democrat problem. I think that it's California Governor Newsom who said this week that Texas has a higher rate of violent crime than California. And if you look at the charts right now, I think it's like five of the top states in terms of murder rate per capita have Republican governors. So when you look at this, I really think it boils down to a gun problem. And right now, close to 80 percent of all these murders are being committed with guns. And Adams wants really tough attitude towards getting guns off the street. You know, in New York, there's a big issue about stopping and frisking, especially minority youth, and he says he's afraid in favor of stop, talk and frisk, not ending stop and frisk, stop, talking and frisk.

If you do it -- if you help them, you're legitimizing this spending. So it really is not about the process as much as it's about keeping your word. We let a lot of people down. Senator McConnell's been a great leader on many things, but we're going into an election cycle where the wind's to our back. We can't do this again. But when you look forward to this party, Donald Trump is the most consequential Republican in the entire Republican Party, maybe in the history of the party since Ronald Reagan.

GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM, \"THE GUY BENSON SHOW\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Oh, it will certainly be an issue. And, of course, should that happen, should Roe be curtailed or supplanted, that issue, abortion, would be restored to the states for people to make decisions based on their legislative representatives on those policies. When it comes to the national picture on abortion, I know some Democrats have said, oh, this would really energize our base. It could really turn the election. I think polls suggest that Americans are focused on a lot of other big issues, not just abortion. It could very much fire up or motivate certain people out there. There's no question about that. But I did see a poll this week in Texas, which is Ground Zero on this fight, with that -- with that restrictive, new law. It's been in place for weeks now. And Governor Abbott, who signed that bill into law, is leading his leading Democratic opponents, his top would-be opponent, by 15 points, including by eight points on the issue of abortion.

They'll be marching and they'll be saying that they are protecting women's rights. I mean they also will have a powerful message to take the voters because right now, according to Pew, 59 percent of Americans favor keeping Roe v. Wade as it is. The status quo. And 75 percent of Americans, according to \"The Washington Post, \"think abortions is a matter between a woman and her doctor. So, you know, the number one issue in all midterms is turnout. And what you get, of course, is the economy is the number one issue. But in states where you have governors races, legislative races, as governor -- as Guy was referring to, this is going to be a big issue, and it's going to lead to increased turnout, I think, especially among one very critical group, suburban white women.

They think he was very clear, as Jake Sullivan said, that there are measures beyond what the Obama administration did that the Biden administration would be prepared to do. They also feel really good about the unity among western allies. And that's been something we haven't seen over the last couple years, unity on Russia among the United States and -- and the European.

What does he think he can get out of an invasion potentially of Ukraine and is the deterrent effect of all these other threats that are now being put out there and mentioned, are those powerful enough to change his calculus because over the last 10, 15 years we've seen that what the west has done has not stopped him.

Eighteen years ago the bosses here at Fox promised me they would never interfere with a guest I booked or a question I asked, and they kept that promise. I have been free to report to the best of my ability to cover those stories I think are important, to hold our country's leaders to account. It's been a great ride. We've covered five presidential elections, interviewed every president since George H.W. Bush, traveled the world sitting down with France's Emmanuel Macron and Russia's Vladimir Putin. And I've gotten to spend Sunday mornings with you. It may sound corny, but I feel we built a community here. There's a lot you can do one Sunday mornings. The fact you've chosen to spend this hour with us is something I cherish. But after 18 years, I have decided to leave Fox. I want to try something new, to go beyond politics to all the things I'm interested in. I'm ready for a new adventure. And I hope you'll check it out. And so, for the last time, dear friends, that's it for today. Have a great week and I hope you'll keep watching FOX NEWS SUNDAY. Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC.

But let me tell you first of all, in the eight years I've been mayor index crimes, major crimes in New York City are down 11 percent over eight years. And we did it bringing police and community closer together. So the key is to overcome this horrible patch we've had in the COVID era all over this country. And we bond police and community, get those guns off the street. And the NYPD has been doing a fantastic job. The most gun arrests we've seen in over two decades. So yes, there's been problems, for sure, and more to do, particularly in certain parts of the city. But I will guarantee you this -- and our police commissioner, Dermot Shea, said this this week very clearly, we are going to go back to where we were pre-pandemic and then get safer still. And we have been the safest big city in America and we will remain."

But, look -- look around this city right now, this city is thriving. We have come back strong from COVID. And the bottom line is that there is -- today in New York City, a much safer city than we were eight years ago. There's no question about that. The two years of COVID have created immense problems and I agree with Commissioner Shea. There's some changes that we need in the laws in Albany. We need our court system back and running, which it hasn't been over these last two years. But the NYPD is doing their job and they're doing it with the community. And this is crucial, Chris, that bond between police and community got really hurt deeply last year. But that's being fixed and healed now. And it's making a difference. We're getting guns off the street. We are going to turn this situation around. I have confidence and the NYPD has confidence that we're going to get back to the pre-pandemic level soon and then surpass and become even safer. And the statistics show it in most of the city. There are a few places where we're struggling. There's no question we have more work to do, for example, in the Bronx. But in most of New York City, the statistics show we're getting back to the pre-pandemic levels and then going better and further."

And I think he's going to continue what we started and build upon it. He was a police reformer as a police officer. This is well known. And he believes that we need to improve the relationship between police and community as key to safety. That's what we did with the strategy of neighborhood policing. So I think there's a tremendous amount of continuity. You know, Commissioner Dermot Shea believed we needed to change that plain clothes unit and I agree with him. Those officers are now in uniform and they're taking more guns off the street this year than we've seen in decades. So I want to say Commissioner Shea had a view strategically of what would work and he proved it and I backed him on it. I believe that was the right way to go. But I'll tell you, I think Eric Adams is going to take everything that has been done and take it to the next level of safety for this city. I have a lot of faith in him."

We're leading the country. And that's because we use incentives and mandates and every single mandate we've put in place has greatly increased the number of people vaccinated. Since the first mandates back in August, we've had over a million more doses, and that's why the city is open and thriving. Chris, really vaccination equals freedom because it allows people to get back to work, get back to their lives, be safe wherever they are, school, a workplace.

It's not where you start, it's where you finish. And elections are a chance to tell people your vision and what you've done. My vision is that we've got to change a lot of things in this state, including helping families. Working families are struggling in the State of New York. They need a lot more help. Parents need a much better situation for their kids then they have right now. The school day does not account for parents' schedules at work. Summer is tough for parents. I proposed a plan to change that by asking those who have done very well to pay a little bit more so families can have a decent life in New York State. So I think people respond to ideas and vision and accomplishment. And I'll be going all over the State of New York talking to people about just that."

Murders are up, although not nearly at the level they were in the `90s and we've seen these shocking images, you know, just every time you see `em, it's kind of stunning, of these organized smash-and-grabs, oftentimes in high end stores. How big a problem for President Biden and Democrats both in terms of the politics? And also, is there anything substantively they can do about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JULIE PACE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think in terms of the politics, you know, crime is one of those things that can really overshadow basically any other issue for people. If you don't feel safe, if you don't feel like your family is safe in a community, then there's almost nothing else that matters. So, from a purely political perspective, you know, there are the statistics and then there's how people feel. And if people feel like they're living in an era where crime is increasing, then they're going to perhaps react at the ballot box there. When it comes to actual actions, you know, there are some things that the administration is considering in terms of federal assistance, federal advisory groups for local police officers. But often, this is really a state and local issue. But for Democrats, obviously, this trickles down, if people like Democratically elected officials are not taking crime seriously enough are not doing enough to prosecute as some of what we're seeing, then, certainly, I think there could be some blowback there."

    {
      "speaker": "GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO",
      "utterance": "Oh, it's a big issue, and I think Julie's right. I would call it trickle up is the effect here, where it might be happening at local levels because, as you mentioned Chris, some prosecutors and DAs have effectively decriminalized low level crime or even mid level crime. But if that's seen as a Democratic issue, that could trickle up to the White House, and certainly two congressional races coming up, in 2022. I see Republicans hammering on this -- on this general issue set virtually every single day, and I think a big element of it, Chris, is the recidivism, the re-offending of people who in many cases get out with no bail or very low bail from that horrible series of killings up in Waukesha, Wisconsin, at the Christmas parade, all the way to the guy who burned down the FOX News Christmas tree in New York. He was out within hours because of so called reforms in New York. There are people who are dangerous who should not be on the streets. And far too many of them are and I think people feel that."

      "utterance": "Well, I think Eric Adams represents most Democrats on this issue. You know, the issue is trying to have safe streets at the same time, and here I'm pretty much using Adams's language to hold police accountable when there's misbehavior. You know the thing about this. Chris is, I spoke to Adams during his campaign, and he told me that if working class people in New York are told by any candidate that they were that they plan to defund the police, he said, that candidates going to need intense police protection. This is not a Democrat problem. I think that it's California Governor Newsom who said this week that Texas has a higher rate of violent crime than California. And if you look at the charts right now, I think it's like five of the top states in terms of murder rate per capita have Republican governors. So when you look at this, I really think it boils down to a gun problem. And right now, close to 80 percent of all these murders are being committed with guns. And Adams wants really tough attitude towards getting guns off the street. You know, in New York, there's a big issue about stopping and frisking, especially minority youth, and he says he's afraid in favor of stop, talk and frisk, not ending stop and frisk, stop, talking and frisk. So, I think he doesn't want Starsky and Hutch on the streets. But he wants safe streets, and I think that's what most Democrats want."

There is one way to get control of the spread of the virus, and that's for more people to get vaccinated and in places where you have had vaccine mandates that have gone into place, you've seen vaccination rates rise, you've seen COVID rates come down. But if those -- if those mandates continue to be blocked by the court, the Biden administration looks at this and says, how are -- how are we going to get those vaccine rates up if we're not mandating it? What is the other method for doing so? And then they want they worry about the economy. They worry about our ability to get back to sort of life as normal if we continue to have rates, where they are.

We are going to try to force people to do something. I think that won't sit well with many voters and has not in many cases. And I also was struck by something that Mayor De Blasio said, and he has said this in previous comments as well regarding his very heavy-handed mandate, which is he has cited Omicron as the reason why it's sort of like the triggering of the instigating effect here that brought this about. Based on what you just said Chris, it's true. We are still waiting for a lot of good data on Omicron. But thus far, it does appear to be significantly less virulent. No deaths that we have seen so far around the world. The numbers have fallen significantly in terms of hospitalizations and certainly deaths in South Africa, where it's been circulating for a month.

And you know why I wrote a letter to CBO, because Joe Manchin came to me and he said, I think this bill is full of gimmicks, that these programs won't go away, Lindsey, and if you score them for 10 years, I think the bill will double. Well, it didn't double, it was almost 2.5 times. So, I hope that this will be a showstopper for Build Back Better. But, in 2017, President trump and all Senate Republicans voted for the tax cuts then that added $2 trillion to the economy."

Families in your state of South Carolina with two children, on average, now spend 21 percent of their income on childcare. The Build Back Better plan would cut that to 7 percent of their income on childcare, pre-pandemic 14 percent of children in South Carolina lived in poverty.

So it makes your paycheck go less. It's crushing people who are working. So, if you pass Build Back Better, it declares war on fossil fuels. It gives tax credits to buy electric vehicles made by union plants, which hurts BMW and Volvo. This bill, Build Back Better, will be gasoline on the inflation problem. It destroys the ability to extract fossil fuels. Gas prices went up 58 percent. The last thing I'm going to do is add more burdens to working families in South Carolina. And here's my message to the Democratic Party, quit lying about this bill. They should revote it in the House. And, Senator Manchin, you were right. I hope you will stand up and stop this madness. We need to stop Build Back Better before it destroys this country."

At the end, we did not make them use reconciliation, which changed the rules of the Senate in a House bill. I don't like that a lot. I like Senator McConnell.

But here's my point, if we're going to be successful in 2022, we're going to have to work together as a team. And here's what I would say to every Republican, if you want to be a Senate Republican leader in the House -- excuse me, a Republican leader in the House or the Senate and you don't have a working relationship with Donald Trump, you cannot be effective.

What we said as a party is, we're going to make them use the reconciliation process to raise the debt ceiling. The Democrats caused this problem. They needed to fix it. If you do it -- if you help them, you're legitimizing this spending. So it really is not about the process as much as it's about keeping your word. We let a lot of people down. Senator McConnell's been a great leader on many things, but we're going into an election cycle where the wind's to our back. We can't do this again. But when you look forward to this party, Donald Trump is the most consequential Republican in the entire Republican Party, maybe in the history of the party since Ronald Reagan.

And while it said that providers can sue, it -- there's a real question as to whether they can sue in a way that they could actually stop the law. Which raises the question, what does this -- it's a separate decision, largely procedural, but what does it indicate about what the Supreme Court may do later this year, later this term in the Mississippi law, versus when it comes to Roe v.

And I think we already saw in the arguments, you know, some of the justices really signaling, you know, pretty clearly that they are willing to either substantially restrict abortion rights or perhaps even overturn Roe completely. And I think that that decision on Friday, again, is just going to raise that concern about where that broader ruling is going to go in the next couple of months."

Wade, or perhaps even overturning it, how big an issue does abortion become in the 2022 midterms? GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM, \"THE GUY BENSON SHOW\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Oh, it will certainly be an issue. And, of course, should that happen, should Roe be curtailed or supplanted, that issue, abortion, would be restored to the states for people to make decisions based on their legislative representatives on those policies. When it comes to the national picture on abortion, I know some Democrats have said, oh, this would really energize our base. It could really turn the election. I think polls suggest that Americans are focused on a lot of other big issues, not just abortion. It could very much fire up or motivate certain people out there. There's no question about that. But I did see a poll this week in Texas, which is Ground Zero on this fight, with that -- with that restrictive, new law. It's been in place for weeks now. And Governor Abbott, who signed that bill into law, is leading his leading Democratic opponents, his top would-be opponent, by 15 points, including by eight points on the issue of abortion. So, I think it's a guessing game how much it would actually affect races. I think there's sort of spin on both sides so far."

They've been on the offensive to try to end Row v. Wade. Now, if it flips, as you describe it, I think what you'll see is that people who are for abortion rights in this country will be on the offense. They'll be marching and they'll be saying that they are protecting women's rights. I mean they also will have a powerful message to take the voters because right now, according to Pew, 59 percent of Americans favor keeping Roe v. Wade as it is. The status quo. And 75 percent of Americans, according to \"The Washington Post, \"think abortions is a matter between a woman and her doctor. So, you know, the number one issue in all midterms is turnout. And what you get, of course, is the economy is the number one issue. But in states where you have governors races, legislative races, as governor -- as Guy was referring to, this is going to be a big issue, and it's going to lead to increased turnout, I think, especially among one very critical group, suburban white women.

Well, they feel good about a couple of things. One, they do feel good about the message that Biden delivered. They think he was extremely tough. They think he was very clear, as Jake Sullivan said, that there are measures beyond what the Obama administration did that the Biden administration would be prepared to do. They also feel really good about the unity among western allies. And that's been something we haven't seen over the last couple years, unity on Russia among the United States and -- and the European. So they feel like they're in lock step with those European leaders. But the big question is how Putin responds. And that's really how they'll know if they made any progress here. If he backs off of his posture in Ukraine or if he moves forward, and that is, in some ways, going to be out of Biden's hands."

I was pleased to see yesterday he's starting to sound a little bit tougher in some of the things that he's saying Biden is. The question here is the -- the psychology of Vladimir Putin. What does he think he can get out of an invasion potentially of Ukraine and is the deterrent effect of all these other threats that are now being put out there and mentioned, are those powerful enough to change his calculus because over the last 10, 15 years we've seen that what the west has done has not stopped him. He continues to do what he feels is in his interest. Is this time really different? Are the threats that are being made explicitly or implicitly enough?

After 18 years, this is my final FOX NEWS SUNDAY. It is the last time, and I say this with real sadness, we will meet like this. Eighteen years ago the bosses here at Fox promised me they would never interfere with a guest I booked or a question I asked, and they kept that promise. I have been free to report to the best of my ability to cover those stories I think are important, to hold our country's leaders to account. It's been a great ride. We've covered five presidential elections, interviewed every president since George H.W. Bush, traveled the world sitting down with France's Emmanuel Macron and Russia's Vladimir Putin. And I've gotten to spend Sunday mornings with you. It may sound corny, but I feel we built a community here. There's a lot you can do one Sunday mornings. The fact you've chosen to spend this hour with us is something I cherish. But after 18 years, I have decided to leave Fox. I want to try something new, to go beyond politics to all the things I'm interested in. I'm ready for a new adventure. And I hope you'll check it out. And so, for the last time, dear friends, that's it for today. Have a great week and I hope you'll keep watching FOX NEWS SUNDAY."
