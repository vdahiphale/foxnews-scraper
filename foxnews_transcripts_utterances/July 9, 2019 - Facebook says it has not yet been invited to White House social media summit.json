      "sentences": "Welcome, everybody. I am Neil Cavuto. And, today, we are departing from our usual heap of politicians screaming at each other to remember a man who never screamed at all, and now has left this world for good. Ross Perot is dead. He was 89 years old. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, some younger folks out there might not know him, remember him, but older Americans won't soon forget him. A man who led his charge do the talking, as much as his stunning quest for the presidency of the United States left all the experts fumbling. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's not just that they underestimated him. They underestimated the power of what he was telling us, all of us, and how our government had failed us, a rage so palpable, some say it festered still in the populist wave that would later bring us Donald Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Ross Perot, a man who made billions in life, worried about the billions more this government was wasting en route to what he warned would be its fiscal death, if we didn't wake up, if we didn't see the bipartisan madness of its ways, spending more than we were taking in year in and year out. And he was on it. Armed with a little more than charts on a stand and a matching chip on his shoulder, Ross Perot figured, if he didn't say something, no one would do anything. So, back in 1992, Perot took on the established parties to say, both Democrats and Republicans had failed this country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Who does that remind you of, by the way? And he was going save it, run for president of the United States to get the attention of everyone in the United States. They said he was wasting his time, that no one would want to listen to lectures on budgets that really didn't seem to matter, too depressing, too boring, too much. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the political experts underestimated American voters as much as they did Ross Perot himself, this third-party candidate who took on an incumbent Republican president who had triumphed in Kuwait, and a rising Democratic star named Bill Clinton, who had electrified crowds, managed to upend politics, for a while an entire presidential race. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In fact, before he abruptly quit that race himself, for a short time, Ross Perot was leading those established candidates. And when he reentered, he still managed what no third-party candidate had ever done before or since, garner a stunning 19 percent of the vote. His message was as simple as it was certainly unconventional and, well, politically suicidal. His goal? Be frank, be jarring, be real. But he spelled it all out on paper, a spending bill and a binge that was unsustainable. Leave it to Bill Clinton to heed his warnings and start hacking that spending years later. But the seeds were planted with Ross Perot that election year, and hopefully a reminder to politicians now you can level and should level with the American people this year, all years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And years after that historic run, it was a message he repeated as a CEO.",

We lead with that, which is why we're all over that with his son, Ross Perot Jr., on his dad's quest to keep the nation's debt from blowing up, and his handpicked Svengali, you might say, the former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, who launched a national campaign to make the importance of spending only what you have sink in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then there's poster Tom Bevan on how Perot darn near sent the two-party system as we know it tumbling down.

So it's about whether the government should mandate it or the private sector. And we talked recently about Amazon lifting its minimum wage to $15 an hour.

And, today, we are departing from our usual heap of politicians screaming at each other to remember a man who never screamed at all, and now has left this world for good. Ross Perot is dead. He was 89 years old. Now, some younger folks out there might not know him, remember him, but older Americans won't soon forget him. A man who led his charge do the talking, as much as his stunning quest for the presidency of the United States left all the experts fumbling. It's not just that they underestimated him. They underestimated the power of what he was telling us, all of us, and how our government had failed us, a rage so palpable, some say it festered still in the populist wave that would later bring us Donald Trump. Ross Perot, a man who made billions in life, worried about the billions more this government was wasting en route to what he warned would be its fiscal death, if we didn't wake up, if we didn't see the bipartisan madness of its ways, spending more than we were taking in year in and year out. And he was on it. Armed with a little more than charts on a stand and a matching chip on his shoulder, Ross Perot figured, if he didn't say something, no one would do anything. So, back in 1992, Perot took on the established parties to say, both Democrats and Republicans had failed this country. Who does that remind you of, by the way? And he was going save it, run for president of the United States to get the attention of everyone in the United States. They said he was wasting his time, that no one would want to listen to lectures on budgets that really didn't seem to matter, too depressing, too boring, too much. But the political experts underestimated American voters as much as they did Ross Perot himself, this third-party candidate who took on an incumbent Republican president who had triumphed in Kuwait, and a rising Democratic star named Bill Clinton, who had electrified crowds, managed to upend politics, for a while an entire presidential race. In fact, before he abruptly quit that race himself, for a short time, Ross Perot was leading those established candidates. And when he reentered, he still managed what no third-party candidate had ever done before or since, garner a stunning 19 percent of the vote. His message was as simple as it was certainly unconventional and, well, politically suicidal. His goal? Be frank, be jarring, be real. But he spelled it all out on paper, a spending bill and a binge that was unsustainable. Leave it to Bill Clinton to heed his warnings and start hacking that spending years later. But the seeds were planted with Ross Perot that election year, and hopefully a reminder to politicians now you can level and should level with the American people this year, all years. And years after that historic run, it was a message he repeated as a CEO."

Ross Perot did that. Today, we remember that. We lead with that, which is why we're all over that with his son, Ross Perot Jr., on his dad's quest to keep the nation's debt from blowing up, and his handpicked Svengali, you might say, the former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, who launched a national campaign to make the importance of spending only what you have sink in. Then there's poster Tom Bevan on how Perot darn near sent the two-party system as we know it tumbling down. We begin, though, with the man named Russ who made a household word out of Ross, Russ Verney, who single-handedly -- he will never say that -- helped make Ross Perot make history.

And that certainly is one of the important ones, that we should be looking to base - - base our trade policies on strength and not on favors. NAFTA was all about building an extrajudicial system in Mexico to protect investors against government takeover of their properties down there. It wasn't about fair trade. It was very managed trade, with multiple volumes of books explaining it. So Ross was able to take a lot of these complicated issues and explain them to people. He went on into health care, many other subjects over the life of his -- his political activity."

But, in reality, Neil, the exit polling that was paid for by the news media on Election Day, when people reported to them that they voted for Clinton or Bush, they were asked a follow-up question. If you thought Ross Perot could -- could win, would you have voted for him? This is after he get out and got back in. And the analysis of that question is, Ross Perot could have won if people thought he could win. So, yes, I think if he had stayed in, he could have won. But he has had a great impact on all of American life through his philanthropy, through his dedication, devotion to his family and especially to his commitment to politics, because it's all about service, and not about self."

But he made a big difference. He didn't win that race. But he made fiscal responsibility a top priority for Bill Clinton. Even his Cabinet secretaries will admit that publicly. He also helped to contribute to the Contract for America. And the combination of those two things led us to surpluses for four years. But now we're totally out of control.

I mean, he did spend some $60 million of his own money, and he had the money to spend. But the thing that we learned about Ross Perot is that he was authentic, and he was able to explain these subjects to voters and communicate with them in a way not dissimilar to Donald Trump, in a way that experts didn't see coming. And he really was a leader for that time. And, again, had he not gotten out of the race, we don't know what would have happened, but certainly the results, 19 million votes that year in 1992.

Whatever your politics, you cannot deny the wisdom of what both men offered, in Ross Perot' case, a stark reminder that the two parties had failed when it came to doing their essential job, handling the books.

Keep it in mind, this covers the period he is a private citizen, leaving the White House and the vice president's mansion. And he's done OK for himself. He and his wife, Jill, have made more than $15 million since he left office. He made a lot of money, so much money, it dwarfs any of the opponents including who up until now was the number one moneymaker among the presidential candidates, Kamala Harris of California, who, with her husband, made a little bit more than $2 million. The fact of the matter is, though, however you view this, that if you count the years he was vice president and released tax returns every year and all the years before that he was senator, they have more than two decades of returns that Joe Biden has released for all the world to see. And I have been -- been going year by year, and they're all there. It's a reminder, no doubt, the Biden campaign is sending to the United States that he has not done the same. How big a deal is that?

It doesn't name him by name, but it targets him. And the federal courts look very, very, very skeptically at legislation that was written just to target one taxpayer. So even though this legislation basically says to the Congress, do you want Donald Trump the private citizen's state tax returns, from which you can extrapolate what he reported to the feds?

And it's something like two-thirds of Americans are in favor of the question. And that includes a majority of Hispanics and a majority of Democrats, slight majorities, but still a majority.

You're talking about California, you're talking about New York, but you're also talking about Texas, you're also talking about Florida. So this notion that it's going to adversely impact minorities and, by extension, Democrats, to me is a bunch of bunk, because, realistically, you could actually make the argument that President Trump is shooting himself in the foot and shooting the party in the foot, because if the influence of Texas is diminished, if the influence of Florida is diminished, you're going to see a lot of GOP power in D.C. diminish as a result of that."

      "speaker": "AMY MCGRATH, D-KY, SENATORIAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's important to note that the only major piece of legislation that Senator McConnell was able to do when he had all the power was this tax windfall for corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent. And the problem that I had with the tax cuts was not that I'm for tax cuts -- or against tax cuts for the middle class. I'm not. I didn't marry a millionaire. I married a Navy man. So, everybody wants low taxes. The problem that I had was his priority was always corporations. If you -- your priority should have been the people of Kentucky, and he should have made the middle-class tax cuts permanent. And he didn't do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. But, again, to be fair -- and, again, you can argue the size and scope of the tax cuts, but about 80 percent of Americans did get them. And I don't know how that percentage breaks down in Kentucky. But would you tell residents of Kentucky, I'm going to scrap all of those and start fresh?"
    },

      "speaker": "MCGRATH",

    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGRATH",
      "utterance": "I think that's something we should look at. I mean, look, those tax cuts that Mitch McConnell championed, you have to remember they almost doubled our deficit. They increased our debt by $2 trillion. I don't think that's very responsible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, you're new to this. You're new to politics. And I commend you for saying that. But Democrats had a hand in increasing the debt before this president, and the Republican president before that president, and the Democratic president before that president. The debt has exponentially gone way out of control. Would you make it a central part of your duty, if you become a United States senator, to address the debt?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGRATH",
      "utterance": "I think we absolutely have to address the debt. It's something that's very important to me. I am also very concerned about it. Guys like Mitch McConnell and -- Senator McConnell have said that they are concerned about the debt. And then, when they get in power, what do they do? They increase it. I think it's a problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, they all do that, right? Democrats, Republicans alike, they all do that. So how would you stop it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGRATH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you stop it by getting people elected who are honest with the American people about our debt. And we have to pay for that the goods and services we want government to provide. I think that's very important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. But Barack Obama was sincere, I take it at face value, in trying to deal with the debt. He couldn't deal with it, George Bush before him equally sincere, and no one seems to get a handle on it. Is it so important to you that you might scale back some spending to deal with it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGRATH",
      "utterance": "Well, I will tell you this, that we were on a path to decrease our deficit in the last few years of the last administration, and we were on that path. And then Senator Mitch McConnell came in with these -- this tax windfall, and we now almost doubled it. So that's not the right thing to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know if we were on a path. We were certainly in the years of Bill Clinton. You're quite right about that. I don't know if we were on a path there. But you would go ahead and address entitlements as well to deal with that, as you're cutting tax cuts that were in trail now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGRATH",
      "utterance": "I think what we need to do is get people in office who want to look at a range of things and come together as Republicans and Democrats and look at our debt and how we address it. I think that we started to try to do that with things like the Bowles- Simpson plan and the Rivlin-Domenici plan."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGRATH",
      "utterance": "And that was thrown away. Why was it thrown away? Because we had people that just didn't -- didn't want to go to that. We had the Tea Party, for example, that went -- that held up our national debt and said that they were going to basically hold it hostage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I mean, it wasn't just the Tea Party. I mean, everyone had a hand in this. I guess what I'm asking you -- and, also, as someone who has served in the military in this country very honorably, would you be open to paring defense spending?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGRATH",
      "utterance": "You know, I'm -- here's what I would say about defense. As somebody who's served in three combat tours, as a Marine, I don't think we can pare defense spending until we stop the wars that we're in."

      "utterance": "All right."
    },

      "speaker": "MCGRATH",
      "utterance": "It's very important to me to make sure that we have body armor for our Marines going forward. And so I don't think we can think about that right now until we scale back. And that's why I'm for things like an authorization to use military force. That's why that's such a big, important thing for me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "By the way, we want to let you know we did put out a call to Mitch McConnell's office, fair and balanced, to get him on. They are working on it. All right. In the meantime, the Democrats' fight for a $15 minimum wage. A government study has said that 17 million Americans would get a raise, but a little bit more than a million would lose their jobs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The Congressional Budget Office has a report out that says a $15 minimum wage would boost pay for about 17 million folks in this country. That's the good thing. Now the bad thing. It would eliminate more than 1.3 million jobs in the process. So is it worth that tradeoff? The host of FOX Business Network's \"The Evening Edit,\" great show, great host, Elizabeth -- wicked smart -- MacDonald. So, Faustian choice here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELIZABETH MACDONALD, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, that is the choice. And the 1.7 million job losses, that was the average. They were saying upwards, I think, of 3.7 million losses. That could be the upper band. This is CBO saying it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "This is the CBO saying it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The idea that you boost it, someone's going to have to go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACDONALD",
      "utterance": "Low-skilled workers would have to go, the very people who would benefit from the higher wages. Listen, we want to get higher pay for workers, absolutely, across the country. But it's -- but how do you do it? Should the government top down do it? That's the debate right, Neil? Because we know that Bernie Sanders loves the Nordic countries, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, Norway. They do not have a minimum wage. They leave it up to the private sector to work it out in collective bargaining with unions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But don't a lot of states now, a good many, more than half, have higher minimum wages, some as or getting in the direction of $15 anyway? But the markets ultimately would decide this, right? You and I know of towns where jobs go begging at $15, and the Wendy's and all these legendary stories, where they can't get those jobs filled."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACDONALD",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's the point. And also your point is well taken about the states doing it, because the cost of living is different in each state, certainly lower in the Midwest vs. New York or California. So is that the one size fits all federal minimum wage? Or should you just leave it to the states? We know that, for example, China has a mandated minimum wage, and they pay, what, $1 an hour? So it's about whether the government should mandate it or the private sector. And we talked recently about Amazon lifting its minimum wage to $15 an hour. People say, ooh, that was the moral thing to do. Amazon was morally right to do that. What did Amazon do? They cut stock compensation. They cut bonuses. They cut worker jobs and had 100,000 robots instead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, you give it in one area, take it away in another. But the Armageddon that a lot of folks feared with this coming was, it didn't materialize, right? For a lot of people -- we're looking to deal with record unemployment lows here in some of these states and all where wages did go up. But that's a booming economy, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACDONALD",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's -- so that's the issue. Can a booming economy just lift more boats than having the government step in and saying, yes, lift the wages? Again and again, we say, yes, what is the best way to get wages on the rise? We know they're up under the Trump administration. Like, I don't know if the top-down approach works. I mean, I'm just looking at all the data here. And we see that with the minimum wage, more than half leave that low-wage job within a year, and they go up the income ladder. So it's not that they're locked on that minimum wage job. There's a lot a mobility up and out. It's usually college age students who have the minimum wage job. It's a terrible that we're in this country where people are trying to raise a family on the minimum wage. That's not how this economy is supposed to be working."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. If the economy itself is sound, invariably, the minimum wage goes up anyway."
    },

      "speaker": "MACDONALD",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

The time is now for Congress to declare a climate emergency and swiftly mobilize federal resources in response to protect the interests of our nation and its people.\" And Ocasio-Cortez continued pitching the climate emergency on a conference call just now."

      "utterance": "There's a lot of text about how bad global warming has gotten and the need to address it. But there is not a lot of new text about specifically how these Democratic lawmakers would do that. And believe it or not, these Democrats claim they are trying to take a page from the Trump playbook. Congressman Earl Blumenauer says, when President Trump declared a national emergency at the border, they decided they could declare a national emergency for the planet. And expect to hear a lot more of this on the campaign trail, because Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, who is involved with this as well, called climate change an existential threat today -- Neil."

One platform that has faced its share of challenges, Facebook, well, they're apparently saying, we were not invited.

The president's been on a tear against all these social media companies, Facebook, Google, and especially lately Twitter, who he is accusing of making it harder for people to follow him.

But, look, there is no question, Neil, that Facebook, Twitter and Google, whose executives are anti-Trump, are all left-leaning organizations. Mark Zuckerberg has talked about this. He's invited conservatives. And they have a problem. Whether it's anecdotal or systemic remains to be seen. They also have a problem because, basically, the climate's turned against them. There's talk of government regulation. They're even resigned, I think, to government regulation. Why?"

They have almost invited it, because they have -- they're always apologizing for it. They're always fighting the last war. They don't seem able to get a handle on this. But the antitrust question, look, they're successful businesses who play by the rules. I don't see the problem there. That should be separated from the complaints by Trump and Republicans of bias."
