It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" The White House is fighting a brand-new battle to combat internal leaks, President Trump taking to twitter to blast staffers for the latest wave of unauthorized media disclosures. The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the fake news media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are. Top White House advisor Kellyanne Conway is also warning that big changes are coming and that these leakers could soon be kicked to the curb. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He brings in families, he brings in loyalists, the campaign people, the insiders, the military, the ideologues, non-ideologues. When you have that many different factions you're going to have a diversity of opinion. Also, Trump devours TV and print media, obviously. So, one of the ways you influence him is either leak or do TV hits. He's also a talker. So he talks to a thousand people a day. He's on the phone. He's calling people, and he's extremely emotional and passionate and speaks colorfully and bluntly. So, a lot of times after you hear the president, you can't resist the urge to leak because it's so money, you can't believe what the president said. Can you believe he said this?

So, when I was there, I would say if the White House communications team was on the front page of the paper or leading The Five, I would have been mortified, because you don't want to be in the news. You want the president to be the news. And he is the news, because this is also just a part of him. The other way to look at this, though, is that if we are leading the show with this news that must mean things are pretty good elsewhere. I mean, we're not leading it with any other, sort of, dramatic things that we're going to talk about Israel and Gaza in the next block. So, I do think that there's a big problem. I think that a lot of people believe that if they're talking to somebody in the media and you get a little bit of a thrill when you see yourself quoted, even if it's anonymously because you know that somebody thinks you're important. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So those reporters keep going back. They're not fake. They're actually journalists who are reporting the story. The president calls them traitors. And I would assume in a small group like the one they have where the McCain comments leaked about Kenny Sadler, they probably know who it is. I do think it's interesting though that Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, one of her tweets yesterday was that sometimes that people complaining most about the leaks are actually the leakers.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" The White House is fighting a brand-new battle to combat internal leaks, President Trump taking to twitter to blast staffers for the latest wave of unauthorized media disclosures. The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the fake news media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are. Top White House advisor Kellyanne Conway is also warning that big changes are coming and that these leakers could soon be kicked to the curb."

And I will tell you that something else is going on in this White House, but not as badly as it was in the beginning, where it's not so much leaking, it's using the media to shiv each other. If you work at the pleasure of the president, as we all do here, and you have the privilege and the blessing of coming today every -- today, every work in this White House on behalf of the nation."

      "utterance": "As Comey says, there's a lot of weasel moves being made in the Trump White House, and there's reasons for that. A few reasons. President Trump brings out the best and the worst in people because he encourages competition with his staff, so some people leak when they feel they're down and they need to move up. He's also, being an outsider businessman, brought in a thousand different factions. He brings in families, he brings in loyalists, the campaign people, the insiders, the military, the ideologues, non-ideologues. When you have that many different factions you're going to have a diversity of opinion. Also, Trump devours TV and print media, obviously. So, one of the ways you influence him is either leak or do TV hits. He's also a talker. So he talks to a thousand people a day. He's on the phone. He's calling people, and he's extremely emotional and passionate and speaks colorfully and bluntly. So, a lot of times after you hear the president, you can't resist the urge to leak because it's so money, you can't believe what the president said. Can you believe he said this? And then people are inspired to leak. It's true."

We know Comey himself hated Trump personally, the FBI people too. And Comey leaked in order to trigger the special counsel. I think Kelly has gotten a hold on it. It was started as a Niagara Falls, now it's like half of Niagara Falls, but it's still bad. In the same sense, Trump utilizes the leaks because he can say, now, look at the fake news media, and he can try to diminish their credibility. At the same time, there is fake news, there is legit leaks, but there is fake news because you have these sources that are unnamed, unverified, unsubstantiated coming from third-rate players who have axes to grind. And they feed the press and the press spins it negative. The Obama White House, you never have this problem. No one leaked because they were on the same side of the press. So, everything that came out of the Obama White House was spin, and it was spun positively for Obama."

So, when I was there, I would say if the White House communications team was on the front page of the paper or leading The Five, I would have been mortified, because you don't want to be in the news. You want the president to be the news. And he is the news, because this is also just a part of him. The other way to look at this, though, is that if we are leading the show with this news that must mean things are pretty good elsewhere. I mean, we're not leading it with any other, sort of, dramatic things that we're going to talk about Israel and Gaza in the next block. So, I do think that there's a big problem. I think that a lot of people believe that if they're talking to somebody in the media and you get a little bit of a thrill when you see yourself quoted, even if it's anonymously because you know that somebody thinks you're important. So those reporters keep going back. They're not fake. They're actually journalists who are reporting the story. The president calls them traitors. And I would assume in a small group like the one they have where the McCain comments leaked about Kenny Sadler, they probably know who it is. I do think it's interesting though that Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, one of her tweets yesterday was that sometimes that people complaining most about the leaks are actually the leakers. So, I don't know who's getting fired."

If you say, oh, my God, this is a leak, this is terrible. Guess what? The real problem here is what was said, and then the failure to apologize publicly for it. And so, it's kind of like, well, let's throw up the fog, let's put on the shoes and the act and the mask, and we'll pretend that's not the story. The story is the leak. The leaks have been there all along. I was just curious about leak. Well, just remember, it was just last week I think that the president -- maybe it was this week, things go so quickly. The president was tweeting about this Chinese company and the negotiators who were trying to make a deal on trade with China, said we don't know about -- where did that come from? Why is that in the papers? Or you think about something like, you know, going back his light schedule in the morning, his executive time, said that's a leak. Gee, I don't know. Rob Porter, John Kelly. How about his nasty comment about people coming from Africa, the Caribbean, El Salvador? How about just last week, Kirstjen Nielsen, they say, oh, Kirstjen Nielsen wasn't going to resign -- oh, then John Kelly says, yeah, I called her and asked her not to resign."

When you say something and all of a sudden it becomes a big story because somebody leaked it. So, the point of this story isn't about the item itself, which is the joke.

And it leads you to this big question, what have groups like Hamas done for the Palestinian people in terms of quality of life versus, say, America which has gives -- you know, hundreds of millions of Palestinian aid. And the answer is Hamas isn't interested in the quality of life of their civilians, because if there was an improvement, then there is no incentive for violence. So, they need to keep the Palestinians unhappy and miserable, or they won't actually obey them when they get on the loudspeakers and tell them to converge on the border. This has all been done before."

We do exactly what Israel did. We -- probably wouldn't be as restrained as Israel. And, a lot of these people that were there, as Greg said, infiltrated the crowd were Hamas. And we saw local reports coming out of the Mideast that shows a majority of the people that were dead were actually Hamas security forces, and Iranian sponsored Islamic jihad soldiers. So, that hasn't adds up. And when Bette Midler comes out and says what she says -- she's trying to make it look like she cares more about loss of life than Donald Trump. But that's ridiculous, because where was Bette Midler when Obama sat by and ISIS was running wild, killing people? Assad was running wild, killing people. She didn't say anything. So, it's selective outrage. It's based on party, not principle. Greg likes to say this is virtue signaling, but there is no virtue with Bette Midler, because it's all about attacking the president. The Palestinians I would say are in a tough spot and, of course, we believe all loss of life is bad. But, at a certain point, the Palestinians have to say to themselves, listen, we're going to be on the losing end of this. We're outgunned. We have to make peace. Every time they try to bring violence to the border, it works against them. Israel increases their buffer, it hardens Israeli positions. And what they're doing now is not helping, so they have to switch gears because right now it's not working."

As you know, Dana, this country gives billions of dollars to Israel in terms of supporting them and offering them military protection from the likes, so much of that coverage is directed in that sense. But it's also the case, I think, when you see people being killed, or you see people being humiliated, that there's a sense of, oh, my gosh, you know. What's going on? Are we getting the entire story from the other side? So, I think, yesterday, what you have is a situation where people died. There's a loss of life. That's pretty dramatic.

People game the system, sometimes even with game, Kimberly, which makes it hard for real patients. So if you're applying for service animal documentation and you're only doing it because you want Captain Snuggles near you and you're not a veteran or a victim of an accident or illness, you're not being cool.

And President Trump attended the annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service, where he greeted the families of police officers before giving, really, a truly moving speech. And saw the family members there today, and the way he spoke to them was incredible. He called the officers among the bravest Americans to ever live, adding that they stared down danger with courage, with dignity and with pride.
