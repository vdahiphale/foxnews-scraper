Now, Felicity Huffman, very early in all of this, confessed to her crime, apologized profusely, and worked out this plea agreement. Of course, the judge can look at all of the facts as they come and make their own determination. And, ultimately, this judge, Indira Talwani, decided that two weeks was the right thing to do. Felicity Huffman in court today, apologizing openly and tearfully before that judge, saying that she was deeply ashamed of what she had done, that she had done more damage than she could ever imagine. \"And I realized now, with my mothering, that love and truth go hand in hand.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The \"Desperate Housewives\" star, as you mentioned, confessed to paying $15,000 through the mastermind of this scheme to ultimately facilitate cheating on her daughter's SAT exam, now, of course, convicted felon heading from prison. Now, we're told that she won't have to report until late October, so not an unusual way to end these proceedings. This is not uncommon. A self-report is what essentially is expected to happen. Prosecutors didn't take it easy on her today in court. They came down very hard on her and argued that her efforts and mothering were not excuse for what happened, saying: \"We all want the best, to give them an edge. Most parents have a moral compass, do not step over the line. The defendant didn't.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Her lawyers had argued for probation and 250 hours of community service.

And we are just getting word now that it appears that potentially Felicity Huffman is stepping out of the courthouse. It appears going -- moving quickly into a vehicle, heading out to leave. It doesn't look like she will be stepping up in front of the cameras to make a big statement following this. As you can see, we see a dark car on the corner, most likely will shortly be making a swift exit as the media begins to back away, these big cameras stepping further and further back as folks gets into the car. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

She apologized profusely, and in a statement saying that: \"I can only say that I am so sorry. I was frightened. I was stupid. I was wrong. I'm deeply ashamed of what I have done.\" The attorney -- the assistant U.S. attorney, Eric Rosen, in arguing for some president time, limited though it might have been, was that, \"With all due respect to the defendant, welcome to parenthood,\" going on to say that: \"Parenthood is terrifying, exhausting and stressful, but that is what every parent goes through. What parenthood doesn't include, it doesn't make you a felon. It doesn't make you cheat. In fact, it makes you want to serve as a positive role model for your children.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And with that in mind, the judge agreeing that some prison time, albeit limited as it was and is, was warranted here, in this case, 14 days, as I think Judge Andrew Napolitano was telling Shepard Smith, a very unusual and, in fact, ridiculously low amount of federal prison time. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But it is what it is. Attorney Mercedes Colwin on all of this. What do you make of that 14-day sentence? I guess it could have been up to 30 days, but what do you make of it? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They're looking, they're waiting, they're seeing. Felicity Huffman was the sacrificial lamb that step forward, took the plea, which, frankly, it was the right call, acknowledged that she had done the wrong thing. And, really, frankly, we're all pretty stunned that she has any jail time. She has no criminal record. She was well-represented. She took a very, I think, contrite attitude towards the whole controversy. She managed this controversy and scandal very, very well. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Pretty shocking that she had any days in jail time. Frankly, the 250 hours of community service was more than enough time for lesson learned. But, really, this is about keep making sure that this message is sent to the others that are waiting in the wings for their day in court. Many -- we know that it's up to 40 to 50 of these others that have been in this scandal as well.

It's pretty shocking, truthfully, to see that there was any jail time imposed. And it really goes back to that message that's been sent to the others. Frankly, there's always back-channel communications between defense attorneys and the prosecutors to see if they can negotiate some sort of deal. What's weird about this particular scandal is that they got the big fish first. Usually, the best way to get a negotiated plea for your client is that they're going to -- they're going to negotiate, they're going to give you information, it'll lead to the center, nucleus of the scandal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's not how this happened. We got -- they got the nucleus. And now everybody else gets implicated based on the big fish in the entire scandal. So it really is going to be depending on the prosecutor. And given what they what they said in the courtroom, where it was a continued lashing against Felicity Huffman, and I'm sure the continued messaging is, you didn't have a moral compass, you shouldn't have gone down this path.

He has gaffes at times, but people see it as baked into the cake. And he's done a pretty good job with the economy and from a policy perspective. So it's kind of dismissed.

It's unclear actually coming straight to the door, if there's some paperwork that will potentially need to be done inside, very common following major proceedings like these. As you mentioned, 14 days in prison was the sentence that was handed down in this case. Now, Felicity Huffman, very early in all of this, confessed to her crime, apologized profusely, and worked out this plea agreement. Of course, the judge can look at all of the facts as they come and make their own determination. And, ultimately, this judge, Indira Talwani, decided that two weeks was the right thing to do. Felicity Huffman in court today, apologizing openly and tearfully before that judge, saying that she was deeply ashamed of what she had done, that she had done more damage than she could ever imagine. \"And I realized now, with my mothering, that love and truth go hand in hand.\" The \"Desperate Housewives\" star, as you mentioned, confessed to paying $15,000 through the mastermind of this scheme to ultimately facilitate cheating on her daughter's SAT exam, now, of course, convicted felon heading from prison.

Judge Indira Talwani determined that prison time was warranted. And we are just getting word now that it appears that potentially Felicity Huffman is stepping out of the courthouse. It appears going -- moving quickly into a vehicle, heading out to leave. It doesn't look like she will be stepping up in front of the cameras to make a big statement following this. As you can see, we see a dark car on the corner, most likely will shortly be making a swift exit as the media begins to back away, these big cameras stepping further and further back as folks gets into the car."

For those of you just tuning in right now, Felicity Huffman, the \"Desperate Housewives\" star, is going to be serving a 14-day prison sentence probably in another six weeks or so for paying $15,000 to help boost her daughter's SAT scores in that college admissions scandal that grew to include some 34 parents of varying degree and fame and boldface name status that became known simply as the college admissions scandal."

I'm deeply ashamed of what I have done.\" The attorney -- the assistant U.S. attorney, Eric Rosen, in arguing for some president time, limited though it might have been, was that, \"With all due respect to the defendant, welcome to parenthood,\" going on to say that: \"Parenthood is terrifying, exhausting and stressful, but that is what every parent goes through. What parenthood doesn't include, it doesn't make you a felon. It doesn't make you cheat. In fact, it makes you want to serve as a positive role model for your children.\" And with that in mind, the judge agreeing that some prison time, albeit limited as it was and is, was warranted here, in this case, 14 days, as I think Judge Andrew Napolitano was telling Shepard Smith, a very unusual and, in fact, ridiculously low amount of federal prison time. But it is what it is. Attorney Mercedes Colwin on all of this. What do you make of that 14-day sentence? I guess it could have been up to 30 days, but what do you make of it?"

Felicity Huffman was the sacrificial lamb that step forward, took the plea, which, frankly, it was the right call, acknowledged that she had done the wrong thing. And, really, frankly, we're all pretty stunned that she has any jail time. She has no criminal record. She was well-represented. She took a very, I think, contrite attitude towards the whole controversy. She managed this controversy and scandal very, very well. Pretty shocking that she had any days in jail time. Frankly, the 250 hours of community service was more than enough time for lesson learned. But, really, this is about keep making sure that this message is sent to the others that are waiting in the wings for their day in court. Many -- we know that it's up to 40 to 50 of these others that have been in this scandal as well. Most of them have pled not guilty. We know Lori -- obviously, Lori Loughlin comes -- the first person that comes to mind that she pled not guilty. This is a pretty loud message that prosecutors are not granting any mercy, even if you do manage the scandal as well as Felicity Huffman did and acknowledge wrongdoing at the very get- go."

But does that surprise you, in and of itself, that for -- I'm not trying to minimize the crime, but, in comparison, it seems relatively minor.

It's pretty shocking, truthfully, to see that there was any jail time imposed. And it really goes back to that message that's been sent to the others. Frankly, there's always back-channel communications between defense attorneys and the prosecutors to see if they can negotiate some sort of deal. What's weird about this particular scandal is that they got the big fish first. Usually, the best way to get a negotiated plea for your client is that they're going to -- they're going to negotiate, they're going to give you information, it'll lead to the center, nucleus of the scandal. That's not how this happened. We got -- they got the nucleus. And now everybody else gets implicated based on the big fish in the entire scandal. So it really is going to be depending on the prosecutor. And given what they what they said in the courtroom, where it was a continued lashing against Felicity Huffman, and I'm sure the continued messaging is, you didn't have a moral compass, you shouldn't have gone down this path.

And that's what's going on. And that's why my message is to parents, you can't count on politicians, Neil, because I met with them. They're -- the ones I met are great guys. If they could make a snap and make every school safe, they would. But it boils down to the local level of your school district. They could do whatever they want.

The Biden campaign just blasted out an e-mail to supporters, calling that a low blow. They corrected Castro on some of his information. And despite the Biden campaign being so forward with that, Biden himself doesn't seem too eager to address Castro and what he said.

We look at the debate last night, and they're talking about Joe Biden and his memory. And truth be told, Joe Biden has been a gaffe machine his entire career. You think about when he was running with Obama during the time, how they had to make him sit out, I think it was around the second term, because he was making continuous gaffes. They didn't put him before reporters, they didn't put him before the cameras. So that's -- that's interesting to me that people are acting like it's something new. But the interesting part here for Democrats is, they're looking for a candidate that's almost perfect. They don't see his gaffes as baked into the cake, like Donald Trump. He has gaffes at times, but people see it as baked into the cake. And he's done a pretty good job with the economy and from a policy perspective. So it's kind of dismissed. But, for Democrats, I think they're their own worst enemy in this case when it comes to Joe Biden."

And I don't know how that's working. I do know that he's holding up reasonably well in the polls. He has high likability marks. So I'm wondering whether he weathers the storm or he just gets deeper into it."

I do think that we're -- our candidates are certainly held -- I agree that they're held to a different standard than Donald Trump. But what I do think is being overlooked a little bit -- and it has been reported -- that he did bring -- he held Senator Warren and Senator Sanders to task over their support for Medicare for all. They continue to not be able to answer the question about whether that policy would bring about increases in middle-class tax cuts, and they still weren't able to do that. And he was successful."

And this is the Democratic message. So instead of talking about the economy, as we recognize that none of the economy was brought up, because it's flaming hot right now, they have to have a message that is going to resonate with Americans all over the country, and they don't have that. Cohesively, as a unit, the Democratic Party doesn't have a message that's going to resonate with Americans and make their lives better. And that's why it's problematic. And that's why, when it comes to these gaffes, maybe it's fine in the Democratic primary. But when Trump is on a debate stage with Joe Biden, if Joe Biden gets through, Trump is going to make Joe Biden look like a fool. And I say that respectfully."

And, really, when you look at the situation those northern islands, some of them entire destruction of neighborhoods, tens of thousands of houses gone, and people really just struggling at this point to try to get a foot back on the ground. You see people with no electricity trying to use hammers and nail tarps over gaping holes in their homes. You see people are washing clothes outside, hanging them up on trees.

We're trying to find out a little bit more about this I.G. report that is in the attorney general's hot little hands right now. What are we talking about, and when is it going to come out? After this."

Anyway, Catherine Herridge in Washington with the latest on all of this. What do we know, Catherine?"

      "utterance": "Well, Neil, we are officially in the endgame when it comes to the inspector general's FISA report. We obtained this two-page letter that went from the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, to the congressional Oversight Committees late today. And it confirms that draft findings are now with the Justice Department and the FBI. Now they face the hard process of classification. I have been told that's one of the lingering stumbling blocks here. How much of it will be public, how much of it will be blacked out or redacted? Republicans want as much public as possible. What we also learned from the letter is that Horowitz has reviewed over a million records and interviewed more than 100 witnesses. So it's extensive. But the big question is the timeline. My contacts anticipate there will be a declassification of records prior to the release of the FISA report. That will allow as much of that report to be as public as possible, maybe late September, early October, Neil."
