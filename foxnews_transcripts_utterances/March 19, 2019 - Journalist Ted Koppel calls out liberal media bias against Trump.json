      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” When the founders of this country designed the American Republic, something we're grateful for obviously, but not everyone was impressed by it at the time. Much of Europe scoffed at the idea not just because they were monarchists, though many of them were, even free thinking people of the time. Contemporary liberals were worried it wouldn't work. They didn't think it would. They thought that democracy was an inherently weak system. At some point they believed, unscrupulous politicians would come to power, change the rules in their favor and establish a one-party state. What began as government by the people inevitably would become tyranny. That's what they said at the time. It has not happened. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For more than two centuries, this country has relied on our institutions, our brilliantly designed and remarkably durable institutions to survive as an intact democracy and we have through a Civil War, two World Wars, the great depression, 9/11 and more. All of those events put great stress on our system. None of them broke it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then came 2016. Donald Trump's election has convinced many on the left that our institutions no longer work. They must be torched and replaced by a system that will prevent Trump and anyone like Trump from ever being elected again. That's their goal and they're starting with the judiciary. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At least four leading Democratic presidential candidates have suggested packing the Supreme Court of the United States. Enlarging its size, adding more Democratic appointees, making it explicitly political, a tool of elected officials rather than an independent branch of government. Here is Elizabeth Warren explaining that changing the court is a form of revenge for the crime of having a Republican President. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

This is changing our society. Young people are not leaving their parents' homes. When they do, they live with roommates. They're delaying as we said marriage. Some are not having no children. Colleges, though, by profound contrast are doing great. And if you haven't seen how great they're doing, drive out and take a look at one. Why are they so affluent? Well, because they hike tuition every year, and there are no consequences. With this money, they have funded a building boom that has lasted for decades. Top administrators live like feudal lords enriched by a population of student serfs. The cost of college is distorting our society in a way that is fundamentally unsustainable. Well, the last time we proposed to fix to this, a very simple one -- make colleges share the risk by co-signing student loans of their students.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” When the founders of this country designed the American Republic, something we're grateful for obviously, but not everyone was impressed by it at the time. Much of Europe scoffed at the idea not just because they were monarchists, though many of them were, even free thinking people of the time. Contemporary liberals were worried it wouldn't work. They didn't think it would. They thought that democracy was an inherently weak system. At some point they believed, unscrupulous politicians would come to power, change the rules in their favor and establish a one-party state. What began as government by the people inevitably would become tyranny. That's what they said at the time. It has not happened. For more than two centuries, this country has relied on our institutions, our brilliantly designed and remarkably durable institutions to survive as an intact democracy and we have through a Civil War, two World Wars, the great depression, 9/11 and more. All of those events put great stress on our system. None of them broke it. Then came 2016. Donald Trump's election has convinced many on the left that our institutions no longer work. They must be torched and replaced by a system that will prevent Trump and anyone like Trump from ever being elected again. That's their goal and they're starting with the judiciary. At least four leading Democratic presidential candidates have suggested packing the Supreme Court of the United States. Enlarging its size, adding more Democratic appointees, making it explicitly political, a tool of elected officials rather than an independent branch of government. Here is Elizabeth Warren explaining that changing the court is a form of revenge for the crime of having a Republican President."

And that trust in the court and other institutions keeps this country stable. Would the public still have trust in the court once it becomes an arm of the Democratic Party? Well the feeling is \"Who cares what they think?\" How people feel is not a concern for the Democratic Party right now. They want their power back now and forever and that's why we're hearing calls to abolish the Electoral College.

If that election had been tied in the popular vote, Barack Obama still would have won. The Electoral College keeps the country from becoming a colony of California, Chicago and New York. It demonstrates that America is a union of equal states, not a collection of provinces that revolve around a few powerful cities. The Electoral College also discourages the rise of factional parties that dominate only a small portion of the country. We could go on. But the best argument for keeping the Electoral College is pretty simple for 230 years it has worked, better than any other country systems in history. But because it didn't help the left win a presidential election two years ago, they want it gone forever, and along with it, any restrictions at all on who can vote -- violent felons, illegal aliens and even children.

So I think, look, we've got three states that are actually the economic engine and the population centers of this country whose wills are not necessarily demonstrated both in the Electoral College and in the United States Senate, which needs some reform, too.

Well, they should campaign in Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, so you know it goes both ways, Tucker. I hear what you're saying. And we've got to find a balance. We need to have a long conversation.

This is changing our society. Young people are not leaving their parents' homes. When they do, they live with roommates. They're delaying as we said marriage. Some are not having no children. Colleges, though, by profound contrast are doing great. And if you haven't seen how great they're doing, drive out and take a look at one. Why are they so affluent? Well, because they hike tuition every year, and there are no consequences. With this money, they have funded a building boom that has lasted for decades. Top administrators live like feudal lords enriched by a population of student serfs. The cost of college is distorting our society in a way that is fundamentally unsustainable. Well, the last time we proposed to fix to this, a very simple one -- make colleges share the risk by co-signing student loans of their students. If a student can't pay the debt, college is on the hook. Michael Simkovic is a Professor of Law and Accounting at the University of Southern California and he joins us tonight.

The upside of education is people who are educated earn substantially more money, they're more likely to be employed. They are less of a burden on social insurance programs like unemployment and disability, and that provides benefits to the student, but it also provides benefit to the government - to government budget in the form of higher income tax revenue, higher payroll tax revenue and lower expenses and the benefits to the government in the form of higher revenue and lower expenses. And the benefits to the government in the form of higher revenue and lower costs are actually larger than the benefits to the educational institution in the form of tuition.

Well, let me give you some example. So at Baylor -- I just picked this up right at the top -- Baylor University in Texas. President Ken Starr. I know him, fine guy. His compensation about $5 million a year. The average debt for someone graduating from Baylor $44,000.00. The average early career pay for a graduate $54,000.00.

There's another view out there, Tucker and that is, \"Look, students who can succeed in life go to college, but college doesn't have anything to do with their preparation and we look at colleges and we see what's going on, people look at the way money is spent. They look at the classes students take and they say, \"Wait a second. Is college really the key to students making it in life?

I think what's interesting if you look at younger schools, upstart schools that are trying to disrupt this space, it's a different story for them. They don't have that reputation. Every student they send out to the marketplace, they've got skin in the game.

It's from Siena College, and it shows that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has wasted no time in becoming deeply unpopular among voters in her home state of New York. A total of 33% of those polled said they liked Ocasio-Cortez, a whopping 44% did not. How did someone who has been in Congress only a few months turn off so many people and so quickly? Well, the Congresswoman has a ready answered for that as she does for most things. As she explained on Twitter, Republicans working in concert with that dastardly Fox News quote, \"Otherize and demonize anyone who isn't quote, 'a white male.'\" In other words, it's bigotry, pure and simple. Those may look like bad poll numbers. What they really are, is racism. Now it's possible you will scoff at this explanation. It is whiny and predictable and totally self- serving. It's also unsupported by evidence. So skepticism is a fair response. But let's go a little deeper for a second. What we have here is not simply a cynical excuse for personal failings when we've heard a thousand times from politicians, racism. What Ocasio-Cortez has given us instead is a litmus test for our souls. It's simple. When you agree with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, you are a good person. When you disagree with her, you are not. You're racist, a bigot, a hater, a loathsome human being. Got that? Okay, prepare for the exam. We're not proctoring this test. We're on TV right now and you're at home or in a bar, we're going to have to use the honor system here. We're going to play you a series of clips. Now be honest about how you feel about them. Everything hangs in the balance. First, we're going to consider AOC's views on children. She doesn't have any and there's a reason for that. She cares too much. Her heart is too big. Watch her explain."

You're probably a white supremacist.

And it turns out, Tucker, Gallup also had a poll on March 15th, which found that her unfavorable ratings have increased by 15 points since the last poll they did in September 2018. And the reason being is that the more Americans find out about her, the less they like her. The more that they get to know her, the more that they form an opinion on her, the less likely they are to like her because back in September 2018, 50% of Americans didn't know who she was.

You've got a council and a mayor's office that is playing politics, they're being ideological. They go after anyone like me, who happens to say, \"Hey, maybe we should be helping these people, putting them into treatment, putting them into housing,\" but they say, \"Well, we would just be inconveniencing them.\" That it's not compassionate to move them from site to site. I'm sorry. It's not compassionate to let them live like this. Your compassion is killing people."

      "utterance": "No, and they're drug addicts. So it sounds like your mayor doesn't care about Seattle at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RANTZ",
      "utterance": "The mayor on this particular issue loves to talk about how much she cares and that's sort of a theme going on all across the country with some progressive. They like to tell us how much they care, but they don't actually follow it up with any action. We have a governor right now who's desperately trying to become President, who is talking about how amazing Washington is, while completely ignoring that a major city in Washington, a hub for business and the economy is dying because of a lack of leadership and it's a shame."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I mean, it's absolutely shocking that this could happen. Is there anybody and I wish we had more time for this -- but is there anybody in elected office in Seattle who is going to fix this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RANTZ",
      "utterance": "There are some Republicans and Democrats who are in Olympia, in our capital who are looking at this at a sort of from a bigger picture, they're going to help in small quantities, but unless we get a change in leadership in the council in Seattle and the mayor's office, I just don't think they're going to be able to move anything through, but there are some Democrats and Republicans who are taking this really seriously because they live in the neighborhoods that are impacted and the problem with Seattle politics, they tend to spread to other parts of the state."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I hope they do because what's happening is cruel and awful. Jason Rantz. Thank you for that. Good luck there."

      "speaker": "RANTZ",
      "utterance": "Thank you."

      "utterance": "You can't overstate how well done that one hour news documentary was. It's by KOMO, the station out in Seattle. It is posted on our \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" Facebook page. I hope you'll take a look at it. We are out of time tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.
