Now, we have been telling you that we have been expecting the results of four separate federal investigations into the deep state. Breaking tonight, according to our sources, the first of those reports is set to be released soon, maybe as early as tomorrow. The DOJ inspector general's official findings on James Comey are now imminent, and it's not looking good for, well, Mr. Super Patriot, the guy who did know (ph) better than us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we are told that the former report will strongly rebuke the disgraced former FBI director, document his utter lack of candor. That means lying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we're also being told that the report the inspector general is putting out tomorrow has referred Comey for federal prosecution for stealing government documents, leaking confidential government memos that detailed conversations with the president, a clear violation of the Espionage Act. These documents were so sensitive, one month after Comey was fired by Donald Trump, the president, the FBI agent showed up at the disgraced former director's front door to retrieve the memos and interrogate Comey about his rampant misconduct. And as of now, the attorney general -- well, he has reportedly decided not to at this moment charge Comey over this criminal referral. However, this is what is a tiny piece of what the bigger report will be and the three major reports that are coming, and without a doubt, Comey should be sweating a lot tonight about what might be in those reports. This report is expected to be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Jim Comey. In the coming weeks, when we get the FISA, full FISA abuse report by the inspector general -- as we have long reported, Jim Comey is playing a starring role in that investigation. Remember, he signed three of those FISA applications. All of them, he had been warned about on multiple occasions, all of them, the bulk of the information, Hillary Clinton's bought and paid-for Russian dossier, or what \"The New York Times\" now refers to as, oh, likely, Russian disinformation from the get-go. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, that's where premeditated fraud on the FISA court, for the purpose of spying on a presidential candidate, a president-elect, and a president of the United States were all obtained under false pretenses, fraud before a court, and were also used in an attempt to destroy a duly elected president. That's how serious this all gets. We're also awaiting what will ultimately be the Durham-Barr report on what are the origins of the Russia probe. Now, this report will dig into how America's powerful tools of intelligence were used and abused against President Trump's campaign and then, President Trump. And also, whether, in fact, illegal spying incurred, the outsourcing of intelligence gathering to friendly countries like Italy, Great Britain and Australia, all designed to circumvent U.S. laws against spying against Americans without a warrant, for the purpose of destroying a duly elected president. That will be a bombshell. James Comey is also implicated in that particular case. We also await to see what roles James Clapper and John Brennan played in all of this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, Andy McCarthy, as he points out in his brand-new book, there is no such thing as a counterintelligence investigation unless the president of the United States was involved. That would mean, at some point, as these reports now come out one after another, former President Obama must be asked under oath, what did you know about your counterintelligence investigation and when did you know it? Because at some point, we will also get another report on deep state leaking, which is also a criminal offense. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And thanks to the excellent investigative journalism from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, we know that James Comey and his high ranking cohorts are now under a microscope, not a pretty picture, all must be held accountable. We can't have a two-tier justice system now, can we? Sunlight is the best disinfectant. You can't have one justice system for the Clintons and people that work at the DOJ, and the upper echelons at the DOJ, the FBI, and one for the rest of us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I can't imagine any of you at home, that if you had subpoenaed emails and you just tried -- tried to delete them, destroy the hard drive, bust up the devices and remove the SIM cards, that that would work out well for you. And if you were warned that the information you were about to present before a court was full of lies, it's unverified, it's not corroborated, it had a political agenda, and you presented it anyway, as if it was verified, which we now know to be unverifiable, I don't think you'd do very well before that judge, when that judge came down hard on you for lying to a court. So, we have good news on all these fronts tonight. And according to Solomon, a new White House initiative by President Trump to declassify a variety of government documents is now underway. That is huge news. We need transparency. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining us now with more is investigative journalist, executive vice president of \"The Hill\", John Solomon. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is like an office of transparency?",

That's a little bit different than the story we have been hearing for the last few years. The second is a series of intelligence reports that were given to the committee that approved of the Uranium One purchase -- remember that? Remember the Obama administration telling us there were no red flags? My sources tell me these documents show there were red flags raised. And then third is this annex that the Inspector General Michael Horowitz prepared that shows what the FBI wanted to look out at the end of the Hillary Clinton investigation, highly classified, sensitive evidence that agents were not allowed to look at. All three of those documents could be big revelations this fall. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They don't know who they are. But when they watch them, they don't like them. There is a great disrespect for the media today. They have a credibility problem. Thanks to them. They've turned off half of America. They treat half of America with utter contempt. They bring on their news shows. You know this, the days of Huntley Brinkley and Howard K. Smith are long over. Can you imagine, what have we heard over the last two years. They bring in a porn actress hundreds of times, her now soon to be felonious lawyer hundreds of times, they bring on a neo-Nazi Jake Tapper did to try and attack the President. They had a fire in anti-Semitic professor over there at CNN, doing better than the New York Times, who still has their anti- Semitic senior editor, race spading professors endlessly. Ex-Obama officials with their vicious allegations against the President. Never Trump-ers who nobody has ever heard it before with their vicious allegations against the President. And what do we hear day in and day out from our unpatriotic media that the President is Hitler. Do they know who Hitler is that the President is Stalin. That he is Mussolini. That he is a White Supremacist. That he is a racist. A bigot. An anti-Semite. A dictator. I just wrote these down when I hear them. A neo-Nazi, he's depraved, he's treasonous, he's demented, mentally ill, serial liar, compromised. I mean to me that all sounds I chose Scarborough, but what do I know. Now, what else do they push? Russia collusion, lie, the dossier, lie, impeachment, bizarre obstruction, lie. So, of course the public's turning on the press and the President has every right to defend himself. Now I brought a few books, a few books that I'm sure journalists don't have the capacity to read, although they like this one. The dangerous case of Donald Trump by Dr. Bandy Lee. Who the hell is Dr. Bandy Lee? I don't know. But they found her at Yale. And what did she decide. Having never met the President, talk to the President or anything else. She and 27 of her colleagues decided that President is mentally ill and shouldn't be President. Well guess what, they pulled that same one in 1964 against Barry Goldwater and the American Psychiatric Association told them to cut it out, but they don't cut it out. That's our media today. See this book, it's called Propaganda. Big book during the Woodrow Wilson administration than FDR. You know who likes this book? Our media like this book. Things aren't as they seem just position them and then they project on top of them. Another book. The image. This gentleman was former director of the Library of Congress. You know what he wrote that the media creates pseudo-events. The President is so right. He calls it fake news. They create fake news, pseudo-events and then they report on them and repeat them. Oh! I've got more. Here's three books. Spirit of Community never heard of it. Public Journalism never heard of it. What Are Journalists For, Jay Rosen. You know what these books are, these books are taught to young journalism students and you know what they teach them, it's not enough to pursue objective truth. Social activism, progressivism, that's how you need to wrap your news. This has been going on for 20, 25 years in your universities, ladies and gentlemen, then I have a special one for the New York Times with its anti- Semitic problem. See this book. It's called Buried by the Times, Buried by the Times. See this book. The Abandonment of the Jews. You see this one, I've read all these books. See this one, Beyond Belief. These are three professors, tremendous scholars. Look at this, you know what they wrote, page and verse that the New York Times during the Third Reich, during the Holocaust did everything it could to censor and cover up the extermination of the Jews in Europe. Now, how are you supposed to believe a business that tried to cover up the Holocaust. Now they have anti-Semitic cartoons. We made a mistake. Now they have an anti-Semitic senior editor over their political coverage. Oh! while the Trump people are attacking him. One final thing, this President has been nice to the media. Hello. Nice to the media. Unlike John Adams and Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson, he didn't shut down any newspapers. He didn't imprison any journalists. Unlike FDR and JFK and LBJ, Trump hasn't unleashed the IRS against a single news publisher. They did. Unlike Barack Obama, the great Barack Obama, Trump hasn't surveilled New York Times columnists or Fox reporters or 20 Associated Press reporters and yet they hate him. Why do they hate him, because he's pro-American and they're anti-American? That's the only explanation. That's it.",

The pictures of Maxwell ranged from her lying naked to her and Jeffrey Epstein in what appears to be the White House press briefing room. We don't know if the photos are verified. We do know Epstein had a long relationship with former President Bill Clinton and that Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane dozens of times. Clinton says he knew nothing of Epstein's crimes, but if authorities go after Ghislaine Maxwell for criminal wrongdoing, legal experts say she might save herself by giving up information on powerful people that Epstein surrounded himself with like Prince Andrew, who was seen with Epstein even after he was labeled a sex offender.

      "utterance": "Welcome back. And welcome to “Hannity.” We begin tonight with a Fox News alert. Now, we have been telling you that we have been expecting the results of four separate federal investigations into the deep state. Breaking tonight, according to our sources, the first of those reports is set to be released soon, maybe as early as tomorrow. The DOJ inspector general's official findings on James Comey are now imminent, and it's not looking good for, well, Mr. Super Patriot, the guy who did know (ph) better than us. Now, we are told that the former report will strongly rebuke the disgraced former FBI director, document his utter lack of candor. That means lying. And we're also being told that the report the inspector general is putting out tomorrow has referred Comey for federal prosecution for stealing government documents, leaking confidential government memos that detailed conversations with the president, a clear violation of the Espionage Act. These documents were so sensitive, one month after Comey was fired by Donald Trump, the president, the FBI agent showed up at the disgraced former director's front door to retrieve the memos and interrogate Comey about his rampant misconduct. And as of now, the attorney general -- well, he has reportedly decided not to at this moment charge Comey over this criminal referral. However, this is what is a tiny piece of what the bigger report will be and the three major reports that are coming, and without a doubt, Comey should be sweating a lot tonight about what might be in those reports. This report is expected to be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Jim Comey. In the coming weeks, when we get the FISA, full FISA abuse report by the inspector general -- as we have long reported, Jim Comey is playing a starring role in that investigation. Remember, he signed three of those FISA applications. All of them, he had been warned about on multiple occasions, all of them, the bulk of the information, Hillary Clinton's bought and paid-for Russian dossier, or what \"The New York Times\" now refers to as, oh, likely, Russian disinformation from the get-go. Now, that's where premeditated fraud on the FISA court, for the purpose of spying on a presidential candidate, a president-elect, and a president of the United States were all obtained under false pretenses, fraud before a court, and were also used in an attempt to destroy a duly elected president. That's how serious this all gets. We're also awaiting what will ultimately be the Durham-Barr report on what are the origins of the Russia probe. Now, this report will dig into how America's powerful tools of intelligence were used and abused against President Trump's campaign and then, President Trump. And also, whether, in fact, illegal spying incurred, the outsourcing of intelligence gathering to friendly countries like Italy, Great Britain and Australia, all designed to circumvent U.S. laws against spying against Americans without a warrant, for the purpose of destroying a duly elected president. That will be a bombshell. James Comey is also implicated in that particular case. We also await to see what roles James Clapper and John Brennan played in all of this. Also, Andy McCarthy, as he points out in his brand-new book, there is no such thing as a counterintelligence investigation unless the president of the United States was involved. That would mean, at some point, as these reports now come out one after another, former President Obama must be asked under oath, what did you know about your counterintelligence investigation and when did you know it? Because at some point, we will also get another report on deep state leaking, which is also a criminal offense. And thanks to the excellent investigative journalism from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, we know that James Comey and his high ranking cohorts are now under a microscope, not a pretty picture, all must be held accountable. We can't have a two-tier justice system now, can we? Sunlight is the best disinfectant. You can't have one justice system for the Clintons and people that work at the DOJ, and the upper echelons at the DOJ, the FBI, and one for the rest of us. And I can't imagine any of you at home, that if you had subpoenaed emails and you just tried -- tried to delete them, destroy the hard drive, bust up the devices and remove the SIM cards, that that would work out well for you. And if you were warned that the information you were about to present before a court was full of lies, it's unverified, it's not corroborated, it had a political agenda, and you presented it anyway, as if it was verified, which we now know to be unverifiable, I don't think you'd do very well before that judge, when that judge came down hard on you for lying to a court. So, we have good news on all these fronts tonight. And according to Solomon, a new White House initiative by President Trump to declassify a variety of government documents is now underway. That is huge news. We need transparency. Joining us now with more is investigative journalist, executive vice president of \"The Hill\", John Solomon. This is like an office of transparency?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is. And it could be announced as early as next week. And it gives the president the opportunity to no longer rely on the bureaucracy at DOJ or DNI or all the other alphabet soup agencies that haven't given us transparency. He'll have the ability through this office to release documents. And, tonight, my sources tell me there are three explosive documents from the Obama era that could be at the top of the list on this declassification process that can give us an entirely new story about what under -- what went on under President Obama's secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. One of those are some letters between the Iranian leaders and the president, President Obama, in which Obama promised the Iranians that they could keep their ability to enrich uranium. That's a little bit different than the story we have been hearing for the last few years. The second is a series of intelligence reports that were given to the committee that approved of the Uranium One purchase -- remember that? Remember the Obama administration telling us there were no red flags? My sources tell me these documents show there were red flags raised. And then third is this annex that the Inspector General Michael Horowitz prepared that shows what the FBI wanted to look out at the end of the Hillary Clinton investigation, highly classified, sensitive evidence that agents were not allowed to look at. All three of those documents could be big revelations this fall."

Tomorrow will be a day to understand why James Comey was fired, when you see the conduct laid out in this report, and also the report that came out in 2018 about his handling of the Clinton email investigation. You will see why President Trump and senior officials at the Justice Department felt confident they should fire James Comey. It will be a day of vindication, I believe, for the president and his judgment to get rid of the disgraced former FBI director."

We will have more detail when this, the first of many revelations, likely begin tomorrow. These are huge, massive developments. Sadly, they are almost completely ignored by other so-called news networks. You know, the same people that spent the last two and a half years spreading lies, propaganda, misinformation -- oh, conspiracy theories have a hoax that we've never seen in our lives -- by the way, did they ever admit they were wrong? No, never. We still see baseless conspiracy theories that fit a vengeful, psychotic, deranged, anti-Trump narrative. It is a psychosis, at this point.

Well, actually, Lawrence, the B.S. you displayed last night was just a perfect example of what NBC's rigorous so-called journalistic standards are, pretty much every night, on every day, for the last two and a half years on your conspiracy network. And breaking just a minute ago, Eric just tweeted that the Trump Organization -- Eric Trump plans to take legal action against O'Donnell. Good. And, of course, only par for the course for so-called NBC News. Normal NBC vetting process, this is what they do every day. And thanks to the networks' Trump derangement syndrome -- well, NBC News has turned themselves into the twilight zone. Every single hour of every day dedicated to spreading their hatred, their propaganda, their lies, their conspiracies, all on behalf of the DNC. They have a political agenda. Don't take my word for it, just listen for yourself. And I can do hours of this if I wanted to. The outright lies that make it through NBC's rigorous verification and standards -- what? -- process.

That's like almost 100 million people, and Stelter wants you to know that he let that insane claim flyby, I think I might have audio problems, whatever (ph) you want to call that out. That is what journalism looks like on CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, and, of course, oh, we can't forget CNN's April Ryan, she values journalism so much that she smiled as her personal bodyguard physically removed a local reporter from covering a speech she was giving. And this week, she actually reported that the fake news story about Donald Trump -- that Donald Trump wanted to nuke hurricanes. No, he doesn't. Shows that the president is racist. This is CNN. Take a look. Apparently the tape got caught. Anyway, we'll get back to that. Anyway, CNN, like MSNBC, every second, minute, hour, every day, baseless identity politic, common tactic in the mainstream media. It's everywhere. And, by the way, another common tactic is when CNN, MSNBC feature so-called Republicans who are conservatives, who in reality, are anything but. All they are, left leaning, Trump-hating liberals living in a state of psychosis and rage every day, and, of course, that's their political identity. Latest example, look at Nicolle Wallace. He once worked for John McCain and Governor Sarah Palin, and several other high-profile Republicans. But now, she, just like her counterpart, liberal Joe, in the morning, she gets a big paycheck from NBC to make crazy, hateful statements about Trump and his family, pretty much the whole hour, every day. You just saw a clip of her claiming that Trump wants to exterminate Latinos. She still has a job, pretty disgusting.

It's not only that Trump has to lose, but all of his enablers have to lose. They have to -- we have to collectively, in essence, burn down the Republican Party.

Recently, the head of \"The New York Times\" just admitted on tape that its whole news division, the entire division, which was dedicated one story, the Russia hoax conspiracy and lie, he says -- then it got tricky. It got tricky because everything they reported for two and a half years was not true. Now, why don't they just admit that they were wrong and make a correction, and say we are going to do better? Let's try that. No, that's not going to happen. Instead, they're going to refocus on Trump and linking everything Trump, everything Republican and conservative, to racism. They are saying it. They're telegraphing it. And meanwhile, one of their own editors was just outed for past anti- Semitic tweets. And remember, \"The Times\" also published that disgusting anti-Semitic cartoon featuring Prime Minister Netanyahu as a seeing-eye dog for President Trump. And let's not forget -- \"The New York Times\" recently changing a front-page headline afterward it was deemed too positive for the president. \"The New York Times\", like almost every other major, mainstream media outlet in this country, nothing more than the propaganda arm of the Democratic Party. I said it in 2007 and it's as more true now than it's ever been. Journalism is dead. Look at how the media mob is every day, how often they are, spectacularly wrong, Cambridge police, Richard Jewell, UVA, Duke lacrosse, Ferguson, Missouri, Baltimore, Maryland, Freddie Gray, Nicholas Sandmann, the kid with the MAGA hat, and how they fail to report on the huge, big city failures for decades. They failed to report on decades of failure, violence, poverty, misery, drugs, the worst education, we pay the most amount of money. We get the worst results. They only use reports that can bludgeon Trump, Republicans, and conservatives. And that's why it's up to us to vet these Democratic candidates because the media never will.

George W. Bush left the White House with his approval in the toilet, he couldn't buy a good story. It's what they do.

Just this week, we learned that prosecutors are nearing a decision as to whether to charge disgraced former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, but that didn't stop fake news CNN from hiring him, fits just perfectly. Here with reaction to that and what we expect coming out tomorrow or very soon, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham. Senator, good to see you. First on the hiring, wasn't he fired for lying and leaking?"

So, if you have any doubt as to where these folks are coming from, I've got some good friends at CNN who try to be good journalists. But here's what happened, Sean, CNN has just hired the alleged architect of criminal conspiracy against the Trump campaign. So how much time and attention do you think they are going to give the Horowitz report when they hired the guy that Horowitz is investigating?"

First will be the Comey report, I expect it to be around 65 pages, some of my sources are suggesting it will be pretty devastating, as -- and it will say that he was not candid with the FBI, lack of candor -- that's lying. That would be what Manafort, Papadopoulos, Flynn, and Cohen got in trouble for and actually got charged with, which Andrew McCabe may face. And I have a problem if we don't apply our laws equally. Then, the next will be the FISA abuse issue, that was the bulk of information. There was a Grassley-Graham memo --"

      "speaker": "GRAHAM",

Without the Steele dossier, there would be no warrant issued against Carter Page. I think you are going to find pretty early on, there was no real belief that Papadopoulos was actually working with the Russians and had no real contact with the president. But I want to repeat what I said earlier on in the interview. CNN has just hired the person Horowitz is investigating for committing crimes against the Trump campaign. CNN has just hired the person Horowitz is investigating. How seriously do you think they're going to take the Horowitz's investigation which is a really a shame?"

And the counterintelligence investigation, there is no real credible evidence I've seen to suggest that Papadopoulos actually was working with the Russians, that came from our own people that told him about the Clinton emails. The bottom-line is who briefed President Obama if anybody about the counterintelligence investigation against the Trump campaign. And finally, why did they not tell the Trump campaign that they had concerns about people working for him tied to Russia. That's what you're supposed to do in a counterintelligence investigation."

The great one Mark Levin joins us next, has a few things to say about fake news, CNN, Jeff Zucker's stenographer, Humpty Dumpty. And later Congresswoman Ocasio- Cortez's latest Instagram rambling. It might be the most bizarre and the dumbest yet. And that's pretty hard to beat and a really big development in the Epstein case. Coming up."

Who can lie more? Who can tell and spread more conspiracy theories? Well, in the last couple of days, pretty stiff competition, you've got Humpty Dumpty, Brian Stelter that would be Jeff Zucker's stenographer and then you've got Lawrence O'Donnell. Yes, he really stepped in it. Well he does pretty much every night. Here now with more, the author of now 14 weeks in a row. Number one, New York Times bestseller Unfreedom of the Press. I call him The Great One, he's the host of Life, Liberty, Levin. Now you know Levin, Great One, I looked at the Nielsen numbers for book sales and fake news Jimmy Acosta, well he released his book right around the time that you did and I saw you're almost at the half a million mark, congratulations and he's at 15,000. And Humpty Dumpty is going to write a book about us here at Fox and probably put our pictures on it and not pay us to sell books. There is a pretty big discrepancy. I would say fake news Acosta earned his lack of sales because they lack of credibility just like O'Donnell."

      "speaker": "MARK LEVIN, HOST OF LIFE, LIBERTY, LEVIN",
      "utterance": "Look, do you want to know the truth, the vast majority of Americans never heard of Jim Acosta or helter skelter Brian Stelter or any of these other people. They don't know who they are. But when they watch them, they don't like them. There is a great disrespect for the media today. They have a credibility problem. Thanks to them. They've turned off half of America. They treat half of America with utter contempt. They bring on their news shows. You know this, the days of Huntley Brinkley and Howard K. Smith are long over. Can you imagine, what have we heard over the last two years. They bring in a porn actress hundreds of times, her now soon to be felonious lawyer hundreds of times, they bring on a neo-Nazi Jake Tapper did to try and attack the President. They had a fire in anti-Semitic professor over there at CNN, doing better than the New York Times, who still has their anti- Semitic senior editor, race spading professors endlessly. Ex-Obama officials with their vicious allegations against the President. Never Trump-ers who nobody has ever heard it before with their vicious allegations against the President. And what do we hear day in and day out from our unpatriotic media that the President is Hitler. Do they know who Hitler is that the President is Stalin. That he is Mussolini. That he is a White Supremacist. That he is a racist. A bigot. An anti-Semite. A dictator. I just wrote these down when I hear them. A neo-Nazi, he's depraved, he's treasonous, he's demented, mentally ill, serial liar, compromised. I mean to me that all sounds I chose Scarborough, but what do I know. Now, what else do they push? Russia collusion, lie, the dossier, lie, impeachment, bizarre obstruction, lie. So, of course the public's turning on the press and the President has every right to defend himself. Now I brought a few books, a few books that I'm sure journalists don't have the capacity to read, although they like this one. The dangerous case of Donald Trump by Dr. Bandy Lee. Who the hell is Dr. Bandy Lee? I don't know. But they found her at Yale. And what did she decide. Having never met the President, talk to the President or anything else. She and 27 of her colleagues decided that President is mentally ill and shouldn't be President. Well guess what, they pulled that same one in 1964 against Barry Goldwater and the American Psychiatric Association told them to cut it out, but they don't cut it out. That's our media today. See this book, it's called Propaganda. Big book during the Woodrow Wilson administration than FDR. You know who likes this book? Our media like this book. Things aren't as they seem just position them and then they project on top of them. Another book. The image. This gentleman was former director of the Library of Congress. You know what he wrote that the media creates pseudo-events. The President is so right. He calls it fake news. They create fake news, pseudo-events and then they report on them and repeat them. Oh! I've got more. Here's three books. Spirit of Community never heard of it. Public Journalism never heard of it. What Are Journalists For, Jay Rosen. You know what these books are, these books are taught to young journalism students and you know what they teach them, it's not enough to pursue objective truth. Social activism, progressivism, that's how you need to wrap your news. This has been going on for 20, 25 years in your universities, ladies and gentlemen, then I have a special one for the New York Times with its anti- Semitic problem. See this book. It's called Buried by the Times, Buried by the Times. See this book. The Abandonment of the Jews. You see this one, I've read all these books. See this one, Beyond Belief. These are three professors, tremendous scholars. Look at this, you know what they wrote, page and verse that the New York Times during the Third Reich, during the Holocaust did everything it could to censor and cover up the extermination of the Jews in Europe. Now, how are you supposed to believe a business that tried to cover up the Holocaust. Now they have anti-Semitic cartoons. We made a mistake. Now they have an anti-Semitic senior editor over their political coverage. Oh! while the Trump people are attacking him. One final thing, this President has been nice to the media. Hello. Nice to the media. Unlike John Adams and Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson, he didn't shut down any newspapers. He didn't imprison any journalists. Unlike FDR and JFK and LBJ, Trump hasn't unleashed the IRS against a single news publisher. They did. Unlike Barack Obama, the great Barack Obama, Trump hasn't surveilled New York Times columnists or Fox reporters or 20 Associated Press reporters and yet they hate him. Why do they hate him, because he's pro-American and they're anti-American? That's the only explanation. That's it."

There are also several pictures of Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. That's the woman who some say orchestrated the underage sex trafficking ring. The pictures of Maxwell ranged from her lying naked to her and Jeffrey Epstein in what appears to be the White House press briefing room. We don't know if the photos are verified. We do know Epstein had a long relationship with former President Bill Clinton and that Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane dozens of times. Clinton says he knew nothing of Epstein's crimes, but if authorities go after Ghislaine Maxwell for criminal wrongdoing, legal experts say she might save herself by giving up information on powerful people that Epstein surrounded himself with like Prince Andrew, who was seen with Epstein even after he was labeled a sex offender.
