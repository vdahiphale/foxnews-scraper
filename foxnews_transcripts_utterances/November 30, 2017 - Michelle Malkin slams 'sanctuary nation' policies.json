      "sentences": "All right. Thanks, Tucker. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" A huge breaking news tonight. A Fox News alert. Stunning news tonight out of San Francisco. The illegal immigrant accused of killing Kate Steinle found not guilty. We know he had seven prior felony convictions. He was now facing, get this, his sixth deportation. Now believe it or not, his attorney is now blaming Donald Trump. We're going to explain how sanctuary city laws and policies killed Kate Steinle tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, the GOP is now on the verge of keeping one of their big campaign promises, a crucial tax reform vote in the Senate coming as early as tomorrow. This important piece of legislation, well, not perfect, it will bring jobs back jobs, it will slash rates for corporations, for middle class Americans, increase take-home pay for millions of American men and women. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But predictably, the obstructionist leftist is now playing class warfare politics, of course, with your paycheck.

Their star anchor, Matt Lauer fired after disturbing claims of sexual misconduct. Tonight, the question, what did NBC executives know? What did other hosts know and when did they know it? It also appears the chaos over at the peacock network is really getting to liberal Joe Scarborough. He is now lashing out at President Trump like never before. We will show you his complete and total, emotional national meltdown. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, new sexual misconduct allegations against senator grope himself, Al Franken. And there are growing calls for Democratic Congressman John Conyers to resign, including one of the biggest flip-flops in political history from Nancy Pelosi. All of that in tonight's important breaking news opening monologue. Our top story, sad breaking news tonight in the Kate Steinle murder case. The illegal immigrant, Garcia Zarate, who killed Kate Steinle on that pier in San Francisco was acquitted just a short time ago of murder and manslaughter charges before he shot Steinle. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now get this: He was released from a San Francisco jail despite a federal request that he be held for his sixth deportation. He already had seven prior felony convictions. Let me tell you something the mainstream media will never tell you tonight: It was San Francisco, sanctuary city policies that killed Kate Steinle. They did not obey the law. They follow these ridiculous liberal policies and because of their stupidity and their, quote, \"form of justice\" and caring more about the rights of illegal convicted felons, tonight Kate Steinle is dead and her family has received no justice. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's the attorney for the illegal immigrant right after the verdict, taking a shot at the president. Really?",

Now, Kate Steinle, she was arm in arm with her father on that pier. Here you have a guy, homeless at the time, claimed he found the gun with a piece of cloth under his swivel chair at a pier. And then he says he picked it up. He accidentally fired it. It ricocheted and hit Kate Steinle in the back. Well, we know a lot more about Mr. Zarate. And that is in fact because he had little experience with his guns, is what his attorney was saying. But we did find out some other facts tonight. For example, he had been requested by the federal government that in fact he be -- that he be handed over to federal authorities. They didn't do it. The reasonable they didn't do it is because of the sanctuary city laws that are in San Francisco. The same laws now that have been adopted by the governor of California, Jerry Brown, in this particular case. You look at his track record, you look at all of the deportations, you look at all of the felony convictions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tonight, America has to ask a very important question. Tell us, tell us what good comes out of a sanctuary city law? People that never respected our laws and our sovereignty come into this country again and again and again and again. Six times after being deported? After all of those felonies? And an American, young woman is killed with her father walking on a pier in San Francisco? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We're going to have a lot more. Michelle Malkin joins us in a minute. Now, with the tax vote in the Senate looming, many are wondering tonight what tax reform could mean for their bottom-line. Here are the statistics. As of now -- this is important to every forgotten man and woman that voted in this election -- this bill increases the minimum deduction to $12,000 for individuals. Twenty four thousand dollars for joint filers. It ends the individual mandate penalty under ObamaCare -- thank goodness. It removes the alternative minimum tax. Additionally, the top marginal rate will be lowered -- not enough in my mind -- 38.5 percent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Perhaps the most crucial part of this bill could be in the dramatic reduction in the corporate tax rates from one of the highest at 35 percent in the world to just 20 percent. And of course, the 10 percent tax on repatriation for multinational corporations, foreign cash. That means trillions potentially coming into this country and factories and manufacturing centers being built for the forgotten men and women in poverty, out of work. Now the question is, what does this mean for you? Here's some examples the mainstream media will not show you. According to estimates, a middle income family of four at around $70,000 in earnings, they can receive up to an estimate 60 percent tax cut. A single parent with around $40,000 in earnings will likely see at least a 50 percent reduction in their taxes. This is real money in hardworking Americans' pockets. No, the bill is not perfect -- I would have preferred dramatic across the board cuts like in the Reagan era -- but it is an important starting point. Lowering the corporate rate, spurring economic growth, for decades hopefully to come. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Listen to the gloom and doom of Democrats. This bill will destroy the middle class and end America as we know it. Watch the petty display of predictable class warfare from earlier today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Eleven million more Americans on food stamps. Eight million more in poverty. A homeownership rate at its lowest in 51 years. Fifty million Americans in poverty, an increase as I said of eight million. And get this, Obama, the only president in history of this country never to reach three percent GDP growth in the country. Meanwhile, since President Trump was elected, third quarter GDP just yesterday, was revised upward, 3.3 percent. The highest rate in three years. In October, 261,000 jobs were created. Nearly two million now since President Trump was elected. Unemployment, a 17-year low. Consumer confidence, 17-year high.

It is been one day since \"Today\" show host Matt Lauer was abruptly fired. Now multiple women have come forward with shocking allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse against the longtime morning host. Some of these allegations include exposing himself to a staffer, demanding that she perform a sex act. Giving an adult toy as a present along with a note suggesting that it would be used in front of him. And one instance where Lauer summoned a married staffer to his office where he had sex with her until she passes out?

Take a look at this clip from Lauer's former co-host Meredith Vieira where she talks about his in office, bag of sex toys.

Shot and killed by an illegal immigrant, Jose Garcia Zarate. This man had seven prior felony convictions, four involving narcotics. He was facing his six deportation at the time he shot and killed this innocent woman. The illegal immigrants said, he accidentally killed her. He said it was an accident that the bullet ricocheted off the concrete and hit Kate Steinle. His lawyers says he found the gun just moments before he shot her. And it gets worse. He says his client had never fired a gun before and got scared after it went off. What did he do? He threw it off the pier and they found it the next day.

And the fact that the defendant, a 45- year-old, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate was a multiple felon and deportee and who is protected by San Francisco's decision to refuse to comply with immigration officials, none of that was presented as evidence and the jury was not allowed to consider any of that and not to consider any politics as well when they went in to deliberate. And they had deliberated about 30 hours when late this afternoon, we got the word that they had reached a verdict and decided that Kate Steinle's death was in fact a tragic accident. And now we are hearing from Kate Steinle's family. Jim Steinle saying that they are, quote, \"Saddened and shocked.\" Kate's brother Brad saying, quote, \"I'm not surprised.

I should mention that Garcia Zarate was convicted of being a felon in position of a firearm and that conviction does carry a sentence of 16 months, two years or three years.

Jeff Sessions saying in part that cities choosing to put \"criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities put the public safety at risk.\" I can tell you Republicans have spoken, too, on Capitol Hill tonight and saying this verdict could give the President new impetus to push his get tough policies on illegal immigration, a key part of his agenda. Another key part of his agenda of course tax cuts. The president got good news today when John McCain said he will support them. Remember McCain sunk the president's push to repeal and replace Obamacare. His support on taxes makes it very likely the President will get a victory on that as early as tomorrow. The President has already been touting a stock market that has been on fire lately. The Dow today seeing its 63rd record close of the year and could be going even higher and when see the details on this bill, for example the corporate tax rate will be dropping from 35 percent to roughly 20 percent. The personal side, there's been claims that this helps very few people. The joint committee on taxation just put out a new report saying 60 percent of U.S. households will get a tax cut. 8 percent approximately will pay more. Democrats jumped on that same study. That committee saying that the economic impact will not be very strong and that this will strongly increase the deficit. Republicans pushing back on that today saying that they're undercounting the impact on the economy. That will be hashed out tomorrow with a likely final vote on the senate on Friday. The bottom line, the other big story tonight, reports out of North Korea that the North Koreans may be willing to negotiate about its nuclear weapons program. That is a bit of a surprise. Remember earlier this week that missile launch suggesting that North Korea could reach various U.S. cities. There's nuclear experts saying this could be a sign that Kim Jong- un just wants to show that he has a deterrent, but doesn't want to actually use the missiles and weapons as an offensive weapon against the U.S. and others. Remember President Trump said he doesn't want to negotiate with Kim Jong-un. But this sign tonight that maybe the President tough rhetoric has been working with North Korea might lead them to the table, Sean.",

Starting to see communities that will be revitalized, because when you have more of these investments, more corporations coming back to the United States, not planting themselves out in other countries, but really coming back to what we call the American model, it's a huge benefit for these communities that have really been strangled under what we would call so much regulation under the Obama years.

      "utterance": "All right. Thanks, Tucker. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" A huge breaking news tonight. A Fox News alert. Stunning news tonight out of San Francisco. The illegal immigrant accused of killing Kate Steinle found not guilty. We know he had seven prior felony convictions. He was now facing, get this, his sixth deportation. Now believe it or not, his attorney is now blaming Donald Trump. We're going to explain how sanctuary city laws and policies killed Kate Steinle tonight. But first, the GOP is now on the verge of keeping one of their big campaign promises, a crucial tax reform vote in the Senate coming as early as tomorrow. This important piece of legislation, well, not perfect, it will bring jobs back jobs, it will slash rates for corporations, for middle class Americans, increase take-home pay for millions of American men and women. But predictably, the obstructionist leftist is now playing class warfare politics, of course, with your paycheck. We'll explain in detail. Also breaking tonight, it is a nightmare over at NBC News. Their star anchor, Matt Lauer fired after disturbing claims of sexual misconduct. Tonight, the question, what did NBC executives know? What did other hosts know and when did they know it? It also appears the chaos over at the peacock network is really getting to liberal Joe Scarborough. He is now lashing out at President Trump like never before. We will show you his complete and total, emotional national meltdown. Plus, new sexual misconduct allegations against senator grope himself, Al Franken. And there are growing calls for Democratic Congressman John Conyers to resign, including one of the biggest flip-flops in political history from Nancy Pelosi. All of that in tonight's important breaking news opening monologue. Our top story, sad breaking news tonight in the Kate Steinle murder case. The illegal immigrant, Garcia Zarate, who killed Kate Steinle on that pier in San Francisco was acquitted just a short time ago of murder and manslaughter charges before he shot Steinle."

      "speaker": "Now get this",
      "utterance": "He was released from a San Francisco jail despite a federal request that he be held for his sixth deportation. He already had seven prior felony convictions. Let me tell you something the mainstream media will never tell you tonight: It was San Francisco, sanctuary city policies that killed Kate Steinle. They did not obey the law. They follow these ridiculous liberal policies and because of their stupidity and their, quote, \"form of justice\" and caring more about the rights of illegal convicted felons, tonight Kate Steinle is dead and her family has received no justice. Here's the attorney for the illegal immigrant right after the verdict, taking a shot at the president. Really?"

      "utterance": "For those who might criticize this verdict, there are a number of people that have commented on this case in the last couple of years. The attorney general of the United States, the president, and vice president of the United States. Let me just remind them that they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C., and they may themselves soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence and beyond a reasonable doubt standard. And so I would ask them to reflect on that before they comment or disparage the result in this case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I want to go through some of the details tonight, pay very close attention here. Now, this family of -- the Steinle family have been waiting more than two years for this justice. Now, Kate Steinle, she was arm in arm with her father on that pier. Here you have a guy, homeless at the time, claimed he found the gun with a piece of cloth under his swivel chair at a pier. And then he says he picked it up. He accidentally fired it. It ricocheted and hit Kate Steinle in the back. Well, we know a lot more about Mr. Zarate. And that is in fact because he had little experience with his guns, is what his attorney was saying. But we did find out some other facts tonight. For example, he had been requested by the federal government that in fact he be -- that he be handed over to federal authorities. They didn't do it. The reasonable they didn't do it is because of the sanctuary city laws that are in San Francisco. The same laws now that have been adopted by the governor of California, Jerry Brown, in this particular case. You look at his track record, you look at all of the deportations, you look at all of the felony convictions. Tonight, America has to ask a very important question. Tell us, tell us what good comes out of a sanctuary city law? People that never respected our laws and our sovereignty come into this country again and again and again and again. Six times after being deported? After all of those felonies? And an American, young woman is killed with her father walking on a pier in San Francisco? We're going to have a lot more. Michelle Malkin joins us in a minute. Now, with the tax vote in the Senate looming, many are wondering tonight what tax reform could mean for their bottom-line. Here are the statistics. As of now -- this is important to every forgotten man and woman that voted in this election -- this bill increases the minimum deduction to $12,000 for individuals. Twenty four thousand dollars for joint filers. It ends the individual mandate penalty under ObamaCare -- thank goodness. It removes the alternative minimum tax. Additionally, the top marginal rate will be lowered -- not enough in my mind -- 38.5 percent. Perhaps the most crucial part of this bill could be in the dramatic reduction in the corporate tax rates from one of the highest at 35 percent in the world to just 20 percent. And of course, the 10 percent tax on repatriation for multinational corporations, foreign cash. That means trillions potentially coming into this country and factories and manufacturing centers being built for the forgotten men and women in poverty, out of work. Now the question is, what does this mean for you? Here's some examples the mainstream media will not show you. According to estimates, a middle income family of four at around $70,000 in earnings, they can receive up to an estimate 60 percent tax cut. A single parent with around $40,000 in earnings will likely see at least a 50 percent reduction in their taxes. This is real money in hardworking Americans' pockets. No, the bill is not perfect -- I would have preferred dramatic across the board cuts like in the Reagan era -- but it is an important starting point. Lowering the corporate rate, spurring economic growth, for decades hopefully to come. Listen to the gloom and doom of Democrats. This bill will destroy the middle class and end America as we know it. Watch the petty display of predictable class warfare from earlier today."

      "utterance": "You have to remember, for almost a decade those same people you see bashing this tax reduction, this tax reform, are the same politicians that gave us the, quote, \"economic wisdom\" of Barack Obama. But you know, what about these Democrats? What they're not going to tell you is this. What happened under the Obama economy? They'll never tell you how bad it is. We told you during the last election, under Obama, the slowest economic recovery from a recession since the 40s. Eleven million more Americans on food stamps. Eight million more in poverty. A homeownership rate at its lowest in 51 years. Fifty million Americans in poverty, an increase as I said of eight million. And get this, Obama, the only president in history of this country never to reach three percent GDP growth in the country. Meanwhile, since President Trump was elected, third quarter GDP just yesterday, was revised upward, 3.3 percent. The highest rate in three years. In October, 261,000 jobs were created. Nearly two million now since President Trump was elected. Unemployment, a 17-year low. Consumer confidence, 17-year high. Median existing home prices for all housing types in October, 2017, up 8.7 percent since January. The stock market today another record, all-time record. Based on that alone, who do you trust? The Obama sycophants that gave us this failed policies? Their cohorts in the liberal media? Their friends on the left side of the aisle? They want this bill to fail when they failed all of us for eight years? Or what about this president that has literally put confidence in the heart of American corporations by getting rid of Obama regulations and red tape. We now have seen what economic growth could mean and what an economic turnaround could be. This bill must pass. Our economic future depends on it. We're going to discuss the tax bill also later on in the show. And also bring you a vote. In fact, we'll update you any votes that happened in the Senate throughout the night. Now, we turn our attention also to the ongoing nightmare that is NBC News today. It is been one day since \"Today\" show host Matt Lauer was abruptly fired. Now multiple women have come forward with shocking allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse against the longtime morning host. Some of these allegations include exposing himself to a staffer, demanding that she perform a sex act. Giving an adult toy as a present along with a note suggesting that it would be used in front of him. And one instance where Lauer summoned a married staffer to his office where he had sex with her until she passes out? And then Lauer reportedly took the woman to see a nurse? Earlier today, Matt Lauer has issued an apology with a caveat stating that some of the allegations are, quote, \"untrue or mischaracterized.\" Now, more damning tapes also surfaced indicating that Lauer's misconduct was going on for a long while and may have been an open secret at the Peacock Network. Take a look at this clip from Lauer's former co-host Meredith Vieira where she talks about his in office, bag of sex toys. Watch this. MEREDITH VIEIRA, FORMER \"TODAY\" CO-HOST: I have to say, I went into your office once. Do you remember this? MATT LAUER, THEN-\"TODAY\" CO-HOST: Yes."

And then there is the current fake news CNN chief Jeff Zucker, he served as the head of NBC News during many of Lauer's allegations of misconduct. Zucker is now saying that, quote, \"I didn't know this Matt.\" So was Zucker in the dark or did he turn a blind eye? These allegations against Matt Lauer, they needed to be investigated fully, but if true, those who knew about this and possibly enabled this behavior should be called out. Now, with allegations abounding, well, all of the stress at NBC News seems to be getting to crazy liberal Joe Scarborough, especially after Trump made this accusation in a tweet. \"So now that Matt Lauer is gone, when will the fake news practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin,\" he runs MSNBC, the conspiracy network, \"and will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the 'unsolved mystery' that took place in Florida years ago.

      "utterance": "We'll have more on these Democratic scandals that are plaguing them later tonight in the show. But first, we have a lot more in our top story. Kate Steinle's killer found not guilty. Now walking free. Kate Steinle killed back in July of 2015, walking arm and arm with her father on a pier in San Francisco. Shot and killed by an illegal immigrant, Jose Garcia Zarate. This man had seven prior felony convictions, four involving narcotics. He was facing his six deportation at the time he shot and killed this innocent woman. The illegal immigrants said, he accidentally killed her. He said it was an accident that the bullet ricocheted off the concrete and hit Kate Steinle. His lawyers says he found the gun just moments before he shot her. And it gets worse. He says his client had never fired a gun before and got scared after it went off. What did he do? He threw it off the pier and they found it the next day. And as I said at the top of the show, sanctuary cities tonight, those that support them, they are to blame for the death of Kate Steinle. With reaction now, host of \"Michelle Malkin Investigates\" Michelle Malkin. You look at all of this in detail. All of this years. This guy, six deportations he was facing. The federal government said to San Francisco turn this guy over. And they refused to obey the law. MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\": Sean, my outrage is laden with melancholy. Because I have reported and investigated on so many of these cases over the last 25 years and there has been so little, if any, accountability for people in the federal, state and local government who have blood on their hands. Kate Steinle and her family never wanted or wished for the publicity that they have gotten, the pain that they have suffered and the fact that they have no choice but to be front and center in the headlines as they suffer as a result of this verdict. This really is, I think, a damning indictment of so-called San Francisco values. Where is Nancy Pelosi tonight? Where has she been the last 25 years? This is her city. And it is her open borders policies that have haunted so many innocent people and innocent lives in San Francisco. And it is the conversion of America into a sanctuary nation instead of a sovereign nation that has endangered us and one of the primary reasons that President Trump was elected in the first place. Because people made a choice after seeing this fork in the road, after seeing both political parties, Sean, both Republicans and their big business donors and Democrats and their identity politics, grievance mongers who don't care about the rule of law in this country. And the collusion between those two things that have created sanctuary policies and a sanctuary nation that still exists to this day. When will this city and county sheriff in San Francisco and that mayor and the governor ever be held accountable for the deaths as a result of bloody open borders?"

But the idea that he simply happened upon this weapon. And it was oopsy an accident when there were witnesses that testified at the trial that they saw him twirling the gun around recklessly beforehand and then scurrying away when the police were looking for who it was that caused Kate Steinle to fall to the ground and be shot in the back when she was as you said walking arm and arm with her father on a happy day. The idea that this defense attorney now is politicizing this verdict and rubbing salt into the wounds of Kate Steinle's family is disgusting. And it shows you the mentality I think, that probably infected much of the jury. Did you know, Sean, that any discussion of immigration policy and Jose Zarate's five prior deportations, the detainer that was ignored by city and county officials, the pending six deportations, the seven felony convictions including four narcotics convictions, none of that was allowed to be presented to the jury.

And they took issue with some of the police translations as well. So the defense did a great job, Sean, picking apart this sort of muddled confession and statement about shooting at sea lions and stepping on guns and so forth. But what a stunning end to this case that many had considered a referendum on illegal immigration and sanctuary city policies. But at the end of the day here in San Francisco, remember, this was a local murder case with mostly circumstantial evidence. And the fact that the defendant, a 45- year-old, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate was a multiple felon and deportee and who is protected by San Francisco's decision to refuse to comply with immigration officials, none of that was presented as evidence and the jury was not allowed to consider any of that and not to consider any politics as well when they went in to deliberate. And they had deliberated about 30 hours when late this afternoon, we got the word that they had reached a verdict and decided that Kate Steinle's death was in fact a tragic accident. And now we are hearing from Kate Steinle's family. Jim Steinle saying that they are, quote, \"Saddened and shocked.\" Kate's brother Brad saying, quote, \"I'm not surprised. The system failed Kate from the start of the chain of events. Why would the verdict in this case be any different?\" But again, outside court, the defense team said, given the physical and the circumstantial evidence here, the jury made the right decision. By the way, Sean, the jurors quickly left after the verdict was read. They had nothing to say to reporters. I should mention that Garcia Zarate was convicted of being a felon in position of a firearm and that conviction does carry a sentence of 16 months, two years or three years. The judge will make that determination at a hearing probably next month. But again, what a stunning end to this case and a big victory for the San Francisco public defender's office."

The point is he shouldn't have been here in the first place. He should have been deported. By the way, California -- the bay area has since changed sanctuary City law. If you were to apply that change to the same set of facts, he still would had been released and not have been deported. So California is a sanctuary state.

Of involuntary manslaughter. I mean, how do you look the American people in the eye? I'm serious. If you're in that jury and say justice was done tonight to this woman who by the way, Sean, her aorta was suffered as a 40 caliber round went through her back and pierced her aorta.

Simpson butchered two people and got away with it. Robert Shaw, same thing and got away with it. You never know what will happen before a jury. After the O.J.

DANA LOESCH, THE BLAZE ON TV AND AUTHOR OF \"HANDS OFF MY GUN\": I have. I thought what Dan Bongino said earlier was pretty spot on. I thought that the defense was moronic on this. There's things the jury saw that we the people didn't see. But I do find it interesting that the same people that want to look at forensic reports as concerns ballistics, they ignored that in the Mike Brown case. For the lawyer to also invoke Donald Trump and falsely also say that there's an investigation based on criminal propaganda which substantiated a FISA warrant, I thought was bizarre. This is moronic. People in California are not protected. The courts have said there's no justice, no peace for the law abiding. Those that break the law and enter illegally are given preference over law abiding Americans and California has now declared itself to be a dangerous state. California have decided they want to make it virtually impossible for law-abiding Americans to be able to choose their pro-choice right of self-defense. But if you're an illegal alien and you're in that state be protected as a sanctuary state, you're afforded all of the luxuries of American citizens including rights that we have sacrificed for, due process. You're given a slap on the wrist. This wasn't even involuntary manslaughter isn't a front to due process and all the law abiding systems in California. This is shameful."

      "utterance": "A tough statement just in from the Attorney General on the Kate Steinle verdict. Jeff Sessions saying in part that cities choosing to put \"criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities put the public safety at risk.\" I can tell you Republicans have spoken, too, on Capitol Hill tonight and saying this verdict could give the President new impetus to push his get tough policies on illegal immigration, a key part of his agenda. Another key part of his agenda of course tax cuts. The president got good news today when John McCain said he will support them. Remember McCain sunk the president's push to repeal and replace Obamacare. His support on taxes makes it very likely the President will get a victory on that as early as tomorrow. The President has already been touting a stock market that has been on fire lately. The Dow today seeing its 63rd record close of the year and could be going even higher and when see the details on this bill, for example the corporate tax rate will be dropping from 35 percent to roughly 20 percent. The personal side, there's been claims that this helps very few people. The joint committee on taxation just put out a new report saying 60 percent of U.S. households will get a tax cut. 8 percent approximately will pay more. Democrats jumped on that same study. That committee saying that the economic impact will not be very strong and that this will strongly increase the deficit. Republicans pushing back on that today saying that they're undercounting the impact on the economy. That will be hashed out tomorrow with a likely final vote on the senate on Friday. The bottom line, the other big story tonight, reports out of North Korea that the North Koreans may be willing to negotiate about its nuclear weapons program. That is a bit of a surprise. Remember earlier this week that missile launch suggesting that North Korea could reach various U.S. cities. There's nuclear experts saying this could be a sign that Kim Jong- un just wants to show that he has a deterrent, but doesn't want to actually use the missiles and weapons as an offensive weapon against the U.S. and others. Remember President Trump said he doesn't want to negotiate with Kim Jong-un. But this sign tonight that maybe the President tough rhetoric has been working with North Korea might lead them to the table, Sean."

But state local taxes no longer deductible but really all this years, states like Florida, Texas, and no state income tax have been subsidizing these big spending, big taxing liberal states like California and New York, right?"

That was a primary focus in addition to making sure that they simplify the tax code and also to ensure that they reduce the corporate taxes. When you lower the corporate taxes, Sean, the benefits many of them go to the American worker. You're starting to see actually investments, building in factories. Starting to see communities that will be revitalized, because when you have more of these investments, more corporations coming back to the United States, not planting themselves out in other countries, but really coming back to what we call the American model, it's a huge benefit for these communities that have really been strangled under what we would call so much regulation under the Obama years. Not enough economic growth. What are we seeing? We're seeing consumer confidence up. Business is optimistic. So there's really this sense of President Trump has said, the rocket fuel economy where you're going to see by year ten, the GDP between 3 to 5 percent growth that is real economic growth and real results."

This is something that the President has pushed through on his principles of immigration and something that he focused on as well as closing the loop holes and ensuring that we're going to enforce the immigration laws. This is incredibly important in addition to border security. Why, because when you look at the jurisdictions that refuse to hand this criminal alien over to the federal authorities.
