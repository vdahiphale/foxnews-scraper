Yes, that required a vote, but that was going to happen anyways. To Chris' point, there was a lot of infighting, too. So as a Democrat, you're actually grateful nothing is getting done right now because you're afraid of the things that if Trump's agenda went through, that's exactly what you don't want.

U.S. Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, is leading Kim Jong-un some wiggle room, telling Kim the younger he needs to halt all missile test so U.S. and North Korea can start negotiations.

That's the first time these types of missiles have been deployed on this type of platform since 2014. Remember, experts at the Pentagon say they believe North Korea now has an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile that can reach the shores of Alaska, and could soon have the capability to hit Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. It's unclear if those missiles can carry a nuclear war head, but it's only a matter of time.

But what was more important was China stepped up and said, we will follow through on these sanctions. We will make sure that we follow. And they encouraged the international community to follow it.

We're going to continue to do what we have to do. I think Russia's trying to figure out how to deal with us. And I think they're trying to decide when can we be with the United States and when can we not? The resolution was certainly an opportunity for them to be with us, and they stepped up and they did it. They didn't do it willingly. I think they wanted to drag it out a bit.

The Security Council's response was this should go the Human Rights Council. The reason it hasn't gone to the Human Rights Council because Venezuela sits on the Human Rights Council. So, yes, I do think it's getting to the point where we're going to have to bring this back to the Security Council. But at this point, we're going to continue sanctions at least from the U.S. side, but we have to be loud about this. What's happening in Venezuela, and what's happening to the people there is just awful.

And all of the Security Council and the international community said that's enough, you've got to stop it. It's reckless. It's irresponsible. And the international community really laid down the groundwork of saying we're not going to watch you do this anymore. Now, North Korea has to respond."

Ambassador, Nikki Haley, just moments ago stating, in no uncertain terms that the ball is now in North Korea's court after the latest round of sanctions with fresh provocation from the rogue nation just today. Will the U.S. and our allies be able to stop short of military action and the effort to deter North Korea's nuclear ambition? So, to answer that question let's turn to no one else but the best: General Jack Keane, Fox News Military Analyst and Chairman of the Institute for the Study of War. Sir, earlier today, we found out that North Korea apparently, according to our sources, has moved anti-ship cruise missiles to the eastern part of the country. Apparently, they've not done that since 2014. Is this to be expected since North Korea said that they were going to punch back against the U.S. after the vote on Saturday?"

      "speaker": "GEN. JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST AND CHAIRMAN OF THE INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is. I mean, certainly, the bell across rhetoric is part of that pattern. They may be moving this military capability, but they're not going to take military action against our allies or against the United States to be sure because that would clearly provoke a response that they would not be able to handle from the United States. And let me just say listening to Ambassador Haley there, you know, the Trump team's got an absolute first rate national security team that they have brought together. And this is one of the stars of it. I mean, she is such a strong and articulate voice, and she pulls no punches whatsoever, no matter what the issue is that she's dealing with. And I think, you know, her skill as a successful Governor in South Carolina serves her well as a diplomat here in New York."

Well, I guess, we have to leave it to our imagination as to what when we meant by that. One thing I didn't get to ask her, and I wish I had, and I wonder if you could comment on this because as you know the effort that diplomacy is trying to save off military action. Last week, President Trump put off a speech he was going to be giving about China. And there were some trade sanctions, some trade actions that they're going to take against China, but they pulled that back with no real explanation. And I wonder if, in talking with China, that one of the negotiating tactics with them was to say we will not do that in order to help you get us on the same page when it comes to this North Korea situation and the vote on Saturday. Do you think that's plausible?"

      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Oh, yes. That's definitely plausible. And also, China's very good at working with us -- sometimes I use the word gaming us to accomplish their national interests. But I think that this vote is a testimony to the fact that the international community to include China and Russia know two things here. One is that this is a rapidly dangerous situation that's being created by the North Koreans and nuclearized ICBMs. And the second thing and this is critical because this is what enhanced Ambassador Haley's hand when she played it. This is no longer the Obama administration of appeasement, of a combination of the North Koreans. They know full-well that this administration will not stand for a nuclearized ICBM pointing at the United States with the capability to hit it."

What is the best way for us to slow them down or to prevent them from using it?"
    },

I mean, in the past, there are seven other times we sanctioned; never been successful. And the players, never truly vigorously executed to the fullest. This team, the Trump team, and Ambassador Haley will stay on top of it -- I'm sure, as will Secretary Tillerson. They have got to ensure that these people are executed rapidly and vigorously because the time clock is a factor here. And that's the reality of what we're dealing with."

There are other so-called sanctuary cities, but Mayor Emanuel and Chicago are the first to file a lawsuit against the policy of Donald Trump's Department of Justice. The suit is related to the Edward Byrne memorial justice assistance grant. Chicago would only get $3.2 million. But in order to get the money, city police would be required to share information with federal agents about illegals and give Homeland Security a 48-hour heads up if they're going to release an illegal.

So, Chicago is not harmed. So, there isn't any case for the court to resolve until the money is actually held back. If Donald Trump had been president a year ago, and if the cash that's flowing to Chicago had been subject to the agreement, you take this cash, you agree to help the feds and for enforce immigration policy. Then, Rahm Emanuel has a very thin ice to stand on. But since the money that is flowing to Chicago is coming from the last year of the Obama administration budget, which did not include the condition you will help immigration enforcement, he has very strong ground to stand on. So, once the case is litigated, I think he wins and the Trump administration loses. But, until the Trump administration actually stops sending the money, there's no basis for a lawsuit."

The city of Chicago has the right to spend its money and direct its police however it wants, and they're not required to help the Feds. Can the federal government enforce all federal laws on their own without local assistance? No. As big and powerful and rich as the federal government is, it requires some cooperation.

That's why I use the word fist because apparently the New York Times was completely unaware of. But a free people have the right to fact check the press, particularly, when this is the press that has falsely maligned so many people for so long. I mean, think of this, Jim Rutenberg, just last year in a column had written that the New York Times doesn't have to objectively cover the president because they don't like the way that he talks. And Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who is the publisher of the New York Times, actually came out and said, and I quote him, that they're going to rededicate themselves to balanced journalism. If you're practicing balanced journalism you don't need to rededicate yourself to balanced journalism. So they've kind of already admitted that they have been misleading and that they have been practicing bias. And that's what people are tired of.

But it was just last month that you had an op-ed that you put out, it was July 6th. In fact, I had you on air that night because I had a chance to fill in for Martha. And you took a lot of heat from the left, because it seems that the Democrats are thinking that they really need to be more pure and to the left, and what you're saying to them is don't do that, there's danger ahead of you."

It got us to successful midterms. The same thing really has to happen. The issues are different. We have to be modernized for really what's going on in America today. But the working class vote is not an ultra-liberal vote. They're not going to be attracted by moving to the left or the right."

It seemed to me that that sounded a lot like what President Trump ran on for a successful presidential campaign. Did you see that, too?"

I think we've got a long way to go in defining that as a real issue, because, right now, the economy issue is being won by Trump, believe it or not, and Democrats and Republicans are losing it aside from him."

So, 200 days ago the Trump administration began with much fanfare and questions about how the real estate mogul turned reality TV star would be as president.

The president is currently on a working vacation in New Jersey, as renovations are made to the White House. Well today, marks his 200th day in office. So what are we to make of his time in office to date and his promises to the nation? Joining us now is former house oversight committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, we're glad to have him, Chris Stirewalt, Fox News politics editor, and Mary Anne Marsh who served as a senior advisor to secretary of state John Kerry. Since you're here with me, you get to go first, congressman. I'm still going to have to call you congressman."

They have had some hiccups, you know, out of the administer of the White House, but I think that's been resolved. I think the real heat, the real criticism are on the house and the senate. I mean, the senate, they actually said we're going to extend into mid-August because we have so much on our agenda. And what did Mitch McConnell do? They excused them early. They're not in even in session this week."

We've just had a change -- a lot of change, actually, in senior staff positions. And then you saw over the weekend, that big story in the New York Times about Vice President Pence and looking ahead to 2020, which the vice president's office vigorously denied. But already you have political intrigue 200 days in. What do you make of that?"

      "utterance": "Well, also like shooting fish in a barrel has been throughout these 200 days, reporters finding eager leakers inside the White House, and people eager to run down and trash other people. You really have basically three factions inside this administration. You have traditional conservative Republicans, ala-Mike Pence, people of this mold. Then have you the Steve Bannon set. You have these -- whether you think of them as alt right or that they're populist nationalists, or whatever they are, but this is a different way to look at the Republican Party. And then have you these other people who aren't Republicans at all. This is like the president's daughter and son-in-law, this is like top economic advisor Gary Cohn, and now we have sort of a nonpartisan as White House chief of staff. So these groups, whatever they can do in the body of the chief of staff to clean things up, get it tightened down, make it run better, you still have these three factions who are still leaking on each other and are still trying to run each other down in the press and that's not helpful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Mary Anne, you really can look at this through both perspectives, right? The Republicans have pretty much stayed with the president. They can list off all sorts of things, not just Gorsuch but regulations, they can look at the stock market. They can list all of these things. And, yet, the Democrats can look at these first 200 days and say this is a disaster. What do you think? I'm assuming you're in the latter camp, but give me a broader perspective from the Democrats. Are they worried about those midterms as Mark Penn was just saying? It doesn't look like it's going to be easy for them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARY ANNE MARSH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think a couple things. I mean, Congressman Chaffetz makes a great point. The reality here is anything that requires a vote hasn't gotten done. So any accomplishment and quotes that Trump talks about has not gone through congress. It's been either, an executive order, regulation changes, or the appointment of a Supreme Court justice. Yes, that required a vote, but that was going to happen anyways. To Chris' point, there was a lot of infighting, too. So as a Democrat, you're actually grateful nothing is getting done right now because you're afraid of the things that if Trump's agenda went through, that's exactly what you don't want. What you do want is what you're starting to see, which are effort to work together to get some things done. Repair the healthcare bill, don't repeal and replace it, things like that. That's what you're looking at. In terms of 2018, I have a more bullish viewpoint than Mark Penn does."

How difficult is it for the hill to come together to try to get these major things, and they're some must-pass thing, the debt ceiling is not that sexy of topic, you know, and then you've got the budget, what do you think they can really get done? And I think everyone points at tax reform. Is it possible? Can they do it before the end of the year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I hope so. But the easier stuff was first. I mean, healthcare is difficult but it was doable. Everybody campaigned on it. Everybody said it in every ad and every promise that they made and, yet, they didn't get there. The gauntlet, the hardest part is actually September, because there is not a Republican out there that wants to vote for a debt ceiling increase. They got to do a budget. They have to fund the border wall. They have to do all of these things, and yet to go on recess. So they're not exactly coming together. We only have 12 days on the calendar in September. You've got to do all of that. And Republicans are more concerned, there's too many people that are more concerned about a primary than they are about their general election. So they do not want to go back saying we didn't get anything done and we didn't -- and we voted for a debt ceiling increase."

We started the show with an exclusive interview with Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is confronting the North Korea crisis, working with the national security team. And yet, you still have continuing from last week this fight, apparently between -- maybe it's a proxy fight between H.R. McMaster, the national security advisor, and Breitbart, I guess? I mean, how does General John Kelly help solve this situation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Well, look, he can't solve it. The president has to solve it. Now, Kelly can be a cop on the beat, right? He can say, no, you can't leak that. No, you can't say that. No, you're fired. No, you're in. You're out. But what he cannot do is tell the president what he believes about foreign policy. One of the challenges that this administration has had about foreign policy is speaking with many voices. And you heard -- Nikki Haley tonight, that was -- those were sentiments that came right out of the core heart of conservative Republican foreign policy, but not everybody in the administration."
