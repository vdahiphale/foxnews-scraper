So Republicans are going to keep their promises to you. Plus, explosive new reports from John Solomon, Sara Carter.

So look, Scaramucci got high marks in the early hours, first few days. Let's remember it's only been barely a week since he was announced, Sean. So much has happened. But he got high marks for being a street fighter, somebody who understands the president and is going to be more forceful and aggressive in getting his message out. The challenge tonight is when you have this kind of colorful language, that might attract not just media interest but some people like Newt Gingrich, other conservatives tonight saying that they think this is all a distraction.

GOP lawmakers -- they only have themselves to blame they're in this situation. That is tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" You know, when we started the program tonight, I got to tell you it's really a shame that we are at this point with Senate Republicans having to pull an all-nighter. It's sort of taking toilet paper, they're wetting it down, they're throwing it up against the wall. That's their strategy, see what sticks strategy -- an attempt to try and pass some kind of health care bill so that they can then go to conference with House Republicans and eventually come up with a plan to do what they promised to do, that's repeal and replace ObamaCare. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Senator McConnell just posted details of the, quote, \"skinny\" ObamaCare repeal. Republicans, they begged you, the American people, for this opportunity for seven long years. And they are now doing their best to squander it. There's no other way to spin this. Now, yesterday, seven GOP senators -- they voted against the clean repeal of ObamaCare. Some of them voted for that very bill in 2015. It makes you wonder if everything you've been told for years was just all talk. Now, it sure certainly seems that way. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as I said last night, these senators have put Republican advantages in Congress now in jeopardy for 2018 because we don't know how the vote on the \"skinny\" repeal is ever going to turn out, and we'll be following it all night tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, Republicans -- they had seven years, seven years to come up with a plan, seven years to find consensus and agreement, and that didn't happen. It's been one misstep after another. They literally let this all play out in public on TV and radio and in the papers instead of everybody getting in a room, as I suggested, locking the door, taking their phones, ordering pizza, having beer and Coke and Seven Up and water so that they could have the plan that works for the American people. Aren't the Republicans -- and I'm a registered conservative. Aren't they supposed to be the party of big and bold ideas? Well, they're now today the party I say of zero identity. They seem too afraid, too timid, too spineless to go beyond the status quo. They played this way during the Obama years. The GOP is supposed to be the party of repeal, replace. They're supposed to be the party of freedom and liberty and capitalism and less regulation and government interference in our lives and free market solutions. Right now, they have no vision, they have no identity, and there's no unity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And they didn't even try to offer up big, out-of-the-box ideas.

I've been interviewing him since 2012, Dr. Josh Umbehr, Atlas MD. I've interviewed him all these times. He runs a health care cooperative. It's $50 a month for adults, $10 a month for children. They have no co-pays, unlimited office visits, 24-hour doctor service available for you, free procedures, 95 percent reductions because they negotiate directly with the pharmaceutical companies, and you leave with your medicine as soon as you leave the doctor's office. And the same with lab tests. Why not let other doctors -- and by the way, some 400 already are doing similar things. They didn't even bring these ideas up, just like health savings accounts. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, there's some good news today. The House did vote to fund the -- some of the president's border wall, but that still has to get through the Senate. And finally, Republican lawmakers, their inability to get things done -- here's the truth. It's harming you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And at this point, it seems like the only person in the Republican Party who has a vision, is articulating that vision, is the president himself. And you see the reaction that he gets and the crowds that show up when he speaks. And earlier this week on the Senate floor, after returning to Washington from his brain cancer diagnosis, Senator John McCain made these comments. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

If the goal of the deep state is the same, well, excuse me, they're trying to get the president to never enact his agenda. And you know, that's what the bottom line is here. They want to delegitimize the president. They don't want what you voted for to become the law of this land. And the president, Anthony Scaramucci, Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon -- you know what? The one thing they all have in common, in spite of maybe disagreeing here and maybe some infighting -- they're all tired of the deep state leaks. Anthony Scaramucci rightly is trying to put an end to it. I don't know who's leaking in the White House. I have no idea, but I hope it ends. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And it's important they figure out where these leaks are coming from to the press, the press that wants to destroy the president, as well. And then look at the deep state. They have one singular focus. They are determined to damage the president with selective leaking day in and day out and stop his agenda, which, at the end of the day, that hurts you, the American people.

Sean, if I showed you all those senators, all those members of Congress who ran successfully on repealing and replacing \"Obama care\" -- there were no asterisks, no footnotes, no bibliographies, no maybe, shoulda-coulda-woulda. It was very straightforward. I can show you their paid advertisements. I can show you them in 16 different shots at podiums in (ph) with the crowd, pledging to repeal and replace ObamaCare straight up. Now, the one person who's keeping that promise is Donald Trump. He's been here for six short months, got pen in hand. They've been talking about this for seven years, four consecutive election cycles.

This is not A-OK, this is zero. And four or so -- four or five Democrats voted against it, and then the rest of the Democrats voted present. They might as well have been out to dinner because they're certainly out to lunch. They're not lifting a finger to help the 6.5 million Americans who forked over $3 billion to the IRS, rather than get basic \"Obama care\" coverage. They're not helping those who have suffered because 83 insurers have fled the market with dozens more promising to do so. They're not helping people to meet the cost of these premiums, the people who have the worst possible outcome, ridiculous, quote, \"insurance cards\" that they can't use because the premiums are too high.

What John was reporting is that Obama aides, Obama aides in the White House were unmasking, the majority of which they believed were all people associated with President Trump or related to President Trump or connected to the President Trump in unmasking these foreign intercepts.

If we think that's OK, then we've lost the constitutional republic that our forefathers fought for.",

I submit to you that the establishment that you're talking about, the so-called deep state exists on both sides, the left and the right, and President Trump is up against both of them.

      "utterance": "Yes, the over of The New York Post suggesting it's like \"Survivor\" around here, Sean, from Reince Priebus to Steve Bannon to now Anthony Scaramucci, as well, all these advisers around the president seemingly battling it out not just in private but now spilling out into the public, starting last night when Scaramucci essentially accused Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, of leaking out sensitive financial information from Scaramucci's disclosure reports. That was really information that was available to the public, so he sort of pulled that back, but then spoke to a reporter from The New Yorker, and Scaramucci really let loose on several people here at the White House, saying about Priebus, quote, \"They'll all be fired by me I fired one guy the other day. I have thee to four people I'll fire tomorrow. Reince Priebus -- if you want to leak something, he'll be asked to resign very shortly. Reince is a bleeping paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.\" Then Scaramucci goes on to say about Bannon, quote, \"I'm not Steve Bannon. I'm not trying to build my own brand off the bleeping strength of the president. I'm here to serve the country,\" that about the president's chief strategist. Scaramucci, in his defense tonight, has gone onto Twitter to say he regrets the colorful language. He's going to be more careful. And he adds, quote, \"I has made a mistake in trusting in a reporter. It won't happen again,\" Sean."

      "utterance": "Yes. And look, The New Yorker has not been friendly to this president. That's an open secret. And so whether the ground rules were worked out or not, and as you say, there were only two people in that phone call or that conversation, so we don't know for sure -- obviously, if you're the incoming White House communications director, you're going to have to be careful about communications, particularly with a reporter from an organization that has, frankly, been hammering the president every which way. So look, Scaramucci got high marks in the early hours, first few days. Let's remember it's only been barely a week since he was announced, Sean. So much has happened. But he got high marks for being a street fighter, somebody who understands the president and is going to be more forceful and aggressive in getting his message out. The challenge tonight is when you have this kind of colorful language, that might attract not just media interest but some people like Newt Gingrich, other conservatives tonight saying that they think this is all a distraction. Get it back on jobs and health care, the other parts of the agenda that, as Mike Emanuel said, are being fought out tonight, Sean."

      "utterance": "All right, I'll have more in just a moment, my commentary on this. All right, but it is make or break night tonight live here for the Republican Party and ObamaCare repeal, replace. GOP lawmakers -- they only have themselves to blame they're in this situation. That is tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" You know, when we started the program tonight, I got to tell you it's really a shame that we are at this point with Senate Republicans having to pull an all-nighter. It's sort of taking toilet paper, they're wetting it down, they're throwing it up against the wall. That's their strategy, see what sticks strategy -- an attempt to try and pass some kind of health care bill so that they can then go to conference with House Republicans and eventually come up with a plan to do what they promised to do, that's repeal and replace ObamaCare. Now, Senator McConnell just posted details of the, quote, \"skinny\" ObamaCare repeal. Republicans, they begged you, the American people, for this opportunity for seven long years. And they are now doing their best to squander it. There's no other way to spin this. Now, yesterday, seven GOP senators -- they voted against the clean repeal of ObamaCare. Some of them voted for that very bill in 2015. It makes you wonder if everything you've been told for years was just all talk. Now, it sure certainly seems that way. And as I said last night, these senators have put Republican advantages in Congress now in jeopardy for 2018 because we don't know how the vote on the \"skinny\" repeal is ever going to turn out, and we'll be following it all night tonight. Also, Republicans -- they had seven years, seven years to come up with a plan, seven years to find consensus and agreement, and that didn't happen. It's been one misstep after another. They literally let this all play out in public on TV and radio and in the papers instead of everybody getting in a room, as I suggested, locking the door, taking their phones, ordering pizza, having beer and Coke and Seven Up and water so that they could have the plan that works for the American people. Aren't the Republicans -- and I'm a registered conservative. Aren't they supposed to be the party of big and bold ideas? Well, they're now today the party I say of zero identity. They seem too afraid, too timid, too spineless to go beyond the status quo. They played this way during the Obama years. The GOP is supposed to be the party of repeal, replace. They're supposed to be the party of freedom and liberty and capitalism and less regulation and government interference in our lives and free market solutions. Right now, they have no vision, they have no identity, and there's no unity. And they didn't even try to offer up big, out-of-the-box ideas. I've been talking about these ideas for over 15 years, how to fix our broken health care system. Remember this doctor in Kansas? I've been interviewing him since 2012, Dr. Josh Umbehr, Atlas MD. I've interviewed him all these times. He runs a health care cooperative. It's $50 a month for adults, $10 a month for children. They have no co-pays, unlimited office visits, 24-hour doctor service available for you, free procedures, 95 percent reductions because they negotiate directly with the pharmaceutical companies, and you leave with your medicine as soon as you leave the doctor's office. And the same with lab tests. Why not let other doctors -- and by the way, some 400 already are doing similar things. They didn't even bring these ideas up, just like health savings accounts. Now, there's some good news today. The House did vote to fund the -- some of the president's border wall, but that still has to get through the Senate. And finally, Republican lawmakers, their inability to get things done -- here's the truth. It's harming you. And at this point, it seems like the only person in the Republican Party who has a vision, is articulating that vision, is the president himself. And you see the reaction that he gets and the crowds that show up when he speaks. And earlier this week on the Senate floor, after returning to Washington from his brain cancer diagnosis, Senator John McCain made these comments."

It wish him personally a speedy recovery. But what he said I have to disagree with. Talk radio, TV hosts -- we are not, Senator, the ones to blame for your inaction and your failure in Washington. I have for years on radio and TV been offering up conservative solutions. 2013, late 2013, I offered the conservative solution caucus. I'm constantly encouraging Republicans to adopt big ideas, solutions that help the American people in poverty, on food stamps and out of the labor force that can't buy a house. I've talked about the penny plan for fiscal responsibility, to balance our budget. I've talked about lowering taxes for all the years I've been on the air. I've talked about tax reform, repatriation of trillions of corporate American and multinational corporation dollars to build factories and manufacturing centers and build jobs in America. I've talked at length about energy independence. I've worked with energy companies to get Americans hired. I've talked about securing the border. I've talked about charter schools. I've talked about sending education back to the states. I've talked about rebuilding our military, ending stifling regulations of government, identifying, defeating radical Islam. Excuse me, Senator, I care about the country and I want solutions. I've talked about this for four hours a day for now 22 years on TV and radio. And when you were running, you wanted to be on my show as much as you possibly can. So I'm sorry, that is an unfair cheap shot. And I'm sorry, Republicans, stop pointing the fingers. You sound like Hillary Clinton. Start producing the results you promised. Now, also tonight, we want to talk about new White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Of course, the Fox News audience knows him well. And we also want to look at the deep state leaking. Now, look, I know the rest of the mainstream media -- they're foaming at the mouth. They love what they view as infighting and leaking and conflict and everything that they think will stop the president and his agenda. OK, so Anthony Scaramucci -- he made a phone call with a New Yorker reporter. And guess what? He wasn't clear enough that it was off the record, apparently. I talked to him tonight. He said he's apologizing. Now, this is the cover of The New York Post tomorrow morning. It's one of the New York tabloids. And everyone may have a good chuckle at this cover. Take a look at the cover. Look, \"Survivor,\" the White House, the Trump White House. Now, if you look at every single person on that front page, they have had to deal for over six months with the D.C. swamp, starting with the president. They have had to deal with unprecedented lies, attacks from liberals in the mainstream destroy Trump media, and much more. Every one of those people have been fighting to drain the swamp and the sewer that is D.C., and they're trying to get these changes done for the American people. Now, if those people are on the cover, if they lose in their battle, if they're beaten by the deep state, by Democrats, if they're beaten by weak Republicans, never Trumpers and the media -- if they're beaten, well, guess what? The American people in this country will lose the opportunity of a generation. Now, speaking with Anthony Scaramucci, as he expressed and as Ed Henry reported, in his tweets, he regrets using some of the language he used with the reporter. He told me he thought it was off the record. Now, OK, I don't doubt there's been plenty of infighting, plenty of leaking. I don't like any of it. But doesn't that kind of happen at everybody's job? Let's be honest with ourselves here. If the goal of the deep state is the same, well, excuse me, they're trying to get the president to never enact his agenda. And you know, that's what the bottom line is here. They want to delegitimize the president. They don't want what you voted for to become the law of this land. And the president, Anthony Scaramucci, Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon -- you know what? The one thing they all have in common, in spite of maybe disagreeing here and maybe some infighting -- they're all tired of the deep state leaks. Anthony Scaramucci rightly is trying to put an end to it. I don't know who's leaking in the White House. I have no idea, but I hope it ends. And it's important they figure out where these leaks are coming from to the press, the press that wants to destroy the president, as well. And then look at the deep state. They have one singular focus. They are determined to damage the president with selective leaking day in and day out and stop his agenda, which, at the end of the day, that hurts you, the American people. Joining us with reaction -- she's the counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. I thought of everybody on the cover of The Post tomorrow -- I thought you looked the best."

I don't know what they were expecting. He said, like all those senators said, I'm going to repeal and replace ObamaCare. Sean, if I showed you all those senators, all those members of Congress who ran successfully on repealing and replacing \"Obama care\" -- there were no asterisks, no footnotes, no bibliographies, no maybe, shoulda-coulda-woulda. It was very straightforward. I can show you their paid advertisements. I can show you them in 16 different shots at podiums in (ph) with the crowd, pledging to repeal and replace ObamaCare straight up. Now, the one person who's keeping that promise is Donald Trump. He's been here for six short months, got pen in hand. They've been talking about this for seven years, four consecutive election cycles. While he was busy being a successful businessman in New York and around the globe, they were promising their constituents. It's not just a campaign promise, it's a moral imperative. And I also want to point something else out about tonight. Whether they have an all-nighter, whether it goes -- whenever intelligence goes to conference, I want America to know not a single Democrat is helping. In fact, the Republicans offered a single-payer amendment tonight to get a vote on where the Democrats say our country is headed with respect to health care. Do you know how many votes it got? This is not A-OK, this is zero. And four or so -- four or five Democrats voted against it, and then the rest of the Democrats voted present. They might as well have been out to dinner because they're certainly out to lunch. They're not lifting a finger to help the 6.5 million Americans who forked over $3 billion to the IRS, rather than get basic \"Obama care\" coverage. They're not helping those who have suffered because 83 insurers have fled the market with dozens more promising to do so. They're not helping people to meet the cost of these premiums, the people who have the worst possible outcome, ridiculous, quote, \"insurance cards\" that they can't use because the premiums are too high. So I want America to remember who stood up, kept promises and tried to help the people who have been left behind. In that White House, people come once a week, \"Obama care\" victims. And we've met them personally. The president, the vice president, others have met with them personally. Their stories are real. They're evolved (ph). You know, the mainstream media still puts them in quote, \"Obama care,\" quote, victims. Folks, they're real. You want to go cover intrigue? Go talk to those people, ask them what's happened to them and their families since they had their hours cut, their wages cut, their jobs cut, their health care benefits cut."

For allegedly leaking classified national security information to the mainstream press, the establishment press. Also, other major stories that we're following tonight -- well, this one comes from John Solomon of The Hill. According to his report, House Intel Committee chairman Devin Nunes is now accusing the Obama administration of illicitly unmasking hundreds of American names last year without any proper justification. Joining us now with all of this, CircaNews's Sara Carter, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice and a president -- and an attorney for President Trump Jay Sekulow, as well, FOX News anchor and attorney Gregg Jarrett.

I haven't been able to yet verify that information was, but if these allegations, Sean, prove true, it's going to be devastating for the FBI, whose morale has already been shook up. And I've spoken to sources that say even within the FBI right now, within the bureau, I mean, they're scouring through everything. They're looking for leakers. They really want to clean house.

He's the chief lawyer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And if he leaked information, national security information or anything else for that matter, he needs to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Now, he was also the general counsel when James Comey, the previous FBI director, was, in fact, the director of the FBI, and we know that James Comey did not hesitate to leak information, including information about conversations he had with the president of the United States that he leaked to a friend of his who was a law professor, ultimately to get it to the press.

We are following these developments on Capitol Hill very closely. We will keep brining you news as it becomes available. Also tonight, for weeks right here on this program, we have been saying that we need to restore the rule of law, equal justice under the law, and get rid of the two-tiered justice system. Lawmakers need to start looking into the Democratic congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the I.T. staffer who was arrested earlier this week being charged with bank fraud. Back with reaction, Sara Carter, Jay Sekulow, Gregg Jarrett. Before I get to that issue, Sara, let's go to John's story. The Obama administration illicitly unmasking hundreds of Americans' names, something you and him have now been discussing for a while. And I am also told that it is going to get so big and names are going to be named and they are top names that were with Obama. How accurate is that? How close are we to maybe hearing that? SARA CARTER, \"CIRCA NEWS\": I think we're very close to hearing about that. And remember, Sean, this wasn't just high-level officials that were unmasking. What John was reporting is that Obama aides, Obama aides in the White House were unmasking, the majority of which they believed were all people associated with President Trump or related to President Trump or connected to the President Trump in unmasking these foreign intercepts. And they want to know, were some of these stories coincided with the leaks that happened in the media? And they're going to be looking at this. That's why this is so important, because it's such a violation of Fourth Amendment rights, if it proves to be true. And it was used for political espionage. If that allegation is true, it is going to change everything because, remember, FISA, Section 702 comes up for a vote at the end of the year.

Why has this not been an ongoing FBI investigation since the outset, since all this information broke?

We think that it's OK for the former FBI director while he was the FBI director to take notes from a private conversation he had with the president of the United States and leak them for the purpose of obtaining a special counsel. If we think that's OK, then we've lost the constitutional republic that our forefathers fought for."

More leaks coming from the White House tonight. \"The Washington Post\" citing, shockingly, an anonymous White House official reporting that Anthony Scaramucci and his allies are planning to present to President Trump a diagram showing suspected leaks out of the White House. We will have details as they emerge tonight. Joining us with reaction, Fox News contributor Mercedes Schlapp, Fox News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera. This is no secret that there have been individual camps, Geraldo, leaking in the White House. There's no secret, and little battles, wars which kind of defined other administrations, maybe this one a little more but when you really think about it, everybody there wants to drain the swamp and the sewer."

There are different loyalties built up over time. You say \"The Washington Post\" is suggesting that Mooch is going to present the diagram that shows who leaked and how it was leaked. I submit to you that the establishment that you're talking about, the so-called deep state exists on both sides, the left and the right, and President Trump is up against both of them. And I have no doubt -- our friend Anthony Scaramucci has very colorful language. I think that unfortunately it detracted from his main message, which was these leaks have to stop because they are undermining not only the Trump administration but the very nature of the republic itself. And I firmly believe that he's got something on Priebus."

You have a president being attacked by the deep state, by Democrats, by the media, by weak Republicans as we're watching these idiots trying to do the skinny bill that they never ran on, and of course, never-Trumpers. And then if they are fighting with themselves and leaking to the media that hates the president, you can't function in that environment that way."

And that I think is very counterproductive. And at the end, rather than each individual group trying to save their reputation, they are forgetting that the main reason why they are there is to serve the president of the United States and serve the American people, which is most important. I tell you, when I worked at the White House under President Bush, it was the chief of staff who made it very clear to the staff that if anyone were to leak, you packed your bags and you get out of this White House because you are serving the American people. And I think it's very clear that whatever Scaramucci is planning to do in terms of getting to the bottom it in terms of these leaker is incredibly important. But at the same time --"

We expect Republican senators are getting a closer look at this Republican health care plan that has just come out in the last 50 minutes or so. It contains a lot of conservative principles, getting rid of the Obamacare mandates for employers and for individuals, providing flexibility to states, also using health savings accounts. And so it has a lot of Republican principles. We'll see if they have the votes. They can only afford to lose two Republican and have Vice President Mike Pence be the tiebreaker. And so there's very little wiggle room here, but at this hour we believe that Republican lawmakers are taking a closer look at it and figuring out whether they're a yes or a no, Sean."

Back with us for reaction, Geraldo Rivera, and now the host of \"War Stories,\" Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North. Colonel, you understand. You've been there, how dangerous leaking is to the White House. And Anthony Scaramucci went in, and he is saying we'll put an end to it. In the interim he took on two of the president's, two people that have been with the president since day one. What are your thoughts? COL. OLIVER NORTH, HOST, \"WAR STORIES\": Look, I lived through that. I watched it happen with President Reagan. I watched it happen on some very sensitive missions where the lives of Americans were at risk. It's nothing new. And unfortunately in this administration, there seems to be so much opposition coming from within the administration, perhaps some holdovers, perhaps some other people have different perspectives. The bottom line of it is, it's bad for America and it's against the law to leak classified information. They ought to be prosecuted."

Here's the bottom line of what just happened with the president's tweets on the issue of transgender people serving the military. A U.S. marine rifle company is not a petri dish in which we conduct experiments on how much stupidity it takes to tough kill men with rifles. There is an estimate in the press that it cost $250,000 for transgender surgery and hormone treatment. Why would we spend that? If indeed some of those reports right, then we have 6,000 people that are transgender in the military and want to come in to get transgendered surgery and the like, why would we spend $1.5 billion on that when for the same amount of money, we could build another USS Wasp, a landing helicopter delivery vessel for Marine amphibious assaults?"
