His legacy is right up there with New Coke. And the whole point of the Iran deal was legacy, it wasn't security. Before this bone-headed deal, Iran was on the ropes. The economy was headed into North Korean territory and the place was about as stable as Jim Carrey on a skateboard. Then we threw them a lifeline, so the left could have something to write about in their history books. Stupid. We went to negotiate with a bunch of apocalyptic theocrats and we sent this guy.

I would say this, you're exactly right on the monologue, they had the sanctions in place and had max leverage and we're squeezing them hard. And instead of ratcheting that up, they caved and gave him a sweetheart deal. They gave him billions of dollars in cash, which they used on missiles and terrorism. They were violating the deal.

They allow to spin centrifuges, 6,000 of them. And they have a sunset provision that says they can ramp it up in just a few years. So, it's a terrible deal.

He actually climbed down 50 feet down a garbage burn pit to save a puppy that he later named Mimi, and the two bonded immediately, as you can see from the photo. He's trying to bring Mimi back to Texas with him. And it sounds like a simple thing to do, but in fact, it is not. It's expensive, as well, and complicated. So they have this wonderful relationship. And I think if there can be anything we can do for our veterans to help bring them joy for all that they do and serve. You can go to PawsofWar.org to check out more about it, to get involved.

Then we threw them a lifeline, so the left could have something to write about in their history books. Stupid. We went to negotiate with a bunch of apocalyptic theocrats and we sent this guy. What's the matter? Kathy Perry was booked? One question, did James Taylor strum a little mood music while the mullahs screwed us? So now, for Kerry the Iran deal is like a crappy shack on a vital plot of land and the new guy, Trump, tore it down. So, does this mean war? No. If you think the current president harbors a grudge against Iran, you'd be wrong. He seems willing to talk to just about anyone. The only thing he hates is dumb deals. He'd rather start clean.

Not by people here in America, or not by the visitors from Europe that came to visit, and he decided -- and wasn't just going to take a little piece out of it. Like, we're actually pulling out of the entire thing. And he made his case, whether he's persuasive enough across the board, I don't know, but it doesn't actually matter. The person wasn't persuasive enough, initially, was President Obama, because he did not decide to have the senate vote on it as a treaty, that meant that he did it by executive action. If you look at the things that President Obama did under executive action, President Trump has been able to dismantle those quite easily. An exception is Obamacare. Obamacare was passed by the congress and it was upheld by the Supreme Court. That is naturally something that has been -- chip away at it, but it still exists. So, President Trump took decisive action, but it was really not -- I don't think it's that unprecedented given that it was not a treaty. It was a decision President Obama made. And there might be consequences from it, but I think that -- I think it was a good decision."

I can't think of a very funny pun, Greg, like a mummy pun. But it's shrinking and it's shrinking fast. I would say this, you're exactly right on the monologue, they had the sanctions in place and had max leverage and we're squeezing them hard. And instead of ratcheting that up, they caved and gave him a sweetheart deal. They gave him billions of dollars in cash, which they used on missiles and terrorism. They were violating the deal. They exceeded the heavy water capacity. The inspections were a joke. They've actually let them self-inspect. Can you imagine that? The Iranians self-inspecting. They were banning inspectors from their military sites. Satellite images shows that the military site inside a bunker and a mountain that's being moved around. They're opening up doors and they're doing some refurbishing there. So that's very suspicious. You know the Israeli spies smuggled all those documents out of Iran to say the guy lied just to facilitate the deal in the first place. So, the entire thing was about they let the ballistic missiles stay. They, you know, did really nothing to make sure the deal was enforced. The worst part about it was Ben Rhodes, the national security advisor, bragged about how he sold these lies through the fake news media about how good of a deal it was, because of you actually put the deal to a senate vote, like a treaty would go, no one would have voted for it because it was so ridiculous. They allow to spin centrifuges, 6,000 of them. And they have a sunset provision that says they can ramp it up in just a few years. So, it's a terrible deal. And, like he said, there's still going to be a deal on the table potentially if they make a smart decision."

And guess what, you know why he couldn't do that? It's because People like Michael Hayden, Dan Coats, the intelligence community -- Dan Coats is his own guy, has said we know of nothing, nothing within Iran's action that would constitute a violation of this deal. That's the same thing he was hearing from his advisors before he got Bolton and Pompeo over at CIA. So, this is a victory for Iran because it creates distance between the United States and our European allies. Secondly, it accelerates regional insecurity in the Middle East. It also has -- going to have an impact on global oil supplies. We don't know where that's going to go, could drive up prices. And then, finally -- you know, it's so funny. In the speech, he said, oh, you know, in seven years, Iran is going to be free under the terms of this deal to create nuclear weapons. Well, guess what, the Washington Post writes that they've gave him four Pinocchio's. In other words, no chance, not true, but it doesn't seem to matter. I mean, you always say this is team sports, and if this is about team sports and politics, well, I guess Trump's people are going to say great.

But he didn't do it in a knee-jerk fashion as soon as he became president. He, actually, still continues to listen to toppled deliberation on it and then came to the conclusion. He has shown that he is somebody that's not afraid to change his mind when presented with persuasive factual evidence through the contrary. In this case, he determined that this was not a good deal for the United States. In fact, it's a billion-dollar push to help reach a greater nuclear Iran. That's why he wanted to pull out of it. Why would we subsidize a nuclear Iran? And that's what this was. There was no bite or teeth to the inspections. They were self-inspecting.

And I do think one vulnerability here is that you do put sanctions on a country to change their behavior. If Iran had not actually done anything to violate the deal, as all of these people had said, then there might be a problem there. But the president was also careful to do something else.

This is a very, very serious case. You have multiple accounts that are pretty consistent of different women coming forward with really a tale of horror and physical abuse, really difficult. When I was prosecuting sexual assault, physical and sexual abuse cases in Los Angeles and in San Francisco, they are -- Ronan is rights. They're the toughest to do in terms of the vulnerability of the victims, the fear of reprisal coming forward, especially someone who is incredibly powerful, well-connected in the Democratic Party, someone who had an eye towards a presidential bid, and was able to go, you know, undetected for so long because they were afraid to come forward to say anything against him.

Of course, I won't because I'm not a lawyer. And, thirdly, to the point about these Democrats coming forward and trying to silence the victims, this happens on both parties where you can make a choice between your ideals and victims or choosing the powerful and the money, and a lot of the times in the past people have choose to side with the powerful and the money.

Like, there was that kind of pushback. It's never appropriate. This cuts a little bit, even, closer to the bone, because they are actually mocking her for her being an immigrant. I do think, though, staff-wise, though, when you look at the slogan \"Be Best,\" they could have probably saved her a little bit of heartache on this, if you just add -- she could call it \"Be the Best,\" whatever -- whatever you want it to be. But first ladies can do whatever they want to do. And it does come with some criticism, but it's not widespread. I do think that we have to remember that the people who are being A-holes --"

That is a big jump, despite 90 percent negative coverage during that approximate time period on the broadcast evening news tallied by the Media Research Center.

The facts are that he's working on immigration. He's working hard on the border. He pulled out of the Iran deal. He said no to the crazy Paris climate change accord. All right? We're winning in national security and against ISIS. We're having historic talks as it relates to North Korea and South Korea. You know, he's tough with Iran. He's been tough with Syria.

And then the song girls did more of, like, the dance routines and stuff like that. So it was, like, kind of separate and distinct. So -- but you also have to be in very good physical shape to be able to do this. There's a lot of the pyramids and stuff, and you can fall. And they do flips and everything.

Thirty-five buildings, though, destroyed, most in private homes. There's also sulfur dioxide gas at high levels all around. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes, and its lava usually flows into the ocean. Not this time."

The colleges of -- Washington and Jefferson College, excuse me, they became partners with the memorial, and they have created an exhibit talking about how important baseball is in times of national tragedy. And one of the examples they have here is after 9/11. So there's the baseball that George W. Bush threw out at Yankee Stadium. You can also see the former New York City mayor, Rudy Giuliani's windbreaker that he wore. And I think we have a picture here of the Washington and Jefferson College students. Their assistant history professor is David Kieran. He helped create the exhibit for the memorial. If you can, try to get there."

And through the organization, I came across the story of U.S. Army Specialist Zachary McIntyre who was stationed in Afghanistan. It was really a compelling story. He actually climbed down 50 feet down a garbage burn pit to save a puppy that he later named Mimi, and the two bonded immediately, as you can see from the photo. He's trying to bring Mimi back to Texas with him. And it sounds like a simple thing to do, but in fact, it is not. It's expensive, as well, and complicated. So they have this wonderful relationship. And I think if there can be anything we can do for our veterans to help bring them joy for all that they do and serve. You can go to PawsofWar.org to check out more about it, to get involved. And then I'd like to kindly invite you to go -- 7:25 tonight, FOX News Channel, Martha MacCallum. I will join her on \"The Story\" to discuss more of the details of the Eric Schneiderman case."
