Remember, it was Robert Byrd that filibuster the historic Civil Rights Act, oppose the Voting Rights Act, and Joe Biden absolutely did work hand-in-hand with the former Klansman to stop school integration. Let's quote The Washington Post. Biden spoke out repeatedly and forcefully against sending white children to majority black schools and black children to majority white schools. Remember Biden worried his own children would grow up in a, quote, racial jungle. A few years later, Biden fact lied about merging the civil rights movement. He also lied about endorsements he claimed he had from the NAACP. In 1993, he referred to inner-city youth as, quote, predators in our streets. In 2006, he told a crowd, you have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-Eleven or Dunkin' Donuts.

In 2007, remember what he said about Barack Obama? The first mainstream African-American who's articulate, bright, and clean. That's storybook, man. He likes to say \"come on, man\" a lot. Last year, he said, quote, poor kids can be just as bright as white kids. And recently, Biden said, you ain't black if you support President Trump. So, clearly, Senator Harris was onto something and this was not the first time that Harris launched accusations against Biden.

Remember the plan that would ultimately eliminate oil and gas in 10 years? That would be the lifeblood of America's and the world's economy. Remember, she wants to immediately ban all fracking. By the way, how are our friends in Pennsylvania and Ohio feeling about that tonight? She even supports a federal ban on plastic straws, and she also wants to ban guns via a presidential executive order. And, by the way, as for your public health insurance, versus private health insurance, well, under Kamala's Medicare-for-All program, you can kiss all private insurance goodbye. She is so extreme she would get rid of all private health plans, so much for freedom of choice, right? Like it or not, she wants to outlaw your private insurance, replace it with government-run Medicare-for-All. She also wants to raise your taxes, billions and billions of dollars. She voted against the president's tax cuts. She's a huge proponent of raising income taxes. Not minimally, by billions and billions of dollars. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, that would be confiscation and redistribution of wealth. But of course she doesn't want any of that money going to law enforcement. 2019, remember, she tweeted: Michael Brown was murdered by Officer Darren Wilson. Wow. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Former prosecutor, rush to judgment. Where's the presumption of innocence? Innocent until proven guilty. She was a prosecutor in San Francisco. By the way, that was beyond a despicable lie. Has she ever apologized to Officer Darren Wilson? A clear smear? Now and exonerated police officer for peer political gain. And, by the way, it was Biden and Obama's own Justice Department that cleared Officer Wilson and said that shooting was justified. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But yet today, her smear stands. Recently she praised Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles. Why? He slashed the LAPD's budget by $150 million, which is pretty dumb and as we've been telling you on this program, that's not going to end well. New York City, Chicago, Portland, Seattle or anywhere. She also once compared immigration and customs enforcement to the Ku Klux Klan. And she now wants to start from scratch in order to totally transform ICE. In addition to smearing immigration law enforcement officers, Harris also supports sanctuary cities and that great state of hers, the sanctuary state of California. She wants to halt construction of our border wall as a prosecutor in San Francisco, oh, San Francisco, she allowed while scores of violent criminals to walk free. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, she was infamous for offering plea deals to anyone that would take them, especially and even violent felons. Still, somehow her conviction rate was among the lowest of all prosecutors in the entire state of California. And during her tenure, San Francisco's homicide rate -- well, it's skyrocketed. It surged. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Harris was also accused of prosecutorial misconduct. Some on the left believed that she was disproportionately targeting minorities for prosecution. And that's not even touching the surface. Kamala's presidential run -- well, it was absolutely wrecked. Remember, Tulsi Gabbard called her out for her current practices as a prosecutor. Who could forget this moment? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Well, guess what, he had plenty of other radical far left options. In fact, according to David Axelrod -- well, Kamala Harris wasn't even Biden's topic at all. Apparently, he wanted to tap Michigan's ever corrupt, incompetent, far left governor there, that's Shutdown Whitmer. And Axelrod believes that Whitmer was not picked because of her race.

Look at what you see, there appears to be a script in the picture and Joe actually has his phone backwards.

I saved it. We called Russia, President Putin. We called the king of Saudi Arabia. They cut 10 million barrels of oil a day. And we saved the energy. And now, we are at $41 a barrel. But, more importantly, for the people driving cars, we are around $2 and even less a gallon. And that's fantastic. She's against petroleum. She is against fracking. So is Biden. And that means you can't win Texas. You can't win Pennsylvania. You can't win Oklahoma or North Dakota or many other states. And it also means your electric bills would go up literally by 10 times. You wouldn't -- it wouldn't be even sustainable. And if they went with this crazy Green -- it's like child's play. If they went with the so-called Green New Deal, you're talking about a -- catastrophic for the country. You would probably have to close 20 to 25 percent of your businesses even to qualify. And they wouldn't function properly, because we don't have that kind of energy. It's crazy. This can't -- they can't power our massive -- we have these massive plants, some of which and many of which are being built under me.

That's what they say. It goes slower, and it's more painful. We are taking them out by the thousands. And Guatemala, if you look at Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, these are countries that wouldn't take people back. Tremendous problems came to our country. They wouldn't take them back. Now they take them back. You know, we were paying them for years hundreds of millions of dollars a year, ridiculously. And I said, you mean we're paying them the money? We don't take them back. We bring them to the country. They wouldn't accept. They wouldn't let our planes land before me. And when I got there, I said, well, if they won't do that, then we are not going to pay them anymore. Once I said that, we stopped paying them. And then all of a sudden, they take these people back gladly, with -- very, very happily. Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on the Southern border. And people aren't coming in now. They don't go past the Mexican soldiers, so, very, very few people coming in illegally. And then that's helped, of course, by the wall. So, we have made tremendous strides. We let people come in legally. We want people to come in through merit, where they can help our country, where they can love our country.

It can't work. It hasn't worked in little districts. Small, little defined districts, they can't do it. And it's an impossibility. Plus, the post office isn't set up for this.

And now security and safety -- now, some people would argue, including me, that if you can't -- that is the number one job of government.

You watched my interview with Horace Lorenzo Anderson Sr. He lost his 19- year-old son in the \"Summer of Love\" zone, when the mayor out there allowed the anarchists to take over city blocks and police precincts. We now know about Kamala Harris' view. I mentioned it during my opening monologue. Joe did -- he's trying to walk it back -- say, the police, they have become the enemy. And he's all for reallocating funds away from the police. And Kamala Harris praised the LAPD for the cuts in that city, a billion cut in New York, and it's become a disaster.

You know, we need -- they're supposed to call and say, please send help. But, honestly, they have 10,000 great law enforcement people there. Really, they can take care of it themselves. But we'd be glad to send in the National Guard and solve the problem, like we did in Minneapolis. We solved that problem in one hour after they arrived. We can do it in Portland so easy. We can do it in Chicago, a little more difficult. It's a different kind of a problem. One is anarchists, and the other are people that go around indiscriminately shooting everyone and themselves. But we can solve the problems, if they ask. They have to ask. We are ready, willing, and able. We went to Portland to save the courthouse, if you can believe it, an expensive courthouse, a beautiful courthouse. It was going to be destroyed. It was going to be set on fire. And the mayor wasn't saving it. And the governor of the state wasn't going to save it. So we sent Homeland Security, 300 people. And they -- it was very easy for them. They could've marched forward. They are not allowed to do that. They have very strong restrictions, unfortunately. And they were -- they surrounded it, and they protected it, and it's fine. And they are still there, by the way. You know, the mayor likes to say they're -- they are still there. They are to protect the courthouse. It's not for them to do anything beyond that. They are not allowed to.

And after two years of seeing them, I say: \"Why do you people keep coming back? Why are you continuing to come back?\" \"Well, we have to come back and ask for money.\" I said: \"Every year, you have to ask for money? Every year? That's not -- that's terrible.\" And one man said something. A wonderful guy in charge of one of the colleges, the head person at one of these really good colleges, said to me: \"Yes, they make us feel like beggars, because, every year, they make us come back for money.\" \"And you have been doing this for years?\" They said: \"Yes, sir, we have been doing this for years.\" I said: \"We have to give you long-term financing.

And he could've possibly at least tried criminal justice reform. He didn't even try. I have done more for the black community than any other president, other than perhaps Abraham Lincoln. And I will tell you, when you look at what we did with Tim Scott on Opportunity Zones, it's incredible, the jobs that we are producing for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans. But the jobs that we are producing -- Tim Scott is incredible. The jobs that we are producing, it was an idea that Tim had, and we took it. And we made it into an incredible thing, where jobs are being done. And areas that haven't been invested in, in decades are being brought back. It's an incredible thing to see. And we did these things. And Obama didn't do it. And this mostly helps the minority communities, the black community. It's incredible, what has happened. It's actually incredible, some of the things we have done. And we have tremendous African-American support. I will tell you that, Sean, tremendous. We have tremendous Hispanic support. And you know who likes the wall the best of all and who likes the border safety the best of all? The Hispanic, because they understand the border better than anybody.

Trump, will join us live with reaction to today's major breaking news. It is now official. California liberal Senator Kamala Harris has been selected as Joe Biden's running mate. Now, this pick now solidifies what is the most extreme radical far left out of the mainstream ticket of any major political party in American history. Her radical extremist record is atrocious, her support for socialism frankly scary and full details coming up throughout this hour on this terrible record. But, first, let's -- let's first hear what Senator Harris really thought about Joe Biden. You might remember this just a few months ago. Now, she wants all but accused her running mate of outright bigotry and racism. Take a look."

And it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing. And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me."

      "utterance": "Now, of course, Senator Harris was right. Biden did in fact work hand-in-hand with segregationists to stop school integration. Let's, quote, NBC News at the time. He led the charge on an issue they kept black students away from the classrooms of white students. Now, former Ku Klux Klan leader, I call him Robert \"KKK\" Byrd, well, Biden says he was his mentor. Remember, it was Robert Byrd that filibuster the historic Civil Rights Act, oppose the Voting Rights Act, and Joe Biden absolutely did work hand-in-hand with the former Klansman to stop school integration. Let's quote The Washington Post. Biden spoke out repeatedly and forcefully against sending white children to majority black schools and black children to majority white schools. Remember Biden worried his own children would grow up in a, quote, racial jungle. A few years later, Biden fact lied about merging the civil rights movement. He also lied about endorsements he claimed he had from the NAACP. In 1993, he referred to inner-city youth as, quote, predators in our streets. In 2006, he told a crowd, you have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-Eleven or Dunkin' Donuts. He says I'm not joking. In 2006, he bragged that his state was a slave state. In 2007, remember what he said about Barack Obama? The first mainstream African-American who's articulate, bright, and clean. That's storybook, man. He likes to say \"come on, man\" a lot. Last year, he said, quote, poor kids can be just as bright as white kids. And recently, Biden said, you ain't black if you support President Trump. So, clearly, Senator Harris was onto something and this was not the first time that Harris launched accusations against Biden. She also accused Joe Biden of disgusting sexual misconduct. Remember in 2019, she said she believes all the women who accused Biden of touching them and verbally. Let's see her in her own words. You decide."

      "utterance": "One of the first questions you should ask, does Senator Harris feel the same way today? Now, will anyone in the media mob ask her this question? I tend to doubt it. Or if they do ask, she will give a lame excuse and the mob will accept it instantly, like always. It will be up to this program to vet the Democratic ticket as we always do and we always promised. Buckle up because Kamala Harris and her record, it is extreme, it is radical hard left. Senator Harris was an official cosponsor of the radical Green New Deal. Remember the plan that would ultimately eliminate oil and gas in 10 years? That would be the lifeblood of America's and the world's economy. Remember, she wants to immediately ban all fracking. By the way, how are our friends in Pennsylvania and Ohio feeling about that tonight? She even supports a federal ban on plastic straws, and she also wants to ban guns via a presidential executive order. And, by the way, as for your public health insurance, versus private health insurance, well, under Kamala's Medicare-for-All program, you can kiss all private insurance goodbye. She is so extreme she would get rid of all private health plans, so much for freedom of choice, right? Like it or not, she wants to outlaw your private insurance, replace it with government-run Medicare-for-All. She also wants to raise your taxes, billions and billions of dollars. She voted against the president's tax cuts. She's a huge proponent of raising income taxes. Not minimally, by billions and billions of dollars. Well, that would be confiscation and redistribution of wealth. But of course she doesn't want any of that money going to law enforcement. 2019, remember, she tweeted: Michael Brown was murdered by Officer Darren Wilson. Wow. Former prosecutor, rush to judgment. Where's the presumption of innocence? Innocent until proven guilty. She was a prosecutor in San Francisco. By the way, that was beyond a despicable lie. Has she ever apologized to Officer Darren Wilson? A clear smear? Now and exonerated police officer for peer political gain. And, by the way, it was Biden and Obama's own Justice Department that cleared Officer Wilson and said that shooting was justified. But yet today, her smear stands. Recently she praised Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles. Why? He slashed the LAPD's budget by $150 million, which is pretty dumb and as we've been telling you on this program, that's not going to end well. New York City, Chicago, Portland, Seattle or anywhere. She also once compared immigration and customs enforcement to the Ku Klux Klan. And she now wants to start from scratch in order to totally transform ICE. In addition to smearing immigration law enforcement officers, Harris also supports sanctuary cities and that great state of hers, the sanctuary state of California. She wants to halt construction of our border wall as a prosecutor in San Francisco, oh, San Francisco, she allowed while scores of violent criminals to walk free. Now, she was infamous for offering plea deals to anyone that would take them, especially and even violent felons. Still, somehow her conviction rate was among the lowest of all prosecutors in the entire state of California. And during her tenure, San Francisco's homicide rate -- well, it's skyrocketed. It surged. And Harris was also accused of prosecutorial misconduct. Some on the left believed that she was disproportionately targeting minorities for prosecution. And that's not even touching the surface. Kamala's presidential run -- well, it was absolutely wrecked. Remember, Tulsi Gabbard called her out for her current practices as a prosecutor. Who could forget this moment?"

      "utterance": "Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she will be a prosecutor president, but I'm deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. She blocked evidence. She blocked evidence that would have freed up innocent men from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison the other sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California. The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference in impact and these people's lives, you did not. And worse yet, in the case of those who are on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that whatever freed them until you are forced to do so. There is no excuse for that, and the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor owe -- you owe them an apology."

In fact, according to David Axelrod -- well, Kamala Harris wasn't even Biden's topic at all. Apparently, he wanted to tap Michigan's ever corrupt, incompetent, far left governor there, that's Shutdown Whitmer. And Axelrod believes that Whitmer was not picked because of her race. That would be identity politics on steroids and human growth hormone. And according to the Trump campaign, there is a much more obvious reason that biden tapped senator Harris. Let's take a look."

And just today, the Biden campaign photographer, look at this, they released a picture showing Joe talking to Kamala Harris. Look at what you see, there appears to be a script in the picture and Joe actually has his phone backwards. But over there at MSDNC, state-run conspiracy television, Roswell Rachel Maddow's Area 51 channel, well, they have now been accused tonight of cropping that apparent script out of their coverage. That's how you know it's bad. So, what's going on? Does Joe Biden actually need a script to have a casual conversation? Is it really that bad? Will Biden actually leave his basement bunker to ever really campaign? He's been doing little mini campaigns, baby step campaigns. He shows himself for an hour or two and, run races right down to the bunker basement where he can hide. And that's all he's been doing. Is he going to make Senator Harris do all the heavy lifting and campaigning? Keep in mind -- well, he's now the same age as Ronald Reagan was when he left office. So, yes, as the Democrats and the mob and media asked about Ronald Reagan in 1984, this question remains. We will ask it if the media mob won't. And that is about Joe Biden's fitness for the toughest hardest most difficult job on the face of this earth, especially given what we see every day when he does pop his head out of the bunker. You know, he's ever confused, confounded, forgetfulness, those bouts of rage. He's having trouble with speech and numbers, what office he's running for, what day of the week it is -- really scary moments. The American people deserve answers. As I've been saying, I think before any vote is cast every American needs to see that first debate. Before the first debate, we have 16 states now scheduled to allow early voting. That shouldn't happen, especially in light of Biden being in hiding for all this time. Now, no matter what, one thing will remain true. Now more than ever, Joe Biden is running on the most radical platform of any candidate from any major party in U.S. history, now with the most radical running mate ever. In other words, if these insane socialist policies are implemented, that would mean that it is predictable America will suffer, Americans will suffer. We will lose our freedoms. We lose our very way of life. It will be threatened. In 84 days, America and the world as I say in \"Live Free or Die\", America and the world are on the brink. President Trump will be joining us in a minute. We're just beginning to touch the surface of our vetting here on this program. Here with reaction, she's a host of the highly rated \"Justice\", Judge Jeanine Pirro.\" Salem Radio nationally syndicated host Larry Elder, civil rights attorney Leo Terrell.

Notice nobody in the woman administration, the holdovers, the pundits, they ever brag about the stimulus plan. They never brag about the cars for clunkers. They never bragged about cars for clunker. Remember all that. That's the kind of stuff that Mao Zedong would have done. These are radical, crazy left-wing people that believe you can tax, spend and regulate to death."

She is a cosponsor of the Green New Deal and he has tried to distance herself if she gets political heat. But at the end of the day, we know who she is by her impromptu comments. You mentioned one of them, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the KKK, suggesting people who will are in jails, we ought to consider letting the vote. Judge Jeanine touched on one. She's refused to condemn the violence we've seen in Seattle, in Portland, and even in her own home town of Oakland. When there is terrible violence there, we did not hear her condemning the violence and the riots in that town. So, we know she is by how she (INAUDIBLE) impromptu comments. I also agree with what the panel said. She's not exactly the best candidate in the world. She didn't set everybody on fire in the Democratic presidential primary, and remember she barely won the race for attorney general over a bland, well-qualified but bland Southern California Republican prosecutor in that great state of California, far left state. She barely won the attorney general race. So, I'm -- she's good on the inside politics. Look at all the oppo dumps that she's done on poor Karen Bass. There's only one person all that stuff came from and it's Kamala Harris' operation. I do think this -- politically, she's going to be for Biden, the attack machine. She is going to be going after President Trump. And when -- and President Trump is the great counterpuncher, but you ought to remember, she is not the target. When she attacks him, he ought to use it as an opportunity to attack Biden. If she goes the president on any issue, he goes after Biden on that issue, because he's a real target.

They both believed that they can tax, spend, and regulate America into prosperity. They both believe vetting people at the border is racist. I happen to think it's prudent. They both believe that abortion is morally acceptable. They both believe in what I call the \"I deserve, you owe me\" mentality. Their vision of America is in America of safety nets where no one has to take responsibility, where it's always somebody else's fault, where every child gets a trophy. They believe that government is the only thing they can make America great. I don't. I think America is great because of ordinary people doing extraordinary things.

I think, if it is, we have got problems. But I would be surprised if it is. She wants to raise taxes. She wants to get rid of your Second Amendment, no guns for protection, no nothing. She is very strong on the Second Amendment, getting rid of it, and very bad to the military. She wants to cut the military. She wants to cut spending for the military and the vets. And, you know, I don't quite get the choice. But we will have it out. We have a great vice president named Mike Pence.

She co- sponsored his -- not only his single-payer Medicare for All, which would be, anywhere, estimates from $32 trillion to $54 trillion.

The people that really control the party -- he will never control the party -- they want it. That means you're destroying something that 180 million people love. They have a plan that they really like. That's a very hard thing to do, very hard thing to do. And, by the way, I have to say, Larry and Leo and Jeanine and your great Senator John Kennedy, who is fantastic, and Karl Rove, who has been so great, last -- you know, Karl and I had our disputes previously.

And you went forward with the Keystone XL pipeline, the Dakota pipeline. You have opened ANWR. And for the first time in 75 years, America is now energy-independent. And we are now also -- it's been a longer period of time -- the largest producer of energy in the entire world. She was a co-sponsor in the U.S. Senate of this radical Green New Deal. Joe Biden has already pledged trillions of taxpayer dollars for that plan. And all I see is that would eliminate the lifeblood of the world's economy, America's economy, in the next 10 years, according to the original plan that she, again, was a co-sponsor of. How do you see that in terms of the geopolitical strategic even defense of this country, because, that to, me is a crucial program that is scary? You know, to go back to energy dependence is scary to me."

And we -- when we had the pandemic hit us from China, which should have never happened -- they should have never let that happen. But there was obviously a lot of energy around. And we saved it. I saved it. We called Russia, President Putin. We called the king of Saudi Arabia. They cut 10 million barrels of oil a day. And we saved the energy. And now, we are at $41 a barrel. But, more importantly, for the people driving cars, we are around $2 and even less a gallon. And that's fantastic. She's against petroleum. She is against fracking. So is Biden. And that means you can't win Texas. You can't win Pennsylvania. You can't win Oklahoma or North Dakota or many other states. And it also means your electric bills would go up literally by 10 times. You wouldn't -- it wouldn't be even sustainable. And if they went with this crazy Green -- it's like child's play. If they went with the so-called Green New Deal, you're talking about a -- catastrophic for the country. You would probably have to close 20 to 25 percent of your businesses even to qualify. And they wouldn't function properly, because we don't have that kind of energy. It's crazy. This can't -- they can't power our massive -- we have these massive plants, some of which and many of which are being built under me. The car companies are moving back from Japan and from other countries, coming in from Germany. They're coming back to America, first time in 42 years. And you can't even think about firing up those plants with the kind of things they're talking about. Wind is nice. It's nice. It's -- but it's -- it causes tremendous environmental problems, from sight to home values going way down. If you see a windmill and you hear a windmill, your home is worth half or less than half. It kills all the birds. The whole thing is crazy, what they want to do. And they will destroy the country. We have built the greatest. And if you see what has happened, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, better than China by far. We were lapping them. And then, all of a sudden, when the plague came in, we had to close it down. We saved millions of lives. And now we're opening it up, and we're setting records. And you even see the stock prices today, where the markets are -- Nasdaq is higher than it ever was. And the Dow is just about ready. I mean, it's right at -- almost at the same level. Who would have believed that in the middle of a pandemic, which we are soon going to have vaccines and therapeutics. It's going to be -- it's going to all be good next year. We're going to have one of the greatest years we have ever had, if it isn't blown out the window by tripling and quadrupling taxes and regulations."

We don't want to have to pay for them for the next 50 years, but we don't want to take a chance. They are so violent. They kill people with knives because it's more painful and it goes slower. That's what they say. It goes slower, and it's more painful. We are taking them out by the thousands. And Guatemala, if you look at Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, these are countries that wouldn't take people back. Tremendous problems came to our country. They wouldn't take them back. Now they take them back. You know, we were paying them for years hundreds of millions of dollars a year, ridiculously. And I said, you mean we're paying them the money? We don't take them back. We bring them to the country. They wouldn't accept. They wouldn't let our planes land before me. And when I got there, I said, well, if they won't do that, then we are not going to pay them anymore. Once I said that, we stopped paying them. And then all of a sudden, they take these people back gladly, with -- very, very happily. Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on the Southern border. And people aren't coming in now. They don't go past the Mexican soldiers, so, very, very few people coming in illegally. And then that's helped, of course, by the wall. So, we have made tremendous strides. We let people come in legally. We want people to come in through merit, where they can help our country, where they can love our country. And that's what's happening. And the Democrats stay away. The -- I call them the radical left, because, if you look at the races, you look at some of the races that are taking place, all of these old, mainline, older mainline Democrats are being beaten by radical left, I don't know, I guess you could say anarchists in a certain way. But the people that are winning these races for the Democrats -- Eliot Engel, he was a staple many, many years. And you know who I'm talking about, a staple, from a very nice part of the world that's going bad on us, New York. It's going bad. I left there. It was four years ago. It was a wonderful place. You could see signs of badness, but it was a wonderful place. And now it's -- crime is up by many, many times. And what's happening in New York is so horrible for our country, what they have done. What Mayor de Blasio has done to that city in a short period of time is horrible. But you look at Eliot Engel, and gets beaten easily by the radical left. And the Democrats, that's where they are.

And all she did, as people got to know her, she went down. She finished at two percent, probably less than that, and she fled. Remember how quickly? She said horrible things about Biden. The one thing I felt he couldn't do -- I mean, she took what somebody said about her -- some horrible things that were said about Joe, and she said she agreed with the woman that said them. That was a terrible statement. And I said, you know, just that statement alone. But she made terrible statements. She essentially called him a racist and other things that were very bad. And you know, I said, he probably can't pick her, but let's do something on her, because people were saying it could happen. And we had others in mind also. We had some -- we had some other choices.

We know that Hillary Clinton's -- even The New York Times now recognized that her bought-and-paid-for Russian dossier was likely Russian disinformation from the beginning. But my question is more about her attack on Biden on the issue of race. And you know, the reality is, he did praise the guy that filibustered the Civil Rights Act. Imagine if you had done that. Biden did support the anti-busing amendment of Robert Byrd. And, by the way, he did say he worried his children would grow up in a racial jungle, referring to school and integration. And he did, you know, use the comment more recently, \"You ain't black,\" and \"Poor kids are just as smart as white kids,\" and in a previous campaign, \"They are going to put you all back in chains,\" and \"You can't go to a Dunkin' Donuts or a 7- Eleven unless you have a slight Indian accent,\" and what he said about even Barack Obama, clean and bright and articulate, and that's storybook, and man.

I always try and figure out which is worse. And then you have CNN and, frankly, ABC, CBS, NBC. And -- but you have some good ones in between. Locals are great. Locals, we do great in. I couldn't possibly be here. And on social media, I don't -- does anybody do better in terms of people watching and the importance of social media? So, we get the word out. But you know, the sad thing is, you have so many incredibly talented writers, journalists, frankly, including yourself, because I consider you really a journalist, to a very -- to the largest extent, the job you have done, because you got the Russia hoax correct. And your people that came on that show night after night, including, by the way, our great congressmen and senators, and senators -- you had John Kennedy on tonight. You have a lot of them on. But a lot of people got it right. And a lot of our Congress and Senate got it right. And they got it wrong, and they got Pulitzer Prizes. The Pulitzer Prize is worthless, as far as I'm concerned, because, when you have the Maggie Habermans getting a Pulitzer Prize, and she got it all wrong, she doesn't - - I haven't spoken to her in forever. She is like my biographer, like she knows everything about me. She knows nothing about me. And they talk about they have sources. They don't have sources. They are made up. They make them up in their mind. They have no sources. I know when there are sources. But, if you look at The Times, and I guess The Washington Post, they got Pulitzer Prizes, and they were totally wrong. And they got them, I guess, before the end result. And there was no collusion. And now this thing turns out to be a total hoax. And now it finds out that we caught Obama-Biden. That's why I didn't think that Susan Rice could get it, because she's part of this whole illegal thing that happened, which is one of the worst, perhaps the worst, political scandal in the history of our country. And they got caught. Now let's see what happens. But they are caught red- handed. And -- but these writers -- the writers got Pulitzer Prizes. And that shows you, a Pulitzer Prize is worthless. And, frankly, you ought to start a petition to return the Pulitzer Prize, because they were all wrong. They were wrong on the whole subject of Russia, Russia, Russia. It was made up, fabricated. It was a crime that was committed. And you look at Hillary Clinton, where she paid for the fake dossier. And now the dossier is proven to be totally fake. It's a disgrace what happened. And no other president should have to go through it, Sean."

It says on the top of a FISA application, \"Verified.\" Not only was it not verified, it was unverifiable. And they were warned not to use it on numerous occasions, and definitively by January of 2017. They ignored her bought-and-paid-for dirty Russian, now debunked dossier. They ignored the biggest abuse-of-power corruption scandal in history, which then brings us to your comments yesterday about where we are. There's two issues that I would like to see, as somebody that is a talk show host.

I'd like to know -- I'd like to, number one, before any voting takes place, see you debate Joe Biden. You have invited him.

And I hope that they do it properly, because this is -- this affected -- this had to do with Obama and Biden, as well as Brennan and Comey and Clapper. And you go down to Page -- Lisa Page, and her lover, Peter Strzok, and McCabe. But you look at all of these people, and they're all implicated. Now we're going to find out. Let me tell you, the Democrats play a much dirtier game than the Republicans. And I say that in a very negative way. It's a disgrace. They play a much dirtier game. They will impeach you over a phone call that was perfect. Nothing like that has ever happened before. They impeached me over a phone call that was absolutely perfect. You couldn't have made a better phone call. There was nothing done wrong with that phone call. And they play a much dirtier game, a much tougher game than the Republicans. The Republicans, fortunately, much better policy, but they ought to get tougher. The Republicans have to get tougher. And this whole thing with this mail-in ballot, that's a rigged election waiting to happen. It's rigged, and everyone knows it, because you can't send out 60 million mail-in ballots to everybody in the -- who knows who's getting them? The mailmen are going to get them. And people are going to just grab batches of them. And you talk about China and Russia. They will be grabbing plenty of them. It's a -- it's a disaster. It's a rigged election waiting to happen. And it's just common sense. You wouldn't even have to know anything about politics or elections. It's common sense. And an absentee ballot is OK, where you send in for a ballot, they go through a process, and they send it to you, and then you send it. It's fine. But these mail-in ballots, where they send millions of them all over the country, it's a -- it's going to be a rigged election. And this country shouldn't allow it. The courts have to step in. We are in many different courts right now. If the courts don't step in, the federal courts, you will never know who won the election. Just like in New York, they had an election with Carolyn Maloney, a third- rate congresswoman that I have known for a long time, third-rate. Well, she won, but they have no idea where the ballots are. Where are the ballots? Many missing ballots. Her opponent is having a fit. But they declared that because it was so embarrassing. Then you look at Paterson, New Jersey. They declared her the winner because it was so embarrassing. You look at then Paterson, New Jersey. Look at what happened there. Look at what just happened in Virginia, where they sent in 500,000 applications. And they're -- most of them are to wrong people. They sent some to dogs. They sent two to cats. They sent people that are -- that passed away, dead people. They were sent to dead people, and 500,000 applications. This is crazy, what we are doing. And it's not a question of anything else. It can't work. It hasn't worked in little districts. Small, little defined districts, they can't do it. And it's an impossibility. Plus, the post office isn't set up for this. The post office is not set up for millions. When you look at what they did in Nevada, and take a look, where they are sending millions of ballots, and you don't have to have a confirmed signature, there is nothing to say that that person signed it. It's going to be catastrophic corruption."

The one thing they all have in common, they been run by liberal Democratic mayors for decades and liberal Democratic governors for decades. And now security and safety -- now, some people would argue, including me, that if you can't -- that is the number one job of government. We had a one-year-old child killed in a stroller in New York in a park, a beautiful seven-year-old girl killed in Chicago in her grandmother's backyard on Fourth of July weekend, an eight-year-old beautiful girl killed in Atlanta, when her mom made a wrong turn into the CHOP zone there. You watched my interview with Horace Lorenzo Anderson Sr. He lost his 19- year-old son in the \"Summer of Love\" zone, when the mayor out there allowed the anarchists to take over city blocks and police precincts. We now know about Kamala Harris' view. I mentioned it during my opening monologue. Joe did -- he's trying to walk it back -- say, the police, they have become the enemy. And he's all for reallocating funds away from the police. And Kamala Harris praised the LAPD for the cuts in that city, a billion cut in New York, and it's become a disaster. Your reaction to this whole defund the police effort madness that's going on in the country?"

And it's -- it's very sad. Now, we have talked to the governor. If you look at Oregon and you look at what's going on out there, we're willing to help. You know, we need -- they're supposed to call and say, please send help. But, honestly, they have 10,000 great law enforcement people there. Really, they can take care of it themselves. But we'd be glad to send in the National Guard and solve the problem, like we did in Minneapolis. We solved that problem in one hour after they arrived. We can do it in Portland so easy. We can do it in Chicago, a little more difficult. It's a different kind of a problem. One is anarchists, and the other are people that go around indiscriminately shooting everyone and themselves. But we can solve the problems, if they ask. They have to ask. We are ready, willing, and able. We went to Portland to save the courthouse, if you can believe it, an expensive courthouse, a beautiful courthouse. It was going to be destroyed. It was going to be set on fire. And the mayor wasn't saving it. And the governor of the state wasn't going to save it. So we sent Homeland Security, 300 people. And they -- it was very easy for them. They could've marched forward. They are not allowed to do that. They have very strong restrictions, unfortunately. And they were -- they surrounded it, and they protected it, and it's fine. And they are still there, by the way. You know, the mayor likes to say they're -- they are still there. They are to protect the courthouse. It's not for them to do anything beyond that. They are not allowed to. But we can have the National Guard go in and clean out Portland in a matter of hours, less than hours. But they have to ask us for that. And they don't want to ask. And it's not because they are too proud. It's because they truly don't have a clue as to what's happening."

And I will tell you, when you look at what we did with Tim Scott on Opportunity Zones, it's incredible, the jobs that we are producing for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans. But the jobs that we are producing -- Tim Scott is incredible. The jobs that we are producing, it was an idea that Tim had, and we took it. And we made it into an incredible thing, where jobs are being done. And areas that haven't been invested in, in decades are being brought back. It's an incredible thing to see. And we did these things. And Obama didn't do it. And this mostly helps the minority communities, the black community. It's incredible, what has happened. It's actually incredible, some of the things we have done. And we have tremendous African-American support. I will tell you that, Sean, tremendous. We have tremendous Hispanic support. And you know who likes the wall the best of all and who likes the border safety the best of all? The Hispanic, because they understand the border better than anybody. And they understand the bad people that can come in through the border. And they don't want them in our country.
