And what the companies need to do is to begin to rob and bar the extremists from having every sort of bells of and whistles to be able to be part of their deployment in a terrorist fashion. That's absolutely the minimum. Beyond that, they can do a lot to erode the marketing capabilities of the extremists. You know, the hate is not new.  Unfortunately, there are Americans now they're watching the ISIS approach online. They've absorbed some of those lessons. And that is I think one of the reasons why houses of worship are being targeted is there a more important fundamental right that we have to freedom of religion. So we need the companies who know how to put in those technological tripwires. We need them to be active. If we have to wait for Congress to get involved, it'll to be months or years. They don't even understand the technology. So I think that is job one. Secondly, our politicians, and I say from the top, our president, Nancy Pelosi, Democrats and Republicans. We have to stop weaponizing hate crimes and create a -- or rediscover the idea of bipartisanship. I was so glad that the president called the Rabbi, offered his condolences. He needs -- he will need to send the tweet through future victims no matter who the perpetrators are. And as far as Speaker Pelosi, she's still allowing an anti-Semite Congressman Omar to get away with it.

You have a Republican candidates like Donald Trump able to get into the industrial union. People who build things, people who manufacture things, people who construct things, people who protect things. President did quite well among that part of the union movement. The public service sector unions, however, not only are Democrat in the primaries, they tend to be very Democrat in the general elections. Now, the response of Biden is a very good general election to -- argument.  I'm the guy who's going to be middle class, and I'm going to stand for the firefighters and the construction workers and so forth. Kamala Harris's argument to get rid of right-to-work laws -- first of all, it ain't going to happen. Because a majority of states in the Union now have right-to- work laws, and there's no way that you're going to get 60 votes in the Senate to repeal those laws. And second of all, it right-to-work sounds good to a lot of people. And people don't want to be forced to join a union in order to get a job. They might like to join a union in order to get the benefits of union membership when they have a job. But they don't like being told, I can't have a job unless I join a union."

So, the president has to, and he's right to pay attention to it. Because Biden is -- you know, for all this awkwardness and his goofiness, and his familiarity, you know, he has grit. And you know, people are -- you know, they appreciate his sincerity while he's been through with his family. The fact that he was such a great wingman for Barack Obama.

A few things, one, the last time I was on with Karl, and you, Martha, collectively was midterm night, and there was a blue wave. And part of the blue wave also took part in governorships where we won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. So, there's no question that it's important that Joe is getting back to the Rust Belt to try to take back the blue wave. And I think, actually, speaking to Industrial America. You know, per what Geraldo said, and places like where Conor Lamb win is incredibly smart. We won 40-plus seats mainly in the moderate places during the midterm.  With respect to where Joe is today, he's in a great seat. Because he's checked what I would say those that spectrum of progressive boxes. Climate change, healthcare, gun reform, immigration reform, and now he has to show why he's someone that can be a commander in chief, and why he's going to be good on the economy? And I actually think it's a smart move.  And then, the last thing, where we as Democrats were nervous with Joe, is whether he could raise money and run a campaign. And I think, he certainly passed the first test because he raised north of $6 million. I think he was number one in that 24-hour period of the launch."

He followed -- they fired the as I recall the black police chief of South Bend under kind of shaky circumstances. He's not gotten any traction at all, and he's going to be facing this very formidable voting bloc in the -- in the primary campaign. That's why I think that Joe Biden is really the best hope. Bernie Sanders isn't going to get that vote. Joe Biden, in part because of the loyalty I spoke of earlier to Barack Obama, still has a tremendous magnetic attraction for the African-American community. I think he's got a good chance of landing a substantial portion. I would bet you that Biden would outpoll Cory Booker in the black community.  Because he's seen as more authentic. I think, with Biden is going to depend on whether or not his physical energy. He's going to be the oldest ever president if he wins, 78 years old. It does -- e have the energy to go head-to-head with the amazing Donald Trump with all of that bounding onto the stage and glad-handing, and high- fiving and all the rest of it.

But America has always been the land where people came to embrace religious freedom starting with the pilgrims. You could go into any house of worship and feel safe. But it now appears that those days are gone here as well. So how do we get them back? First, we will inevitably enter an era of armoring up houses of worship. Then, we have to ask ourselves how do we combat the hate that all these killers tap into online, the so-called alt-tech that spews hate towards Jews and the glorification of Islamic radicalism urging on terror.

      "utterance": "Right. Well, first of all, Martha, thanks for tackling this part of the issue. We've had too many of these moments where we stand in solidarity and light of candle. We also have to try to get practical. And we talk about social media that has provided a subculture of hate for extremists of all types including Islamists as well as people from white supremists, neo-Nazis, etcetera. It gives them a sense of validation, encouragement. Robert Bowers, the shooter, the mass murderer in Pittsburgh was actually on Gab communicating with his buddies when he finally said I'm going to go out and do the deed. The shooter in New Zealand was on vote. What we need to do first and foremost is to get the big players starting with Facebook, and YouTube, and Google, and Twitter and make sure that no future attack, god forbid, is ever broadcast live. Facebook told me that they removed 1.5 million postings of the mass murder of 50 Muslims. And what the companies need to do is to begin to rob and bar the extremists from having every sort of bells of and whistles to be able to be part of their deployment in a terrorist fashion. That's absolutely the minimum. Beyond that, they can do a lot to erode the marketing capabilities of the extremists. You know, the hate is not new.  Unfortunately, there are Americans now they're watching the ISIS approach online. They've absorbed some of those lessons. And that is I think one of the reasons why houses of worship are being targeted is there a more important fundamental right that we have to freedom of religion. So we need the companies who know how to put in those technological tripwires. We need them to be active. If we have to wait for Congress to get involved, it'll to be months or years. They don't even understand the technology. So I think that is job one. Secondly, our politicians, and I say from the top, our president, Nancy Pelosi, Democrats and Republicans. We have to stop weaponizing hate crimes and create a -- or rediscover the idea of bipartisanship. I was so glad that the president called the Rabbi, offered his condolences. He needs -- he will need to send the tweet through future victims no matter who the perpetrators are. And as far as Speaker Pelosi, she's still allowing an anti-Semite Congressman Omar to get away with it. So we need a level playing field.  We have to get our Congressional leaders back into leadership and away from politics in the fight against hatred or we're all in a lot of trouble."

So this is a growing problem. But the good news is we've seen the kind of response that is necessary to start squelching that kind of hatred. I love the fact that my community came together and remembered Matthew 5:44, the love your enemies and to pray for those who persecute you. But it brought in strength and a courage to confront some of the issues of polarization and hate in this country in a positive and powerful way. And I hope that we see more actions that are that positive confronting hatred. From my perspective, that's one of the best tools we have when the community at large stands together united and do what the president said at the Wisconsin rally which is he abhors that kind of hatred and stood strong and that was a positive moment for the entire country."

And now, I think it's tragic and an interesting on that level. That's what we're seeing happening on social media.

It can also be used as it was after the three church burnings in Louisiana as a powerful tool for good because of media, because of the technology of social media, we saw over $2 million raised in a few days to confront that awful atrocity in the state of Louisiana. So there is a double-edged sword when we think about social media and technology. We can't blame it in and of itself, but we have to recognize that it can be a tool on either side. So the question is how do we use that tool and we have to continue to force the conversation and all of our communities in at large around the use -- the use of technology and the use of community collaboration to push forward positive, powerful resources that can stand against hate."

Robert Mueller who is the special counsel. And then the next day, which is the way it's portrayed in the report, it just goes away. McGahn says I'm going to leave. I'm going to quit. His, you know, colleagues convinced him not to do that and then he never gets another phone call about it."

The theory is that you fire Comey to stop the Russian investigation. What do we know after the Mueller report? There was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. There is no underlying crime. What do we also know? That the Trump administration gave the special counsel a million documents, allowed people to testify, McGahn for 30 hours, and never claimed executive privilege. To the Sally Yates of the world this ridiculous absurd to charge this president with obstructing justice when there was no underlying crime to obstruct, and he cooperated fully with the special counsel. And finally, name one event that Donald Trump engaged in that impeded the Mueller investigation."

      "utterance": "Well, I think Bill Barr is required by law to receive the Mueller report and report to Congress. We will interview. We will question the attorney general. Each senator will get seven minutes. And if we need a second round, we'll have a short second round. I can understand his concern. What the House is doing is way over the top. Mueller is the final word on this. I fought like hell to make sure Mueller could do his job without interference. I introduced legislation so that he couldn't be fired without cause. And I've old everybody in the country if the president colluded with the Russians that would be horrible and terrible but I don't believe he did. And Mueller said he didn't. This is over. This is political revenge. The House is on a witch-hunt truly a witch-hunt to try to make something out of nothing. Mueller said to Barr, I can't decide about obstruction of justice and since there is no underlying crime it would be hard to prove intent. The president did nothing to impede Mueller, and if the House pursues this it's because they have gone crazy when it comes to Trump."

I'm grateful to you for the opportunity to serve for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations and for the goals you set in your inaugural address, patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity.\" And he goes on with more in the letter. I'm just curious what you think about that. You know, in light of Rod Rosenstein is such an interesting character in all of this when I think back to the whole, you know, I will wear a wire, I'll pick up some of what the president says in my next meeting."

There was no obstructions when it comes to President Trump. So, I think he served his country well. I think he served his country honorably. I do want to know why he signed the warrant, the FISA warrant application regarding the dossier that was used to get a warrant against Carter Page that's a bunch of garbage.
