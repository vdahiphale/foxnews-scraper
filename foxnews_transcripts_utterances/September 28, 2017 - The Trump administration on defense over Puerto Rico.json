      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "This is one of the major events that Donald Trump has been waiting that he pushed during the campaign. They did not succeed, as we all know, try as they did with respect to the Affordable Care Act. He promised a huge tax cut, one that would cause a sort of reshaping of the tax landscape. I was hoping for the postcard size tax return, and apparently that will be the case for many Americans but not for all of us. Do I like everything in there? No. Do I like the concept, the principle of a huge tax cut so as to regenerate the economy? Absolutely. Do I think it will pass? Yes. I think even my small government buddies in congress, particularly in the House who do not want to be the deficit increase will vote for this tax cut."

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "The problem with this is the whole discussion is hypothetical. If you listen to Gary Cohn today, he said we are going to cut middle-class taxes, although people were coming up with scenarios under the framework in which this or that middle class family would pay more in taxes."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Exactly. If you take the seven brackets down to three, where are the lines between those brackets? The child tax credit, how much is that going to be? He's going to have to come up with a lot more to satisfy a number of conservative Republicans who want to make up the gap and want it to be family friendly as. So the problem with this discussion now is everything is on the level of hypothetical."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And quickly, because I want to save it for Secretary Price's panel on the second panel here, but Amy, that is the question. We could see a lot of changes in this thing from the original rollout. The death tax could not be totally eliminated and perhaps, who knows, a one percent payroll tax cut, something could be put in there that hits the middle class more than it does now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALTER",
      "utterance": "And this is the other challenge which is what Republicans had going into the health care debate. There are mixed messages coming from Congress and from the president. Nobody really sold it. All the discussion was really process oriented and really focused on getting individual members to vote for it. Nobody sold it to the public. This is going to take an effort not just getting the votes but making the case that this is going to help regular people. And when it comes to taxes, people know it instantly, right. You're going to get your tax bill and you're going to know whether you got a cut or whether you got an increase. You can't just spin your way out of this. But being able to make that case, Democrats being against this are going to be unified in their message. They can be very disciplined on that. Can Republicans be disciplined in selling it?"
