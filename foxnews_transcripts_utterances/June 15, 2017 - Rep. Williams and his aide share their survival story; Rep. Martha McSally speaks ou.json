Each of those parties, political parties, obviously associated with the colors red and blue, but tonight there's a lot of purple and gold on the field. The Republicans and the Democrats wearing Louisiana State University colors on their uniforms, or on their hats to honor their colleague the Congressman Steve Scalise from Louisiana, who is it still 5 miles away tonight at Medstar Hospital where he still lay critically wounded. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } His condition has been described as complicated because Scalise needs operations to repair bone damage from the bullet that entered near his right hip, but the bullet also did damage to his internal organs. And those conditions must be addressed first because there has been a lot of internal bleeding that has required multiple blood transfusions. Two of the other gunshot victims from yesterday's ambush in Alexandria are still in the hospital tonight as well. The Capital Police officer, Crystal Greiner, who was shot in the ankle; and the Tyson Foods Lobbyist, Matt Mika, who was shot multiple times and is scheduled for more surgery tomorrow. And while they recover, the Fed are unearthing a lot of new evidence. The FBI said they have a laptop, phone, and camera belonging to the 66-year-old gunman who is now dead, and they spent a lot of time going through the white conversion van, they believe he's been living in since arriving in Alexandria in March. And say that the two weapons found with the gunmen, a handgun and a rifle, were legally purchased, but they're still working to trace the trajectory of his shots tonight at a ball field across the river that remains closed. This ballpark though, open, even though the Nationals are out of town, and there's so much interest in this red versus blue, Democrat versus Republican, lawmaker baseball game. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } 20,000 tickets have been sold, and more than a million dollars has been raised for charity. And to put that in the context, they've had this event and just about every year for the last 108 years. They know how many people they need to add to the nationals to set aside pit four, but today they had to call the ball club, the National League Ball Club, and say we need some more room, and the Nationals did accommodate them. And as for that million dollars, that is double what they raised so far and that's just the pre-game total, of course, the game hasn't even started yet.",

And they actually keep stats, and I went and checked Steve Scalise's stats today. And he's been one of their better players on the Republican team in recent years. He is used as a pinch runner a lot because of his speed. He scored four runs in seven seasons. That's a lot for some of these older lawmakers, you know, past their prime, but that's one of this bitter irony is about. Now, he's in the hospitals, as Peter said, five miles away, can't run. You know, he's been medicated. He's now gone through three operations. And I heard a little nugget from one of his Republican colleagues who told me that Steve Scalise's wife Jennifer and their two very young children were already planning, obviously, before the shooting to come to Washington because the kids wanted to cheer their dad on the ball field. And it breaks your heart to hear those kinds of details. But if there's anything good that comes out of this, as what Peter is reporting, about 20,000 people that maybe here.

You know, the big thing that we've all talked about a lot since this happened yesterday morning, Ed, and what a shock it was to everybody, obviously.

You don't have people blaming Bernie Sanders just because this man, the shooter who was now dead volunteered for Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless, the New York Times decided, let's go after Sarah Palin with this debunked theory. Here's what they put in the editorial, in 2011, when Jerry Lee Lochner open fire in a supermarket parking grievously wounding representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin packs circuited a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under the crosshairs. Now, there's one problem, there's zero evidence that Lochner, the shooter in that case, was actually inspired to do any of that shooting, any of that carnage by Sarah Palin, so now a correction from the Times. An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitements in the 2011 shooting of Gabby Giffords, in fact, no such link was established. The editorial has been updated to clarify that in the map distributed by a PAC before that shooting, electoral districts, not Democratic lawmakers weren't depicted beneath stylized process. So here in the New York Times that it's always so high and mighty about the separation, church and state, between news and editorial, and then basically just getting the facts completely wrong in this editorial, and smearing a Republican in Sarah Palin at a time when it was actually a Democrat, basically, who went after the Republicans. And you don't hear a lot of people blaming Bernie Sanders today, but the Times decided let's go back to 2011, and let's blame Sarah Palin. It's remarkable.",

A lot of excitement going on here at Nationals Park as we -- I can't see the score, can anyone see the score from where you are? We're going to get to the score in just a moment. Let me see if I can turn around and take a look. It's 2-0, the Republicans are winning. Did you know that it's 39 to 39. So in the history of this game being played, Republicans have won 39 times, and the Democrats have won 39 times. So tonight is a very exciting, separate even from all of the very serious reasons that we're gathered here tonight, in these large numbers. This is going to be a tiebreaker because it's 39 to 39. And I think they tied once in the history of this game. So we also want to bring in some other friends who are joining us this evening, as we move forward here. And you all have been following the story, of course, of the special counsel Robert Mueller who is reportedly widening his Russia investigation to include possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. The president firing back on twitter saying this, they made up a phony collusion with the Russian story, found zero proof. So now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice, he ends it. Here now is Karl Rove, the former senior advisor to President George W. Bush, and Zac Petkanas, a Democratic strategist and former senior DNC advisor. Gentlemen, we're playing ball as the president said just moments ago. And so we're going to let you play some ball over this issue. Let me bring in Karl first on this, the news broke last night -- and it really wasn't that surprising in some ways, Karl. Everyone likes Karl Rove a lot. They're cheering wildly as you can tell. But the news broke last night that there is this continuing investigation. Something very big is happening on the field right now -- looks like a home run. Big play. Is it a home run? Oh, he's on third. I think he's on third. So Karl, What do you make of this news that the obstruction of justice investigation is going forward.",

He has unlimited power to order the end of any investigation. As a former DOJ officials said to me, if John F. Kennedy told J. Edgar Hoover to stop investigating and wiretapping Martin Luther King, would that have made him guilty of obstruction of justice? No it wouldn't. He has the authority. He pays a political price if he does it, but he has a legal authority to do it. And not only that, but he didn't do it. He said I hope you let him go. Hope is not the same as a demand or an order. And not only that, but the statute, and anybody can Google this, 18 USC 15.05, section 15.05, says that in order to have obstruction, you have to act in a corrupt manner. That would mean that there have to be something the president was trying to hide that personally benefited him. He got part of Michael Flynn's fees from Russia today for attending the dinner from the Turkish businessmen from lobbying on their behalf, or some other extremely weird thing that's just not going to happen.

In terms of what Karl said about that he just said he hoped that James Comey does something, that's simply nonsense as well because he actually took action, he fired James Comey. I don't understand the pushback from the White House when he says that they didn't actually do anything because they actually did something to impede the investigation.

Each of those parties, political parties, obviously associated with the colors red and blue, but tonight there's a lot of purple and gold on the field. The Republicans and the Democrats wearing Louisiana State University colors on their uniforms, or on their hats to honor their colleague the Congressman Steve Scalise from Louisiana, who is it still 5 miles away tonight at Medstar Hospital where he still lay critically wounded. His condition has been described as complicated because Scalise needs operations to repair bone damage from the bullet that entered near his right hip, but the bullet also did damage to his internal organs. And those conditions must be addressed first because there has been a lot of internal bleeding that has required multiple blood transfusions. Two of the other gunshot victims from yesterday's ambush in Alexandria are still in the hospital tonight as well. The Capital Police officer, Crystal Greiner, who was shot in the ankle; and the Tyson Foods Lobbyist, Matt Mika, who was shot multiple times and is scheduled for more surgery tomorrow. And while they recover, the Fed are unearthing a lot of new evidence. The FBI said they have a laptop, phone, and camera belonging to the 66-year-old gunman who is now dead, and they spent a lot of time going through the white conversion van, they believe he's been living in since arriving in Alexandria in March. And say that the two weapons found with the gunmen, a handgun and a rifle, were legally purchased, but they're still working to trace the trajectory of his shots tonight at a ball field across the river that remains closed. This ballpark though, open, even though the Nationals are out of town, and there's so much interest in this red versus blue, Democrat versus Republican, lawmaker baseball game. 20,000 tickets have been sold, and more than a million dollars has been raised for charity. And to put that in the context, they've had this event and just about every year for the last 108 years. They know how many people they need to add to the nationals to set aside pit four, but today they had to call the ball club, the National League Ball Club, and say we need some more room, and the Nationals did accommodate them. And as for that million dollars, that is double what they raised so far and that's just the pre-game total, of course, the game hasn't even started yet."

He is used as a pinch runner a lot because of his speed. He scored four runs in seven seasons. That's a lot for some of these older lawmakers, you know, past their prime, but that's one of this bitter irony is about. Now, he's in the hospitals, as Peter said, five miles away, can't run. You know, he's been medicated. He's now gone through three operations. And I heard a little nugget from one of his Republican colleagues who told me that Steve Scalise's wife Jennifer and their two very young children were already planning, obviously, before the shooting to come to Washington because the kids wanted to cheer their dad on the ball field. And it breaks your heart to hear those kinds of details. But if there's anything good that comes out of this, as what Peter is reporting, about 20,000 people that maybe here.

And you know, when you hear that video from yesterday, how awful was the 50, 60 shots going off. And the accounts of lawmakers who said, Steve Scalise was crawling from second base to the outfield to try to not get shot again.

Gentlemen, thank you so much. It is a beautiful night out here. Congressman Williams, let me start with you. When you look at where you were yesterday, and you think about where you woke up this morning and got in here tonight, what's it like 24 hours later as you look back on what happened?"

But we literally thanked the Capital Police, we've saved 25 Congressman and some staff members. It was a moment that we all have our story. Zach has his story; I have mine. But we can't give enough praise to the Capital Police that, literally, saved a massacre that would've happened yesterday."

      "utterance": "You know it was a harrowing moment from the beginning; I was out in center field shagging fly balls when the shooting started. You know, time kind of stood still after the first crack of the rifle, and somebody said run. And I ran as far away from the shooter as I could. Ran to the right field, you know, corner right field, got down to the ground, there was nowhere for me to go. Then he turned his sights to me and started shooting at me, everything started popping around me. I got struck in the leg, and at that point, I decided I wasn't going to be a sitting duck for this guy. I needed to get out of there, so I ran down the first base line, jumped in the dugout and that's where I met up with Congressman Williams, we grabbed each other. You know, it was very - you know, there's a lot going on, very stressful. But in that moment, we knew that the Capital Policemen were there, you know. Agents Greiner and Bailey, they were protecting us. And it was scary, it lasted for about ten minutes, we prayed to God, and we had each other and we were just trying to stay alive."

I think we work hard in Congress across the country and dialing down the rhetoric that we sometimes have. And I hope this game, which had to be played tonight, will begin that process of bipartisanship, loving our country, and agreeing to disagree in the proper way.

We have to remember that and stay true to that. We can have sincerely held disagreements; we can have rigorous debates which we should, but we can still honor each other and maybe listen and maybe learn something from each other.

And one of the stories out there tonight is the New York Times that is now backtracking a bit after publishing a debunked conspiracy theory as fact in an editorial piece called America's lethal politics. They falsely linked Sarah Palin to the 2011's assassination attempt of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Chief national correspondent Ed Henry with me throughout the course of this here tonight, has been looking into this story. This was an egregious error."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yeah, because think about the context, you're talking about a situation where a Republican lawmaker and other Republicans were targeted by a left-wing activist, basically, who said he wanted to go after Republicans based on his Facebook posts and whatnot. You don't have people blaming Bernie Sanders just because this man, the shooter who was now dead volunteered for Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless, the New York Times decided, let's go after Sarah Palin with this debunked theory. Here's what they put in the editorial, in 2011, when Jerry Lee Lochner open fire in a supermarket parking grievously wounding representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin packs circuited a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under the crosshairs. Now, there's one problem, there's zero evidence that Lochner, the shooter in that case, was actually inspired to do any of that shooting, any of that carnage by Sarah Palin, so now a correction from the Times. An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitements in the 2011 shooting of Gabby Giffords, in fact, no such link was established. The editorial has been updated to clarify that in the map distributed by a PAC before that shooting, electoral districts, not Democratic lawmakers weren't depicted beneath stylized process. So here in the New York Times that it's always so high and mighty about the separation, church and state, between news and editorial, and then basically just getting the facts completely wrong in this editorial, and smearing a Republican in Sarah Palin at a time when it was actually a Democrat, basically, who went after the Republicans. And you don't hear a lot of people blaming Bernie Sanders today, but the Times decided let's go back to 2011, and let's blame Sarah Palin. It's remarkable."

Bill, a lot -- juxtaposed this evening, were looking at this great shot as they begin this baseball game tonight, and we're just talking about that story of the New York Times which they corrected. But the one line that they added really undercuts the meaning of the entire editorial.

This was a very moving moment with Officer Bailey out there. This is the way America works through things, this amazing country. I was thinking of a line from Virgil, here's two things mortals touch the mind, and there are tears for passing things, here to the honorable finds its due. And you heard of the cheers for the honorable Bailey and Griner. There is something to celebrate here. But look, divisiveness will go on, bitterness will go on, anger will go on. I have a couple of ideas that I think we could use moving forward. Could we start, Martha, at the outer edge and say no more death threats. No more representations of the deaths of your political enemies or your political opposition. Martha McSally is exactly right, these are not our enemies. This is the opposition. Our enemies are ISIS and al Qaeda. But no more death threats, no more holding heads, no more putting the president in the role of Julius Caesar being assassinated, no more blowing of talk about blowing up the White House. Let's all agree to that. Second, maybe as it's against the law to threaten the lives of the president, it should be against the law to threaten the lives of any public official. Can we just start at that point and then see if we can work our way back to greater stability."

      "utterance": "Well, on Tuesday, the president is going to sign this bill, and we've been working hard. And, you know, what you see here tonight is really what you're seeing in congress. When it comes to our veterans, there aren't Democrats or Republicans. This is really a bipartisan issue. And so, we saw both the senate and the house work hard to pass the accountability bill, and the president is really excited to sign this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, you worked in a prior administration, and I remember the prior head of Veterans Affairs complaining in front of congress, he said, I know that these things are happening in hospitals, but I don't have the authority to fire anybody. Why would the entire administration not want to give him the right to do that? It makes no sense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHULKIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't really understand why it's so different now. But, you know, the president is so committed getting this fixed. And I think people have just been fed up not seeing our veterans get the right type of services they need. And now, everybody is rolling in the same direction and everyone wants to see this fixed and that's certainly why I'm here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So how soon after he signs that bill do you expect to start the see some of the dead wood cleared out from these hospitals and the people who are involved in them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHULKIN",
      "utterance": "Well, we're going to be making decisions immediately after he signs this bill. And it's going to be clear to everybody who works in the V.A. that it's a privilege to be there, and that we only want people who are really there for the right reasons."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "In terms of another part of the bill that would have cut funding for some of the older veterans. Now, obviously, you want to trim where you can, but you kind of got pushed back on that and changed their mind. Tell everybody what happened with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHULKIN",
      "utterance": "Well, we've proposed a budget which is a great budget for veterans, it really showed the president -- more money in almost all areas for veterans care. But we look at areas that we think all programs can be improved. And when we took a hard look at it and the president was supportive of this, this proposal that we made was going to hurt too many veterans, it was going to take away money from those who couldn't afforded it, so now we're back looking at different ways that we can make this budget work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So I know that older veterans were very concerned about changing that program which would have given them more money because they -- people who can't look for a job for whatever reason. Is it possible that you would reintroduce that for veterans down the road, in the future, not one's who are benefiting from that now, but change it for future generations?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHULKIN",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I do think that there are possibilities that we're looking at. We're going to work with congress to make this work. But if we will designed a new program, I'm not sure we would do it exactly like what we had the program in place right now, but we don't want to be withdrawing benefits from veterans who are relying on it. And we don't want to do anything that will hurt our current veterans. But I think looking at how can we make it work better in the future. That is a responsibility that we have."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Have you made it easier for veterans to -- if they're on a waiting list, that they're not getting the care they need to go to a private provider?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHULKIN",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. We're doing several things. First of all, we're publishing all of our wait time, so for the first time, veterans can see. But we're also making it easier for them to get into the private sector because we don't want veterans waiting for care."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Thank you very much, David Shulkin joining us tonight as we watch the game below us. A lot of excitement going on here at Nationals Park as we -- I can't see the score, can anyone see the score from where you are? We're going to get to the score in just a moment. Let me see if I can turn around and take a look. It's 2-0, the Republicans are winning. Did you know that it's 39 to 39. So in the history of this game being played, Republicans have won 39 times, and the Democrats have won 39 times. So tonight is a very exciting, separate even from all of the very serious reasons that we're gathered here tonight, in these large numbers. This is going to be a tiebreaker because it's 39 to 39. And I think they tied once in the history of this game. So we also want to bring in some other friends who are joining us this evening, as we move forward here. And you all have been following the story, of course, of the special counsel Robert Mueller who is reportedly widening his Russia investigation to include possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. The president firing back on twitter saying this, they made up a phony collusion with the Russian story, found zero proof. So now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice, he ends it. Here now is Karl Rove, the former senior advisor to President George W. Bush, and Zac Petkanas, a Democratic strategist and former senior DNC advisor. Gentlemen, we're playing ball as the president said just moments ago. And so we're going to let you play some ball over this issue. Let me bring in Karl first on this, the news broke last night -- and it really wasn't that surprising in some ways, Karl. Everyone likes Karl Rove a lot. They're cheering wildly as you can tell. But the news broke last night that there is this continuing investigation. Something very big is happening on the field right now -- looks like a home run. Big play. Is it a home run? Oh, he's on third. I think he's on third. So Karl, What do you make of this news that the obstruction of justice investigation is going forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH",
      "utterance": "Look, I think it's highly unlikely it's going to result in anything. The president is the head of the executive branch. He has unlimited power to order the end of any investigation. As a former DOJ officials said to me, if John F. Kennedy told J. Edgar Hoover to stop investigating and wiretapping Martin Luther King, would that have made him guilty of obstruction of justice? No it wouldn't. He has the authority. He pays a political price if he does it, but he has a legal authority to do it. And not only that, but he didn't do it. He said I hope you let him go. Hope is not the same as a demand or an order. And not only that, but the statute, and anybody can Google this, 18 USC 15.05, section 15.05, says that in order to have obstruction, you have to act in a corrupt manner. That would mean that there have to be something the president was trying to hide that personally benefited him. He got part of Michael Flynn's fees from Russia today for attending the dinner from the Turkish businessmen from lobbying on their behalf, or some other extremely weird thing that's just not going to happen. I think this is Performa. I think that having raised the issue, they're going to now just sort of run through it with the three principal people who the president was supposed to talk to besides James Comey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Zac, let me bring you in here, what you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZAC PETKANAS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Sure. What he said is absolute nonsense. I mean just to use his own analogy that we're talking about Martin Luther King Jr. being in our investigation. The only way it would make sense is if Martin Luther King Jr. was a member of Donald Trump's -- JFK's aides, or was one of his top aides and then he called off the investigation. In terms of what Karl said about that he just said he hoped that James Comey does something, that's simply nonsense as well because he actually took action, he fired James Comey. I don't understand the pushback from the White House when he says that they didn't actually do anything because they actually did something to impede the investigation. He fired the FBI director, and then he said very plainly not once but twice, the reason why he did it was because of the Russian investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Karl, you want to push back on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Look, first of all, to say this, nonsense that the president the United States is the head of the executive branch with the ability to order this is to ignore the constitution of the United States. I recommend my Democrat friend here go read the constitution. And, yes, if John F. Kennedy ordered the end of an investigation is that somehow different than President Trump if he ordered the end of an investigation? No it's not. And the fact of the matter is the statute requires corrupt activity, corrupt behavior, corrupt conduct, and you can call that phony all you like but it's written in black and white of the U.S. code 18 USC 15.05. Google it when we finish having this fun exchange."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Gentlemen, thank you very much. Karl Rove and Zac Petkanas, the argument over obstruction of justice is going to take on a bit of a life of its own in the coming days as those interviews take place, and Robert Mueller will do that as special counsel. But tonight, we are watching this baseball game, and America's leaders taking part in one of America's great pastimes, just 36 hours after the tragedy struck on the baseball field as they practice. Our quote of the night comes from the house chaplain, Father Pat Conroy, and the prayer that he gave to congress and the members who you see on the fields today this morning. Watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAT CONROY, HOUSE CHAPLAIN",
      "utterance": "We pause to thank you for the courage and sacrificial service of our capital police. Forgive us when we take their daily courageous service for granted. Forgive us also when we seem to forget that words matter and can become seeds that will bring a bitter harvest. Bring speedy healing to our brother Steve Scalise and all those injured in yesterday's shooting. Bring peace and solace to all those affected by yesterday's tragedy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "An amazing combination that we have seen of how this country pulls together in difficult times. We all woke up yesterday morning to the shocking news that a gunman had taken down a member of congress, another person who worked on the hill, and had also hit two Capitol Hill police officers who valiant in their duty took that shooter down and protected so many others who were huddled nearby as they tried to hide from that shooter's wrath. Tonight is special, it is about to baseball, it is about unity, it's about what makes America great. We are so proud to be witnessing what we have seen here tonight on this baseball field, and to have heard from President Trump his words of bringing people together of thinking about what matters. We thank you so much for being with us tonight at Nationals Park on this beautiful summer evening as we celebrate what's good. END Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.
