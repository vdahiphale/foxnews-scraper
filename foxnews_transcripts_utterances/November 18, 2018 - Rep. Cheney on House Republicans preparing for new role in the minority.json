I will be talking to Senator Roy Blunt this morning, the next chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee -- his party's priorities, the new role as the fourth ranking Senate Republican.

Secondly, I would say we, as Republicans, have got to do a better job at making sure that our message is getting out there. For women, the extent to which economic growth matters, the extent to which national security matters, the extent to which we have got to make sure people understand that the Democrats were lying when they said we're going to take away coverage for preexisting conditions, all of those things are very important.

You get a little more flexibility to maybe stretch a little bit more on someone that couldn't be appointed if it took absolutely every Republican, but could be if it took almost all the Republicans. So we will see. We have made great impact on the judiciary branch, not just the two Supreme Court seats, but one out of six of the Court of Appeals judges are now people who've been nominated by President Trump, confirmed by the Republican Senate. We're going to continue this year, between now and December 31, to try to clean -- to clear the calendar of those judges and others who are out of committee, and then to try to give the president the team that he needs to implement what he was elected to do.

If that's -- if that's the way people want it in America -- I don't think that is, but, clearly, that's what the Democrats think it should be.",

We will be speaking with two of them straight ahead, as one of the biggest questions looms. Where can Republicans and Democrats find common ground? Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. This is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The midterms end with more women than ever before coming to power in the House. My next guest is a rising star and will be the third most powerful Republican in the House next year. Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney will join me exclusively to talk about the midterms, her new role in the leadership, and how today's GOP is different than her party when her father helped lead it. In the Senate, Republicans are forging ahead after -- with judicial nominees and the next round of spending bills. I will be talking to Senator Roy Blunt this morning, the next chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee -- his party's priorities, the new role as the fourth ranking Senate Republican. And we have been following this story closely on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" from the beginning, investigations into misconduct at the top levels of the FBI and the DOJ leading up to the 2016 election. The chairman of the House Intel Committee, Congressman Devin Nunes, is here. He has been spearheading those investigations. He will join me next to discuss what happens to those probes now that the Democrats have taken over the House. All that, plus reaction from our panel, as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And we begin this morning with House Republicans preparing for their new role in the minority, looking for potential common ground with Democrats. Joining me right now in an exclusive interview, someone who will have a leading role in that process, Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney. She's been elected as the incoming House Republican Conference chair. That is the number three leadership position for House Republicans. And, Congresswoman, it's good to see you this morning.

And we have got to make sure that we do everything necessary to prevent the Democrats from reversing course on that. They have made clear that's what they want to do. We have got to, as Republicans in the House, work with the White House, work with our colleagues in the Senate to make sure that doesn't happen. And we have got to take back the majority in 2020.

And Nancy Pelosi obviously, as the leader of the Democrats, is somebody who's in a position who's going to -- has said that she will try to put in place the kind of legislation we know is bad for the country. If you look at the wave of young Democrats, women, many of them who've come in, in this freshman class, a lot of them are socialists.

And you see it in the people that are likely to be their presidential candidates as well. So I think the Democrats are going through a very challenging time.

When you have got the Democrats protesting in each other's offices because you have got some on their side who think we should eliminate all fossil fuels in 10 years, that's just -- it's a recipe for disaster. And so we won't be part of that. We won't be party to it. We're going to fight every day to make sure that we preserve the tremendous momentum we have seen. And the Democrats have a challenge, because the results are there. As I said, President Trump's deregulation, the work we have done in Congress on that, the tax cuts, we have got historically low unemployment across the board, historic job growth and economic growth.

There's a lot of conversation about the suburban woman not supporting the GOP right now.

A lot of what we saw on these midterms was massive amounts of money coming in, billionaires putting money in on the Democratic side and, frankly, Nancy Pelosi targeting Republican women. So, when you have a situation where you have got somebody on the other side of the aisle saying that she stands for all women, but we very clearly saw her go after our Republican women -- and I think that it's going to be very important for us make sure that we get those seats back. We have got a great opportunity to get them back. And I intend to do that."

You have already seen it. We talked about some of it. So, number one, I think that the -- what they're going to have to do to appeal to the socialist wing of their party will really help make clear the choice that people have. Secondly, I would say we, as Republicans, have got to do a better job at making sure that our message is getting out there. For women, the extent to which economic growth matters, the extent to which national security matters, the extent to which we have got to make sure people understand that the Democrats were lying when they said we're going to take away coverage for preexisting conditions, all of those things are very important. But we can't segment women into thinking they only care about women's issues."

We do have a number of other appropriations bills that we will have to address and deal with before December 7. But, on defense spending and on defense appropriations, that is absolutely something we have got to make sure -- the president has made the investment with -- Congress has appropriated money to begin to rebuild our military.  But we are -- have been in such a whole after the Obama administration. It is going to take multiple years to be able to do that effectively. And we simply cannot allow the Democrats to turn back on that. Our adversaries are in a position now where they are deploying weapon systems we simply can't defend against in too many instances.

From my home state of Wyoming, deregulation has been tremendous, in terms of what we have been able to accomplish with revenue from oil and gas leases on public lands, our coal industry, our energy industry. So, we're going to have to work very hard to make sure that business -- that the engine of growth in this economy, our small businesses, continue to know that they have got the support of certainly the Republicans in Washington, and that we're going to -- we're going to block the Democrats from being able to reverse course on that."

And so the fact that the House has changed control really has no impact on that. What has an impact on that is, it looks like they're going to be 53 Republicans in the Senate, instead of 51. And you can do a lot more with 53 than 51. You get a little more flexibility to maybe stretch a little bit more on someone that couldn't be appointed if it took absolutely every Republican, but could be if it took almost all the Republicans. So we will see. We have made great impact on the judiciary branch, not just the two Supreme Court seats, but one out of six of the Court of Appeals judges are now people who've been nominated by President Trump, confirmed by the Republican Senate. We're going to continue this year, between now and December 31, to try to clean -- to clear the calendar of those judges and others who are out of committee, and then to try to give the president the team that he needs to implement what he was elected to do. It's been one of the big obstacles that Democrats in the Senate have thrown in the -- in the -- in our way, something that that's never happened before, the denial of a president to have his team. And they have effectively used every tool they had to slow that process down."

Let's not stop and have to start again. And the legislation that Senator Flake would like to see voted on would have to be signed by the president. And it is clearly not going to happen.  And why we would use up that time, when we could be making these kind of lifetime changes in the judiciary, is amazing to me. I think we're still going to figure out a way to do that, and we need to be forward. I think, Maria, on the Mueller dismissal side of the -- of the discussion, there's a huge constitutional reason not to believe that the Congress can decide who works in the judiciary branch. So, along with many others, I have said repeatedly, Mr. President, it would be a big mistake to not let this investigation go forward. But I'm not going to be for any legislation..."

Look at Claire McCaskill in your state losing to Josh Hawley and basically saying, look, I'm not a crazy Democrat, and calling out her colleagues for going so left.

But it was with a backdrop of a state where the president is probably as popular as he is anywhere ,his approval ratings much higher in Missouri on Election Day this time than they were when he was elected president in 2016. And his efforts for Attorney General Hawley, his efforts in Senate races around the country exceeded anything that I think any president has ever done as a campaign or for a ticket that their name wasn't on. And it made a difference in Missouri. It made a difference in these other states as well. It's one of the reasons that, while we lost seats in the House, our margin in the Senate is going to go up.

Probably, the best thing Democrats could do in the House would be legislate, rather than investigate. But if they investigate, they're going to have an active participant talking about how those -- those investigations are being conducted in the White House, and that participant is going to be the president of the United States."

And that only happens by making sure that you allow cattle to graze on the grazing land again and you remove timber that's fallen."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Right. Understood. Let me move on, Congressman, and ask you about your investigation. We have been with you for the entire year following your moves from the Intel Committee in terms of investigating the FBI and the DOJ and this number of people, the small number of people at the top of those agencies, who tried to stop Donald Trump and exonerate Hillary Clinton, as you have said many times on this program. Now you have got the Democrats holding the majority in the new Congress in January. What will happen to your investigation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, we largely are done. So, a lot of people don't understand that, but we -- we finished our investigation. So, we have three buckets of information that we want declassified. We now have a fourth bucket that we want declassified. The president has called for three of those four to be declassified. We sent a list of about 40 names to our Russia task force that Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman Gowdy are heading up. Likely, they're not going to get through those names, because they just haven't had -- haven't had enough time. But, look, this begs an investigation by the Department of Justice. So either the Department of Justice, under new leadership, can actually go in and investigate these cast of dirty cops, is really what they were, and their connections to the Russians and their connections to the Clinton campaign. Either it's a special counsel or the DOJ has to do that. Now, that's the way that this is going to be solved, because our committee -- and I'm very proud of the work we have done. We unearthed all of this information. The American people now know that the Trump campaign was unmasking American citizens. They know that -- that many of the Trump campaign -- campaign people were targeted. They know that they used a dossier that was paid for by the Clinton campaign to go after and use it in a FISA warrant against the campaign. So, we're really proud of what we have done. And we want the American people to see these -- these four buckets of information that need to be declassified."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, let's go through that, because you're now giving us new information on this fourth bucket. But you want to see the last FISA renewal, which was signed by Rod Rosenstein. You want to see Bruce Ohr reports, which are the e-mails that you want to see from Bruce Ohr and his wife and others. And you want to see the exculpatory evidence that wasn't presented to the FISA court, in other words, evidence that would say there was no collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians. But that actually wasn't presented to the FISA court. What is this fourth bucket? And am I right about the first three?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Yes, so the first three, you're right on. We have been calling for those for many months. The president actually directed them to be done. And then you had Rod Rosenstein, who convened a meeting to stop that and get that kicked to the I.G. But that's not a workable solution. We have let the White House know that. That's not going to work. That will -- that will just bury this, and none of it will ever be declassified. The new fourth bucket that we're asking actually to be declassified now is, for months, we have been reviewing e-mails between FBI and DOJ and others that clearly show that they knew about information that should have been presented to the FISA court. So, it is real evidence that people within the FBI withheld evidence from the FISA court."

      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes. So, look, they have been in denial for a long time. Their party was colluding directly with the Russians. Their entire party and the Clinton campaign should be investigated, because, if you're going to investigate -- if you're going to open up a secret investigation on the Trump campaign, when you had no evidence into them colluding with the Russians, when you -- in fact, the FBI used the evidence that the Clinton campaign paid for that was coming directly from Russians. So, the very thing Trump's being -- Trump campaign was investigated for, they did. So I assume maybe there is no FISA abuse in their own mind because they think it's OK. They think, as long as the Democrats are the ones that are using secret courts to spy on their political opponents, then it's OK. If that's -- if that's the way people want it in America -- I don't think that is, but, clearly, that's what the Democrats think it should be."

So, at the first open hearing we're going to have, I'm looking forward to them finally releasing this information, because we know that the only thing that hasn't leaked is this information about the Trump campaign colluding with Russians. So they have promised it. They now have the majority. So, finally, maybe now they will present their evidence."

There's so many Americans out there whose minds have been poisoned, who believe that the Trump campaign actually did collude with the Russians, because they have had dishonest politicians saying such. Now, look, they weaponized this. They used it for crowdfunding, where you had all of these millions of Americans who sent money all over the country to districts they didn't even live in to actually attack Republicans."

But real quick, my final question here, Congressman, is Rod Rosenstein. You had an opportunity to interview him. And now you're not. If you don't interview him in the next five weeks, you're not going to interview him. Shouldn't you have done that interview, so that the American people could have actually seen what took place and got answers from him?"

      "speaker": "NUNES",

So, Rod Rosenstein, as the deputy attorney general, doesn't get to dictate to Congress what or -- what or how an interview will be conducted. So it's a lot like James Comey wanting to do one in public. Rosenstein wants to do one in public. Look, this is -- this is all a scheme for them to hide from answering the tough questions."

      "utterance": "\"Hillary will run again, reinventing herself as a liberal firebrand. Mrs. Clinton will easily capture the 2020 nomination.\" This is from The Wall Street Journal on November 11. Mark, I know that you used to work with Hillary. And I know that, over the last two years, you have been critical of some of her behavior. But this article saying Hillary will run again, are you taunting her? What was the point in writing this?"

    {
      "speaker": "MARK PENN, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, I was really stating the obvious -- it caused quite a stir -- which -- which is that she has a 75 percent rating among Democrats. And if there's no front-runner come October in the Democratic primary -- and there may well be no front-runner -- I think there's a pretty high probability she will jump back in, and if she does, even win the nomination again, and redo history in a very dramatic way. So I'm just painting kind of what I really think is a reasonable scenario here, given the fact that there is no front-runner and how poorly Democrats did in those hearings with Kavanaugh."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And this sort of underlines what's going on within the Democratic Party right now, doesn't it, Lee? Because the fact is, you have got Alexandria Cortez coming out -- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez coming out and saying, look, moderate Democrats, we're gunning for you. We're coming. We want more progressives. And we want things like Medicare for all and abolish ICE and all of these far left proposals."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Yes, and let's just not forget that the primaries are really about getting people who are registered voters to the polls. And so when you have got people who are on the extreme, either right or left, they do generally do better in the primaries, because that's who goes and votes."

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "So, it's not all that surprising that we're seeing on the left people going a little bit further left and seeing some of these ideas. What I'm thankful for is that we're actually seeing people put ideas forward, rather than just talking about resist, resist, resist."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes, but these ideas, Mark Penn, real quick, this flies in the face of what the Democrats want to be. I mean, the moderates in the party don't know what their party is anymore."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, a lot of attention has been given to the left, but it was the moderate candidates who pulled through. And it's the moderate Problem Solvers Caucus that is demanding a rules change from Pelosi, waiting for a reply. And they're the ones who are really going to determine which legislation gets passed and doesn't."
