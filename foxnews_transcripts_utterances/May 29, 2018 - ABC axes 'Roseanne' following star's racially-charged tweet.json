      "sentences": "Well, she's incorrect on that point because well before Donald Trump was in office or even entertaining the presidency, Roseanne was always saying, absolutely, that poop crazy stuff. And we knew that. We've talked about this on the show even when her show came out that she said some completely crazy stuff, but maybe she changed and the show seems refreshing. And this is a new start and -- not the case. A lot of people are saying this is a freedom of speech issue, not really because freedom of speech in a place of work has consequences. We've talked about this with the NFL, saying like the NFL can make their own rules. So, if you're going to do something objectionable like what Roseanne did at a place of work, ABC is every bit right, as Fox News would be, if any of us had done something as absurd and ridiculous and hateful as that. But, I do think it's incorrect to broadly blame a political party or a politician over this. It's not that, it's the individual. The other point to make is that twitter can ruin a career faster than a string of felonies. It really is. I said earlier on your show, it's like -- it's used to be the office Christmas party that would get you fired. Now, you could just cut to the chase, you can just go on twitter, wasted or not, and just think, and think that, like, oh, you know what, this can't hurt. I'll just say this. And the next day, the company cuts you because they have to, as you've said it's part of the deal of the job. Just one last thing to just reiterate what I've said on your show, comedians have a flaw within them and it is the desire to jump off cliffs. People become comedians for that reason, to jump off cliffs. When they get on a stage, when they're saying that thing, it's to jump off -- it's to see what happens, and this is what happens sometimes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Now a man from the stands, he got up from his seat, and he stood next to the young cadet with an umbrella to shield him from the rain. Suntrust Park Memorial is an unoccupied seat, and it is dedicated, in fact, to the memory of the brave men and women who sacrificed so much and served this country. And it's interesting, because people were trying to figure out who this person is that engaged in this random act of kindness. I love this.",

It's 5 o'clock in New York, and this is \"The Five.\" Stunning developments as Roseanne gets axed by ABC. The show's star igniting a firestorm after tweeting this racially charged comment about President Obama's former aide Valerie Jarrett, Muslim brotherhood and Planet of the Apes had a baby equals V.J. The comedian later expressed remorse after facing intense backlash tweeting, I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me my joke was in bad taste. As a result of the uproar, ABC pulling the plug on the wildly popular Roseanne by releasing this statement, Roseanne's twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values and we have decided to cancel her show. Here's Valerie Jarrett's reaction."

And as -- taught me you have to be -- people on the inside have to push hard and people on the outside have to listen."

So, you've had, probably, hundreds of people who will never be seen on the program, but they're the ones doing all the work on the background, all the marketing, all the people running to get coffee, the wardrobe, the set design, lighting, audio, all of those people. Now, their future is uncertain because of one racist tweet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yeah. She destroyed a lot of people's career trajectories, obviously. She's paying a price as she should, Greg. What do you think about what happen and what do you think about Valerie Jarrett saying this start at the top with the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, she's incorrect on that point because well before Donald Trump was in office or even entertaining the presidency, Roseanne was always saying, absolutely, that poop crazy stuff. And we knew that. We've talked about this on the show even when her show came out that she said some completely crazy stuff, but maybe she changed and the show seems refreshing. And this is a new start and -- not the case. A lot of people are saying this is a freedom of speech issue, not really because freedom of speech in a place of work has consequences. We've talked about this with the NFL, saying like the NFL can make their own rules. So, if you're going to do something objectionable like what Roseanne did at a place of work, ABC is every bit right, as Fox News would be, if any of us had done something as absurd and ridiculous and hateful as that. But, I do think it's incorrect to broadly blame a political party or a politician over this. It's not that, it's the individual. The other point to make is that twitter can ruin a career faster than a string of felonies. It really is. I said earlier on your show, it's like -- it's used to be the office Christmas party that would get you fired. Now, you could just cut to the chase, you can just go on twitter, wasted or not, and just think, and think that, like, oh, you know what, this can't hurt. I'll just say this. And the next day, the company cuts you because they have to, as you've said it's part of the deal of the job. Just one last thing to just reiterate what I've said on your show, comedians have a flaw within them and it is the desire to jump off cliffs. People become comedians for that reason, to jump off cliffs. When they get on a stage, when they're saying that thing, it's to jump off -- it's to see what happens, and this is what happens sometimes."

Joy Reid has got an amazing second chance going right now after a paper trail of homophobia."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "I just don't see her ever coming back from something like this to a network show, Kimberly.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, Roseanne Barr has apologized, but there's just, you know, there's really, kind of, no cure for something so abhorrent and racially insensitive. And ABC acted, you know, decisively, and with authority, and compelling, you know, morality on this issue to say, listen, this is not appropriate what happened. And despite the fact that this was a tremendous, you know, economic opportunity for the network in terms of the show. They've made the right decision to say, we will not tolerate or standby when we see one of our stars behave in a way like this and say these things on twitter. I think to equate at though to say that, in fact, it has anything to do with the President of the United States, is wat too far, you know, a stretch. Roseanne Barr has been around for a long time. She has personal responsibility for what she chooses to do just like each and every one of us do as well. And, I just really do think about the jobs and the people, like, you know, Dana, you mentioned too. That are really excited about this opportunity to have, you know, for their families, for everything. And I think the ripple effect of it will be, you know, tremendous. This was a chance, kind of a new start, a new beginning for that show and for so many people associated with it along the line, production team and the crew, all of the above. So, you know, I just hope that they are able to find jobs and land in a good place, you know, despite having to go through this hardship."

She's been continuing to say provocative political things over the course of the reboot that most people really wouldn't get away with in Hollywood, and she was able to get away with it until she went way overboard with something out of left field like that. And easy decision for ABC, it was time to go. Do you think they -- there's any responsibility for, kind of, mismanaging her or is it all on her?"

They've made clear this was beyond the pale, this beyond the line. She just tweeted incredibly offensive things on a number of issues over many years. And like Greg said, twitter can be very problematic. I mean, there's a reason I'm not on twitter, not that I would tweet things like this. But, you know, it is not--"

Maybe they would laugh, maybe they'd not. Maybe they would punch you in the face. But doing it on twitter is such a bad thing. And I was asking Greg earlier, and I'm curious what you all think, is that -- I feel like -- many people, especially on public life, think that they have to be on twitter in order to advance their career. Marie, you're a good example of that not being true. You just got a new show at Fox News radio show that you're doing with Guy Benson. It's successful from 6 to 8 PM every night.

But not so fast everyone, it turns out these pictures were four years old, when their hero, Obama, was in charge. And with that, the loud condemnations go silent. Who cares now since their idol was boss at the time? But there's more, this photo of an all baby seat immigration detention bus was also shared and blamed on Trump. One anchor called it a prison bus just for babies. But the photo was also from Obama's era and it's a bus for field trips. And did you hear the widely shared claim about 1,500 immigrant kids that were separated from mom and dad again by evil Trump? Lie. These children actually arrived alone minus their parents, and then were placed among sponsors. The government had lost track of them which says something about the system, the system that Trump actually wants to fix. And so, as Trump cements his agenda through significant legislation, these folks have the vapors over imaginary discrimination. But if you can't blame him for that, what's next? Ebola? Malaria? Your lousy love life? And they accuse Trump of spreading baloney. The media can't even check the date on a photo and that's their job to check facts. It's all the usual suspects: identity activists, the paranoids in pajamas, you know, the New York Times. Fake news is now no longer a catchphrase, it's a brand. I have an idea. Dana, where is it? Shoot, I lost it."

But the sad thing is that this photo goes out, thousand -- tens of thousands of times, and then the retraction and the deletion doesn't get seen, so the damage is already done. But the reason they do this, the reason they have the policy to separate children and families is to discourage human trafficking, to discourage families from taking kids across the treacherous, hot, dangerous southern border trip, and they want to discourage dangerous and illegal immigration. So if they want to change the policy, let's get a deal on DACA, let's get a deal on merit-based, and they can hammer it out.

So, I think that part of the challenge is both sides have gone to such extremes now that the space for a deal on DACA or on any of these is increasingly shrinking, especially in a midterm year. If President Trump went out and gave an address that was somewhere down the middle that had a DACA fix but got some border security and try to bring both sides together, I -- depending on what it said, would probably think that's a good idea. The challenge is the Republican congress isn't on the same page particularly in the house, particularly in a midterm year. So, now, we're in a situation where the Trump administration has separated 800 children from their parents since October, for often good reasons, sometimes not. And, what do we do now? Where are these 1,500 children? This is heartbreaking. And no one in this political climate, it seems like, is trying to actually fix it."

Everyone should care, whatever your politics or administration you're in, about children. But when you look at the actual facts of the laws here that President Trump and his administration is following the law on the book in terms of what you do when people enter the country illegally with children. The goal and aim behind it is to be protective of children, so it doesn't foster this whole legal atmosphere of human trafficking, etcetera. And flat out follow the law, don't enter the country illegally, put yourself and your children at jeopardy. That's not love. That's foolish illegal desperation in terms of not honoring and following the laws. Other people are following it and trying to get into this country legally. It's a nation of immigrants.

Remember what the Democrats said about James Comey when he was the sitting FBI director? Politics is ugly. It's rough. It's fine. People attack people, it's what they do. Now, there are conflicts of interests, 13 out of the 18 lawyers on the Mueller team are Democrats. There are no Republicans there. One of the Democrats, Jeannie Rhee, is prosecuting Papadopoulos. Now, she previously worked for Hillary Clinton when she was under investigation for emails. She previously worked for the Clinton Foundation, and she worked for, I think it was Ben Rhodes when he was with Obama. So not a good track record. Now, Papadopoulos, they say, that whole thing started when a Clinton Foundation donor tipped off Obama's FBI. And now the former person that worked for the Clinton Foundation is prosecuting the guy?

Even with an adversary, somebody that you don't get along with, the reciprocity actually matters every bit as much. This is why Trump's letter was so polite, to the point that people thought it was a joke. But actually, he purposely avoided insult, maintained a level of politeness, because he knew that, as a salesman trying to sell this in a nonzero-sum environment, such words no longer contribute to it.

Things like people can't sleep. They can't have improper use of restrooms, which is the two things that I was mostly thinking about.
