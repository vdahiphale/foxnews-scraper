A message to those who are distorting my views including all white nationalists and especially one racist freak whose name I will not even mention. You do not have my support. You don't represent my views and you are antithetical to the beliefs I hold dear. The purpose of last night's Angle was to point out that the rule of law, meaning secure borders, is something that used to bind our country together. And despite what some may be contending, I made explicitly clear that my commentary had nothing to do with race or ethnicity, but rather a shared goal of keeping America safe and her citizens safe and prosperous. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Furthermore, as I have said repeatedly on the show, merit-based immigration does wonders for our country's economy, our way of life, and how we define our country. I even said that in my opening thoughts last night. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I want to make it really clear that my concern will continue to remain with the families who have suffered the tragic results of illegal immigration. The children put in dangerous and unfair situations at the border, and all those border agents around the country who work to keep our country safe. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And now could the expert class be possibly wrong again?

The announcement sparked a storm of controversy, as you can imagine, and tonight the school announced it is backtracking on its decision. But could be seen more schools across the country trying the same move? Joining us now with reaction, University of Maryland professor Jason Nichols, back by popular demand, along with writer and clinical analyst Carrie Sheffield. Jason, they are backtracking and saying that you can see that pledge or say the school cheer or something like that. but what does it say about us that this is a controversy?

And no one, including Martin Luther King Jr., would sit here and tell you if he were alive today, but he knew that we were working toward a more perfect union.

And despite what some may be contending, I made explicitly clear that my commentary had nothing to do with race or ethnicity, but rather a shared goal of keeping America safe and her citizens safe and prosperous. Furthermore, as I have said repeatedly on the show, merit-based immigration does wonders for our country's economy, our way of life, and how we define our country. I even said that in my opening thoughts last night. I want to make it really clear that my concern will continue to remain with the families who have suffered the tragic results of illegal immigration. The children put in dangerous and unfair situations at the border, and all those border agents around the country who work to keep our country safe. And now could the expert class be possibly wrong again? That is the focus of tonight's Angle. All right, the prevailing wisdom among the professional political prognosticators is that it's all gloom and doom for Republicans come the November midterms."

First, in its latest iteration, the RealClearPolitics average of polls about the country's direction finds that more Americans, 41.3 percent, find that Trump is setting us on the right track than at any other moment since December 2012. That's the right track, wrong track. Second, to the idea that Trump's base is shrinking, there is ample evidence to refute that. A brand-new Pew Research poll finds that for most Trump voters, the warm feelings for him -- I love that -- the warm feelings for him over the past couple of years have endured. Furthermore, Trump has many more converts, people who voted for him but didn't like him who have since warmed than those who liked him in 2016 and have \"cooled\" -- I love the warm cooled. And despite the near daily barrage of negative coverage about Mueller, tariffs, immigration, his approval ratings have remain pretty consistent. And they have even improved with his rural base despite the stories were told about the farmers who would turn on him over his aggressive trade policies."

A recent NPR?PBS NewsHour/Marist poll reveals that not only do most female voters prefer Democrats this fall, but nearly six in 10 suburban women strongly disapprove of Trump. And that same Pew poll mentioned above also found that women with a college degree are the most likely Trump voters to have soured on him since the election. And finally, a recent Wall Street Journal-NBC poll found that just 36 percent of independents approve of Trump's job, down seven points from just one month earlier. And also distractions.

The more he risks losing I t think more voters like Mary. The economy is good. It's a period of peace and prosperity. So, women like Trump the protector, the strong guy. They like that. But for the swing voters, he might not seem as charming when it seems like he's fighting everyone at once. They want things to calm down a little. For President Trump, the message is simple. Be the happy warrior we see at a lot of these rallies. Touting the economic resurgence, you can pat yourself on the back a little. The media is not going to do it. The renaissance in manufacturing and talk about how you want the economy to benefit all people -- forgotten Americans of all backgrounds, races, ethnicities like you did this afternoon."

Finally, Mr. President, don't ignore that right track reading we mentioned at the top. As the \"Washington Post\" wrote ahead of the 2016 election, \"the nation's mood is intrinsically important, providing a basic gauge of how Americans think the country is doing and whether people are more optimistic or pessimistic than in the past. Presidents can succeed or fail regardless of the public's mood, but the public's overall outlook sets the stage for political debate.\" Sets the stage for political debate -- that final line is most important for Trump and Republicans. Use that data point. Draft off that economic success. Be positive about America's current economic standings. It's a great time to be an American. We have problems but my goodness, other than the early years of Reagan, I can't think of a better economy. Set the terms of the debate yourself. Do not be defined by others. We are already on the right track, Mr. President. All you need to do now is not let the wrong track get you sidetracked.

But it also shows the motivation and the energy is definitely on the left.

Permanently re-assigning officers to the city's most gang ravaged areas. But the proposal is generating huge blowback. Why? Over fears that it could generate a surge in crime in some of the safer districts of Chicago. But is this just another excuse to avoid badly needed radical solutions to stop this carnage? Joining us now to analyze this Horace Cooper, the co-chair of Project 21, along with Anthony Tall, a criminal defense attorney. Now, neither of you are with me in the studio so, we're going to have to deal with that. I wish you were here with me. But let's start with you, Anthony because something has to be done in Chicago.

Remember, I have represented gang members in L.A. I've represented gang members who -- and they have the whole community afraid of them. So what we don't need is police coming in doubling the fear if it's not going to be strategically placed and constitutional provisions are not going to be there. There is nothing wrong with permanent policing, but it needs to be constitutional provisions to protect the 98 percent of the community that is not causing the trouble. And that two to three percent that are repeat offenders."

You hear them over and over and over again. Yet residents of the south and west sides of Chicago, on camera over the last several days, saying we need help. So there is two competing views here. Where is your -- where do you come down? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Look, these people are living literally in war zones. It is unbelievable that the conversation is being held that grandma can't go and get her prescription filled, that her granddaughter can't get to school without a drive-by shooting, that jobs won't locate in those communities, perpetuating poverty because investors will not go where there is this elevated level of crime. What you need is a common sense idea. The same thing that happens when you are on the interstate, when the officer puts his car prominently on the side of the road, all of a sudden, everybody slows down. Even people who are law-abiding take notice. What we need to do is have an elevated presence of law enforcement in these communities. And it doesn't need to be for a weekend. It doesn't need to be for a few weeks. It needs to be a year, two or three if necessary. That's the way that you can make it safer, and that's the way that this war zone mentality can go away."

With all of these harsh statistics, do you really want a permanent police force there that's not strategic and that's not following Fourth Amendment rules?

The Southern Poverty Law Center, cited by the mainstream media as an unbiased organization that's a national treasure because it points out the bad people. And there are a lot of bad people. White nationalist, Nazi groups, that type of person. But then they also label with the hate label people like Ben Carson who was put on an extremist watch list. The Israeli ambassador dinner with Frank Gaffney, they urged the Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, not to attend a dinner hosted by this guy Frank Gaffney who has views on Islamism and so forth. Center for Immigration Studies done enormous research on immigration. And of course the Alliance Defending Freedom, a group I have spoken to before, that litigated cases.

The problem here is that the attorney general is using the office of the attorney general to suppress First Amendment rights of these organizations in the name of religious freedom, which is yet another constitutional right.

And SPLC is about as objective as Antifa. They are a far left organization, and it's a disgrace that the government is using their imprimatur to silence speech. The real effects of this, Laura, are, for example, earlier, a couple years ago the Family Research Council was actually shot up in D.C. by an attacker trying to kill people there because that group was on the SPLC list."

So who made these people, the Soros funded and the far left organization the arbiter of what is correct speech in America and not.

And yes, I am very pro-charter, and it upsets me to see something that something that was a charter school was antifreedom, because charters to me equals freedom. So I am glad that they have done the right thing. But look, Laura, I think this speaks to the broader issue of trying to turn people against each other, trying to tear at our social fabric against things that represent the United States of America. And no one, including Martin Luther King Jr., would sit here and tell you if he were alive today, but he knew that we were working toward a more perfect union.

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "No matter how hard they try, liberals and their media brethren still just can't seem to figure out Trump supporters and their loyalty to the president. But Musa Al-Gharbi, a sociology professor at Columbia University, may have figured out why they keep getting it so wrong. He was on radio this morning, and now he joins us with more. Professor, good to see you. Thanks for being on in the morning and at night. You're doing double duty, really appreciate it. So what is going on here with some of the polling and some of the research that you've been able to cull through?"

    {
      "speaker": "PROF. MUSA AL-GHARBI, SOCIOLOGIST, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY",
      "utterance": "So there is a few things that we see in a lot of the studies that are intended to understand the 2016 election. The main problems seem to be things like prejudicial study design. So a survey will ask a question like, what motivated Trump voters? Is it that their more racist or sexist or ignorant rather than any kind of balanced or positive attributes that could have possibly motivated to vote for who they did. And of course there is no surveys about why would someone vote for Hillary Clinton? Is it because they are anti- American? So there's this sort of prejudicial study design is a big problem. And then there are sometimes just glaring errors, like inferential errors, statistical errors that somehow get through by people who know better and by editors who know better. And they are cited by other people who know better. Not on purpose. I don't think it's a cynical thing. I think for the most part it's just an issue where the studies are confirming something, a view of the world, that they strongly believe and want to believe. And so these kinds of errors can creep in and get unnoticed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And then once one study is published or one poll, it just gets repeated, paraphrased in another website and another and another and another. I want to show for our viewers what we are talking about specifically. One particular question illustrates your point. And you're not a fan of the president, we should say. You're not a rah-rah Trump supporter. In fact, the opposite. Question, this is a CNN/SSRS poll. Question, which of the following do you think is more important? Imposing tariffs on imports from foreign countries to protect certain U.S. industries, 25 percent, maintaining good relations with countries that have been close allies of the U.S. for many years? Of course people are going to say that 63 percent. Both equally, no opinion. So that's a problem because, professor?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AL-GHARBI",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. That result you got there was probably the result of what we call a framing effect. For instance, if they rephrased the question something like do you support -- like maintaining, like protecting the U.S. economy or U.S., critical service, critical U.S. manufacturing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "It's a phrasing issue. This is just classic prejudicial framing issue. When you say maintaining good relations countries that have been close, that's just a biased way to frame it. It's so obvious when you read it. Also something we want to get to, just really quickly, the pairing of Donald Trump with racism on the Google searches. Donald Trump-white supremacy, Donald Trump-xenophobia, 10,000 results, 2,300 results, 3,000 results. Why is that a problem in 15 seconds, professor?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AL-GHARBI",
      "utterance": "What's astonishing is it takes a long time to publish anything in an academic journal. Half a year, a year. So the fact that just since 2016 there were these tens of thousands of studies that were published, all of them having the same -- if you survey the abstracts and titles of these works, they all tell the same story. Trump voters were racist, motivated by --"

The U.S. attorney in Philadelphia will join us, to tell us why the city's sanctuary policies are so dangerous and what he says is also un-American. So you don't want to miss that.
