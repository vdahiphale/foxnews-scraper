But the thing is, the media knew that, the Dems know that but they colluded to manufacture the story just the way they buried that laptop story. They created and manufactured this story because they are terrified of DeSantis becoming a candidate because they know he is going to crush the Democrats. There is another thing too about, it kind of bugs me that they keep calling this bill controversial. And it's controversial because it was misrepresented. But also, when you look at it, it's like don't teach gender and sexuality to kids third grade and under. How was that unreasonable? If you -- I got -- if you, by counter views, if you really want to talk to a 5-year-old or a 7-year-old or an 8-year-old about their sexuality and gender, that's on you. You're a pervert. You're a weirdo. I don't give a damn if you are a teacher or a sex ed. There's something weird if you want to share your sexuality. Like, I want to tell Little Billy that I am a pan sexual woodland nymph. You know? You know what? You do that you go see your shrink. That's for your shrink. You leave the kids out of it.

And the (Inaudible) came at Biden and said, you know, you are going to do it our way. He quite rightfully sees the danger here. And when it comes to the midterms, I think he is heading for a massive shellacking as things stands. But it's really down to the economy. And it can only get worse for him if he embraces anything that AOC is currently preaching. Because that is the very mentality which is, I think, the minority in America and the vast majority of people find it intensely irritating. So, if I was Biden I would completely ignore her and I would try to get a message which people actually listen to about the economy and how you are going to fix it. Because most people that I'm talking as I walk around New York in the last week, the fact they are talking about. They're talking about the economy. They're talking about prices at the pump. They're talking about food prices. And you add in the Ukraine war and the impact they -- that may have on global food prices. This is a real ongoing economic crisis. And at the moment the guy in charge of this keeps trying to blame Vladimir Putin but as the poll show the American people blame Joe Biden. He's got to change that message, somehow before November."

So, Judge, I got to say, I watch all this every day now with people saying he's losing, he doesn't know what's happening. He lost his mind. I don't really buy any of it. I think Putin is extremely smart ruthless dictator who knows what he is doing. I think his real ambitious may actually be eastern Ukraine with all its vast energy resources there.

So, you know, that could make sense, but I also think that for many years we have kind of blown him up to be this incredible threat. He is not such a threat. I mean, to the extent that he has a nuclear weapon, of course he is a threat. But I think, you know, he is just a small dictator and now what he's got to do in addition to being embarrassed on the world stage and not being able to take even the Donbas and that area in the first couple of days and having tanks rolling around in the mud and all of that is, he's now having Russia being hit by Ukraine in a defensive mode. They are now sending missiles into Russia. So now, it's a new game. And he's got to figure out what he's going to do and is he going to back off and say, you know, just stop, you know, pummeling Russia because that's a new onion, a new layer of the onion that's out there."

I pray for a quick ending, that's what I said the first day this happened. I -- it's like the lockdowns. You know, war is easy, rah, rah, rah, when you can still go home in a black Sedan and have your dinner and a comfortable with a decent bank account. So as long as I'm not in danger I'm not going to be pushing for anything aggressive and I think that that's, maybe where a lot of Americans are, specifically because we've been through two wars, right? I mean, this was not -- this has not been a fun time, you know, with Afghanistan and with Iraq. So, I could see that people have to burn their hand on the stove and maybe they want to think about what Trump was talking about which was America first. Let's worry about what's -- what's going on here. And also, I mean, I agree with you completely when you're talking about, how do you -- how do you figure this out? Because on any given day you're told that Russians winning and Ukrainians are winning. Is it possible that they are both winning at the same time? It makes -- you know that this isn't just a battle over land, it's a battle over your mind. And you've got to be able to question the media orthodoxy without getting crushed. And I think that's super important that it's like, you know, it's like, where's your moral outrage? Well, my moral outrage, it's here, but it's, but it's for the Ukrainian people.

And that's one of the contributing factors to the weariness. Here, it seems to me is a much clearer, moral imperative situation, a bit like when Saddam Hussein first invaded Kuwait. Is that you have someone invading a sovereign country? And is there not a Western moral compulsion to kick him out?

So, now, Putin is a laughingstock on the world stage as a military strategist, it is pitiful, and what the moms of Russia are realizing that their sons were sent to die with no strategy, and with fake Chinese tires that are trying to pull these tanks across on roads that they can't get through with no food, and that that message is going to get back and around. So, he is hurt also by the fact that China has not come to their aid like he thought that they would, and he has to go -- Russia used to supply China with military aid. Now, Putin has to go crawling to Russia? I would press that advantage like, well, you are a pitiful, pitiful leader, you are -- like, there are some psychological things that you could do that don't put any boots on the ground. And we have people in inside the Kremlin that are obviously telling us things. As for the red line, I think that what Americans have to think about is what is in your national interest. Is your national interest threatened? And to what extent is your national interest threatened? So, what sort of response does that require? And that is not been clear from Joe Biden. That's why people are frustrated by what is the mission? What are we trying to do? Are we trying to help Ukraine win or lose slowly? Are we trying to destroy Putin? What are we trying to do?
