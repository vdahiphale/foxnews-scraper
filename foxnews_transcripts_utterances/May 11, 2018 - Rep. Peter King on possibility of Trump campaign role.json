Although there is a relative calm in Israel today, there's also a sense that things have shifted that there's now a push back against Iran in the region after year of them encroaching on Israel's borders, and we've saw that in a major way yesterday. We're now learning more about those extensive coordinated strikes carried out by Israel in Syria against Israeli targets. The defense minister saying they've destroyed almost all of the Iran military facilities in the country with 70 different strikes targeting 50 military sites. The U.S. and Russia were notified ahead of the offensive which saw them hit Iranian intelligence sites, logistics and military headquarters and their downtown rocket launchers. Those strikes were in retaliation to Iranian rocket fire into the Golan Heights a day earlier. Today, Iran responded for the first time since the attack in fiery rhetoric, the supreme leader, Khamenei, to chants of death to America and death to Israel, warned that Tel Aviv and Haifa will be destroyed if Israel acts foolishly. And Israel is also facing major protest in the south of the country at the guarded border. The protests comes just three days ahead of what the Hamas leader said will be a march by tens of thousands who could burst through the border fence and into Israel. On Monday, he compared the crowd to a starving tiger. And the protests also coincide with the opening the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, which is a decision many people are not happy with. And as a result, there has been heighten security in Jerusalem, now because Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Steve Mnuchin are coming along with other White House officials, here in Israel at least.

Want they really want to do is replicate what they done in Lebanon, Martha, where the Hezbollah have in their hands 130,000 plus rocket and missiles capable of reaching Israel, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. They want to do that in southern Syria and put the infrastructure in there to do that, so it would overwhelm Israel's missile defense system because they would be swarming at them from multiple directions. The targets would be Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. This is serious stuff what Iran is up to. They certainly want to undermine the government of Israel and create instability in the country.

Rich Lowery of the national review says this about the president's follow-through: \"Trump often doesn't mean what he said. But when he says what he means, watch out. The combined forces of international pressure, polite opinion, outraged New York Times editorials, resistant advisors and sheer inertia are not an obstacle. The president's big week continued Wednesday with the release of three North Korean hostages. Despite media criticism over what they called the theatrics of the release, policy experts call it a major diplomatic win that clears a big hurdle ahead of the upcoming summit with Kim Jong-un -- which if you're keeping score is another Trump home run. With the president tweeting, \"The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong-un and myself will take place in Singapore. On June 12th, we will both try to make it a very special moment for world peace. Experts agree that President Trump's strategy on North Korea is one of high risk and high reward. But the one-day summit could very well become a lasting legacy. And while the president is building his legacy, he is trying slowly dismantle that of his predecessor. Whether it's the Transpacific Partnership, the Paris Climate Accord, DACA, Obamacare, the clean power plan, or the Iran nuclear deal, the president appears is now at the plate and he's looking to go deep, Martha."

Gentlemen, welcome, good to have all of you -- both of you here tonight. You know, I think it is fascinating when you watch the course of this, and you see how deeply people go in their corner. And something, Jose, put on blinders in terms of what is actually going on because they don't want to give the president any credit for anything.

There is some stage craft to them, to be sure. I mean, I think back to the rose garden moment with Bowe Bergdahl and his parents flanking President Obama.

So, I don't think -- I'm not going to judge him for that one good thing that he has done. Again, I am very happy that this happened.

But also, he said I'm going to move the embassy to Jerusalem, which many other presidents had claimed when they were candidates and then they got into office, and said well, maybe we're not going to do that. He actually did it. He also fires off these tweets, frequently, seemingly every morning and a lot of people especially in Washington to say this is highly unusual, it's damaging, it's sort of he's a wild card, he's a loose cannon. But it caught the attention of the Kim regime. Now, whether that ends up paying dividends down the line and gets the Kim regime to seriously agree to lasting peace, it's pretty mature to start celebrating anything. But I do suspect the fact that they are at the table the way that they are now in the context that they are is attributable to their fear and confusion, at least partially of Donald Trump."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

But what we do know for sure at this point is that we are in a place that we haven't been in before, and we have a summit that is in the works between the president of the United States, and the leader of a North Korea who appears to be, perhaps, at a point where he wants something a little bit different for the future of his country. He's motivated by a number of things -- South Korea, perhaps the idea that his country doesn't have to be the dark continental anymore, that maybe they could, you know, join the international economy, and maybe even see some of the benefits of that themselves. But Jose, you know, you talk about the tweets, it's possible that one of the ways we got here, were those, you know, rocket man, those tweets that were blasted by, you know, sort of foreign policy insiders. That may have been a catalyst that gets him now to a point where he's like, you know what, we're getting along fairly well in these discussions."

But my larger point Martha is this: President Trump has been distrusting a bunch of our ally. He's been placing mistrust within our allies, that when the way that he's pulling out of the Iran deal, for example, makes France not want to do deals with us in the future, maybe Germany nor want to do deals with us, and what have you."

      "utterance": "Well, President Obama pulled out of previous Bush agreements with the Israelis, with the checks, those are both allies, and that did not ruin the entire credibility of the United States of America. And there are U.S. allies in the gulf region, and in the Middle East, who are absolutely thrilled, frankly, that the president made this decision on the Iran deal. Yes, he perturbed other allies as well. We should keep that in mind, but it's not like he has universally given the middle finger to all of our allies by pulling out of the Iran deal -- something he promised to do by the way. That just isn't the case."

We haven't been able to curb entitlement programs or to, you know, make any dent in social security or some of these, you know, very entrenched programs. But what we're seeing is that, you get it sort of around the edges, you're getting entitlement reform around the edges with these programs that states are adopting of their own accord, Jose and then Guy on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARISTIMUNO",

If he wants to get a chance of keeping the House and the Senate, he should sit down with the Democrats and be the president that he's supposed to be, which is uniting both parties and he has been doing the opposite of that."

    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "I think that sounds great. I don't think the Democrats are very interested in working with him or handing him anything that could look like a win in an election year. But, Martha, to your point, tinkering around the edges on welfare and other entitlement programs? Fine, I'm for it, but what we actually need mathematically is root and branch reform of Medicare and social security, which are the drivers of our debt.

There is renewed congressional interest tonight in this 300-page testimony from Glenn Simpson whose company, Fusion GPS, commissioned the Trump dossier and paid former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign. Simpson told Senate investigators \"essentially, what Steele told me was that had other intelligence about this matter from the internal Trump campaign source. And then, my understanding was that the FBI believed Chris' at this point, that they believe Chris' information might be credible. The chairman of the House Intelligence and Oversight Committees, Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy, want records related to the source.

And that's one of the things that we're trying to pin down to make sure that is the case. If it is, it raises very, very serious questions because there's been, to us, no real reason given why the investigation began in the first place and why the FISA warrant was granted in the first place. And then, with this person, what role did this person have? If he was an FBI operative, he was dealing with people in the Trump campaign, he was put there by the FBI? If so, you have the FBI actually spying on the presidential campaign, again there's other -- there'll be other consequences to this. So, this is really unprecedented in American history. And perhaps, if there was a real justification for it, and have the extreme justification and maybe you consider it?

And it's amazing President Trump is the one who's being targeted here and was being investigated. And so much went wrong at the other end, at the FBI end, and yet right now they're stonewalling us. They stonewalled us all along, and this is just another end. But listen, Martha, the president can resolve this; the president can order them to release this, and I think he should.

This is what Americans do in general. But I think that what may have been genuine shock at the start. Remember everything that the Clintons do is political. And even her complaints about Russia at the start, that the Russians stole it from her, weaved within what the obvious narrative was right after her loss. So, keep that in mind, but I think that now, we have to consider, you know, she's with a foreign audience. These are comments on foreign soil. And I think an audience that she trust doesn't really know what's going on in America. The president is having great foreign policy success, and I think that we have to consider that this may now be an effort of transferring from, you know, her having group therapy in the beginning to really now trying to malign the president, affect the impact of what the foreign think of Americans in general, which would then have, of course, (INAUDIBLE) with allies -- an impact on how the country is viewed and how policy approaches are viewed.

And the argument is that women are judged on far more categories than men are judge on when they decide to make a run for office.

They've commented on her voice being bland, they've talked about her jacket being cement color, right? They've offered this physical representation of her appearance rather than her qualifications, than the merit of what she can do at that job. So, the point that was just made about a gentlemen about -- look, this isn't Democrat or Republican issue. That's correct, it's not. And, in fact, this garbage comes from the left just as much as it does from the right. And, at the end of the day, that stuff all comes down to just driving readership and looking for, you know, political points to score. But I think what we have seen not just with Gina but the broader issue around Secretary Clinton, is that, you know, losing sucks and it's hard to move on sometime. And when you are struggling to find an explanation for that that's beyond just your own failings, you blast anything and everything out in the universe to hold on to, to give you a sense of it wasn't my fault. And so, I think that she's speaking to a degree of truth here in terms of sexism. But, look, a majority of Americans women voted for Trump, all right? Not for her."

I think to sort of say, oh, it's all about misogyny, and you can still sort of say, you know, poor me. I'm a victim of, you know, people who just don't want to see women in powerful places.

Although there is a relative calm in Israel today, there's also a sense that things have shifted that there's now a push back against Iran in the region after year of them encroaching on Israel's borders, and we've saw that in a major way yesterday. We're now learning more about those extensive coordinated strikes carried out by Israel in Syria against Israeli targets. The defense minister saying they've destroyed almost all of the Iran military facilities in the country with 70 different strikes targeting 50 military sites. The U.S. and Russia were notified ahead of the offensive which saw them hit Iranian intelligence sites, logistics and military headquarters and their downtown rocket launchers. Those strikes were in retaliation to Iranian rocket fire into the Golan Heights a day earlier. Today, Iran responded for the first time since the attack in fiery rhetoric, the supreme leader, Khamenei, to chants of death to America and death to Israel, warned that Tel Aviv and Haifa will be destroyed if Israel acts foolishly. And Israel is also facing major protest in the south of the country at the guarded border. The protests comes just three days ahead of what the Hamas leader said will be a march by tens of thousands who could burst through the border fence and into Israel. On Monday, he compared the crowd to a starving tiger. And the protests also coincide with the opening the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, which is a decision many people are not happy with. And as a result, there has been heighten security in Jerusalem, now because Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Steve Mnuchin are coming along with other White House officials, here in Israel at least.

So, from there, that they really want to gain more influence and domination of the countries in the area. And case point here is Israel. You know, for months now the Iranians had been conducting a military buildup in southern and southwestern Syria with the single purpose in mind of encroaching on Israeli sovereignty and their security. Want they really want to do is replicate what they done in Lebanon, Martha, where the Hezbollah have in their hands 130,000 plus rocket and missiles capable of reaching Israel, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. They want to do that in southern Syria and put the infrastructure in there to do that, so it would overwhelm Israel's missile defense system because they would be swarming at them from multiple directions. The targets would be Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. This is serious stuff what Iran is up to. They certainly want to undermine the government of Israel and create instability in the country. And, eventually, in time, destroy it. That is something they say every single year. And the Israelis didn't come back with a proportionate strike. They came back with an overwhelming response as was mentioned in the introduction."

    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "I don't think so, and here's why. Well, first of all, they had this strike in a kit bag for sure. They were just waiting for something else to happen. Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force, directed the Quds Force to do the strike. That was the first. And Israel took out just about all of their military infrastructure. It's a heck of a price the Iranians will pay. And I think the Iranians when they look at this, the depth pattern, Martha, has never been to get their own forces directly involved in a conflict except for the eight years they fought with Saddam Hussein. And they don't want to make that mistake. They want to use their proxies. And I think this is going to send a very loud message to the Iranians. It doesn't mean that Hezbollah are not going to continue to cause problems for Israel, they will. And it doesn't mean that the Israeli will not going to respond to Hezbollah, they will in the future too.

And I've just returned from Japan and I've talked with leaders in their government, their foreign ministry, and they also are echoing this. They see a potential for a break through here. It doesn't mean that Kim Jong-un is going to want to give us -- just hand us over all of his nuclear weapons, they would want to drag this out for years, and probably not give all of those weapons to us.

A judge ultimately did step in. The allege bullies agreeing to stay 150 feet away from these students. But some academic research suggests dealing with bullies can actually make you a stronger person. Joining me now, someone who knows, Jesse Watters, co-host of The Five, and host of Watters' World. Were you even bullied? JESSE WATTERS, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: No, I did the bullying, unfortunately. I actually bullied someone to a scholarship. There is a kid that we used to chase around."
