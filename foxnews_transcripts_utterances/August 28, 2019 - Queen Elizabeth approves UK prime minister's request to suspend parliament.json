First to the very real storm building just miles of our shores, with meteorologist Rick Reichmuth on just how big a punch this hurricane is packing, Rick Leventhal in Puerto Rico on heavy rains that could soon be whipping, and Phil Keating in Florida, where fears of that Category 3 storm have a lot of folks there bracing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We begin with Rick Reichmuth in the Fox Weather Center -- Rick.",

The storm was across the northeastern part of the Caribbean last couple of days. It kind of kept jogging towards the north and kind of recentering. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That really spared Puerto Rico the brunt of it. It also spared the storm from really big mountains that would rip it apart. So the storm staying intact, and it's going to stay intact. That means what happens next has now much bigger impacts for at least mainland USA. U.S. territory here Puerto Rico also spared. Last couple images, that's where the storm is. It's going to continue to pull towards the north. And that means it'll continue to pull away from Puerto Rico, still some rainfall there, but that rain isn't going to be anything that's going to cause huge problems, although the eastern side of the island, maybe some spots picking up three to six inches of rain. That will certainly cause some flooding, especially because of the weakened state it's still in after Hurricane Maria from a couple of years ago. That's a satellite image of the storm, pulls off towards the Northeast. And, as it does so, now the conditions become much more favorable for strengthening of the storm than we have seen over the last couple days. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Last couple of days, conditions were not very favorable and it strengthened anyway. Now we're going to move into much more favorable conditions. And that's why official forecast brings it up to a major hurricane by the time it gets somewhere here along the Eastern Seaboard. The two most reliable computer models that we have run are still not in agreement. Because of that, we still don't have a great sense of exactly what's going to happen. One of our most reliable ones pulls this across the Florida Peninsula into the Gulf. If that happens, that would mean we would have a landfall on the eastern shore of Florida and then eventually another landfall somewhere probably, maybe Panhandle of Florida, some way maybe over towards Eastern Louisiana. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Another option is that it gets pulled up by a weakness that's going to be left towards the north of this and pulls it somewhere and potentially bring some impacts to North Florida, Georgia, or the Carolinas. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So there's a lot of territory that we cannot rule out. We don't have a good idea just yet. What we do know is, there will be something very close to the Eastern Seaboard sometime this Labor Day weekend. So many people, Neil, thinking they're going to be traveling and vacationing on Labor Day. Not going to be the case across these beaches. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And it has avoided what we refer to as a Caribbean gauntlet. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At this time of the year, the Caribbean can be a graveyard of storms. But instead of continuing into the Caribbean, it's just in the extreme Northeast Caribbean, moving into the Atlantic. It avoided that.

And I fear, when it turns to the West, that's when you're going to see it become a major hurricane. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So there are two different computer models that are -- that we look at quite a bit, but the one that has it further north is usually the one that breaks down the big high pressure to the north too quick. We have noticed it over the years. It is a new version of that model. And the other model is taking this right through South Florida, south Central Florida on into the Gulf. And I will tell you, one of my fears is, the 1947 hurricane, for those of -- we don't have the track there -- went into Fort Lauderdale as a Category 4-5, and then went back toward New Orleans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this one at this time looks like we're going to see some kind of landfall between Fort Lauderdale and Daytona Beach during the day Sunday or Sunday afternoon. But I think this is going to get back into the Gulf. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The ridge of high pressure off the southeast coast is buoyed by this warm water. So, in the wake of Erin, which is east of Cape Hatteras, when that moves out, that high is going to build back in. And when it does, it'll just point this storm at Florida. And that bend in the track -- and you're going to watch it happen, folks, over the next few days -- northwest and then back to the west, that is a path is notorious for intensification.",

The U.S. Trade Office, by the way, officially filing the paperwork to up tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, not all of them. Some will be pushed back a little bit. But a lot of them, from baby products to school supplies, will be marked up from a 10 percent tariff originally intended to 15 percent. And they, by and large, hit on September 1, another batch right before Christmas. So what happens here? Because if the markets were worried about any of this, they, as I said, had a funny way of showing. The Dow was up 258 points. Let's go to market watcher Troy Gayeski and our own jolting Deirdre Bolton. That's what I call her.",

But the president ignoring that cost is wrong, because here's the thing about going to war. You better go in with eyes wide open, obviously rally the nation around winning that war, but do let them know there will be costs to that war. There always are. And that contrary to what the president has said, it will not be an easy war, and it won't be a wonderful war, because tariffs are not a wonderful thing. Tariffs are taxes on goods that you pay. Governments don't pay them. You do. China isn't sucking them up. You are. Now, the president says you have been spared the pain because China has been busy devaluing its currency, so you wouldn't even feel the pinch. But someone is paying the more than $30 billion in tariffs. And it is not Chinese buyers. It's not, well, any of them. It's American buyers. It's American distributors and retailers, not Chinese companies that do business with us, American companies that do business with China. They're the ones who have to pay up or suck it up. And, right now, they are sucking wind. They absorb what they can to avoid passing it along to you. But they can only do so much. And let's just say they can't do much more. And I'm not just talking American farmers, who have lost a bundle. I'm talking American companies that, if things don't change, will lose an even bigger bundle. Where is their relief? Where is your relief, especially now that they're facing -- let me rephrase that, what you're facing -- a whole new wave of tariffs that kick in come September 1, on everything from school supplies and sporting goods, to infant formula and meat and dairy products? They're days away from costing up to 15 percent more on your tab, not China's tab, from your wallet, not China's wallet, when you get to the register here, not when Chinese shoppers get to the register there, not them, you, not later, now. That is the pain Lindsey Graham is talking about. That is the pain he's acknowledging the president is not talking about. It's a pain Graham says is worth the fight. Trouble is, Americans don't see it coming, because all a lot of them know is what the president keeps saying, that tariffs are beautiful, until they get to the register themselves and look at something quite ugly: the receipt.

The storm expected to be a Category 3 hurricane when it makes landfall in Florida over the holiday Labor Day weekend. Then the firestorm in the U.K. over Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspending Parliament, and the queen letting him do it. Don't look now, but Brexit is on, and the Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, is here. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. The Brexit storm in just a moment. First to the very real storm building just miles of our shores, with meteorologist Rick Reichmuth on just how big a punch this hurricane is packing, Rick Leventhal in Puerto Rico on heavy rains that could soon be whipping, and Phil Keating in Florida, where fears of that Category 3 storm have a lot of folks there bracing. We begin with Rick Reichmuth in the Fox Weather Center -- Rick."

      "utterance": "Hi, Neil. So, yes, the radar picture -- this comes out of Puerto Rico -- this is their radar and gives it a really good sense of what we're dealing with. The storm was across the northeastern part of the Caribbean last couple of days. It kind of kept jogging towards the north and kind of recentering. That really spared Puerto Rico the brunt of it. It also spared the storm from really big mountains that would rip it apart. So the storm staying intact, and it's going to stay intact. That means what happens next has now much bigger impacts for at least mainland USA. U.S. territory here Puerto Rico also spared. Last couple images, that's where the storm is. It's going to continue to pull towards the north. And that means it'll continue to pull away from Puerto Rico, still some rainfall there, but that rain isn't going to be anything that's going to cause huge problems, although the eastern side of the island, maybe some spots picking up three to six inches of rain. That will certainly cause some flooding, especially because of the weakened state it's still in after Hurricane Maria from a couple of years ago. That's a satellite image of the storm, pulls off towards the Northeast. And, as it does so, now the conditions become much more favorable for strengthening of the storm than we have seen over the last couple days. Last couple of days, conditions were not very favorable and it strengthened anyway. Now we're going to move into much more favorable conditions. And that's why official forecast brings it up to a major hurricane by the time it gets somewhere here along the Eastern Seaboard. The two most reliable computer models that we have run are still not in agreement. Because of that, we still don't have a great sense of exactly what's going to happen. One of our most reliable ones pulls this across the Florida Peninsula into the Gulf. If that happens, that would mean we would have a landfall on the eastern shore of Florida and then eventually another landfall somewhere probably, maybe Panhandle of Florida, some way maybe over towards Eastern Louisiana. Another option is that it gets pulled up by a weakness that's going to be left towards the north of this and pulls it somewhere and potentially bring some impacts to North Florida, Georgia, or the Carolinas. So there's a lot of territory that we cannot rule out. We don't have a good idea just yet. What we do know is, there will be something very close to the Eastern Seaboard sometime this Labor Day weekend. So many people, Neil, thinking they're going to be traveling and vacationing on Labor Day. Not going to be the case across these beaches."

      "utterance": "And, Neil, that drift to the east by this storm is a relief to the folks here, the three million residents who live on this U.S. territory and were devastated by Maria some two years ago. They have been getting ready. And you can see the tarps on the windows here along the oceanfront and a lot of the stores on the main drag also boarded up. And we can show you our FOX storm cam. It's been lashed to that tree over there. We may not need it in this particular storm here in Puerto Rico, which is good news for the folks in San Juan, if conditions don't get worse. But it does provide weather data and live images. And, Neil, if we show you the beach, I mean, there are people out there because it's not raining. So there are folks in the ocean, even though there are red flag warnings because the surf is considered pretty dangerous right now. And off on the horizon there, you can see some dark clouds. It looks kind of ominous, but not apparently what the biggest fears were, that they might get slammed here, and that could trigger mudslides and flooding on the streets if they got up to 10 inches of rain that some had predicted. So, good news for Puerto Rico, it sounds like, if this storm continues toward the east, but bad news ahead for the mainland and the state of Florida, perhaps I know Phil Keating is standing by."

      "utterance": "Hi there, Neil. Getting into the International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, no longer an option for anybody on the island. You can't fly there either, not that you would want to at this point. All major air carriers canceled all their flights in and out this morning. So, essentially, for most of the day, the regional and international terminals have been closed. As for the cruise vacations, the major lines, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Disney, started changing their itineraries Monday. Several cruises are now skipping San Juan, Turks and Caicos, and St. Thomas. And this is Webcam footage not too long ago of the port there in St. Thomas, where usually you can see one of those massive cruise ships, today, empty and rainy. Several weeklong cruises changed their schedules, flip-flopping ports of call. Navigator of the Seas canceled it stop at CocoCay in Bahamas. Allure of the Seas totally changed its vacation crews from the Eastern Caribbean and those islands to the Western Caribbean, as did Symphony of the Seas. The Coast Guard completely shut down all maritime operations in San Juan late yesterday. All of that remains closed. Things could reopen tomorrow. All depends on what happens tonight. As for Florida, people up and down the coast for the pay day or two have been stocking up on water and nonperishables, but still a few days out, and a lot of uncertainty as to where this eye hits the Sunshine State -- Neil."

      "utterance": "All right, Phil Keating, thank you very much. So just how bad could things get? Remember, we're just revving up to the hurricane season. Meteorologist Joe Bastardi with us right now. Joe, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOE BASTARDI, WEATHERBELL CHIEF FORECASTER",
      "utterance": "Well, I will tell you what. This has a classic bend in the track to the west, which is usually an earmark of a major intensifying storm, if you go back and look at -- I'm talking about the track in two or three days -- it's been moving east of north -- or -- excuse me -- more to the north. And it has avoided what we refer to as a Caribbean gauntlet. At this time of the year, the Caribbean can be a graveyard of storms. But instead of continuing into the Caribbean, it's just in the extreme Northeast Caribbean, moving into the Atlantic. It avoided that. Now, it's going to continue this northwest path over the next couple of days, and then turn to the west. And I fear, when it turns to the West, that's when you're going to see it become a major hurricane. So there are two different computer models that are -- that we look at quite a bit, but the one that has it further north is usually the one that breaks down the big high pressure to the north too quick. We have noticed it over the years. It is a new version of that model. And the other model is taking this right through South Florida, south Central Florida on into the Gulf. And I will tell you, one of my fears is, the 1947 hurricane, for those of -- we don't have the track there -- went into Fort Lauderdale as a Category 4-5, and then went back toward New Orleans. Now, this one at this time looks like we're going to see some kind of landfall between Fort Lauderdale and Daytona Beach during the day Sunday or Sunday afternoon. But I think this is going to get back into the Gulf. The ridge of high pressure off the southeast coast is buoyed by this warm water. So, in the wake of Erin, which is east of Cape Hatteras, when that moves out, that high is going to build back in. And when it does, it'll just point this storm at Florida. And that bend in the track -- and you're going to watch it happen, folks, over the next few days -- northwest and then back to the west, that is a path is notorious for intensification."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So what are we looking at season-wise?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BASTARDI",
      "utterance": "Well, the season itself is -- we don't expect a lot of storm activity in the Caribbean and in the main areas. What we try to emphasize to folks is, storms will be stronger further north than they are to the south. And that's what you're going to see here. You saw that Barry -- Barry developed right off shore like that. And even Erin developed way to the north like this. So what will happen is, in this season, the ones that try to come into the Caribbean, most of them will stay weaker than what they will do later on in their career. Overall, I think it's a little bit below normal as far as what we call the ACE index, Neil, but I think the problem is in scattershot seasons, when there's a big high pressure over the Northwest Atlantic, the United States tends to have higher impact."

Guess what? She went along. She did. She approved his suspending Parliament for upwards of a month to, well, close the deal, or at least that's the impression. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage joins me right now on the phone. Nigel, always good having you. What does this mean now? What's put in place?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NIGEL FARAGE, BREXIT PARTY LEADER",
      "utterance": "It's not, Neil, as exceptional as people may think. We have a constitutional monarchy, which means that Parliament operates through -- through the -- not the power, but the auspices of the queen. So, actually, what Boris Johnson has done is, he closed the current session of Parliament, announced the reopening of Parliament. The queen has approved. And on the 14th of October, Boris Johnson will lay out his new legislative program for the next year. It's a little bit like the State of the Union speech that happens in America. And it's all being portrayed as some sort of terrible trick that Boris playing on the British people. It's actually a very normal thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. So is there anything to stop the Brexit decision to move, to go ahead and bolt from the rest of Europe, deal or no deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the big dilemma. You know, how do we leave the European Union on the 31st of October? Do we leave with a clean-break Brexit, or do we leave with the withdrawal agreement that Mrs. May put to Parliament three times, and was three times rejected? And here's my concern. Much as I think Boris has brought great optimism and energy to the job, things that President Trump has identified, it looks like he wants to go for an amended form of that withdrawal agreement. And that would still leave us very tied to E.U. rules and would mean we could not do a trade deal with the USA for several years to come. So, I'm -- what I'm doing, as leader of the Brexit Party, is putting as much pressure as I can on Boris to say, come on. We have spent over three years waiting to do this. Let's just get out with a clean-break Brexit and get on with our lives."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, you know what? I spent 20 years working in financial markets before getting involved in politics. And, very often, you get short-term hysteria in markets, and it's always the old thing, isn't it? Sell the rumor, buy the facts. And I think, frankly -- I think, frankly, once the U.K. has left the European Union, if we do it in a clean way, I think foreign and direct investment will flood into the United Kingdom, because we will be free of Greece and Italy and all these economies that are doing so badly. And the arguments against leaving are those from the status quo, those from the big firms who are doing very well, thank you. And life's always like that. You always get the big and the rich want no change. Actually, the time has come, not just economically to change, but democratically. Why should my country be run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels? I want to be free."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Nigel, I sometimes wonder -- obviously, you know what's happening there a lot better than I do -- but that maybe Boris Johnson is forcing Europe's hand here. You say you won't renegotiate the deal? The clock is ticking. You better, or we're out one way or the other."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, of course. I mean, look, a lot of this is -- a lot of this is negotiation. But I do think Boris Johnson talking tough on no deal is because he actually wants the European Union to make adjustments to the deal that Mrs. May put in place. And my argument is this. The deal May put in place, even with amendments, is still a terrible deal, is still the worst deal in history. And I'm going to go on campaigning for a clean-break Brexit. And when we're clean, we could, by Christmas, have sectoral trade agreements with the USA. How bad is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Nigel, I wonder, too, whether the Europeans are more worried about this than they let on. After all, it's a club that you don't want to be a part of. And you mentioned what's happening with some members like Greece and Italy and Portugal and Spain that are struggling as members of that European community. And maybe the Europeans fear, Belgium fears, more to the point, that you go, all bets are off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FARAGE",
      "utterance": "I think that's right. And I think us breaking free, us two years down the road being seen to do well will be the end of the European Union. And, of course, the European Union is at the heart of the globalist projects. And Brexit, Trump winning, these are all big blows back, big fight backs against globalism. Globalism is about losing your national democracy, losing your independence, losing control of your borders. So I think right at the moment, Neil, we are -- with this Brexit battle, we are on the front lines of something that doesn't just affect us. It affects America. It affects the whole of the Western world. And it's all propelled, pumped up by money from half-a-dozen giant multinational banks and businesses. It does not suit men and women who want to set up -- set up their own enterprises. It does not suit democracy that our forefathers made so much sacrifice to defend. I know, in my heart, that Brexit is the right thing. I know we're getting closer to it. I just want Boris Johnson to do it the right way."

      "utterance": "Real quickly, to Nigel's point, take a look at the corner of Wall and Broad today. We were up 258 points. If they're worried about this turning into some international crisis, they had a funny way of showing it. Among the issues advancing the most, financial issues, banks. Go figure. Meanwhile, a new poll out that shows the president still trails all the top Democratic contenders. That, of course, is not new. What is new is the grades he's getting on his single biggest issue, the economy. But be careful on any of this stuff. He wasn't even in those polls little more than a few years ago, and he became president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, it's way, way early, right? But we can can't help ourselves right in the media. President Trump trailing the top 2020 Democrats in a new Quinnipiac University poll, but, but, but if you look at another Quinnipiac poll from this same time frame leading right up to the 2016 election, then candidate Donald Trump was behind in hypothetical matchups back then, too. So would this, should this be a worry for the campaign, or is it simply too early to tell? To 2020 Advisory Trump Board executive Madison Gesiotto. We have also got RealClearPolitics' Tom Bevan, Democratic strategist Robin Biro. Help me with this, Madison. I mean, these are snapshots in time, like one snap, that it's shot. The image is gone. So we can't overstate it. But what do you make of what kind of battle could be ahead?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MADISON GESIOTTO, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they will definitely be a battle ahead. But, of course, when we look back at the polls in not only 2016, but those primary polls within the Republican Party nomination process in 2015, many people said that there was no chance Trump was going to win. The polls said that he was going to lose. And he won both that primary and that general election. So I don't really look to these polls to give me an accurate representation or potential result of what we will see next year. Of course, we're seeing the economy still doing very well. When it comes to job numbers, unemployment is remaining low, historic lows for women, for minorities in this country. Jobs are growing. We have seen over 5.5 million jobs created since Trump took office and 500,000 of those being manufacturing jobs, 600,000 women out of poverty, many people off food stamps. It's a great time to be an American right now, Neil."

And it's taken a couple of points off of Trump's job approval rating. It's taken a couple of points off his approval on the economy, although, in our average, he's still over 50 percent approval rating on the economy. But, look, this is all going to come down to how voters feel about the economy next August, next September, next October before they go to the -- before they go to the polls."

How do they feel about their wages? How do they feel about their bank accounts, their 401(k)s? And then what's the alternative? If they don't feel it's good, what's the alternative?

If you're the president overseeing a pretty strong economy, pretty strong markets, this doesn't jibe with any of that. So what do you have to do? Or if you look forward to the long campaign ahead, obviously, you need a challenger, a single individual to focus on. But we're a long way from that. But what do you think the president needs to do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GESIOTTO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, right now, the most important thing that the president and his team can be doing is to be out there and continuing to push strong messaging, not only on the economy, but on so many of the other issues that he's focused on, like immigration and so many others since 2017, things that he talked about during the 2015-2016 elections, promises made, promises kept. And that's something that we continue to talk about from the campaign, because it's something we haven't seen in years. We have so many Democrats out there talking about this upcoming recession. They have been talking about that since he won in 2016. We haven't seen a recession. I don't think a recession is likely. We even saw former Obama appointed Fed Chair Janet Yellen saying that she thinks it's very unlikely that we'd see a recession, and that the inverted yield curve that many people are speaking to specifically over the past week or two won't necessarily be a predictor in this case. So, I think we need to continue to push forward."

But having said that, Tom, do you think that the trade thing is a wild card here? Let's say we don't get a trade deal by the election. It's a problem for the president. Or is it a strength if it says, I'm not going to cave for just any deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "That's a good question. I mean, I do think Trump runs the risk of -- by pushing forward with this trade war, that it's going to hurt farmers, continue to hurt farmers in the Midwest, where he can't afford to lose those folks if he wants to win reelection. At the same time, he is pushing forward because that's one of his core promises, it's one of the reasons people elected him, and people generally agree with his policy. They just don't like his -- maybe the tactics that he's using. I would say, listen -- and I'm sure Trump's advisers are telling him this. And the FOX News poll confirmed it. One thing he can do is to -- is to sort of lay off the tweeting a little bit. It's not going to happen. But even among Trump supporters, more than 50 percent disapprove or want him to sort of lay off the tweeting, because that leads to this constant battle, public battle, whether it's with his Fed chairman or with foreign leaders, any of that stuff."

What you see in this imagery, for those that haven't looked at it, is you see a SINPO-class SSBA, which is a -- it's not a nuclear-powered submarine, but it certainly is one that has capabilities to fire sub-launched ballistic missiles, SLBMs. And if you stop and think about it, those are as dangerous as some of the intercontinental ballistic missiles, because the submarines can be moved anywhere, and they're very hard to track. But there's also a test barge that, when submerged, gives them the opportunity to test underwater SLBMs, in other words, test them like they would be on a submarine. So I think this is very significant. And I think that this has got to get the administration's attention."

Look, I think this is a serious situation, Neil. And I think that the Chinese are potentially right in the middle of it.

He said -- he came out and publicly said North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat. Well, that proved not to be the case. And he's seen nothing but resistance from Kim ever since. So I think that he knows what Kim is up to. I think he understands this. I think the problem is, the president hasn't yet figured out a way, nor have his advisers given him much, in terms of a way to back away from this, and really begin to call Kim out on this."

      "utterance": "All right, what the billionaire investor Ken Fisher was telling me on FOX Business, which, if you don't get, you should demand, is that these trade deals are outweighing some of the trade tiffs, notably with China, because we're scoring them left and right with countries that matter and not necessarily a soap opera that won't end and maybe doesn't matter in the scheme of things. The U.S. Trade Office, by the way, officially filing the paperwork to up tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, not all of them. Some will be pushed back a little bit. But a lot of them, from baby products to school supplies, will be marked up from a 10 percent tariff originally intended to 15 percent. And they, by and large, hit on September 1, another batch right before Christmas. So what happens here? Because if the markets were worried about any of this, they, as I said, had a funny way of showing. The Dow was up 258 points. Let's go to market watcher Troy Gayeski and our own jolting Deirdre Bolton. That's what I call her."

I mean, I was looking at August alone, and seven days, the Nasdaq has closed down by 1 percent. It's been five days for the S&P 500,four for the Dow. So, today, it's green on the screens. But, in general, this volatility is showing up. Today, we can just say, OK, they're up. But then we're also seeing these conflicting signals from the bond market as well. So I do think that there is some sign of worry that comes in on some days, whether you measure by volatility, whether you measure by the signals that the bond market is telling. But the worry is here, just not right this second."

So, in the past, it's been a very reliable indicator. We think it's less reliable now. And a lot of it has to do with, if you look at the domestic economy in the U.S. itself, the consumer is still in exceptional shape when you look at debt to GDP, debt to income, you look at the labor market. It's not white hot anymore, but it's still red hot."

The one thing I would add -- and I agree with you, Troy, about all these indications being positive for the U.S. economy -- I think the thing that I personally think about is that you mentioned the negative rates in Europe.

So that's just something that I monitor."

But the president ignoring that cost is wrong, because here's the thing about going to war. You better go in with eyes wide open, obviously rally the nation around winning that war, but do let them know there will be costs to that war. There always are. And that contrary to what the president has said, it will not be an easy war, and it won't be a wonderful war, because tariffs are not a wonderful thing. Tariffs are taxes on goods that you pay. Governments don't pay them. You do. China isn't sucking them up. You are. Now, the president says you have been spared the pain because China has been busy devaluing its currency, so you wouldn't even feel the pinch. But someone is paying the more than $30 billion in tariffs. And it is not Chinese buyers. It's not, well, any of them. It's American buyers. It's American distributors and retailers, not Chinese companies that do business with us, American companies that do business with China. They're the ones who have to pay up or suck it up. And, right now, they are sucking wind. They absorb what they can to avoid passing it along to you. But they can only do so much. And let's just say they can't do much more. And I'm not just talking American farmers, who have lost a bundle. I'm talking American companies that, if things don't change, will lose an even bigger bundle. Where is their relief? Where is your relief, especially now that they're facing -- let me rephrase that, what you're facing -- a whole new wave of tariffs that kick in come September 1, on everything from school supplies and sporting goods, to infant formula and meat and dairy products? They're days away from costing up to 15 percent more on your tab, not China's tab, from your wallet, not China's wallet, when you get to the register here, not when Chinese shoppers get to the register there, not them, you, not later, now. That is the pain Lindsey Graham is talking about. That is the pain he's acknowledging the president is not talking about. It's a pain Graham says is worth the fight."
