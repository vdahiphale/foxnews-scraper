This tells me based upon what we have not heard, that the verdict is unanimous, whether it's guilty or not guilty. It doesn't appear to be a hung jury. And of course, for a hung jury, all you need is one juror to not agree to the -- with the other 11. But it must be unanimous on every count beyond a reasonable doubt by all 12 jurors. Those jurors can be questioned individually about whether or not they agree with the verdict. And they will either -- they have to either assent or disagree. God forbid they disagree, then we're in a real mess. But yes, this is relatively quick, relatively quick. They got the case yesterday for two hours.

Everything was very quiet here today. Before the jury left yesterday, they had one simple question. They asked for a copy of the prosecution's calendar which had red X marks on it, indicating important dates in this case. Jussie Smollett, our understanding, is not in the courthouse yet. Every day during the trial, he would arrive locked arms with his elderly mother and his brothers and sisters. But today, Jussie and his team decided to wait until there was a verdict. Now, there is one. The judge told Smollett attorneys that he would like the attorneys and Smollett's team here within 30 minutes after the announcement of a verdict. So, we expect to see them perhaps walk into this building at any moment. Smollett is charged with six low-level phone accounts of lying to police. The prosecution and police say that represents a time. They feel that Jussie Smollett lie to them six different incidents. And there are varying charges here. There's long about hate crime because Jussie Smollett is a black gay man. There's lying about a battery because Smollett was injured. And there's lying about an aggravated battery because his attackers were marrying wearing masks. Smollett's lead attorney, Nenye Uche, he told the jury yesterday before they headed into the deliberation room that he \"wanted constitutional warriors in that deliberation room.\" The defense challenging the jury to accept that Jussie Smollett was a real hate crime victim. Smollett telling the jury that he still has a scar under one of his eyes and a permanent black eye as the result of his attack. The prosecution told the jury before they went into the deliberation room, that Smollett not only lied to police, but he also lied to them under oath. If convicted, Smollett faces up to three years in prison. As you have been mentioning, there is the possibility of probation and community service. We will keep you updated.",

We live in a country where Hanukkah and Christmas can stand together as equal partners, and I'm here to say that an act against Christianity is an act against Judaism."

And it doesn't appear that it's a hung jury because we would have heard of some charges to the jury to go back and deliberate, make sure you all agree. This tells me based upon what we have not heard, that the verdict is unanimous, whether it's guilty or not guilty. It doesn't appear to be a hung jury. And of course, for a hung jury, all you need is one juror to not agree to the -- with the other 11. But it must be unanimous on every count beyond a reasonable doubt by all 12 jurors. Those jurors can be questioned individually about whether or not they agree with the verdict. And they will either -- they have to either assent or disagree. God forbid they disagree, then we're in a real mess. But yes, this is relatively quick, relatively quick. They got the case yesterday for two hours. It's just enough time for them to figure out what rules are going to use, how they're going to break it up, how they're going to discuss the counts, and how they're going to go down the counts.

Now, apparently, there's like a film crew following him around. He wants to rehab his career. He's obviously a talented actor, but he's so delusional. He thinks he can go up there and sway this jury. The jury has looked at what, text messages, video evidence. They got the two eyewitnesses, the brothers, testifying against the guy. They got the police. The DA hammered him under cross-examination. This is a slam dunk case. Judge would know more about what the repercussions are going to be. They say he's got a clean record, this is a non-violent crime. But the fact that he wasted so many man-hours which costs so much money in the murder capital of the country, Chicago, spinning their wheels over some hate crime hoax when they could have been locking up real hardcore criminals, gang members, shooters, narcotics traffickers, to waste their time on this punk, the judge has to send a message here when they do the sentencing.

The jury deliberated for seven hours today, two hours yesterday, so about nine hours in total. We were not made aware of any questions or any difficulties today with the jury. Everything was very quiet here today. Before the jury left yesterday, they had one simple question. They asked for a copy of the prosecution's calendar which had red X marks on it, indicating important dates in this case. Jussie Smollett, our understanding, is not in the courthouse yet. Every day during the trial, he would arrive locked arms with his elderly mother and his brothers and sisters. But today, Jussie and his team decided to wait until there was a verdict. Now, there is one. The judge told Smollett attorneys that he would like the attorneys and Smollett's team here within 30 minutes after the announcement of a verdict. So, we expect to see them perhaps walk into this building at any moment. Smollett is charged with six low-level phone accounts of lying to police. The prosecution and police say that represents a time. They feel that Jussie Smollett lie to them six different incidents. And there are varying charges here. There's long about hate crime because Jussie Smollett is a black gay man. There's lying about a battery because Smollett was injured. And there's lying about an aggravated battery because his attackers were marrying wearing masks. Smollett's lead attorney, Nenye Uche, he told the jury yesterday before they headed into the deliberation room that he \"wanted constitutional warriors in that deliberation room.\" The defense challenging the jury to accept that Jussie Smollett was a real hate crime victim. Smollett telling the jury that he still has a scar under one of his eyes and a permanent black eye as the result of his attack. The prosecution told the jury before they went into the deliberation room, that Smollett not only lied to police, but he also lied to them under oath. If convicted, Smollett faces up to three years in prison. As you have been mentioning, there is the possibility of probation and community service. We will keep you updated."

So, there is that presence of you know Jussie and his family walking into the courthouse. And then, Smollett also had a large team with him, some activists here. Some who got in front of these very cameras and told news crews that they felt that the Chicago Police Department is racist, that they feel that the judge is biased. They were not holding back on it. They feel like that's why Jussie Smollett is here.

During direct examination, he was a very warm when he was talking about his mother and his siblings and his upbringing, talking about, you know, his craft and his love of his art. But then, during cross-examination, he got pretty snarky. He got pretty irritated. There were several times that the judge had to step in and tell him that he was only allowed to give yes or no answers to the prosecution. So, his mood varied uh greatly across the two days that he was on that stand. While he was in the courtroom, there were times that he was upset. There was times he would, you know, go back to his team and his attorneys during breaks and he would be very frustrated. You could see in his face it would turn red at times. And after almost every single break, one of the first things he did was immediately rush over to his elderly mother and put his arms around his elderly mother to comfort her, Jesse."

In fact, the eldest brother got up in front of these cameras and said it's very difficult to listen to their brother be charged with something that is false. And each and every day, nearly all of his siblings walked into this courtroom, sat in that courthouse, you know, they shook their heads in disbelief at times. So, at least on the surface, they are trying to send out the message in the visual that they do believe in their brother, they stand by their brother. There are social media accounts. I think it's called a coalition for Jussiee or something along those lines. They're trying to get that to gain traction each and every day. They're posting things on social media, suggesting what they think is inaccurate in this trial, you know, claiming that the Chicago police were lying, claiming that the Chicago police are racist. So, Jussie has built a coalition here. His family is definitely supporting him. At least the optics would suggest that, Dana."

You know, it's a long process. And you know what, jurors are very deliberative. They are really -- they try very hard. I really believe that in all the years that I did this. Whether I was the litigator or the judge, they try hard."

      "speaker": "FINN",
      "utterance": "Yes, we are waiting for Jussie Smollett. Dan Webb, the special prosecutor just walked by. I asked him if he had any comment. He obviously did not. The attorneys agreed not to make any comments as usual during the ongoing trial. We're waiting for Jussie Smollett. That 30-minute clock is ticking and the judge specifically said yesterday that he wanted everyone here within 30 minutes. He doesn't want to stick around once there is a verdict in. And this Judge, I will say throughout the trial, kept the jury here until as late as 8:00 at night. And this judge, Judge James Linn has been known to challenge the jury late into the evening hours. So, here we are at about 5:00. So, this is not that late for the judge. He would like to keep things moving. He did not like keeping people waiting. So, we expect to see Jussie Smollett at any moment."
    },

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "But Judge, would there be any consequences for him if he's late."
    },

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, no. I mean, the Judge is going to be smart enough if they're - - if they're -- if there is a verdict of guilty to not let this interfere with his final sentencing decision. But the judge will be furious because a judge who works until 8:00 at night is a judge who likes to move his calendar. That's the kind of judge who doesn't tolerate people being late especially people who are the very reason that everyone is being you know imposed upon in the first place."
