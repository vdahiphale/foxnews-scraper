So, we are living in a world run by idiots, where every day something more idiotic presents itself like a giddy polka dot-wearing moron blowing a kudzu out of his butt. It's like a parade of Swalwells. First, Arne Duncan. He was Obama's old education secretary. He's so stupid, he thinks SAT stands for sending asinine tweets. Like this one. I'll read it for you. \"Have you noticed how strikingly similar both the mindsets and actions between the suicide bombers at Kabul's airport and the anti-mask and anti- vax people here? They both blow themselves up, inflict harm on those around them, and are convinced they are fighting for freedom.\" That makes no sense. Have you noticed Arne Duncan is a complete jackass? And no, Arne, we didn't notice strikingly familiar mindsets between anti-maskers and terrorists, because we unlike you weren't oxygen-deprived at birth. At least a terrorist thinks he's going to be rewarded with 72 virgins. What's Duncan hoping for? 72 thumbs up from his Twitter followers. So, that was Obama's education secretary. Great pick there, champ. No wonder our education system sucks. At this point, Somalia is better. At least theirs produces high-quality pirates. It's a sad fact, the politicians, the experts, the people in charge are dumber than a cage full of monkeys flinging poop at each other. In the animal kingdom, that's called the Scarborough. Look at this graphic courtesy of The Times. It's a breakdown of all the military equipment we handed over to the Taliban. 65,000 machine guns, 360,000 assault rifles 126,000 pistols. You know that makes receiving 72 virgins look like a pair of socks. Only Biden could make Christmas come early for a horde of Islamic radicals. But Joe, you keep spoiling them like that, next year, they're going to want nukes. So, who made that decision? Someone way up there made that decision. How is that person not known? Even in pro-sports, if a player blows the Super Bowl, he or the head coach has to face the media right after the game. Where are the anonymous sources the media loves to quote with all the inside scoop behind this scandal? Remember, Trump would hit the bathroom, and CNN would say 10 nameless sources claiming he wiped with Sharman. But oddly here, none of our valiant reporters feel compelled anymore. It feels like some things are just off-limits now. Of course, Jake Sullivan, who looks like he just left tryouts for a high school production of Pippin, claims the president relied on military officials advised not to use the Bagram airport. And so, another buck gets passed. And this is an administration who said the buck stops with me. But the White House passes the buck around like it's a dear orgy.",

Even savages like the Taliban have to make things easy for sleepy Joe. They know any choice harder than Matlock or pudding makes him cranky. Rumor has it Joe said no to that because they wouldn't allow him to put a Baskin Robbins in the main terminal. Because you know, he likes ice cream. All right, I'll retire those ice cream jokes.

The job is hard and hard things make Joe angry, especially things that are hard enough to require chewing. Meanwhile, a Marine is fired for asking military leaders to accept accountability. He sacrificed a comfortable retirement to speak his mind. We know his name, Stuart Sheller. But we don't know the names of the people who made all of these awful decisions. Is it just Joe? That's possible. But how can one person make so many mistakes, choosing the wrong path at every twist and turn? He's like me when I grocery shop drunk. The crap I come home with makes no sense. Peanut butter and carrots, and you should see the stuff I eat. And now that it's gotten real bad, they're hiding behind one word, consensus. Not to be confused with consensual, in case Andrew Cuomo is watching. But you know what consensus is? It's fake. Because anyone who doesn't agree with their decision is dropped from the consensus. So, the consensus is always at 100 percent. But I guess, if you get a hit at your very first at-bat, you could say you batted a thousand, but we know it's garbage. And it's this consensus that shields the idiots from accountability. Even though consensus is made up of 100 percent idiots. The Marine who just got fired chose to show them what accountability looks like. He did the right thing. And in the Biden regime, that means he had to pay the price.",

So, according to the American Psychological Association, the poll found that the average gain was about 15 pounds, and that the most common causes were comfort foods, too much booze, and not enough exercise. Worse, adults aren't the only ones affected.

The upside jolliness also increased by 40 percent.

So, we are living in a world run by idiots, where every day something more idiotic presents itself like a giddy polka dot-wearing moron blowing a kudzu out of his butt. It's like a parade of Swalwells. First, Arne Duncan. He was Obama's old education secretary. He's so stupid, he thinks SAT stands for sending asinine tweets. Like this one. I'll read it for you. \"Have you noticed how strikingly similar both the mindsets and actions between the suicide bombers at Kabul's airport and the anti-mask and anti- vax people here? They both blow themselves up, inflict harm on those around them, and are convinced they are fighting for freedom.\" That makes no sense. Have you noticed Arne Duncan is a complete jackass? And no, Arne, we didn't notice strikingly familiar mindsets between anti-maskers and terrorists, because we unlike you weren't oxygen-deprived at birth. At least a terrorist thinks he's going to be rewarded with 72 virgins. What's Duncan hoping for? 72 thumbs up from his Twitter followers. So, that was Obama's education secretary. Great pick there, champ. No wonder our education system sucks. At this point, Somalia is better. At least theirs produces high-quality pirates. It's a sad fact, the politicians, the experts, the people in charge are dumber than a cage full of monkeys flinging poop at each other. In the animal kingdom, that's called the Scarborough. Look at this graphic courtesy of The Times. It's a breakdown of all the military equipment we handed over to the Taliban. 65,000 machine guns, 360,000 assault rifles 126,000 pistols. You know that makes receiving 72 virgins look like a pair of socks. Only Biden could make Christmas come early for a horde of Islamic radicals. But Joe, you keep spoiling them like that, next year, they're going to want nukes. So, who made that decision? Someone way up there made that decision. How is that person not known? Even in pro-sports, if a player blows the Super Bowl, he or the head coach has to face the media right after the game. Where are the anonymous sources the media loves to quote with all the inside scoop behind this scandal? Remember, Trump would hit the bathroom, and CNN would say 10 nameless sources claiming he wiped with Sharman. But oddly here, none of our valiant reporters feel compelled anymore. It feels like some things are just off-limits now. Of course, Jake Sullivan, who looks like he just left tryouts for a high school production of Pippin, claims the president relied on military officials advised not to use the Bagram airport. And so, another buck gets passed. And this is an administration who said the buck stops with me. But the White House passes the buck around like it's a dear orgy."

Even savages like the Taliban have to make things easy for sleepy Joe. They know any choice harder than Matlock or pudding makes him cranky. Rumor has it Joe said no to that because they wouldn't allow him to put a Baskin Robbins in the main terminal. Because you know, he likes ice cream. All right, I'll retire those ice cream jokes.

The job is hard and hard things make Joe angry, especially things that are hard enough to require chewing. Meanwhile, a Marine is fired for asking military leaders to accept accountability. He sacrificed a comfortable retirement to speak his mind. We know his name, Stuart Sheller. But we don't know the names of the people who made all of these awful decisions. Is it just Joe? That's possible. But how can one person make so many mistakes, choosing the wrong path at every twist and turn? He's like me when I grocery shop drunk. The crap I come home with makes no sense. Peanut butter and carrots, and you should see the stuff I eat. And now that it's gotten real bad, they're hiding behind one word, consensus. Not to be confused with consensual, in case Andrew Cuomo is watching. But you know what consensus is? It's fake. Because anyone who doesn't agree with their decision is dropped from the consensus. So, the consensus is always at 100 percent. But I guess, if you get a hit at your very first at-bat, you could say you batted a thousand, but we know it's garbage. And it's this consensus that shields the idiots from accountability. Even though consensus is made up of 100 percent idiots. The Marine who just got fired chose to show them what accountability looks like. He did the right thing. And in the Biden regime, that means he had to pay the price."

My overwhelming feeling when I saw that banner come across the screen that were out was just sheer relief, frankly, for the ones that were still there. Considering the way it had been conducted over the last couple of weeks. The ad hoc manner in which decisions were made that put us surrounded by the Taliban -- at the behest of the Taliban. And then we had Marines reaching over that barrier, trying to pull in people we promised we wouldn't leave behind.

So, according to the American Psychological Association, the poll found that the average gain was about 15 pounds, and that the most common causes were comfort foods, too much booze, and not enough exercise. Worse, adults aren't the only ones affected. Another study found that number of five through 11-year-olds that were overweight or obese increased from 36.2 percent and 45.7 percent during the pandemic.

Fat shaming is saying that someone's a bad person or less than as a person because of their weight, but it's the truth that's going to be the truth.

I'm honestly speechless, because I've been out night after night helping Americans get out. And they're still there, Greg. I was on the phone this morning with two American citizens and their children outside the gate of Kabul International."

And here's the other thing, right, is now they're saying well, we have leverage; we have foreign capital and reserves and we have all these things, the Taliban want. You know, who has the leverage or the Taliban in the form of hundreds of Americans we just gave them on a silver platter. So, last I checked, when you're paying billions or allowing them access to billions in exchange for Americans to be let freed, that's a ransom. And we're -- so Biden's strategy is now we're going to pay ransom to terrorists to get the rest of our Americans out. It's, it's again, it's outrageous."

Do you believe -- I mean, what you just told me clearly, they don't want to be there. But I mean, sure, maybe there are some there that have family there, but what do you say to that when they keep saying a lot of them want to be there."

We're trapped. We're stranded.\" And right now we're faced because he shut down the airfield and wouldn't keep the troops there. So, he kept his promises to the Taliban, but he broke his promises to the American citizens, now we're having to smuggle them out. It's incredibly dangerous, and that blood is -- that bloods on Biden's hands. We're going to make sure of it."

There's a lot of small ones that are like not using the right airport, not Taliban offering to let you take control of the other airport -- is it just Biden or who is this that's making these?"

We had, you know -- we had that pull out of Iraq that led to the rise of ISIS. We have the Iran deal. At the end of the day, this is a group of, of academics and political scientists without a speck of dirt under their fingernails. I've actually had to deal with terrorists that think if we just give enough, if we concede enough, right, if we if we make enough concessions if we're nice enough to them, there'll be nice back. And, and you know this, that's why we are where we are. So, it's that crew. It's Blinken. It's Finer. It's Sullivan. By the way you got Susan Wright and Carrie lurking in the background. It's all the same crowd making, making disaster after disaster after disastrous decision."

      "speaker": "WALTZ",
      "utterance": "No, not, not for a second, and the intelligence is clear that al- Qaeda and the Taliban are tied to the hip. They fully intend to come roaring back and hit America again. You know, Greg, it's not like they're running around out there with different jerseys on saying, I'm on this team or I'm on that team. They're all intermarried. They all have different allegiances. Sometimes they're fighting, sometimes together, but they have one, one clear goal and that's attacking the West and killing Americans, period. So, that's just you know, that's just a joke. And Biden's own intelligence people are telling us this but you're going to hear them try to craft this narrative of we have good terrorists and moderate terrorists that work with us against the bad terrorists."
