And nothing is going to happen on the border on immigration reform until the border is secure. You can't even have the conversation. And for some peculiar reason they just refuse to deal with it. She was in Austin last week doing a fundraiser on abortion rights. She's literally there and she doesn't do anything. Her idea of leadership is to say the other side needs to come up with a solution. What? That's like the opposite in the dictionary of what leadership is. Leaders propose solutions or she's in a power to -- in a position to convene. There's power in that, to be able to say you, you, and you, I want you at the White House on Monday morning, 8:00. We're having a meeting. I'm briefing the president at 10:00. We have to come up with four solutions. Something like, she could do that. She could travel if she wanted to. Remember this big announcement that she made that all these companies were going to save the root causes of the problem because they were going to put a bunch of businesses down there. Do you think anybody is doing that? And what reporter has followed up to see if that's actually happened? No one. She's got power. She doesn't use it. And instead of doing a real interview, they go on a comedy show, which I love. There's a time and a place for it.

They haven't made a single indictment since they launched it. Also, the State Department just issued a travel warning for Belize because gangs have taken over the country. Guatemala is now a narco state and they're suspending constitutional rights. El Salvador, most violent country in the world, first lady of Honduras was just arrested for fraud, and the foreign minister of Panama say we have a problem with the migrants so they fired her. Everything in Central America has gotten worse. Nothing she has done there has helped. The cartels are now making record profits -- $13 billion last year. They've shattered all time border crossing records two years in a row. They've lost track of 20,000 migrant kids. They lost track after they handed them to sponsors which are basically perverts. Fentanyl overdoses are at an all-time high. And I think that at least like two dozen jurisdictions, red and blue, have declared national or emergencies, state of emergencies because of the migrant crisis. And she said this is Trump's fault. And the way to fix the problem at the border is amnesty. That's like poking holes in a boat and saying you're fixing the boat.",

If you do think that this whole game of busing people back and forth is disgusting, which I happen to think and I don't like that Eric Adams sent people down there, and like Greg Abbott and Governor Ducey send them up here or Ron DeSantis. And you know, Tim Ryan, he's an anti-establishment guy. That's not a big deal for Tim Ryan to say that. And frankly, it helps him in Ohio, right, in that debate last night. He wanted to say I vote for the things that I agree with and I stand for Ohio on the things that I don't think help our state. But people just glaze over and I've watch this downturn in terms of Democratic support on the issue of immigration. Even just a couple weeks ago, we were up one, you know, one or two points, and now we're underwater and everything that's come out on the last seven days or so on the issue of immigration. And it's picking up an order of importance kind of parallel to what's going on with crime and policing. Now, it will never be inflation and the economy, but if you allow people the opportunity to discount everything that you say after the border is secure, they do not know what your position is. They can't tell you what the policies are to fix it. And I'm not saying they wake up and say build a wall, that's not going to happen.

Well, excuse me, wasn't Joe Biden a segregationist when you were debating him in the debates for presidency? And then she said -- she talks about him, she says having been vice president, he knows what the job involves. She's basically selling herself to you saying because he was vice president, he can be a good president. So, I could be a good president, too, but everybody knows joe is a disaster and you're a disaster, too. So, if she used any energy at all in trying to deal with the issue, whether it is dead people, 800 of them so far, young people, children coming over the border, people coming in with COVID, fentanyl, anything, Americans suffering at the hands of those illegals, not all of them, but there is certainly a percentage who are criminals.

But this is one of the things that has happened to somebody like a Tim Ryan in Ohio. So, the Democrats are saying, their position and one of the reasons I think Tulsi Gabbard wanted to leave the party is that you're either for all of the things that the Democrats stand for, or you can't be with us. And if you say, well, the teachers' union seem to have too much power or I think that it I don't like this little bit or this little bit. All of a sudden, you're then ostracized. Tim Ryan in Ohio, he's got a pretty competitive race against J.D. Vance. But J.D. Vance is pulling away. And partly it's because the Democrats will not put any resources into Ohio.

Here you are, the first woman vice president of the United States, you're given the toughest assignment and you take a pass. And nothing is going to happen on the border on immigration reform until the border is secure. You can't even have the conversation. And for some peculiar reason they just refuse to deal with it. She was in Austin last week doing a fundraiser on abortion rights. She's literally there and she doesn't do anything. Her idea of leadership is to say the other side needs to come up with a solution. What? That's like the opposite in the dictionary of what leadership is. Leaders propose solutions or she's in a power to -- in a position to convene. There's power in that, to be able to say you, you, and you, I want you at the White House on Monday morning, 8:00. We're having a meeting. I'm briefing the president at 10:00. We have to come up with four solutions. Something like, she could do that. She could travel if she wanted to. Remember this big announcement that she made that all these companies were going to save the root causes of the problem because they were going to put a bunch of businesses down there. Do you think anybody is doing that? And what reporter has followed up to see if that's actually happened? No one. She's got power. She doesn't use it. And instead of doing a real interview, they go on a comedy show, which I love. There's a time and a place for it. But if you are facing all of these crises and 80 percent of Americans think you're on the wrong track, I'm not sure Seth Meyers' show is the right place to go and try to deliver a message."

We have not found any evidence that any of these companies spent any money in central America. In fact, they launched this an anti-corruption task force. They haven't made a single indictment since they launched it. Also, the State Department just issued a travel warning for Belize because gangs have taken over the country. Guatemala is now a narco state and they're suspending constitutional rights. El Salvador, most violent country in the world, first lady of Honduras was just arrested for fraud, and the foreign minister of Panama say we have a problem with the migrants so they fired her. Everything in Central America has gotten worse. Nothing she has done there has helped. The cartels are now making record profits -- $13 billion last year. They've shattered all time border crossing records two years in a row. They've lost track of 20,000 migrant kids. They lost track after they handed them to sponsors which are basically perverts. Fentanyl overdoses are at an all-time high. And I think that at least like two dozen jurisdictions, red and blue, have declared national or emergencies, state of emergencies because of the migrant crisis. And she said this is Trump's fault. And the way to fix the problem at the border is amnesty. That's like poking holes in a boat and saying you're fixing the boat."

But when you say the border isn't secure, when everyone can see what's going on, everyone tunes out at that point, even if you do agree with the Democratic position that we need more judges down there and we need more facilities to make sure that it's safer. If you do think that this whole game of busing people back and forth is disgusting, which I happen to think and I don't like that Eric Adams sent people down there, and like Greg Abbott and Governor Ducey send them up here or Ron DeSantis. And you know, Tim Ryan, he's an anti-establishment guy. That's not a big deal for Tim Ryan to say that. And frankly, it helps him in Ohio, right, in that debate last night. He wanted to say I vote for the things that I agree with and I stand for Ohio on the things that I don't think help our state. But people just glaze over and I've watch this downturn in terms of Democratic support on the issue of immigration. Even just a couple weeks ago, we were up one, you know, one or two points, and now we're underwater and everything that's come out on the last seven days or so on the issue of immigration. And it's picking up an order of importance kind of parallel to what's going on with crime and policing. Now, it will never be inflation and the economy, but if you allow people the opportunity to discount everything that you say after the border is secure, they do not know what your position is. They can't tell you what the policies are to fix it. And I'm not saying they wake up and say build a wall, that's not going to happen. But they certainly don't think that you're serious on the issue."

So, it doesn't matter whether that stops someone from hearing the other thing she's saying because you know right then and there that she's lying. And then she says I love Joe Biden. Well, excuse me, wasn't Joe Biden a segregationist when you were debating him in the debates for presidency? And then she said -- she talks about him, she says having been vice president, he knows what the job involves. She's basically selling herself to you saying because he was vice president, he can be a good president. So, I could be a good president, too, but everybody knows joe is a disaster and you're a disaster, too. So, if she used any energy at all in trying to deal with the issue, whether it is dead people, 800 of them so far, young people, children coming over the border, people coming in with COVID, fentanyl, anything, Americans suffering at the hands of those illegals, not all of them, but there is certainly a percentage who are criminals. Now, we've got the drug artery. She can't articulate any of that. She deserves not to be, you know, the first female vice president. It is an insult to women who are in power."

Let me tell you something, I give her credit for calling out what happened with the Democratic Party, the DNC when Bernie Sanders was edged out by Hillary Clinton when she got the questions from what's her name, who said that we were criticizing her because she was a good Christian woman. What's her name? Donna Brazile. I mean, let's talk Turkey. You want to talk Turkey? Let's talk Turkey.

And we had suggested that Democrats distance themselves from somebody like Randi Weingarten. Now, sending her to Ukraine might have been a little bit of a step too far. But this is one of the things that has happened to somebody like a Tim Ryan in Ohio. So, the Democrats are saying, their position and one of the reasons I think Tulsi Gabbard wanted to leave the party is that you're either for all of the things that the Democrats stand for, or you can't be with us. And if you say, well, the teachers' union seem to have too much power or I think that it I don't like this little bit or this little bit. All of a sudden, you're then ostracized. Tim Ryan in Ohio, he's got a pretty competitive race against J.D. Vance. But J.D. Vance is pulling away. And partly it's because the Democrats will not put any resources into Ohio.

Why aren't you worried about American children who have lost more ground in the last 30 years in -- compared to in the last two years than in the last 30 years? Our own schools are understaffed.

And yes, he was president of a small religious school in Nebraska, but this is a 50,000-person research university. And I do think the strongest argument against Ben Sasse is not his politics, but the fact that he has, excuse me, no background in doing this. The last three presidents of the University of Florida had all had experience managing a research university. It is very different. I think that they should have led with that. But students saying that they want someone in a position of power like that to represent the same values as them, that seems pretty normal to me.

And I always try to think to myself, does protest make people ugly or do ugly people protest? So, I did some research. I sent some people down to that group and it turned out very unattractive people. Oh, yes. It's disgusting, Dana. I feel very bad for them. I tried to send them some tips on hygiene and makeup, but they don't listen to me. I think it's time for national spanking, right? Students get lined up and people who paid off their student loans get to spank them. How about that? By the way, to your point, this concept -- you know, it used to be -- and I'm joking. Not real spanking although I thought about it. College was never supposed to be a safe space, right? You're supposed to be challenged by ideas. It's supposed to be unsafe for you, for your brain and change your mind. Sadly, though, this is not just staying on the campuses. People like that are graduating and they're going to the companies, whether it's Spotify, like Rogan or they go to Google or Apple. Remember the Apple people didn't want to go to work."
