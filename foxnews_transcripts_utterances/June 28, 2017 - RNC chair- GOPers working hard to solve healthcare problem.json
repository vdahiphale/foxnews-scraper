And he's having conversations. The president heard it. He was in states like Michigan, and Wisconsin, and Iowa. He was all over this country. He saw this firsthand, the suffering that is happening because of ObamaCare."

      "utterance": "But he also said of the first attempt at this on the part of the House that it was mean. Now, I know what he meant, stepping back from it here. So, he doesn't want a mean measure, which can easily be interpreted by some that he wants one that could be a tad more expensive. Do you subscribe to that?"

They allow for children up to 26 to stay on their parents' insurance. I shouldn't say children. Adults up to 26 to stay on their parents' assurance -- insurance. All of these things we have to do, we wanted to have a transition, so that the people are not hurt as this transition takes place from a failing health care system to one that is sustainable that will actually restore patient-doctor relationship, that will bring down premiums and bring health care closer to the people."

      "speaker": "ROMNEY MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "Well, I would worry if this doesn't work out because ObamaCare is failing and collapsing. I don't think not finding a solution is an option. We have to put something out there that is going to help these people."
