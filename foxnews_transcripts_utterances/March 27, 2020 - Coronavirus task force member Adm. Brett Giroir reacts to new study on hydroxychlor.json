      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is still demanding the 30,000 ventilators. But does he really need that many? What does that say? Rudy Giuliani is here on that and state's preparedness in general. Plus, you'd think that Pelosi and her friends would be thrilled with the $2 trillion, with a T, aid package, but no, that's just a drop in the bucket, you see. You're not going to believe what the left with the tin cup out still wants money for. We're going to expose it all with Congressman Lee Zeldin. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Joe Biden is the gift that keeps on gaffing? Yes. It's time for \"Friday Follies\" with Raymond Arroyo, and boy, do we need that tonight. And in moments, we're going to talk to Admiral Brett Giroir from the White House Coronavirus Task Force. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, welcome to the end of day-11. Seems like day-50 of our national shutdown because of a virus that arrived here via China. The President officially activated his authority under the Defense Production Act on the issue of ventilator production today. But GM had earlier pledged to manufacture ventilators without a government edict, but the White House wasn't happy with the details. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The modeling for this disease has been revised downward, as you'll recall. Well, there is an enormous amount of disagreement regarding some of the very high estimates for ventilator and ICU bed needs in the United States, especially in those hardest hit areas. Now, remember, the concern about this virus, in addition to the claims of mortality rate, was always that the virus would overwhelm and even maybe collapse our medical system. And there are good indications, however, now that even in New York City - again, where things are so tough - the system will bend but not break when all is said and done. And that would be a very good thing. Now, earlier in the day, Governor Andrew Cuomo defended his ventilator projections. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Well, maybe you don't need 30,000. Well, look, I don't have a crystal ball. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion. But I don't operate here on opinion. I operate on facts and on data and on numbers and on projections. All the projections say you could have an apex needing 140,000 beds and about 40,000 ventilators. Now, New York remains at the epicenter of the COVID spread, adding 3,585 cases today. That's up from the state's previous 24-hour period. Other hot spots like New Orleans and LA are chalking up significant increases. LA has seen 678 new cases in the last 48 hours. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } New Orleans now has the most positive cases per capita of any U.S. city. But it's important to note, as we discussed this tonight, in New York, the rate of hospitalization required for those testing positive continues to decline. That's a good thing. And a new study - this is really big. This just broke tonight -from the French research team that was led by the renowned epidemiologist, Didier Raoult, just posted online, this study offers more hope that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is helping COVID-19 patients. Now, this was a study of 80 patients, more than double the size Professor Oz's (ph) earlier study had, but it's still not controlled. Nevertheless, 54 of the patients had CT scans for COVID pneumonia. Only three of them required an ICU, and the median age was 52, that's fairly young. About two- thirds or so had underlying medical conditions, and the results were stunning. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is what it said, in part. \"By administrating hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, we were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86 and in whom the evolution was irreversible. For all other patients in this cohort of 80 people, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin resulted in a clinical improvement that appeared significant when compared to the natural evolution in patients with a definite outcome, as described in the literature.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, there's a lot to this. We're going to run through this with \"The Ingraham Angle\" medicine cabinet, as I'd like to call them, our medical experts, in just a few moments. And there also seems to be good news on the mortality rate front. Now, it may not be high as originally thought. We talked about that denominator. The bigger the denominator gets of people who are tested, the more information we are finding out about the true mortality numbers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, a little over three weeks ago, the World Health Organization initially pegged the Wuhan virus's fatality rate at 3.4 percent. That is a staggering number. And that - it means, again, the total number of deaths divided by the total number of people who tested positive. Now, it varies by country, and it depends how many people are tested, though. Well, in the United States right now, it stands at about 1.4 percent mortality rate, and we're still ramping up testing, although testing is sky-high now compared, of course, to the way it was just a few weeks ago. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In Germany, where they've been testing 500,000 people a week, if you can believe it, the mortality rate is 0.5 percent. Now, it's critical to remember, the WHO's figure leaves out, doesn't include, people with minimal symptoms or who are asymptomatic. That means they didn't have any symptoms at all and just walked around undiagnosed. So, figuring out that number is crucial to determining how deadly the coronavirus really is. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So what do scientists think here? Well, this is from Dr. Fauci, who wrote last month, \"If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1 percent,\" and \"COVID-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of the severe seasonal influenza pandemic.\" Well, the seasonal flu's mortality rate is just 0.1 percent. So, again, we've gone from possibly 3.4 percent, which is millions dying, to perhaps closer to 0.1 percent. Do you see why it's important to let the data come in? Even CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta had to admit today that as bad as things can get, and they are getting pretty bad, especially in New York and some of these other hot spots, we do need to keep our perspective here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They need our support, they need to see their leaders, state, local, federal - again, safe distances. And they need our prayers. There's going to be a time for a full analysis in the end of all this - after all of this is, I hope, behind us. Who was prepared? Who wasn't? Which mistakes were made? Which weren't? Which states responded properly, made the right calculations or revised them, and which didn't? And which projections were right and which were wrong? But already we're seeing that there is ample evidence, at times, to question the experts, who had everyone freaking out that millions of Americans could be dead by summer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In the meantime, let's keep going in the right direction, move forward. And when necessary, if necessary, revise our data, revise our outlook, and revise our plans so we can restart our country at some point, we hope, very soon. And those are my thoughts at the end of America's shutdown, day 11. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, joining me now is Admiral Brett Giroir, who is the White House Coronavirus Task Force member, Assistant Secretary for Health at HHS. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Admiral, I need to ask you about this brand new study. I know you're not an epidemiologist, but you just heard me talk about it. It's not controlled, but it is clear from this - the renowned epidemiologist and his team in Marseille that this hydroxy-azithro combo seems to be working. So why are doctors and nurses and pharmacists today getting mixed messages, at times, from the administration on the need for a controlled study?",

And it is perfectly reasonable for a physician with a patient, particularly one being sick, to prescribe that. And as you described, the study that was published tonight was on 80 patients.

Plus, you'd think that Pelosi and her friends would be thrilled with the $2 trillion, with a T, aid package, but no, that's just a drop in the bucket, you see. You're not going to believe what the left with the tin cup out still wants money for. We're going to expose it all with Congressman Lee Zeldin. And Joe Biden is the gift that keeps on gaffing? Yes. It's time for \"Friday Follies\" with Raymond Arroyo, and boy, do we need that tonight. And in moments, we're going to talk to Admiral Brett Giroir from the White House Coronavirus Task Force. But first, welcome to the end of day-11. Seems like day-50 of our national shutdown because of a virus that arrived here via China. The President officially activated his authority under the Defense Production Act on the issue of ventilator production today. But GM had earlier pledged to manufacture ventilators without a government edict, but the White House wasn't happy with the details. The modeling for this disease has been revised downward, as you'll recall. Well, there is an enormous amount of disagreement regarding some of the very high estimates for ventilator and ICU bed needs in the United States, especially in those hardest hit areas. Now, remember, the concern about this virus, in addition to the claims of mortality rate, was always that the virus would overwhelm and even maybe collapse our medical system. And there are good indications, however, now that even in New York City - again, where things are so tough - the system will bend but not break when all is said and done. And that would be a very good thing. Now, earlier in the day, Governor Andrew Cuomo defended his ventilator projections."

      "utterance": "Well, maybe you don't need 30,000. Well, look, I don't have a crystal ball. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion. But I don't operate here on opinion. I operate on facts and on data and on numbers and on projections. All the projections say you could have an apex needing 140,000 beds and about 40,000 ventilators. Now, New York remains at the epicenter of the COVID spread, adding 3,585 cases today. That's up from the state's previous 24-hour period. Other hot spots like New Orleans and LA are chalking up significant increases. LA has seen 678 new cases in the last 48 hours. New Orleans now has the most positive cases per capita of any U.S. city. But it's important to note, as we discussed this tonight, in New York, the rate of hospitalization required for those testing positive continues to decline. That's a good thing. And a new study - this is really big. This just broke tonight -from the French research team that was led by the renowned epidemiologist, Didier Raoult, just posted online, this study offers more hope that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is helping COVID-19 patients. Now, this was a study of 80 patients, more than double the size Professor Oz's (ph) earlier study had, but it's still not controlled. Nevertheless, 54 of the patients had CT scans for COVID pneumonia. Only three of them required an ICU, and the median age was 52, that's fairly young. About two- thirds or so had underlying medical conditions, and the results were stunning. This is what it said, in part. \"By administrating hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, we were able to observe an improvement in all cases, except in one patient who arrived with an advanced form, who was over the age of 86 and in whom the evolution was irreversible. For all other patients in this cohort of 80 people, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin resulted in a clinical improvement that appeared significant when compared to the natural evolution in patients with a definite outcome, as described in the literature.\" Now, there's a lot to this. We're going to run through this with \"The Ingraham Angle\" medicine cabinet, as I'd like to call them, our medical experts, in just a few moments. And there also seems to be good news on the mortality rate front. Now, it may not be high as originally thought. We talked about that denominator. The bigger the denominator gets of people who are tested, the more information we are finding out about the true mortality numbers. So, a little over three weeks ago, the World Health Organization initially pegged the Wuhan virus's fatality rate at 3.4 percent. That is a staggering number. And that - it means, again, the total number of deaths divided by the total number of people who tested positive. Now, it varies by country, and it depends how many people are tested, though. Well, in the United States right now, it stands at about 1.4 percent mortality rate, and we're still ramping up testing, although testing is sky-high now compared, of course, to the way it was just a few weeks ago. In Germany, where they've been testing 500,000 people a week, if you can believe it, the mortality rate is 0.5 percent. Now, it's critical to remember, the WHO's figure leaves out, doesn't include, people with minimal symptoms or who are asymptomatic. That means they didn't have any symptoms at all and just walked around undiagnosed. So, figuring out that number is crucial to determining how deadly the coronavirus really is. So what do scientists think here? Well, this is from Dr. Fauci, who wrote last month, \"If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1 percent,\" and \"COVID-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of the severe seasonal influenza pandemic.\" Well, the seasonal flu's mortality rate is just 0.1 percent. So, again, we've gone from possibly 3.4 percent, which is millions dying, to perhaps closer to 0.1 percent. Do you see why it's important to let the data come in? Even CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta had to admit today that as bad as things can get, and they are getting pretty bad, especially in New York and some of these other hot spots, we do need to keep our perspective here."

I think it's a good thing when I go over there and I say thank you - it doesn't mean I'm going to be hugging people and it doesn't mean that I'm going to be shaking people's hands. But I think it sends a signal, when the President is able to go there and say thank you-- The medical community, coast-to-coast, you think about the first responders, they are working in these hazardous conditions. They need our support, they need to see their leaders, state, local, federal - again, safe distances. And they need our prayers. There's going to be a time for a full analysis in the end of all this - after all of this is, I hope, behind us. Who was prepared? Who wasn't? Which mistakes were made? Which weren't? Which states responded properly, made the right calculations or revised them, and which didn't? And which projections were right and which were wrong? But already we're seeing that there is ample evidence, at times, to question the experts, who had everyone freaking out that millions of Americans could be dead by summer. In the meantime, let's keep going in the right direction, move forward. And when necessary, if necessary, revise our data, revise our outlook, and revise our plans so we can restart our country at some point, we hope, very soon. And those are my thoughts at the end of America's shutdown, day 11. Now, joining me now is Admiral Brett Giroir, who is the White House Coronavirus Task Force member, Assistant Secretary for Health at HHS. Admiral, I need to ask you about this brand new study. I know you're not an epidemiologist, but you just heard me talk about it. It's not controlled, but it is clear from this - the renowned epidemiologist and his team in Marseille that this hydroxy-azithro combo seems to be working. So why are doctors and nurses and pharmacists today getting mixed messages, at times, from the administration on the need for a controlled study?"

      "utterance": "Well, thank you, Laura. It's great to be here. I don't think there is mixed messages at all. In order to be absolutely certain that the drug combination works or one of the other drugs work, sure, you need a controlled study. But hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are both approved medications in the United States. And it is perfectly reasonable for a physician with a patient, particularly one being sick, to prescribe that. And as you described, the study that was published tonight was on 80 patients. It was not controlled. But it's again another piece of suggestive evidence that hydroxychloroquine or its related drug, chloroquine, has antiviral properties, and we need to look at that seriously."

      "utterance": "But this is where you see this - the tension, Admiral, in the medical community. People are not sure what to do because you have governors issuing these edicts. I mean, it's scary for these physicians and pharmacists saying, you may not administer this in an off-label use manner if you're not part of a controlled study. And I'm talking to infectious disease doctors every day and from around the world, not just in the United States. This is their go-to combo in most patients. Period."

That just means that it hasn't gone through the 10 years of study to be absolutely approved by the FDA. And it's all about risk-benefit. I'm an intensive care physician. It's different if you have a young, healthy person who is mildly ill. Sure, you don't want to give them a drug that hasn't been proven. But if you have a person who is in an ICU or who is ill or has risk factors and you have a drug that may work, that we have dozens of years of experience with, it's a very reasonable option. And I think that's a decision between the doctor and the patient and the patient's family. And that's the way it should be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Admiral, let's see interesting things in other countries as well. Really cool stuff coming out of Iceland. Germany, as well. They've done a lot of random testing of people, and a lot of testing. And as they do more testing, they're finding that a lot of people are building up, perhaps, herd immunity to this disease, and also, assuming that these numbers are correct, that the mortality rate is not as horrific as perhaps originally thought. Your view on that so far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIROIR",
      "utterance": "I lose track of time, but it's been probably four or five weeks after I briefed Congress with Secretary Azar. I came out in an interview and they asked me what the mortality rate was right after the WHO said 3 to 4 percent. And I said, all the models suggest it's between 0.1 and 1 percent, and it's probably somewhere in the middle of that, because, as you said, we have a denominator problem. In other countries, they only tested just the sickest. So if you just test the sickest, the mortality is higher. So I think it is tracking. And I don't mean to minimize it. A mortality rate of 0.2 or 0.4 percent is still very dangerous. And whatever the number is, we do need to be careful because we know that the elderly or those with chronic conditions may have a much higher mortality rate. But I think it's right. We've all said it. Dr. Fauci said it. I said it. All of these CDC models suggest that the mortality is going to be much lower than what 1 percent."

The one interesting stat of our group, our experience, is that we've had 53 patients so far, 10 of which have begun intubated. Of everybody that's been intubated, that means put on a ventilator, as done so within the first 36 hours, I mean, no patient has gone three days of treatment with these drugs and been intubated afterwards.

And Dr. Adalja, another important part of this study is the following. \"In addition to its direct therapeutic role, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin can play a role in controlling the disease epidemic by limiting the duration of virus-shedding, which can last for several weeks, in the absence of specific treatment.\" Dr. Adalja, what about this virus-shedding, the shortening of that time? How significant is that? AMESH ADALJA, INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR & SENIOR SCHOLAR, JOHNS HOPKINS: Well, we know the viral-shedding is what's driving transmission. And anything that can cut down on viral-shedding is going to be something beneficial to controlling the outbreak. I think it's important to do this in a controlled manner with drugs like hydroxychloroquine to see if this actually is something that's a result of hydroxychloroquine or the natural course of the disease. But we know that hydroxychloroquine does have antiviral effects in vitro, and it will be important to see if that can be translated into a patient benefit. And everybody is hopeful that it will be."

All the patients are coming in with the newly diagnosed COVID are having symptoms for seven to 10 days or more. So this is not a - the social distancing is working.

I think you could ask President Bush to this day, I don't think there's a single thing I asked him for he didn't give me right away.

I happen to represent a district right in the middle of this outbreak in New York. I'm on Long Island, that where I'm speaking to you from tonight. Unfortunately, on the other side of the isle, I have some colleagues who are looking at this as an opportunity to push liberal fantasy wish list items that are totally unrelated to coronavirus, and that should be principle number one, whether it is the bill that we just passed or whatever the next bill may be, is that we should be focused solely on what will get us through this brief moment in time so that we come out the other side stronger."

Victor, for all of us who have been hitting the drum on China and everything they've done on trade and stealing our I.P., and carelessness with this virus reporting, it's interesting to hear the president speak so highly of President Xi, but nevertheless, he wants to get along with everyone, especially at a time like this."

I don't think he will be so complementary when that is no longer the case. But you know, a lot of his views, Laura, that we for the last five years that were written off as unorthodox, heterodox, if you think about it, they become almost conventional wisdom now. He said you can't trust the Chinese Communist Party in 2015, and lo and behold, we don't, now. And he said you don't really have a country unless you have industry and assembly of key materials here in the United States. And everybody today wishes that we had control of our medical supplies and pharmaceutical. He said you don't have a country unless you have secure borders. Even the Europeans agree with that now. And he said if a country can't verify who it's sending to us, we're going to have travel bans. And we had that travel ban of Nigeria and Iran and North Korea, and suddenly, everybody is angry, but you don't hear Joe Biden saying, you know what, that travel ban against China was really unfair, and I want this 15,000 Chinese to come in every single day.

I just want to show, real quick, Victor, this is Hillary Clinton's tweet today on the news that the coronavirus cases here in the United States top China's. \"He did promise America first.\" That was her tweet. She is not bitter or anything, Victor. Close it out. You've got about 30 seconds."

And second and most importantly, it's a per capita basis. We have four times the population of Germany and five times the population of France. So no wonder we have more cases.
