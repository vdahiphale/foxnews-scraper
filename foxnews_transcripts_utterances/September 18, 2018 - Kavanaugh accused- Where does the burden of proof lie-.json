She doesn't recall the house that the party was thrown in, and she doesn't recall how she got home from the party. She's a little fuzzy about the people that were there at the time and there is some discrepancy with the notes that her therapist took. And she admits that she was drinking.

He was also \"venting,\" \"infuriated,\" \"livid,\" \"erupting,\" \"lashing out,\" \"on a tirade.\" The good news? No \"spontaneous combustion.\" That's for after the midterms. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So why all this language? Well, it's to make you think the guy with a finger on that famous button is bonkers. Absent any harmful deeds by Trump and faced with blooming optimism about America's direction, the media is like a pack of cats looking for a sack: Out to create a story that fits their own infuriated furious eye bulging narrative. So they traffic in workplace rumors, the stuff that exists in all offices since the beginning of cubicles. Heck, even Jesus dressed down his apostles. But we get it: Trump's no Jimmy Carter. Thank God. I mean, who'd you rather have? A nice guy mocked by the world or a loudmouth who keeps the world guessing and therefore cooperating. Now Trump is bombastic but most bosses are. They use their voice like an instrument, as a call to action to wake up the slackers, to get the team to do actual work. That voice isn't there to soothe the concerned or troubled souls in the media. And it's always about the media. They're like ignored teens. And they just hate the new guy who's making them work for their shrinks and drinks. They need someone who makes them feel important by echoing their phony virtues. After Obama, the media got so flabby, they should thank Trump: He's the one who put them on a pressroom diet where they eat nothing but their own words.",

Now we have a new study out that has taken those traits and has narrowed people down into four main personality types. So I have carefully decided what I think you guys are. Again, not a psychologist. However, for the fun of the show, and the study. So for me, I like average. Average tends to be -- they're extroverted, but they're a little bit neurotic, meaning they're -- they have their emotional highs and lows. A lot of times, people tend to grow out of that. So I think Dana, maybe when she was younger; definitely me, I was average when I was younger. But I have grown into role models. And I think Dana is a role model, which would means that she's extroverted, openness, agreeable, conscientious but she's not neurotic any more. She's a little bit more even keel.

So tell me what you think about this as a licensed professional. She doesn't really recall how she got to the party. She doesn't recall the house that the party was thrown in, and she doesn't recall how she got home from the party. She's a little fuzzy about the people that were there at the time and there is some discrepancy with the notes that her therapist took. And she admits that she was drinking.

You don't remember the facts. Add -- not fully formed frontal lobe, and alcohol, and then add 36 years to that, and obviously details can get muddied a little bit. Do I believe something happened to Dr. Ford in her adolescence? Absolutely. I don't think anybody is ready to deny that whatsoever. But I do think it's interesting that the party of Bill Clinton and Keith Ellison are trying to lecture America that we need to have a potentially politically motivated allegation should derail an entire process here. And I have concerns about that because we want to ask questions, get answers, but she doesn't have the answers. And so, it's going to go into a he said- she said."

But he actually didn't go. We changed our memories. I said it yesterday, our memory is Playdoh. But I will say this to your point, that goes both ways. Her memory has gaps, and so could his. So that's why something has to be reported when it happens. This is the problem. You can't -- relying on something that happened three and a half decades ago, in the court of public opinion means ever single human being on this planet is vulnerable to this thing."

And then the FBI -- what would be -- what would we do? So now you have a situation where the senators have said, on the Republican side, will have another hearing. We'll do it Monday. We'll do it quickly because Brett Kavanaugh says I'm anxious to clear my name. They still haven't heard from Dr. Ford's lawyers or from her as to whether she will show. The senators also said you don't have to do an open hearing. We can do it as a closed session. So you won't have to worry about, you know, this idea that you're going to be paraded around and there will be some kind of a circus.

Well, why then is the burden of proof on Brett Kavanaugh? And if it is on him, then let him testify. And if she doesn't come, I think that they do what they can to try to get the information. And if the Democrats decide that they're going to vote against him, which they've already said they were going to, call the vote."

This is about winning for a party at any cost. And the cost is perhaps ruining a life. I saw a headline. I won't say where it's from. The headline was this, are Republicans really going to nominate an accused rapist to overturn roe? OK. So, think about -- I would ask the people on both sides, imagine if this was your son, dad, or brother, we often think about, you know, victims, but would you characterize this as fair without -- with the knowledge that we have right now? Is it fair to characterize somebody that way if that is your husband, your brother, your son, or your father?

There's -- if you need to protect somebody's identity that is not involved then -- that is should be protected. You can cross out their name and have it redacted. There's four basic areas that they're looking for. One would be the FISA court and what was used to go to the FISA court. Was it accurate? So you might find out more about it there. You also get to know about the renewal application because with FISA, every 90 days, you have to go back and you have prove to the court I need this to continue because the activity I'm concerned about it is ongoing, so that's why it gets renewed. There's also the Page and Strzok text messages. There's more where that came from. But I'm really interested in the piece about Bruce Ohr.

He has his own investigation ongoing. Remember also that in midst of all this, there is -- the Department of Justice inspector general report that is ongoing that will answer a lot of these questions. So, in some ways, the president is -- I understand he's chopping at the bit. He wants to get this out there. He wants to clear his name. This is getting a little bit ahead of that process.

What they did was they paid a guy to go to anonymous Russian intelligence sources and whisper things into Steele, and then he gives it to Bruce Ohr and then it trickles up, and then they all of a sudden slap a FISA warrant on an innocent American and listen to his phone calls and look at his emails for one full year. At the end of the year, there has never been a charge levied against Carter Page. They found nothing. And they have been trying to cover their tracks for this last year and a half because they know this never would have come out if Hillary Clinton were elected. That was the game plan. They should have given the Trump campaign, if they really cared about Russian interference, a defensive briefing in the spring but instead they spied on them. A lot of these spies were western intelligence officials. Hillary Clinton connected donors. The whole thing reeks. And I'm happy the president is being transparent it. I just feel bad for the I.G.

But what I see here, kind of from a bird's-eye view, is that there is concern over, as Jesse was saying, spying on an American. Carter Page, specifically. That is something I have a concern about. So I want to know was it just political opposition motivation that has caused our DOJ to spy on Americans? I'm also concerned with the text messages where the one that said it's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before your 40 talking about if Trump were to gain presidency. As an average American, I want to know what they're talking about. Is there some behind the scenes moved to undermine our current administration? And I'm not going to able to do much if these FISA documents are released. I'll look at them and hand them over to Dana Perino and that she can interpret them and tell me what they mean. But that's what it is. At least I know that there's going to be some transparency. I don't think that we're going to be putting America in danger.

How long can you spy on somebody without charging them. It's a good question. And this has to be the first time in my life that I've seen journalists not wanting access to information. I mean, they used to love leaks and memos and national security be damn. And now -- now, they're all of a sudden, they're worried about, oh, the danger, the danger. And to Trump's credit, he's the Pyrex POTUS. You know you could see right through him. This is a window paint White House.

Good news, they can change over time, just in case you don't like the one we give you. All right, guys. So we have already known that there are five personality traits. Many people have taken this massive questionnaire throughout the course of their lifetime and they have an idea of where they sit at. Now we have a new study out that has taken those traits and has narrowed people down into four main personality types. So I have carefully decided what I think you guys are. Again, not a psychologist. However, for the fun of the show, and the study. So for me, I like average. Average tends to be -- they're extroverted, but they're a little bit neurotic, meaning they're -- they have their emotional highs and lows. A lot of times, people tend to grow out of that. So I think Dana, maybe when she was younger; definitely me, I was average when I was younger. But I have grown into role models. And I think Dana is a role model, which would means that she's extroverted, openness, agreeable, conscientious but she's not neurotic any more. She's a little bit more even keel. Juan, I like Juan to be reserved. He's agreeable, conscientious, and he's also emotionally stable. And that's why I sit next to him."

Here I am with my grandkids out at Butler's Orchard in Maryland. But forget those pictures for a second, because we had an experience here at \"The Five.\" We want to give a shout-out to two of our beloved \"Five\" fans, Scott and Mary McLean of Harvest Moon Farm and Orchard in Westchester, New York. So these folks are so kind. Melissa Francis, our colleague, went out there with Melissa's daughter, Jemma (ph), who you'll see in a moment in the picture on a bungee jump. And they were asked, hey, you love FOX, but what's your favorite show on FOX? And they said, \"Oh, 'The Five'.\" And then, guess what? They sent us this pumpkin cheesecake!"

But there is some good news for those of you, because his legacy continues to live on. When he fell ill, he was in the advanced stages of almost finishing a whole new book, which he entrusted to his son, Daniel, that you see pictured there. Daniel has completed the book on his behalf. It is going to be called \"The Point of It All: A Lifetime of Great Love and Endeavors.\" It will soon be released. It's now available for preorder. I think the date is December 4. So if you need a holiday gift, that's it for you. And if you visit Charles Krauthammer.com, you can view some of Charles' most influential pieces, and you can learn how to preorder the book. And I got a little sneak peek. It's fantastic."
