In 1983, two hundred forty U.S. servicemen were murdered by suicide bombers in Beirut, Lebanon -- the barracks bombings that year. The family members of those murdered servicemen have been seeking justice ever since. Several court rulings have found that Iran's government was linked to the attack. But Iran's government of course has refused to honor any judgment against it. There is a pool of money $1.7 billion that was apparently laundered by a European Bank. Currently, the fate of this money is tied up in the Federal courts. The Supreme Court has asked the Trump administration to weigh in on what should happen to this money. That was months ago. So far, the administration hasn't weighed in, they still haven't submitted an amicus brief supporting justice for the Beirut families. So here's the question. Why not? Could it be that as long as those families don't have justice, it gives John Bolton another justification to bomb the country of Iran? We're not sure. We don't know. We can't know. But we do know that releasing that money into the hands of the widows and survivors of those Marines who were murdered would be a good thing for America -- we probably ought to do it. Well, up next.

It's not just the Hollywood partisan icon awards. And if I were Al Pacino, or anybody else at risk of getting an award speech -- prize presented to me by Robert De Niro, I'd start carrying the equivalent of an organ donor card saying, \"In the event that I get nominated for a prestigious award, I don't want Robert De Niro coming and giving the speech because he talks about Trump for seven minutes and then says, oh, and by the way is a statue for Al Pacino.\" This is -- this is ridiculous.

I did it, you mentioned, Senator Elizabeth Warren did it. They do it because they know it can improve their chance of admission. Now, as an admissions consultant for sosadmissions.com, I recommend that my clients not disclose their race. If you are Asian-American or white, do not disclose your race and your application for college or graduate school, as it can be shown statistically, to reduce your chances of admission.

College admissions consultants like me, rather than encouraging people to lie about their race, why don't you help them to write a more effective resume or an application essay, or do well in an interview because by teaching someone to do well in an interview, or do well in a resume, you're teaching them skills that will help them not simply to succeed in their interview or their application, but you're teaching them skills that will enable them to succeed in life.

I remember when I arrived, feeling really annoyed, I stepped out of the car and I couldn't check my cell phone. It wasn't working. I was like, \"All right, you're in the right place.\" So it's a really fascinating place. And I remember, I spent a lot of time there. They get a huge range of people in this internet rehab center, but they disproportionately get young men who become obsessed with these multiplayer role play games like \"World of Warcraft.\" I remember talking to the woman who runs the center, Dr. Hilarie Cash, and her saying to me, \"You've got to ask yourself. What are these young men getting out of these games? They're getting the things they used to get from the culture, but they no longer get. They get a sense of a tribe. They get a sense of identity. They get a sense they're good at something. They get a sense they are actually roaming around.\" Because American kids now barely leave the house. But what they're getting really is a kind of parody of those things. The more time I spent there talking to people who have become completely obsessed with social media or video games, or the more I spoke to the social scientists who study this, I began to realize, I think the connection between social media and social life is a bit like the connection between pornography and sex. I'm not totally against pornography. But if your entire sex life consisted of looking at pornography, you'd be going around irritated and frustrated the whole time because that's not what we evolved for. We didn't evolve to look at screens for sex, and we didn't evolve to interact through screens. We evolved to interact face-to-face. And when you have a huge decline in that and that leads to a big increase in depression and anxiety. It's partly a symptom, right? Actually, loneliness have been supercharged already before the internet arrived. Part of what happens is the internet arrives, and it looks a lot like the things we've lost, right? You've lost friends, well, here are some Facebook friends. You've lost status in the economy. Here's some status updates. But it's not the thing we've lost. It's not filling the hole there.",

And there is one, I think, really relates to a question, Tucker. So everyone knows that junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick. But there's equally strong evidence that our kind of junk values have taken over our minds and made us mentally sick. For thousands of years, philosophers have said, if you think life is about money, and status, and showing off and thinking all the time, about how you look to other people, you're going to feel like crap, right? That's not an exact quote from Confucius. But that is the gist of what he said. But weirdly, nobody had scientifically investigated this until an incredible man, I got to know called Professor Tim Kasser. And he discovered two really important things. Firstly, the more you think life is about money and status, and showing off, the things that social media trains you to do, the things advertising trains you to do, the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious. And secondly, as a society, we have become much more driven by these junk values. Over time, there's been a really big increase. But it's also really hopeful things there. Professor Kasser showed relatively small interventions can really help. So he did a program where you just get teenagers and their parents to meet in a group once every couple of weeks for four months, to just talk about moments they have actually found meaningful in their lives, right? Not buying Nike sneakers, not how many likes they got on Instagram, but meaningful moments, and they keep checking in to show, \"Okay, how can we build more of our lives, about seeking those meaningful things and less about all this junk culture is constantly pumping? And just doing that led to a really significant shift in people's values. And these values that are causing so much depression and anxiety.",

And just one example, the sanctuary city of Philadelphia released a previously deported illegal alien from prison rather than cooperate with Federal authorities. After his release, that criminal alien raped a very young child. Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not for a criminal alien."

We will get back to it if and when he makes news in this hour, he likely will. The President as you heard was speaking about the political elite and illegal immigration -- two themes he hits quite often. Two themes that help define the presidential race now in progress. Kirsten Gillibrand is in that race and is not just a candidate, but really a living metaphor. Gillibrand is someone who has lived a remarkably fortunate life until about 10 years ago, she was a Member of Congress. Virtually nobody outside the mostly rural 20th congressional district in upstate New York had ever heard of her. She was considered a thoroughly average Member of Congress, maybe a little below average. And then one day, Hillary Clinton decided to run for President and Gillibrand hit pay dirt. She was plucked from obscurity and handed one of the safest Senate seats in America. Overnight, Gillibrand became a national figure without even having to win an election. Amazing. It was the political equivalent of inheriting a billion dollars. Maybe not surprisingly, Gillibrand's views changed accordingly. She soon adopted the politics of the trust fund left. Before long, there wasn't a fashionable opinion she didn't have on any topic -- guns, abortion, immigration -- you name it. As her friends in Aspen and Martha's Vineyard became more decadent and more contemptuous of the country around them, so did Kirsten Gillibrand. But this past weekend, when she appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" Gillibrand was arguing against continuing to operate the United States as a sovereign country. \"Let everyone in,\" she demanded, \"Detaining anyone is immoral.\" Watch."

She is arguing that anybody from anywhere in the world must be allowed into the United States, awarded a publicly-financed lawyer, given a free place to live along with free healthcare and schools -- all of it you pay for -- and allowed to stay indefinitely unless they lose a court case that by the way, they will definitely show up for. That's her core assumption. The people who have demonstrated contempt for our laws will arrive in court when asked. Gillibrand trusts them to do that, and why wouldn't you trust them? That's the base. That's the whole immigration argument that she's making, which is that unlike you, regular Americans who are lazy and stupid and not worth helping, immigrants are basically perfect. They're smarter, more industrious, and more creative than you or any of your American-born neighbors were or could be. That's what they believe. The facts suggest a more complicated picture. Recently, I.C.E. launched a pilot program to conduct DNA tests of adults and children arriving at El Paso and McAllen, Texas, the border crossings there. When they checked, they found that nearly a third of the kids were not related to the adults they were with. It was fraud on a massive scale. It also revealed something far darker. It reveals that our deliberate failure to protect our borders has made our own government party to the trafficking of children. It would be hard overall to design an immigration system that's worse for a country, our country. But Democrats don't care. To a party totally controlled by identity politics, everything is about race or gender or sexuality. Nothing else matters including reality. Watch Congresswoman Maxine Waters explain that giving preference to immigrants who speak English is, can you guess? Racist."

Americans have no right to want immigrants with job skills. Nancy Pelosi explained that last week, Americans have no right to decide how many immigrants come here or how long they stay. And yet as Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and others have just told us, Americans are required to pay for free healthcare for everyone who comes along with housing and education and lots of others.

Look, the reason that family units and the children are coming right now are record numbers, unprecedented numbers is because they know, we can't detain them all, because of the Ninth Circuit decision to go home 20 days. So that's why the numbers have skyrocketed. So her answer to that is detain less? That's going to cause a surge like you never believe. You think the numbers are bad now? That's just the problem, it is when politicians like her, say things that we don't want to detain anybody and she support sanctuary cities, she wants to abolish I.C.E. When you have the open border attitude, more people are enticed to come into this country illegally. They're more enticed to put themselves in the hands of criminal organizations who come to this country. That's why they're coming. Ninety three percent of every person that I.C.E. removed last year was removed from a detention bed. When you get released, chances are you will never be removed. Last year, 47,000 people got orders of removal in absentia, which means they didn't show up in court. Right now, we're on a path where 70,000 in absentia this year. If you look at the people on the border claiming asylum, 49 percent, almost half never follow up with Immigration Court. There was an article this week in the paper, 86 percent of families do show up. Eighty six percent of half. But the question is, not how many show up in court? How many abide by the order of the Federal Judge? Two percent. So the 200,000 family units, only two percent --"

This is about language she uses and things she says and other Democrats that entice people to put themselves in the hands of criminal organizations. So if they want to blame -- who is to blame for this child dying in custody today? They need to look in the mirror.

We held the families long enough to see a judge. It took about 40 to 45 days, 90 percent of them lost their case -- nine out of 10. We filled a couple of airplanes full of them and sent them off. Guess what happened? The numbers on the border declined significantly. But when the Ninth Circuit says, \"Well, you can only hold them half as much time it takes to see a judge,\" the numbers come up.

So to say to a woman, \"You make this decision. I trust you to make this decision.\" Now, she could have been raped, the victim of incest, a victim of abuse, a college student that has to try to figure out, \"How am I going to finish college and help my parents and my family.\" There are so many things that a woman has to consider, and you're going to put this terrible burden on a woman alone and give her the whole responsibility? \"You decide.\" And then without reminding her that that's another person inside of her body, who should have Civil Rights as well. And so you ignore the motherly instincts, the natural instinct of most women who are about to be mothers, and at that very high crisis period, you glibly say, \"Oh, I'll just trust her to make a decision.\" Now, then you want to legalize abortion all the way through nine months.

They're defending in their minds what's left of the post-war liberal order that really crumbled back in the early 90s with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. So the notion of removing anyone from anywhere is anathema to the people. And then finally, there's a possibility that if you start withdrawing forces, which by the way, in most cases are not needed, where they are today at all, two things will happen. First of all, you're going to erode the support for the authorization for the use of military force and this slush fund, this $200 billion overseas contingency fund that is part of this massive spending exercise that Congress loves, and then secondly, you're going to watch as the various actors in places like Syria, and Iraq and elsewhere -- Russians, Syrians, Iranians, Turks and others -- all fall out with each other.

On this program, we've asked a couple times the obvious question, which is, what purpose would a war with Iran serve? How would it help the United States? There's no obvious way that it would. But here's one conflict with Iran that could at least help a few Americans conceivably. In 1983, two hundred forty U.S. servicemen were murdered by suicide bombers in Beirut, Lebanon -- the barracks bombings that year. The family members of those murdered servicemen have been seeking justice ever since. Several court rulings have found that Iran's government was linked to the attack. But Iran's government of course has refused to honor any judgment against it. There is a pool of money $1.7 billion that was apparently laundered by a European Bank. Currently, the fate of this money is tied up in the Federal courts. The Supreme Court has asked the Trump administration to weigh in on what should happen to this money. That was months ago. So far, the administration hasn't weighed in, they still haven't submitted an amicus brief supporting justice for the Beirut families. So here's the question. Why not? Could it be that as long as those families don't have justice, it gives John Bolton another justification to bomb the country of Iran? We're not sure. We don't know. We can't know. But we do know that releasing that money into the hands of the widows and survivors of those Marines who were murdered would be a good thing for America -- we probably ought to do it. Well, up next.

      "utterance": "Yes. That's the way to look at it. Robert De Niro lives better than 99.99 percent of people in the entirety of human history have ever lived. And he cannot accept that a close election in a 50/50 country didn't go his way. This is deeply bizarre. You mentioned that you'd -- I've never heard of these American Icon Awards and I think it's a faintly stupid title for award. In Australia, they have an award called National Treasure, which again, doesn't seem like the kind of thing you get nominated for. I mean, these kinds of names are in the gift of the people and the general mood. But if you do actually have something called an American Icon Award, then the guy has to be an icon for all Americans, including the 60 whatever million people who voted for Trump. It's not just the Hollywood partisan icon awards. And if I were Al Pacino, or anybody else at risk of getting an award speech -- prize presented to me by Robert De Niro, I'd start carrying the equivalent of an organ donor card saying, \"In the event that I get nominated for a prestigious award, I don't want Robert De Niro coming and giving the speech because he talks about Trump for seven minutes and then says, oh, and by the way is a statue for Al Pacino.\" This is -- this is ridiculous. This is this is beyond derangement. He has actually become more insane than Travis Bickle in \"Taxi Driver.\""

In the last two years, you've watched this parade of again, the most privileged people in our society, shouting down at Trump's voters. \"Damn you working class Americans, you must be quiet. How dare you speak?\" Has there ever been a revolution aimed in this direction down?"

I think I saw something of it with Mrs. Thatcher in the United Kingdom, where essentially, privileged, elite, artistic people just regarded her as vulgar and lower class in the same way that they do with Trump. But the fact is, they're killing themselves. There's a book out at the moment, \"White\" by Bret Easton Ellis, as you know, the novelist of \"American Psycho.\" He voted for Hillary. He is gay. He is nobody's idea of a conservative or right wing. But he was dating this young millennial guy, and the young millennial guy went full Trump derangement syndrome, and had become impossible to live with. And that's the same situation. Would you want to wake up in bed with Robert De Niro every morning? Boring on -- boring on about Trump. He is actually -- they shouldn't have American Icon Awards. They should have Best Cranky and Bitter Grandpa 40 years past his acting best award because he'd be a shoo in for that."

      "utterance": "If you've got a kid in school right now, it's almost certain they're learning that skin color is the key question about people. It's the most important thing. Some children's color makes them tainted. They have white privilege and must be punished for that. But here's a question, if white privilege is real, and everyone in our ruling class seems to assume it is. If it's real, then why are so many people pretending not to be white? Such is Rachel Dolezal or Elizabeth Warren. In the Varsity Blues college cheating scandal, parents were told to invent fake non-white heritage for their kids in order to improve their chances of getting into elite schools. One person may not be surprised to learn this. Joseph Ingam, he is the author of \"Almost Black: How I got Into Medical School While Pretending I am Black.\" He joins us tonight. Joseph, thanks very much for coming on. So it does make you wonder this is not in any way an attempt to pretend that American history isn't real, the ugly parts of it, of course, it is real. But this idea that white privilege is the dominant fact of American life is challenged, I would say by this fact, wouldn't you say?"

      "speaker": "JOSEPH VIJAY CHOKAL-INGAM, AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "Well, of course. I mean, the Varsity Blues admissions scandal kind of shows that white privilege is somewhat of an archaic notion. Because in fact, Rick Singer advises clients to lie as you said. It is actually quite common for white people and Asian-Americans to lie about their race in order to get admission to school, they call it the Pocahontas factor. I did it, you mentioned, Senator Elizabeth Warren did it. They do it because they know it can improve their chance of admission. Now, as an admissions consultant for sosadmissions.com, I recommend that my clients not disclose their race. If you are Asian-American or white, do not disclose your race and your application for college or graduate school, as it can be shown statistically, to reduce your chances of admission. So the best option is not disclosing your race, which kind of indicates the opposite of white privilege if you kind of think about it."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

I mean, that's one of the pivotal decisions in a kid's life is where to go to college, what college can I get into, right? So if being white hurts you there, how does it help exactly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGAM",
      "utterance": "I would help -- it also hurts you in employment as well. But the truth is, is we're missing the point. You talk about going into an elite ruling class. The truth is that there are merit based factors in admissions, like your grades or your letters of recommendation or your essays. And we need to move towards a merit-based system of admission. College admissions consultants like me, rather than encouraging people to lie about their race, why don't you help them to write a more effective resume or an application essay, or do well in an interview because by teaching someone to do well in an interview, or do well in a resume, you're teaching them skills that will help them not simply to succeed in their interview or their application, but you're teaching them skills that will enable them to succeed in life. So rather than promoting a society where race is a huge factor, we should promote a society in which we focus on the merit-based factors and help people to give skills that will help them succeed in life because that is the purpose of an education."

Up next, smartphones and the internet allow young people to stay in constant contact with everyone they've ever met anywhere in the world. So why are today's children the loneliest generation ever? There's a reason. I'll tell you after the break."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Thanks to cell phones and social media, it's easier than ever to talk to people all over the world wherever you want to, obviously, but it's not working exactly as you would expect. Today's teenagers are the loneliest generation in American history. In 2017, for example, teens met with friends 68 fewer times than they did in 1990. Children have fewer friends, but more anxiety. They have fewer dates, but more depression, suicide rates are rising. So what is causing all this? We put that question to one of the smartest people we know, Johann Hari, author of the book, \"Lost Connections: Why you're Depressed and How to Find Hope.\" Here's what he said."

      "speaker": "JOHANN HARI, AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "I wanted to think about this a lot. So with my book, \"Lost Connections,\" I went to the first ever internet rehab center in the world. It's just outside Spokane in Washington. I remember when I arrived, feeling really annoyed, I stepped out of the car and I couldn't check my cell phone. It wasn't working. I was like, \"All right, you're in the right place.\" So it's a really fascinating place. And I remember, I spent a lot of time there. They get a huge range of people in this internet rehab center, but they disproportionately get young men who become obsessed with these multiplayer role play games like \"World of Warcraft.\" I remember talking to the woman who runs the center, Dr. Hilarie Cash, and her saying to me, \"You've got to ask yourself. What are these young men getting out of these games? They're getting the things they used to get from the culture, but they no longer get. They get a sense of a tribe. They get a sense of identity. They get a sense they're good at something. They get a sense they are actually roaming around.\" Because American kids now barely leave the house. But what they're getting really is a kind of parody of those things. The more time I spent there talking to people who have become completely obsessed with social media or video games, or the more I spoke to the social scientists who study this, I began to realize, I think the connection between social media and social life is a bit like the connection between pornography and sex. I'm not totally against pornography. But if your entire sex life consisted of looking at pornography, you'd be going around irritated and frustrated the whole time because that's not what we evolved for. We didn't evolve to look at screens for sex, and we didn't evolve to interact through screens. We evolved to interact face-to-face. And when you have a huge decline in that and that leads to a big increase in depression and anxiety. It's partly a symptom, right? Actually, loneliness have been supercharged already before the internet arrived. Part of what happens is the internet arrives, and it looks a lot like the things we've lost, right? You've lost friends, well, here are some Facebook friends. You've lost status in the economy. Here's some status updates. But it's not the thing we've lost. It's not filling the hole there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So if young people and young men specifically have lost a sense of identity and tribe, and meaning and purpose, and the kind of useful risk that young men need, do we have a whole generation that's ripe for a demagogue to show up and say, \"Here's an identity, here's a purpose, here's some risk.\" I mean, this is like -- it's a perilous situation for our society, isn't it?"

    {
      "speaker": "HARI",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. One of the things that really shocked me for the book that I learned is there's scientific evidence for nine different causes of depression and anxiety. And there is one, I think, really relates to a question, Tucker. So everyone knows that junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick. But there's equally strong evidence that our kind of junk values have taken over our minds and made us mentally sick. For thousands of years, philosophers have said, if you think life is about money, and status, and showing off and thinking all the time, about how you look to other people, you're going to feel like crap, right? That's not an exact quote from Confucius. But that is the gist of what he said. But weirdly, nobody had scientifically investigated this until an incredible man, I got to know called Professor Tim Kasser. And he discovered two really important things. Firstly, the more you think life is about money and status, and showing off, the things that social media trains you to do, the things advertising trains you to do, the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious. And secondly, as a society, we have become much more driven by these junk values. Over time, there's been a really big increase. But it's also really hopeful things there. Professor Kasser showed relatively small interventions can really help. So he did a program where you just get teenagers and their parents to meet in a group once every couple of weeks for four months, to just talk about moments they have actually found meaningful in their lives, right? Not buying Nike sneakers, not how many likes they got on Instagram, but meaningful moments, and they keep checking in to show, \"Okay, how can we build more of our lives, about seeking those meaningful things and less about all this junk culture is constantly pumping? And just doing that led to a really significant shift in people's values. And these values that are causing so much depression and anxiety."
