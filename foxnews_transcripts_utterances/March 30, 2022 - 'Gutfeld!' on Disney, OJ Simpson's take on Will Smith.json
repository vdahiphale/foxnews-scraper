At least don't do it in front of me and put your poodle in the other room. So, you want to see how powerful the media industrial complex is? Watch how they can create something out of nothing. And they get everyone from politicians, to reporters, to washed-up celebrities by buying into it blindly. David Copperfield has nothing on them. I refer to the parental rights bill in Florida. Even righty. Web sites call it controversial even though the bill is only controversial because the media lied about it. The bill bans instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. The only part I found controversial is the third-grade part. How about teachers of any grade staying out of your kid's private life. you power hungry control freaks. Now like my extra nipples, the bill seems pretty benign to me. Last thing I want to talk to a kindergartener about is gender. The second to last thing I want to do is talk to a kindergartener. And if anyone tried to teach me that stuff, when I was that age, it would screw me up. I was still in the process of figuring out the anatomy of 10 and not the doll, the bus driver.",

And then have to let go of the lie. So, the media couldn't read it. And as long as they don't, they can say it bands the word gay. It's the media's version of Jussie Smollett hoax.

They're so pleased with themselves, like driving a Prius to their private jet. But that's what happens in a delusion. You think you're showing the world you're the smart one, when you're anything but look at Disney, which claims Governor Ron DeSantis wants to erase gay kids in odd position from a company whose cruises actually go to countries where homosexuality is indeed erased, where being gay is actually bad. I guess it's just cheaper to virtue signal than act on your principles. Virtue signaling is the only thing that's free at Disney. The magic and Magic Kingdom is how they make $10.00 disappear in exchange for fountain soda. Then there's actor Ron Perlman, who used to think for himself but now he's let Twitter run his brain.

Now in case he's watching, and I doubt it, or he wouldn't have fallen for this crap because this show is like rehab for people hooked on misinformation. The bill bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity with children in third grade or younger or \"in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\" That's it.

At least don't do it in front of me and put your poodle in the other room. So, you want to see how powerful the media industrial complex is? Watch how they can create something out of nothing. And they get everyone from politicians, to reporters, to washed-up celebrities by buying into it blindly. David Copperfield has nothing on them. I refer to the parental rights bill in Florida. Even righty. Web sites call it controversial even though the bill is only controversial because the media lied about it. The bill bans instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. The only part I found controversial is the third-grade part. How about teachers of any grade staying out of your kid's private life. you power hungry control freaks. Now like my extra nipples, the bill seems pretty benign to me. Last thing I want to talk to a kindergartener about is gender. The second to last thing I want to do is talk to a kindergartener. And if anyone tried to teach me that stuff, when I was that age, it would screw me up. I was still in the process of figuring out the anatomy of 10 and not the doll, the bus driver."

And then have to let go of the lie. So, the media couldn't read it. And as long as they don't, they can say it bands the word gay. It's the media's version of Jussie Smollett hoax.

They're so pleased with themselves, like driving a Prius to their private jet. But that's what happens in a delusion. You think you're showing the world you're the smart one, when you're anything but look at Disney, which claims Governor Ron DeSantis wants to erase gay kids in odd position from a company whose cruises actually go to countries where homosexuality is indeed erased, where being gay is actually bad. I guess it's just cheaper to virtue signal than act on your principles. Virtue signaling is the only thing that's free at Disney. The magic and Magic Kingdom is how they make $10.00 disappear in exchange for fountain soda. Then there's actor Ron Perlman, who used to think for himself but now he's let Twitter run his brain.

The more permanence you get, the more money you make. You get someone to rage and he's going to need another fix every day. And whether useful idiots like him, Disney won't need Goofy. Maybe it will offset the money they lose on woke movies. Poor Perlman he used to be in Sons of Anarchy. Now he's just Son of Sam, a guy hearing untruth from his dog Pluto and lost the ability to interpret what's real. All he understands now is free publicity. Now in case he's watching, and I doubt it, or he wouldn't have fallen for this crap because this show is like rehab for people hooked on misinformation. The bill bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity with children in third grade or younger or \"in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\" That's it. The bill doesn't ban the word gay nor does it ban casual discussions at topics relating to sexual orientation or gender. And teachers under this bill. They can't teach about being straight either.

Yes, sir. Talk about the bra (INAUDIBLE) so -- but it was the parents' choice. This law should never have even been put into effect. But because we are allowing this small group and when you say the people of California, it's not. It was like three CEOs and some woke people who have their own issues. They're trying to push their thing. And what we're seeing is what we saw with Rogen, what we're seeing with Spotify, we're seeing what other companies, Netflix. When you stand up to them, they go away because they actually have no foundation and no following. Is that a million people standing outside Disney going, change it. It's this group.

We'll have to see how it ends up working out in practice, because the state standards are never, you know, they never actually say anything.

Now, fewer companies than ever testing for pot or carrying potential hires test positive because of changing attitudes and worker shortages. And it helps me sleep. Sorry, Judge. So, test positive for marijuana. Welcome to the office. Test positive for COVID, go lock yourself away for a few weeks, you scumbag. So, more people at work are smoking dope.
