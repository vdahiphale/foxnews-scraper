Before leaving for his European trip this morning, President Trump took a swing at China and its failure to help contain the rogue state, tweeting, quote, trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40 percent in the first quarter. So much for China working with us, but we had to give it a try. Eboni, and so -- and Kat, big, big news day today. There're a couple ways to deal with North Korea. I think you have diplomacy, which we tried for the better part of five decades, and maybe seven or eight presidents. Bilateral negotiations, meaning trying to work with these people, but he doesn't seem like, Kim Jong-un, wants to work with us. Further sanctions, honestly, I've been hearing this for years. But the one that we talk about, we touched on, may be the only solution barring some sort of military strike would be this massive cyber war, may be a covert cyber war on the North Koreans."

Evan, we'll start with you. You published an article about this exact topic today. I read your article and I'm going to call you out a little bit on this my friend. You're brilliant, you're very smart, but again, you're focusing on more sanctions. We haven't had -- China's ability to get -- to the sanction table for 60 years."

We need to sanction the people who enable North Korea, Chinese banks, Chinese companies, other foreign entities that give economic lifeblood to this killer regime. And when you do that, you're going to start to strangle them economically. At the same time, we need to call on places like South Korea and China to stop giving aid which undercuts sanctions. Between 1991 and 2015, South Korea gave North Korea $7 billion in aid, which allowed the North Koreans to stay in power. If you do that and you strangle North Korea economically, you'll actually see most likely a coup which will see Kim Jong-un be forced out on a more pro-western."

      "utterance": "Well, I think that -- for starters, sanctions don't have a good track record, right? They're not working currently against Russia. They haven't been working against North Korea. They haven't been working against Iran. And so they're not really a viable solution. And while China and Russia might not necessarily want to play ball, the United States also needs them. North Korea is not an issue the United States can go at alone. I think that we all can agree that we want to avoid any type of military conflict or military escalation on the part of the United States. And so, if you actually give these countries something to work with, right, rather than trying to slap them on the wrist and sanction them that might lead."

      "utterance": "I think just having a dialogue, you know. The thing about Russia, for example, that I feel so many people fail to understand is that Russians will cut off their nose despite their face, right? They are a very stubborn country. And so, the more that you try to clamp down, the more that they are chided by the international community, the more resistant and stubborn they will be. And so, I think that if you make China and Russia feel like they're partners who are needed on the part of the United States, then maybe they'll come to the table."

      "utterance": "Yes, I just think it's important to contextualize what's happening in both countries, and even current politics aside, Putin and Donald Trump aside, these are two nations that are both global leaders in their own right, that are rich in human resources. And I think that we should do whatever we can to avoid, you know, military conflict and try to find ways to get people in both countries to understand each other. I feel like there are a lot more similarities than we actually let on, too. So I'm looking forward to just speaking to people face-to-face to see what their priorities are, what their concerns are."

Tomorrow, he's going to get a very warm reception from the Polish people. I hear that every member of the majority party is getting 50 tickets to bring friends from anywhere in the country. And I think it's going to be very different to see new Europe in Poland versus old Europe in Germany and France."
