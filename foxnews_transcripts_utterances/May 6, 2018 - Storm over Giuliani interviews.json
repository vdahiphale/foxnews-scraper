Even she was not aware of something that Rudy Giuliani was going on national television and talking about that is very pertinent to all of these questions. And so, if we look at the Trump campaign and the Trump administration, you know, characteristic fault. If there's one thing, it's just this ungovernable, undisciplined media strategy, and this was the height of that. And it's so many mistakes that didn't (ph) happen and that can be controlled if they didn't - if they were able to control some things like this."

This is someone who just likes the sound of his voice. And before we came out I was seeing he did even more damage this morning. He said that he thinks Michael Cohen probably did this other times, which is not exactly on message."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

But in any event, that's not the crime. So Mara, talking about - well I covered Rudy for Justice Department and when he was running for mayor. He's a very media savvy guy, but he makes an unforced error here. For example, Jared Kushner is disposable as a man, but Ivanka is a fine woman. The FBI agents who raided Michael Cohen, storm troopers he said. And finally, he said Cohen made the payment just so to save his marriage or reputation. Of course the press is going to jump on all of that."

There wasn't going into two corners. One corner is saying Giuliani did great, you know, and other people saying, oh, he's here, but everybody was agreed. Even Sean Hannity's reaction, he was stunned. And people are just -- their mouths are on the table wondering what they are going to do next. But Rudy, let me just say this, he's a giant figure in American politics and certainly in New York, but sometimes maybe he's not perfectly fit for this role of being the president's top legal strategist."

So now with this sort of a kitchen sink approach for example, the kind of eccentric Dr. Bornstein who came out this week and said Trump dictated the letter saying how healthy he was. And so, people are talking about credibility, but it's not just the (inaudible) liberal media. \"Wall Street journal\" conservative he editorial page says Mr. Trump is compiling a record that increase the likelihood that few will believe him during a genuine crisis. Is that overstated?"

He should have known that the president was -"

They say, hey, Bill Clinton lied about sex. So that's why, you know, you don't see the president dropping precipitously in the polls."

But you got to figure one of these is going to catch up with him and ironically --"

You heard Brian Kilmeade say Trump supporters don't care about this and he's right. But at some point, he's going to need to go to the American people or the world and say, here is the crisis, I need you to be with us for this reason, and people aren't going to believe him, even if his approval ratings don't drop at all."

All right, so New York Times obtains those 49 questions that the Mueller prosecutors wanted to ask the president, and at times made it pretty clear that these were notes taken by Trump's legal team and then provided this to someone else who provided it to the paper (inaudible).

So, this isn't so much about to me the sourcing. It's about which one of them is out to get the other.

Perhaps the biggest revelation, CBS management was warned of his conduct at least three occasions and basically did nothing. Joining us now, Sara Fischer, media reporter for Axios. So, Gayle King says, hey, there's nothing more we can do to Charlie Rose.

And now, another woman named Reah Bravo, who was the source for the original Washington Post story about Charlie, writing this week, I would expect CBS executives to have known.

One of the things that they'll tell you is that upon the time of his firing, there were no H.R. complaints that had been filed.

All right, Tom Brokaw, you know, we talked last week about allegations from former NBC reporter Linda Vester, forcible kissing on a couple of occasions. He wrote an angry letter denying that. He's forcibly denied it. So now there's another woman, former reporter named Mary Reinholz, writing in a New York newspaper \"The Villager\" about what happened what she says 50 years ago. Abruptly she says that Brokaw - we can put that up -- he was embracing me, giving me a French kiss. I pulled away reminding him that he was married. Look, Tom is an icon in this business. I covered him for years. A lot of people respect him. Overall, this is receiving remarkably little coverage, do you think?"

You saw that there was a letter signed by over 60 female executives, former and current producers, saying that this is not right. I mean, some of the people that signed the letter were incredibly high-level including Angela Mitchell, Kelly O'Connell. So, you can imagine that when there's that much backlash, it's harder for the media to confront the story. But I will say, it doesn't make it any less important for coverage.

Executive editor, Dean Baquet, told the metro staff according to Vanity Fair, I feel like S as a leader and a journalist not answering questions that I have Sarah Huckabee Sanders answer. To his credit, the Times run a next day news story quoting sources that say at least three female staffers accused Jamieson of inappropriate behavior. What's inappropriate is for newspaper executives to investigate such allegations in other newsrooms and minimize their own.

And the White House has tried very hard to keep the President's personal matters away from what they see as White House matters. She -- we call her President Trump's but she is the White House spokeswoman, and she is there to talk about the White House. At least, that's how they are personally delineating it. So she was not involved in that conversation with the President's personal attorney, and was there for also clearly left out of the strategy about what he was going to say on the television."

      "utterance": "Right. And you have (Inaudible) piling on, and (Inaudible) on CNN saying she should resign. So if we establish that she didn't know and therefore, it's probably unfair to call her a liar, but does it also make her less effective standing behind the podium because there are things she has just not been told?"

      "utterance": "I think it's going to be difficult for anyone who is behind that podium in this administration, because sometimes the President tweets things that directly contradict things they said, or again in this case, he's strategizing with his personal attorney and she is not in the loop on that conversation, because part of the reason they don't want her involved in that conversation. But another point I want to make is that when Sean Spicer was in the chair, everyone wanted to get Sean Spicer out and they wanted Sarah in the chair. Now they want Sarah out. Who would even replace Sarah at this point, potentially (Inaudible), who knows?"
