A stunning very digit out of San Francisco, a five-time deported illegal alien with seven previous felony convictions was found, believe it or not, not guilty of murdering 32-year- old Kate Steinle on July 1st, 2015. Now, the jury did find Jose Garcia Zarate guilty on one count, being a felon in possession of a firearm. The not guilty verdicts on the homicide charges came despite the fact that Mr. Garcia Zarate both admitted to shooting Ms. Steinle and to coming to San Francisco to take advantage of its sanctuary city policies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, Garcia Zarate had been in custody of San Francisco authorities until April of 2015, but then they released him without notifying ICE, of course, blatantly ignoring a detainer request. Despite this fact, his attorney had the gall tonight to say that the case had nothing to do with illegal immigration. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

A stunning very digit out of San Francisco, a five-time deported illegal alien with seven previous felony convictions was found, believe it or not, not guilty of murdering 32-year- old Kate Steinle on July 1st, 2015. Now, the jury did find Jose Garcia Zarate guilty on one count, being a felon in possession of a firearm. The not guilty verdicts on the homicide charges came despite the fact that Mr. Garcia Zarate both admitted to shooting Ms. Steinle and to coming to San Francisco to take advantage of its sanctuary city policies. Remember, Garcia Zarate had been in custody of San Francisco authorities until April of 2015, but then they released him without notifying ICE, of course, blatantly ignoring a detainer request. Despite this fact, his attorney had the gall tonight to say that the case had nothing to do with illegal immigration."

She focuses on civil rights case. She is a litigator. Harmeet, let's start with you. When this came across my phone tonight, I actually got choked up.

And despicably conflating this criminal illegal alien, who has several times been deported from this country with law abiding immigrants like myself and other citizens as of this city, and as if we have no rights at all.

Also on the hands of the Obama administration which did not enforce our borders for eight years. One of the reasons that President Trump was elected into office was promises to seal that boarder and keep us safe. And frankly, now our entire state of California thanks to our governor signing the bill earlier this summer is a sanctuary state. So, every citizen in California can look forward to this type of situation occurring if we don't protect our borders. It's really passed time for us to do that in this state."

The courts forensically found that he had caused an accident. It was not something that he intended on doing. He should never have been here, and this young lady had been alive had ICE stopped him. You want to know something? There are so many ways, whether it's the building of a proper wall or the enforcement of the laws on the books that we can stop the federal felons and criminals from reentering. Mind you, this man can now be prosecuted federally for reentering the United States after he serves the time for the illegal weapons charge."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Don't forget, NBC is the network that held back the Juanita Broderick interview about Bill Clinton before they were forced to run it and the blockbuster Harvey Weinstein investigation. So, with Matt Lauer, NBC initially claimed that there was one accuser. We told you last night, there's actually many more. Now today Fox News is reporting as many as eight women may accused Lauer of sexual harassment. Joining me now to make sense of all this and it's still rapidly developing tonight is Fox News contributor, \"New York Times\" best-selling author, Tammy Bruce along with Sam Braverman, who is a criminal defense attorney and a political analyst. Sam, let's start with you. Look, I used to go on the \"Today Show\" fairly regularly, including back in the 90s, mid to late 90s when Jeff Zucker was there. He was very close to Lauer. Lauer was perfectly nice to me, but they were really good pals. And the reporting today is that this was widely known in the network, that he had a reputation and people were afraid to speak out because of his power and the fact that he was the franchise of the network. What do you say?"

      "utterance": "Well, I'm sure that always has a role to play in all these sorts of things. Being a powerful guy that brings in $100 million to a television station gives you latitude. I have no doubt there's people there that knew this was going on. Whether or not the people at the high end had properly insulated themselves from this so that they can, quote/unquote, have deniability is hard to say. But it seems unlikely to me that nobody knew about this. In fact, \"The Times\" and \"Variety\" had been working on it for weeks. The idea that it came out this Monday is nonsense. Of course, they knew."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Tammy, this kind of plausible deniability, Zucker -- Zucker is a liberal over there at CNN and wagging his finger all the time when Fox is going through its stuff and Lauer was interviewing O'Reilly about a month or so ago. Something about this whole story seems hard to believe. Everybody is so shocked like with the Weinstein thing. Everybody is so shocked and stunned about the so-called behavior."

    {
      "speaker": "TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Right. Now, look, what is interesting here is that Andy Lack, remember, was brought back to NBC to save NBC from the Brian Williams debacle. So, this is a man who was brought in to try to fix things. He's a fixer. Now, this would be somewhat believable -- it's more believable with Zucker I supposed than it is with Lack because of the close personal relationship that Andy Lack has with Matt Lauer. So, even if you try to insulate yourself in the workplace, that level I would think when you are managing that kind of money and the gem of your network, you want to know everything. You don't want to be surprised. That becomes the issue for Mr. Lack and certainly for Mr. Zucker, who also pride himself on actually being, you know, a manager. He is a captain of a ship. You need to know these things. And so, this is where it becomes problematic. I think, Laura, what we've seen, of course, are these men have been able to do this for decades. Suddenly it seems to them overnight that the rule has changed. I think they have underestimated the nature of what was occurring. So, they thought that they could protect themselves. You saw that with the spiking of the Ronan Ferro dynamic and you saw it with just some of the denials that's already led up to this especially with \"Variety\" working I think actually months on this. \"The New York Times\" as well. And then the firing, by the way -- a lot of people don't realize this -- it wasn't just a booker that was fired earlier. It was a vice president of NBC who was Matt Lauer's closest producer that was fired earlier for inappropriate behavior with women. So, a lot of people thought that this would start the unraveling. Now we're seeing them try to still scramble and cover themselves. Clearly, I don't think they're thinking right at this point about the franchise."

So, if they cut off a couple people here and move them on, that gives them some latitude. To suggest this is a liberal network problem, I think probably misses the beat.

Let's talk about a booming economy. GDP just revised up to 3.3 percent. Stock market at 24,000. Christmas retail sales up already this season. Slash of red tape to boost investor confidence, unleashing small businesses across the United States. He's rolled back regulations that strangled business growth, restoring common sense conservatism. Trying to drain the swamp, having some success in urban bureaucracies like the State Department. He's nominating a record number of federal judges in courts across the land. Finally, returning fire in the one-sided trade war with China. Almost gets no coverage. That $250 billion worth of deals he brought back after the trip to Asia? He's finally launching a real anti-dumping case against Chinese aluminum manufacturers. Get this. Now he's working with our European allies to oppose China at the WTO came out hours ago. They're opposing market economy status for China. That's huge news. Where is all the media reporting and obsessing in all of that? Top Trump aide, Stephen Miller, just told The Washington Examiner if media coverage was fair, unbiased down the middle, there would be a hundred stories about the unstoppable momentum and energy of the oval office. It's the same thing that they did to my old boss, Ronald Reagan. They branded him a doddering old actor while trying to sabotage his agenda. These are the same people that got the election wrong, said the stock market would tank once Trump got elected. And now they are desperately trying to revive their own reputations by defaming the president and they hope they get what they in the end, removing him from office. That's what all the crazy talk is about. Frankly, I think that is crazy. That's the ANGLE. Joining us now to discuss what's really going on, Molly Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, and Garland Nixon, a radio talk show host. Garland, let's start with you.

It's funny to hear people talk about worrying about getting into wars. That's what this last three administrations have done, or the last several administrations have done is get us into wars needlessly. He does have a different foreign policy posture. He does want to convey his seriousness with North Korea. And I think those tweets are not more directed toward North Korea so much as directed toward China and getting China to take it seriously. Again, his rhetoric could use a lot of improvement. But people who are observing it need to separate that rhetoric from the reality of the presidency, and from the reality he's actually operating as a pretty mainstream president with a lot of accomplishments to back him up."

A whopping $100,000 went to two staffers of disgraced Democrat Congressman Eric Massa that was forced to resign. Joining me now for reaction to all this, Congressman Ron DeSantis, Republican from Florida. He's a co-sponsor of the Congressional Accountability and Hush Fund Elimination Act. I can't believe there's an act with \"hush fund\" in the title. Congressman DeSantis, take it away. Mitch McConnell would not commit to unmasking the names there as far as I could tell."

So what kind of behavior are you trying to promote? And here's the thing about the offenders. This is taxpayer dollars. You as a taxpayer have a right to know how your money is being spent. So my bill would unveil the claims that were brought and the amount, and then the perpetrator. And the American public deserves to have that information. There's no way that that should be secret."

It's the fact that we didn't have control of our borders and you have a sanctuary city where he could return knowing he would be put back on the streets. So I think Congress needs to look at this now and say we have a spending bill coming up in December. We have to totally defund sanctuary cities in that spending bill."

Again, we had the lawyer for the accused tonight, we had played a sound bite earlier where he said this vindicates basically the rights of illegal immigrants to be here in the United States and to stop demeaning immigrants, always conflating illegal immigrants with immigrants. He went on and on with this impassioned statement about how this demonstrates that we have real justice in the United States for people no matter what color of their skin, making it a racial issue. And it was nothing further from the truth. The guy shouldn't have been in the country."

That's just the bottom line with this."
