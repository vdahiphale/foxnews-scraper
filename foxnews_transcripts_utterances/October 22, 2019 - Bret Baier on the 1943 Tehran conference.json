The public may have been oblivious to what he was really like, but the people who knew him and worked around him knew that Harvey Weinstein was a creep and a predator. It was glaringly obvious. Some of them are brave enough to joke about it at award shows. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Farrow's book is a bestseller tonight on the Amazon list, NBC meanwhile, has not budged. Its Executive still claim they did nothing wrong. They didn't kill the Weinstein story, they say. NBC News Chairman Andy Lack called Farrow's book, quote, \"fundamentally untrue.\" The News Division President Noah Oppenheim called it a conspiracy theory. Who to believe in this? Well, maybe the most powerful corroborating witness in this story has received relatively little attention so far. His name is Rich McHugh who is a reporter in the Investigative Unit at NBC News and he was Ronan Farrow's producer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } McHugh spent eight months of his life working with Farrow reporting out the Weinstein investigation. Ten days ago, he published a story in \"Vanity Fair\" about it. McHugh's piece amounts to one of the most devastating accounts of malfeasance by a television network ever published. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Get yourself a copy of this story. It is jaw dropping. Andy lack and Noah Oppenheim, McHugh writes, quote, \"... not only personally intervened to shut down our investigation of Weinstein, they even refused to allow me to follow up on our work after Weinstein's history of sexual assault became front page news.\" \"As the record shows, they behaved more like members of Weinstein's PR team than the journalists they claim to be.\" End quote. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, that sounds like overstatement, but as you read the story, you realize it's not an overstatement at all. They did act as PR agents for Harvey Weinstein. The story is crammed with damning detail. The cumulative effect is so overwhelming and so clearly true that NBC hasn't even really responded to the story. Instead, they've ignored it, hoping it'll go away. In fact, just today, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that NBC has and this is remarkable even by their standards renewed Noah Oppenheimer's contract. It's expected that he will take control of the entire company soon. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But before that happens, we wanted to speak to Rich McHugh directly about his experiences at NBC and so we're happy to have him join us here tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Rich McHugh, welcome. So, you open the piece with one of the great leads ever. \"One year ago, I resigned from NBC News because they ordered me to stop reporting on Harvey Weinstein,\" which they clearly did. In the piece, you unearthed evidence that Weinstein's lawyers, David Boies, being his chief lawyer had been assured by NBC lawyers that you would not do reporting on Harvey Weinstein. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So promise Medicare-for-All, but without any tax increases. It's magic.

So what does she do? Well, she has found a way. In a new letter to the Department of Homeland Security, Elizabeth Warren demands that all transgender illegal immigrants and she doesn't say how many there are, but all transgender illegal immigrants caught at the U.S. border must be let into this country immediately. Warren says that it's dangerous to be transgender in Mexico. So anyone who claims they were born in the wrong body must be allowed to stay here, no questions asked to receive a taxpayer funded transition. That's right. It's a daring gamut by Elizabeth Warren. She seems to have calculated that she can alienate every normal person in the continental United States and still become President. Will it work? Well, we're about to find out. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are both running on a Medicare-for-All plan. And they really mean for all. They promise to give free medical care to everybody who is here illegally. It's about 22 million people. That number is rising, and of course, it will rise dramatically if this new handout becomes law. But let's pretend it won't. Let's pretend the number stays static at 22 million. How much would it cost to give free healthcare to the legal immigrants already here? According to a new calculation, by the American Enterprise Institute, Medicare for all would cost about $10,000.00 per person per year. So multiply that by 22 million illegal immigrants and you get to $220 billion every year. Now, even in an era of supersize numbers, that's a ton of cash. That is, for some perspective, 10 times the entire budget of NASA. It's also more than the current Veterans Administration budget, the VA budget, which means America would quite literally be spending more on illegal immigrant healthcare than it does on veterans.

That is basically victim blaming, and none of it was your fault.\" The staffer also said she was afraid to push back against Katie Hill for fear of losing her partner and her job. And now Kenny Heslep says Katie Hill was an abusive wife and accuses her of having an affair with a male staffer. Hill denies the new affair and tell POLITICO it was Heslep who was abusive and that he is trying to humiliate her by making vindictive claims. She also claims her opponents are using a private matter for political gain. We reached out to Katie Hill for further comment. She has not gotten back to us -- Tucker.",

But the question it raises is whether she is using campaign funds for personal purposes. And that harks back to her time in the state legislature. We learned this year at the conclusion of a year-long investigation by Minnesota State Campaign Finance Board that she freely used campaign funds on a penny ante type basis for personal purposes on at least nine occasions and they ordered her to pay back the funds and fined her for it. And I would say you know, there are complaints that have been made to the FEC related to the facts that you laid out about her financial relationship with her lover. But the FEC isn't entirely a functioning agency, and I think it's going to take some time for that to play out. In the meantime, I'd encourage your viewers to take a look at what can be learned from this State Campaign Finance Board investigation that incidentally discovered that she had filed two years -- at least two years -- of tax returns jointly with a guy who she is now married to, but wasn't her husband at the time while she was married to her brother, whom she married in 2009. And in Omar's case, we don't have an old fashioned kind of, you know, woman or man cheating on her spouse scandal. We have not just that, we have a scandal of a new kind, new kind of fraud, kind of for the age of Trump. And in fact, President Trump talked about it with great point at the rally in Minneapolis.

And yet Elizabeth Warren, who has a pretty good shot of being her party's nominee, has taken up the same message. She is now leading in the polls. Her tone, though has some on the left worried. A \"New York Times\" piece today described several big Democratic donors who say they're concerned that the party's lurch to the left will lose them the election.

The public may have been oblivious to what he was really like, but the people who knew him and worked around him knew that Harvey Weinstein was a creep and a predator. It was glaringly obvious. Some of them are brave enough to joke about it at award shows."

It was a remarkable scoop, the kind that of reporters dream about, so Farrow and his producer took their story to executives at NBC where they worked. But instead of congratulating them, the network killed their investigation. Farrow who later wrote a book about the experience explained it this way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RONAN FARROW, AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "Look, we had a story that journalists looked at and said this should get on air immediately. We had a recorded admission of guilt from Harvey Weinstein, secured during a police sting operation. This was a case where a news organization didn't behave journalistically. They ordered us to stop, to not take so much as to call and to cancel interviews in some cases with alleged rape victims. This book explains why."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Farrow's book is a bestseller tonight on the Amazon list, NBC meanwhile, has not budged. Its Executive still claim they did nothing wrong. They didn't kill the Weinstein story, they say. NBC News Chairman Andy Lack called Farrow's book, quote, \"fundamentally untrue.\" The News Division President Noah Oppenheim called it a conspiracy theory. Who to believe in this? Well, maybe the most powerful corroborating witness in this story has received relatively little attention so far. His name is Rich McHugh who is a reporter in the Investigative Unit at NBC News and he was Ronan Farrow's producer. McHugh spent eight months of his life working with Farrow reporting out the Weinstein investigation. Ten days ago, he published a story in \"Vanity Fair\" about it. McHugh's piece amounts to one of the most devastating accounts of malfeasance by a television network ever published. Get yourself a copy of this story. It is jaw dropping. Andy lack and Noah Oppenheim, McHugh writes, quote, \"... not only personally intervened to shut down our investigation of Weinstein, they even refused to allow me to follow up on our work after Weinstein's history of sexual assault became front page news.\" \"As the record shows, they behaved more like members of Weinstein's PR team than the journalists they claim to be.\" End quote. Now, that sounds like overstatement, but as you read the story, you realize it's not an overstatement at all. They did act as PR agents for Harvey Weinstein. The story is crammed with damning detail. The cumulative effect is so overwhelming and so clearly true that NBC hasn't even really responded to the story. Instead, they've ignored it, hoping it'll go away. In fact, just today, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that NBC has and this is remarkable even by their standards renewed Noah Oppenheimer's contract. It's expected that he will take control of the entire company soon. But before that happens, we wanted to speak to Rich McHugh directly about his experiences at NBC and so we're happy to have him join us here tonight. Rich McHugh, welcome. So, you open the piece with one of the great leads ever. \"One year ago, I resigned from NBC News because they ordered me to stop reporting on Harvey Weinstein,\" which they clearly did. In the piece, you unearthed evidence that Weinstein's lawyers, David Boies, being his chief lawyer had been assured by NBC lawyers that you would not do reporting on Harvey Weinstein."

      "utterance": "That's correct. And you know, part of this goes to Ronan, and what Ronan unearthed in his book \"Catch and Kill,\" too. But, you know, the piece quotes an incident where that happened where David Boies who was an attorney for Weinstein at the time, you know, on behalf of Mr. Weinstein went to get assurance from NBC of what was going on with the story. And he was told that, you know, we've told Mr. Weinstein, we're no longer doing a story on him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So you've worked at a number of different television networks. You were a supervising producer at the Investigative Unit at NBC, not a small job.

      "utterance": "I think it was -- I think everybody knew -- I think everybody who has read the book, first of all, \"Catch and Kill\" and hopefully people who've read you know, what I wrote now see what it was about. And I think Ronan did an excellent job of connecting the dots that you know, this was A, this a very powerful person, you know, at the time Harvey Weinstein had was you know, still one of the biggest, if not the biggest producers in Hollywood and had extreme ability to shut down stories and had done it for years. And I think this was about -- I think he figured out that NBC had an Achilles heel. Ronan paints it more succinctly through facts in his book, but NBC had a Matt Lauer problem, and everybody was aware of it. And I think Weinstein exploited that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So not to jump ahead of the story, but at the at the end of your piece, you recount a scene where you confronted Noah Oppenheimer directly and you said, did you have any indication that your chief anchor had been accused of sexual misconducts during his time here, that Matt Lauer had a problem with women. And he said, and I'm quoting, \"No.\" Is that true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHUGH",
      "utterance": "Well, that happened. Yes, I confronted him in a meeting. And did I believe it? No. And I don't think anybody else in the meeting believed it, either. I mean, we all knew that NBC -- everybody at NBC was aware that Matt Lauer was of, you know, having affairs and whatnot. And the extent of which we've now learned through documents and settlements that have been revealed in the book, it was much more than that. And the executives at the company, were aware, were told, you know, even Anne Curry was out years ago, and she has now come on and gone on the record since saying she did tell executives at the company. They had to be aware of Matt Lauer with women, so --"

Now, you've got an accounting here of what it was like to spend eight months of your life reporting on Harvey Weinstein with uncertain support from your own employer, NBC. But in this you say that your phone wound up bugged, someone broke into your house and tampered with the phone lines."

It's like I have people who have been trying to break into my e-mails, right, when I was writing the \"Vanity Fair\" story. So it's -- I wish I could say it's over. But it's not."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHUGH",
      "utterance": "I was pretty upset to learn a lot of that stuff, to be honest. You know, I have animosity against these people. But it's clear to me that, you know, we were lied to over and over and it's just not right, especially coming from the news organization."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So Noah Oppenheim was just apparently resigned, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported today. I'm sure a huge salary, and he is next in line to take over the entire company. How do you feel about that? And how do you think employees still at NBC feel about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHUGH",
      "utterance": "I know employees at NBC are upset about it. I've spoken to many of them. I feel it's -- you know, it's rather tone deaf. I think it's going to be hard for employees and journalists at NBC going forward to report on corporate malfeasance elsewhere because it's just -- it makes their job ultimately harder when the leadership at the top isn't listening to what is -- the facts that are coming out in this case. There's a complete disconnect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "But it's baffling. I mean, I know Noah Oppenheim. I don't think he's an evil man or anything, but he's certainly mediocre. I can imagine you could hire a lot of people to run NBC. Why is he still there? I mean, given the fact he has been caught lying repeatedly?"

I even warned them, I said, if you go down this road with this narrative, this is going to be around for a long time, and so it's better to come clean and say, we messed up, we should have done this. We should have done that. And they chose not to do it. And here we are."

And that's what I know is the truth. So anything other than that is a narrative. And, you know, it put me in an odd spot. You know, at NBC let's say that."

He like, he makes the argument, right, in his story and in what he just told you. I don't think there's anyone who could doubt that those things are true, that this network not only stonewalled the investigation from the beginning, but then when it was already out, was not interested in telling the story still. When it was already out there, they weren't interested in talking about it."

We should have had this story, but we let it get away. That was bad on our part. Like none of their subsequent actions comport with that, right? They've been attacking Ronan relentlessly trying to say that he didn't actually have any of the evidence. We know that's not true when we know we had tons of evidence."

They would have had to recheck everything he was bringing to them. It's not like he could just drop it in their laps, and they could run it the next day. That's not how journalism works. So it's baffling that their strategy has been to deny that they've done anything wrong, which speaks to some of the kind of more out there explanations, although they're becoming less out there that they were afraid of maybe the Lauer stuff coming out or that they had some kind of -- there was there was some suggestion of some kind of business they were getting with Weinstein."

Marissa Mayer runs Yahoo and like the value of the company disappears, and she is still a heroine.

She apparently believes she can win the nomination, and ultimately the President with a simple approach, on every issue, find the most left wing possible view, and then go even further than that. So promise Medicare-for-All, but without any tax increases. It's magic. Use America's wealth to fund race-based reparations because almost no one is in favor of that. On the border, it is not easy for Warren to stand out because at this point, almost every other Democrat wants amnesty, no deportations, free healthcare for illegals. So what does she do? Well, she has found a way. In a new letter to the Department of Homeland Security, Elizabeth Warren demands that all transgender illegal immigrants and she doesn't say how many there are, but all transgender illegal immigrants caught at the U.S. border must be let into this country immediately. Warren says that it's dangerous to be transgender in Mexico. So anyone who claims they were born in the wrong body must be allowed to stay here, no questions asked to receive a taxpayer funded transition. That's right. It's a daring gamut by Elizabeth Warren. She seems to have calculated that she can alienate every normal person in the continental United States and still become President. Will it work? Well, we're about to find out. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are both running on a Medicare-for-All plan. And they really mean for all. They promise to give free medical care to everybody who is here illegally. It's about 22 million people. That number is rising, and of course, it will rise dramatically if this new handout becomes law. But let's pretend it won't. Let's pretend the number stays static at 22 million. How much would it cost to give free healthcare to the legal immigrants already here? According to a new calculation, by the American Enterprise Institute, Medicare for all would cost about $10,000.00 per person per year. So multiply that by 22 million illegal immigrants and you get to $220 billion every year. Now, even in an era of supersize numbers, that's a ton of cash. That is, for some perspective, 10 times the entire budget of NASA. It's also more than the current Veterans Administration budget, the VA budget, which means America would quite literally be spending more on illegal immigrant healthcare than it does on veterans. That's their plan. Melissa Francis is cohost of \"Outnumbered.\" She also hosts over at Fox Business and thankfully is a frequent guest on the show. She joins us tonight. So you're the numbers person. You're one of the good people who went to Harvard, assess our math. It's true. There aren't many, you're one."

And they were the ones that came up with this idea of 22 million people. But the point is, if you do all that math out, it doesn't even really matter, because we already can't pay for Medicare-for-All and I don't mean, we can't pay for it in the sense of, you know, we'd have to tax the middle class. I mean, like, there isn't the money at all. And I don't know why more people don't press Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, for that matter on this, because even when Bernie Sanders admits that taxes would have to go up dramatically on the middle class - that still wouldn't do it. If you confiscated all the money. I told you this before, but if you took away every single dollar that every person who makes more than $200,000.00 a year makes and you threw them into an abyss somewhere to die, and you took all their money, it still would not pay for Medicare-for-All. So what difference does it make if we add a lot of illegal aliens? Why don't we add Canada? They're nice people. I mean, why not?"

If you want to make Americans hate immigrants, give free healthcare to illegals because that will -- I mean, that will engender resentment, why wouldn't it? Most Americans aren't able to pay for the healthcare they want. Do you know what I mean?"

It's because they use four times as much in dollar terms as what they've paid in. That obviously can't work on a larger scale. It means everybody else is supporting this group. They're the elderly, we love them. We're happy to do it. You can get the Medicare add-on insurance, but you can't put the whole population on that. But you know, it's amazing to me, Democrats and a lot of people in D.C., including Republicans, I think they think math is a myth. Math is like a vast right wing conspiracy. They're allergic to math. I mean, they don't want to do any of these numbers because it would make everything impossible. And it is depressing when you can't pay your bills and you continue to rack up credit card debt, who wants to sit down and crunch those numbers? Certainly not the politicians in Washington. But the truth is that there literally isn't enough money for Medicare-for- All. It's not about who can you tax, because if you raise taxes on everyone -- everyone -- it still wouldn't pay for it."

Now \"Red State\" has obtained text messages between Heslep and the female staffer that appear to call into question both the power structure of the two-year relationship and how the female staffer felt it was abusive, writing to Heslep headset quote, \"It was a dark time and you treated me really poorly. But I also stayed which I have to own.\" In response, Heslep writes, quote, \"Don't take full responsibility for staying with people that are abusing you. That is basically victim blaming, and none of it was your fault.\" The staffer also said she was afraid to push back against Katie Hill for fear of losing her partner and her job. And now Kenny Heslep says Katie Hill was an abusive wife and accuses her of having an affair with a male staffer. Hill denies the new affair and tell POLITICO it was Heslep who was abusive and that he is trying to humiliate her by making vindictive claims. She also claims her opponents are using a private matter for political gain. We reached out to Katie Hill for further comment. She has not gotten back to us -- Tucker."

But the question it raises is whether she is using campaign funds for personal purposes. And that harks back to her time in the state legislature. We learned this year at the conclusion of a year-long investigation by Minnesota State Campaign Finance Board that she freely used campaign funds on a penny ante type basis for personal purposes on at least nine occasions and they ordered her to pay back the funds and fined her for it. And I would say you know, there are complaints that have been made to the FEC related to the facts that you laid out about her financial relationship with her lover. But the FEC isn't entirely a functioning agency, and I think it's going to take some time for that to play out. In the meantime, I'd encourage your viewers to take a look at what can be learned from this State Campaign Finance Board investigation that incidentally discovered that she had filed two years -- at least two years -- of tax returns jointly with a guy who she is now married to, but wasn't her husband at the time while she was married to her brother, whom she married in 2009. And in Omar's case, we don't have an old fashioned kind of, you know, woman or man cheating on her spouse scandal. We have not just that, we have a scandal of a new kind, new kind of fraud, kind of for the age of Trump. And in fact, President Trump talked about it with great point at the rally in Minneapolis.

He married into an even richer family. He has been compared to one of the Kennedys. I mean, he is our leadership class. And yet he hates the country he seeks to lead and he is not shy about it. He was taught to feel that way. What happens to a country whose leaders hate it? Interesting, I guess we'll find out. In the case of Beto, though he's not going to be President, so it's not strictly speaking relevant in political terms. And yet Elizabeth Warren, who has a pretty good shot of being her party's nominee, has taken up the same message. She is now leading in the polls. Her tone, though has some on the left worried. A \"New York Times\" piece today described several big Democratic donors who say they're concerned that the party's lurch to the left will lose them the election. These donors are scrambling for an alternative who could enter the race at the last minute, maybe Hillary Clinton, maybe Michael Bloomberg, maybe even former First Lady Michelle Obama.

The city currently operates something called a Navigation Team. It's a group of specially trained police and social workers who help clean up dirty homeless encampments and get homeless people into shelters. During cold winter days, they almost certainly save some lives. But two Seattle City Councilmembers want the team gutted or defunded completely. Their agenda is not complicated. They want more filth, more unsafe homeless encampments filling up the Seattle City Center. Why do they want this? Jason Rantz is a Seattle area radio host and he joins us tonight. Jason, thanks a lot for coming on. So normally, with these stories I could see the motive.

But let's be clear, the reason why people are living out on the street in such big numbers is not about necessarily affordable housing. These are people who weren't born homeless, right? They were born into a home and they got on the wrong path for a variety of reasons. And unless you go after that root cause of homelessness, you're just going to continue the suffering."

But in the short term, it's really important to back the Navigation Team. To put this in perspective, 700 tons of trash, human waste has been cleaned from the streets just in the first half of the year, thanks to the Navigation Team. They cleaned up 200 incredibly dangerous encampments. We call this compassionate in Seattle when we let people live out on the streets and not get quote unquote, \"swept away.\" I'm sorry, they're not being swept away.

So call me paranoid and I don't think you can actually be too paranoid in defense of your constitutional rights. But this is -- this is a predicate to something. I mean, they're saying this for a reason, when they start telling you that people who have a 12- gauge at home to defend themselves are terrorists. They're setting it up to do something to those people. No?"

      "utterance": "Yes, well, I completely agree with your analysis here, Tucker. And also first off, you know, all day today, these same individuals that have -- these same Democrat lawmakers that have been screeching and raging because President Trump used accurately the phrase lynching to talk about the witch hunt on him. These are the same lawmakers that have been calling innocent, law-abiding Americans referring to them as quote, \"domestic security threats\" and terrorists. So I think they kind of need to look in the mirror a little bit if they want to start being the rhetoric police."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, that that lynching is just noise. But I think you're absolutely right. It's -- so just to be clear, they're calling Americans who have committed no crime, who pose no threat, who merely want to exercise their constitutional right a terrorist, but what do you do to terrorists?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOESCH",
      "utterance": "Yes, exactly, and that's the whole point, what do you do to terrorists? And these are also the same individuals, Democrats like Bernie Sanders, you have people like Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, all -- particularly Biden and Harris, Tucker that have been trying to run away from their hard on crime, tough on crime stances previously, because now it's in vogue for Democrats to be soft on crime. Bernie Sanders and all these other Democrats have been blasting innocent American gun owners while at the same time Bernie Sanders says he wants to get violent offenders, people like Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the terrorists from Boston. People like the murderer in Parkland. He thinks giving them the right to vote on who is going to determine your laws. That's totally okay. That's a mainstream Democrat candidate, Tucker, that's talking about allowing violent felons to vote while simultaneously completely endorsing through silence and/or omission of it during any of his speeches, calling innocent law-abiding Americans as terrorists. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is somebody who wants to end mass incarceration. And here's something else to think about, too, Tucker and for everyone else out there. These same lawmakers who are referring to innocent people as terrorists and security threats because we disagree with them on the Second Amendment are also the same lawmakers that went to implement the red flag system, and they want you to trust their judgment while they're simultaneously smearing people with these awful terms."
