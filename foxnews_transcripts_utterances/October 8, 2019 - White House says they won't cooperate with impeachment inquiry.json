      "sentences": "All right, I'm Laura Ingraham, this is “The Ingraham Angle,” from a wild Washington tonight in a blistering late afternoon letter to House Democratic Leaders, the White House Counsel is making it clear this means war. And Fox News has also learned exclusively that U.S. Attorney John Durham's review of the origins of the Trump investigation is expanding because of what he has already uncovered. This is good. You will not see a better lineup of guests to break all of this down, people who are actually practicing Attorneys, understanding the constitution. No hyperbole, these are the facts and you're going to get them tonight, the President's Attorney Rudy Giuliani, Joe diGenova, Gregg Jarrett, Sara Carter all here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also tonight, the Liberal Mayor of Minneapolis this is classic, is trying to shut down President Trump's rally there Thursday night. We have exclusive campaign reaction from Mercedes Schlapp that is going to be fun. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first to tonight's big breaking news, the White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sends a lacerating letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Committee Chairs Adam Schiff, Eliot Engel, and Elijah Cummings making it clear that the White House is not going to be complying with the Democrats for impeachment inquiry. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I want to take you through two important passages from this letter. Because I believe it's necessary to lay out what this fight is really all about. The current proceedings are nothing more than an unconstitutional exercise in political theater, an unauthorized impeachment inquiry that conflicts with all historical precedent and rides roughshod over due process and the separation of powers. It continues \"Your inquiry is constitutionally invalid in a violation of due process. In the history of our nation, the House of Representatives have never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the President without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now as we told you last night one of the most fateful decisions of the entire charade was when Nancy Pelosi put Adam Schiff in charge of it all. Schiff is a prevaricating, priggish partisan. He's one of the many reasons why the White House is dismissing this entire episode as a farce. The White House Counsel is 100 percent correct. This non-impeachment, impeachment is not a constitutional undertaking it's a political hit job. Exactly what our founders did not want for our republic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Consider this commentary about the dangers of impeachment. The effect of impeachment is to overturn the popular will of the voters. We must not overturn an election and remove a president from office except to defend our system of government or our constitutional liberties against a dire threat. And we must not do so without an overwhelming consensus of the American people. There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or impeachment supported by one of our major political parties and opposed by another. Such an impeachment will produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come, and will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions. Sounds like the views of our next guests, perhaps, Rudy Giuliani and Joe DiGenova -- wrong. Those were the 1998 anti-impeachment views of none other than current House Judiciary Committee Chair, Jerry Nadler. So, my friends, what has changed? Donald Trump is in the White House, that's what changed. Here now, the aforementioned, Rudy Giuliani, personal attorney to the president, and Joe DiGenova, former U.S. attorney, frequent guest. Rudy, what does this forceful letter mean from Cipollone? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Joining me now, Gregg Jarrett, FOX News legal analyst, and author of the brand-new book -- we were talking about the witch hunt, Jarrett, earlier -- \"Witch Hunt,\" which touches on a lot of tonight's breaking news.

He's asking now for additional personnel, he's gone overseas to two different countries to gather evidence not of Trump-Russia collusion, but of FBI, Department of Justice, Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee collusion. So I think that now that it is expanding, he's not just looking into how James Comey violated FBI regulations by launching an investigation of Trump without a shred of evidence. He is also looking into lying and spying, undercover informants that were used, lying to the FISA court. He should also look, as I point out in my book, that Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel not based on law or evidence or even following the regulations. He defied the regulations and appointed Bob Mueller in an active vengeance, retaliation against Donald Trump. And not only that, he ought to look at Bob Mueller's conflicts of interest in this case, which are egregious.",

      "utterance": "All right, I'm Laura Ingraham, this is “The Ingraham Angle,” from a wild Washington tonight in a blistering late afternoon letter to House Democratic Leaders, the White House Counsel is making it clear this means war. And Fox News has also learned exclusively that U.S. Attorney John Durham's review of the origins of the Trump investigation is expanding because of what he has already uncovered. This is good. You will not see a better lineup of guests to break all of this down, people who are actually practicing Attorneys, understanding the constitution. No hyperbole, these are the facts and you're going to get them tonight, the President's Attorney Rudy Giuliani, Joe diGenova, Gregg Jarrett, Sara Carter all here. Also tonight, the Liberal Mayor of Minneapolis this is classic, is trying to shut down President Trump's rally there Thursday night. We have exclusive campaign reaction from Mercedes Schlapp that is going to be fun. But first to tonight's big breaking news, the White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sends a lacerating letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Committee Chairs Adam Schiff, Eliot Engel, and Elijah Cummings making it clear that the White House is not going to be complying with the Democrats for impeachment inquiry. I want to take you through two important passages from this letter. Because I believe it's necessary to lay out what this fight is really all about. The current proceedings are nothing more than an unconstitutional exercise in political theater, an unauthorized impeachment inquiry that conflicts with all historical precedent and rides roughshod over due process and the separation of powers. It continues \"Your inquiry is constitutionally invalid in a violation of due process. In the history of our nation, the House of Representatives have never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the President without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step.\" Now as we told you last night one of the most fateful decisions of the entire charade was when Nancy Pelosi put Adam Schiff in charge of it all. Schiff is a prevaricating, priggish partisan. He's one of the many reasons why the White House is dismissing this entire episode as a farce. The White House Counsel is 100 percent correct. This non-impeachment, impeachment is not a constitutional undertaking it's a political hit job. Exactly what our founders did not want for our republic. Consider this commentary about the dangers of impeachment. The effect of impeachment is to overturn the popular will of the voters. We must not overturn an election and remove a president from office except to defend our system of government or our constitutional liberties against a dire threat. And we must not do so without an overwhelming consensus of the American people. There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or impeachment supported by one of our major political parties and opposed by another. Such an impeachment will produce divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come, and will call into question the very legitimacy of our political institutions. Sounds like the views of our next guests, perhaps, Rudy Giuliani and Joe DiGenova -- wrong. Those were the 1998 anti-impeachment views of none other than current House Judiciary Committee Chair, Jerry Nadler. So, my friends, what has changed? Donald Trump is in the White House, that's what changed. Here now, the aforementioned, Rudy Giuliani, personal attorney to the president, and Joe DiGenova, former U.S. attorney, frequent guest. Rudy, what does this forceful letter mean from Cipollone?"

If they had on the floor a vote to establish an impeachment inquiry, that would give the Republicans subpoena power. But the Democrats aren't doing that. They want to deny them subpoena power. So, what do we get? We get, first one, anonymous informant, then a second anonymous informant, I refuse to call them whistleblowers. These two nonentities are suicide bombers that the Democrats have unleashed on the democratic process. They actually think that the American people are going to accept having people testify secretly without anyone knowing who they are, where they worked, what their party affiliation was, who they conspired with.

We already knew that Durham would be reviewing the days leading up to the 2016 election and through the inauguration, but now based on his findings, Durham is looking into a wider timeline of events, from the beginning of the Russia probe all the way until the spring of 2017 when Robert Mueller was named Special Counsel. Joining me now, Gregg Jarrett, FOX News legal analyst, and author of the brand-new book -- we were talking about the witch hunt, Jarrett, earlier -- \"Witch Hunt,\" which touches on a lot of tonight's breaking news. He also hosts the new FOX Nation show of the same name, both out today. So happy he's on. Along with him, of course, in Washington with me is Sara Carter, FOX News contributor, investigative reporter. Gregg, the Democrat and deep state conspiracy is unraveling.

And now that we know that the Durham investigation is expanding, that pretty much means he has already found some acts of lawlessness and corruption. He's asking now for additional personnel, he's gone overseas to two different countries to gather evidence not of Trump-Russia collusion, but of FBI, Department of Justice, Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee collusion. So I think that now that it is expanding, he's not just looking into how James Comey violated FBI regulations by launching an investigation of Trump without a shred of evidence. He is also looking into lying and spying, undercover informants that were used, lying to the FISA court. He should also look, as I point out in my book, that Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel not based on law or evidence or even following the regulations. He defied the regulations and appointed Bob Mueller in an active vengeance, retaliation against Donald Trump. And not only that, he ought to look at Bob Mueller's conflicts of interest in this case, which are egregious."

They're running for the hills, because John Brennan, just even his rhetoric is dangerous, both to the United States national security, and because we know Brennan's involvement with investigating -- part of this entire issue of the investigation into President Trump's campaign began with John Brennan, began with the CIA. Why do I say that? Because we know it occurred overseas. We were accepting information, the FBI, from Christopher Steele, who is a foreign former spy for MI6. He was funneling information, that information was well-known to the CIA in London. That information was well-known to those FBI agents that went there and spread these malicious lies. Because what do we know now? Laura, we know none of it was verified, that this dossier that they used to target President Trump and his administration and his campaign, that dossier was based on lies. And then it was handed over to the FISA court. And the foreign intelligence surveillance court said OK, this has been verified. Look, the FBI handed it to us, it says verified on the document.

As you mentioned, he only lost by 44,000 votes out of about 3 million cast. So it is definitely in play. And this is the kind of stunt that does two things. It fires up Trump's base, and it turns off independents because it's just nakedly political. So look, Minnesota is definitely in play, and if Trump manages to steal Minnesota, that really expands the map for him. And it's 10 electoral votes, and that will offset any losses that he might have in Wisconsin or someplace else. So Minnesota is going to be a key presidential state in 2020, and it's very, very much in play."

This is a fact, they state it very clearly. It's not only the idea that they want to impeach President Trump, they want to impeach the Trump voter. And I think that's very unfortunate. When you're also talking about Minnesota, let's remember, from a structural standpoint, the campaign only had one staffer in 2016. That's grown to about 20 staffers that we have right now on the ground. In addition to that, in 2016 we spent $30,000 in Minnesota.
