I'm Dana Perino along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Harold Ford, Jr., Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld. \"The Five\" -- it's 5:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" The president's son is one step away from serious legal troubles. Federal agents investigating Hunter Biden reportedly think they have enough evidence to charge him with tax crimes and for lying about his drug use on a federal gun form. The legal fate of the first son now in the hands of a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware. Sources telling Fox the matter remains in a sensitive and critical phase. The Feds appeared to be closing in after a 4-year investigation, which started over Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings. Hunter Biden's lawyers not denying the story and instead taking issue on the leak, saying this, \"It is a federal felony for a federal agent to leak information about a grand jury investigation such as this one. Any agent you cite as a source in your article apparently has committed such felony. We expect the Department of Justice will diligently investigate and prosecute such bad actors.\" Judge, take us through it. What's going on?",

      "sentences": "Oh, I love it. They want the Department of Justice to diligently investigate that leak. Gee, what happened to that leak of the Supreme Court decision, that Dobbs decision? I haven't heard a word about that. Okay, let's get back to what we're doing here with Hunter Biden. They did the -- they started this investigation in 2018. It's been four years. We know already that the grand jury concluded in the middle of the summer. Now, did they vote a true bill or did they not vote a true bill? Is there an indictment or is there not an indictment? In order to indict someone like the son of a president, you've to get the permission of the deputy attorney general. That is Lisa Monaco, I understand. And Merrick Garland, everybody, don't let anybody fool you. There is no wall there. Merrick Garland is making the call here. So, they need that decision. Now, if they already got an indictment then all they need is for the deputy AG, the DAG, to say okay, go with it. But then we are within 60 to 90 days of an election. You're really not supposed to indict anyone where it might impact an election. Sure, he is not the candidate, but he is the son of a candidate, so that would apply, as well. Now, they are talking about indicting him on tax crimes and making a false statement. Are you kidding? Number one, lying on that application for the pistol permit, that's a given, that is absolutely a given. What about criminal possession of a weapon? We've got enough pictures of him possessing that weapon while he is naked in various stages of clothed - - being clothed and not clothed, so we've got a few more charges there. Tax crimes, plural, hopefully. What about Foreign Agent Registration Act? This kid was going through Europe with a vacuum cleaner sucking up money in a pay to play for the United States. And Joe, of course, is the big guy that Tony Bobulinski has come out and said, gee, the Feds came and talked to me but they never came back. Now, let's talk about the fact that if they didn't vote that indictment yet and they have to get permission, they can bring back another grand jury or bring this grand jury back in. But his attorney says, well, even though the federal agents say that they have enough, it's not just a federal agents who decide. Well, gee, that's what happened with Hillary Clinton, isn't it? The FBI decided, but that wasn't right either. But here we've got them saying that the evidence is being provided by the defense that should be included as well. What is this, a trial or is this a grand jury? You indict based upon evidence, you go forward. Don't talk to me about defense evidence. And finally, what about this Tim Thibault who Senator Chuck Grassley talked about suppressing evidence that wanted -- and the whistle-blowers came out and said they ended that investigation. So, you've got all kinds of other charges. The timing is very unusual. Is anyone going to look at the paintings and whether or not that was a problem? That is something that should be looked into. There's a lot more to this than just a tax charge and a lying on an application.",

It is just too big and it's no coincidence that this report comes out days after Tony B. goes on Tucker Carlson and blows the whole thing wide open again. My source tells me that Hunter Biden rejected a pretty sweet plea deal, and they were going to have him plea, no prison time, a couple million dollars in fines, and he turned it down. That was a bad idea because now I'm hearing it's about $15 million in fines and they are throwing more felonies that he has to plead to. We're hearing about whistle-blowers that are coming out in the FBI. We're hearing about possible more whistle-blowers who know and have done business with the Biden family, possibly coming out, publicly. When the Republicans take the House, who is it going to be, Jim Jordan? One of these guys is going to have the gavel and they are going to be calling associates of the Biden family to testify, under oath on live television. They will be subpoenaing Treasury records that show these suspicious wire transfers from China and Russia and God knows where. They are not going to be able to stop that. CNN, MSNBC, they haven't seen this evidence, but you're going to have Tony B., you're going to have more people coming out under oath, answering questions. This is not a Hunter story. This is a Joe Biden story. The house of cards could fall if they keep the pressure on. Think about this. If you follow the evidence to where this is going, Joe Biden is a traitor because Joe Biden was going to be the front man for China's Belt and Road Initiative. China's Belt and Road Initiative was the biggest challenge the United States supremacy we've ever had. This is their imperial commercial strategy to supplant the United States as the number one world power. They were paying the Biden family to be the face of that. the American face of the Chinese Belt and Road. And Biden was getting paid to do that. I have no -- I don't see how you can keep this under wraps for that much longer and this might be the perfect excuse for the Democrats to say hey, Joe, we don't want you to run anymore. Here is a good excuse why you are not going to.",

To your point about the fact that, you know, maybe this is good for the Democrats. If you were to report any of this stuff prior to the 2020 election you would have been banned from social media, ostracized by all of the smarty-pants in the media. But now it's okay, right? And I think it's because they realize the cabal to bury this story worked. They got Joe elected, and now they can use this story to bury Joe. So, I don't think they're that -- there isn't an urgency or rush to stop this story because you know what, if it does the work that they want it to do, which is to get Joe off the stage, then actually it's going to work for them. I think, however, before we discuss any more of this this, we should run it by the exact same 50 intel agents to find out if this is actually more Russian disinfo and I just think that this -- it's weird, you know. For me, I'm so jaded by the Hunter Biden stuff that I can't even tell what's a big deal anymore. Like, is this the big deal? Is it not the big deal? I think that's another success of the media, is that if the Biden stuff had come out in one big chunk, it would have been staggering beyond any scandal. I mean, that collusion, the influence peddling, the drugs, the hookers, the guns, it's a massive story. But it's kind of like dripped, dripped out, it was diluted by time. So now it is kind of like a daily comic strip and it's like oh, yeah, that guy. We don't even report on it as much, but I think that like, I do believe that if congress is won by the Republicans, they definitely, definitely have to do hearings.",

I don't have a whole lot to say other than the reporting is what it is. I've always said anytime, this investigation under him started, I believe under President Trump. And now it looks as if they -- it may conclude in an indictment. I'd say one less thing, I don't take any glee in any one who has misfortune who or who has a fault.

Where all of the big CEOs? They are hiding. And it really -- I think it's bad. I think it's bad for the economy. It's bad for -- they could write a letter, like do a statement. But there is nobody out there actually driving the message except for their association in Washington, D.C., which is fine and good, but I'm like why aren't you guys out there? Why aren't you defending your energy workers? Don't just leave it to us. You guys should get out there and do it, too. And the last thing on the F-bomb with Biden. The thing that I felt was strange is that why are you talking about yourself in the middle of a disaster zone?",

I'm Dana Perino along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Harold Ford, Jr., Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld. \"The Five\" -- it's 5:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" The president's son is one step away from serious legal troubles. Federal agents investigating Hunter Biden reportedly think they have enough evidence to charge him with tax crimes and for lying about his drug use on a federal gun form. The legal fate of the first son now in the hands of a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware. Sources telling Fox the matter remains in a sensitive and critical phase. The Feds appeared to be closing in after a 4-year investigation, which started over Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings. Hunter Biden's lawyers not denying the story and instead taking issue on the leak, saying this, \"It is a federal felony for a federal agent to leak information about a grand jury investigation such as this one. Any agent you cite as a source in your article apparently has committed such felony. We expect the Department of Justice will diligently investigate and prosecute such bad actors.\" Judge, take us through it. What's going on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Oh, I love it. They want the Department of Justice to diligently investigate that leak. Gee, what happened to that leak of the Supreme Court decision, that Dobbs decision? I haven't heard a word about that. Okay, let's get back to what we're doing here with Hunter Biden. They did the -- they started this investigation in 2018. It's been four years. We know already that the grand jury concluded in the middle of the summer. Now, did they vote a true bill or did they not vote a true bill? Is there an indictment or is there not an indictment? In order to indict someone like the son of a president, you've to get the permission of the deputy attorney general. That is Lisa Monaco, I understand. And Merrick Garland, everybody, don't let anybody fool you. There is no wall there. Merrick Garland is making the call here. So, they need that decision. Now, if they already got an indictment then all they need is for the deputy AG, the DAG, to say okay, go with it. But then we are within 60 to 90 days of an election. You're really not supposed to indict anyone where it might impact an election. Sure, he is not the candidate, but he is the son of a candidate, so that would apply, as well. Now, they are talking about indicting him on tax crimes and making a false statement. Are you kidding? Number one, lying on that application for the pistol permit, that's a given, that is absolutely a given. What about criminal possession of a weapon? We've got enough pictures of him possessing that weapon while he is naked in various stages of clothed - - being clothed and not clothed, so we've got a few more charges there. Tax crimes, plural, hopefully. What about Foreign Agent Registration Act? This kid was going through Europe with a vacuum cleaner sucking up money in a pay to play for the United States. And Joe, of course, is the big guy that Tony Bobulinski has come out and said, gee, the Feds came and talked to me but they never came back. Now, let's talk about the fact that if they didn't vote that indictment yet and they have to get permission, they can bring back another grand jury or bring this grand jury back in. But his attorney says, well, even though the federal agents say that they have enough, it's not just a federal agents who decide. Well, gee, that's what happened with Hillary Clinton, isn't it? The FBI decided, but that wasn't right either. But here we've got them saying that the evidence is being provided by the defense that should be included as well. What is this, a trial or is this a grand jury? You indict based upon evidence, you go forward. Don't talk to me about defense evidence. And finally, what about this Tim Thibault who Senator Chuck Grassley talked about suppressing evidence that wanted -- and the whistle-blowers came out and said they ended that investigation. So, you've got all kinds of other charges. The timing is very unusual. Is anyone going to look at the paintings and whether or not that was a problem? That is something that should be looked into. There's a lot more to this than just a tax charge and a lying on an application."

It is just too big and it's no coincidence that this report comes out days after Tony B. goes on Tucker Carlson and blows the whole thing wide open again. My source tells me that Hunter Biden rejected a pretty sweet plea deal, and they were going to have him plea, no prison time, a couple million dollars in fines, and he turned it down. That was a bad idea because now I'm hearing it's about $15 million in fines and they are throwing more felonies that he has to plead to. We're hearing about whistle-blowers that are coming out in the FBI. We're hearing about possible more whistle-blowers who know and have done business with the Biden family, possibly coming out, publicly. When the Republicans take the House, who is it going to be, Jim Jordan? One of these guys is going to have the gavel and they are going to be calling associates of the Biden family to testify, under oath on live television. They will be subpoenaing Treasury records that show these suspicious wire transfers from China and Russia and God knows where. They are not going to be able to stop that. CNN, MSNBC, they haven't seen this evidence, but you're going to have Tony B., you're going to have more people coming out under oath, answering questions. This is not a Hunter story. This is a Joe Biden story. The house of cards could fall if they keep the pressure on. Think about this. If you follow the evidence to where this is going, Joe Biden is a traitor because Joe Biden was going to be the front man for China's Belt and Road Initiative. China's Belt and Road Initiative was the biggest challenge the United States supremacy we've ever had. This is their imperial commercial strategy to supplant the United States as the number one world power. They were paying the Biden family to be the face of that. the American face of the Chinese Belt and Road. And Biden was getting paid to do that. I have no -- I don't see how you can keep this under wraps for that much longer and this might be the perfect excuse for the Democrats to say hey, Joe, we don't want you to run anymore. Here is a good excuse why you are not going to."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",

    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "God, I wish I had like Hunter's power. Like, nobody I know could get away with all of this for so long. To your point about the fact that, you know, maybe this is good for the Democrats. If you were to report any of this stuff prior to the 2020 election you would have been banned from social media, ostracized by all of the smarty-pants in the media. But now it's okay, right? And I think it's because they realize the cabal to bury this story worked. They got Joe elected, and now they can use this story to bury Joe. So, I don't think they're that -- there isn't an urgency or rush to stop this story because you know what, if it does the work that they want it to do, which is to get Joe off the stage, then actually it's going to work for them. I think, however, before we discuss any more of this this, we should run it by the exact same 50 intel agents to find out if this is actually more Russian disinfo and I just think that this -- it's weird, you know. For me, I'm so jaded by the Hunter Biden stuff that I can't even tell what's a big deal anymore. Like, is this the big deal? Is it not the big deal? I think that's another success of the media, is that if the Biden stuff had come out in one big chunk, it would have been staggering beyond any scandal. I mean, that collusion, the influence peddling, the drugs, the hookers, the guns, it's a massive story. But it's kind of like dripped, dripped out, it was diluted by time. So now it is kind of like a daily comic strip and it's like oh, yeah, that guy. We don't even report on it as much, but I think that like, I do believe that if congress is won by the Republicans, they definitely, definitely have to do hearings."

It sounds like Hunter Biden will be subjected to the American legal process. He knows as well as anyone, he is a graduate of one of the great law schools in this country, Yale Law School, that no one is above the law and he will have to face whatever it is he has to face. I don't have a whole lot to say other than the reporting is what it is. I've always said anytime, this investigation under him started, I believe under President Trump. And now it looks as if they -- it may conclude in an indictment. I'd say one less thing, I don't take any glee in any one who has misfortune who or who has a fault. He has written about this episode in his life, talked about the addictions, the drugs, and the alcohol. I'm blessed to have not had those addictions and we're all blessed to not have those kinds of addictions.

Someone else is telling Biden what his mind will tell him to make up because he doesn't -- he is a stooge, he is a puppet. We are not getting oil from Venezuela. That economy is collapsing. Their infrastructure is crumbling. That's a long-term play. I would argue that the stairs of Air Force One left with Biden and the bike, it's just to be accurate there. Here reminds me of the guy and I know, Greg, and I know -- and I know Harold know people like this, they are overcompensating, right? They are talking tough because deep down there is really not a lot there. I can do more push-ups than you. I graduated with honors. No, you didn't. You basically were last in your class. He feels that way because he feels like he is untouchable because he's got the CIA and the FBI and the big media behind him. But even sometimes made men get taken out, and I think that's what's starting to happen.

But just hearing him say that word, it triggered me because you know what it did? It made me miss Trump. Because he swore all the time! Who cares about the swearing? My impression is that Joe interprets his surroundings far differently than the managed reality around him, right? He is like playing virtual reality president, but he doesn't even need the headset. Think about it. Think about it. I don't take any pleasure in this disaster, though, but it affects every way in ways that Trump's tweets and words never did. You know what I mean? It's like there are actual physical consequences to this energy nonpolicy, to the crime, to the inflation, to the woke policies. And you still, like yesterday, you had the media and Democrats fretting that Trump might return to Twitter because of Elon Musk.

And I -- we -- there is a very exciting transition ahead. There is a lot of innovation for fusion or different ways to power our economy and we're going to get there eventually, but to get there, you have to have fossil fuels until that point. So, I would try to start to -- if I were a Democratic president, I would say I hear you on climate change, I'm with you, we're going to get there. Here's what I'm doing to try to get us to a point where we have zero emissions energy, but in the meantime, we're going to need these fossil fuel companies to do what they are best at doing. But I'll tell you one thing they're not good at doing, and that is defending themselves. And I am just shocked that they sit there and allow us to defend them. Where are they? Where all of the big CEOs? They are hiding. And it really -- I think it's bad. I think it's bad for the economy. It's bad for -- they could write a letter, like do a statement. But there is nobody out there actually driving the message except for their association in Washington, D.C., which is fine and good, but I'm like why aren't you guys out there? Why aren't you defending your energy workers? Don't just leave it to us. You guys should get out there and do it, too. And the last thing on the F-bomb with Biden.

We are kidding ourselves if we don't make the kinds of investments, and we have the capacity and ability to do so. I think President Biden, he seems rhetorically getting ready to get there, get there sooner. I listened to some at the administration on some of the rival networks this morning talk about where we are. We need to be saying exactly what's been said on this show. Let's drill.

The thing that they should be most concerned about is that U.S. murder rates rose by more than 4.3 percent in the past year. But what is absolutely amazing to me is in both LA and New York City did not report their crime statistics. Now, why would that be? Number one, the number would be far more than 4.3 percent in terms of the primary rising if New York and LA were in there. And number two, that you've got Hochul who's to talking about New York is the safest city and you've got Gavin Newsom was running for president who can't afford to have people know how dangerous his state is.

Some -- we need guys to get out there and do hard work for this country in an industrial capacity. And I don't want to make those guys have to go spend billions of dollars to get to this little degree that they should have been out in the country doing.

And this is why -- and this is why when you talk about canceling loan debt, you should definitely do it and punish the banks and punish the schools because they never brought it up. Whenever these kids were going to get a loan, they never told them about the interest rates or that -- they made -- they made it so easy. This I mean, we always talk about the evils of predatory lending. Predatory lending pretty much are the college loans. So, make the banks and make -- and make the schools pay.
