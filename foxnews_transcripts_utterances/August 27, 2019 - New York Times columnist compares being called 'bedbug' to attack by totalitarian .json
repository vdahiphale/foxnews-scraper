The prince calls the meeting a mistake but now, the FBI is conducting a forensic sweep of all Epstein emails, meaning potential exchanges between Epstein and his friends, including the prince.

Of course, his awkward touching and hugging beyond cringe-worthy, pretty gross to me. His small crowds in New Hampshire, Iowa are now causing major concern inside the Democratic Party establishment. His debate performances are beyond lackluster. And tonight, we are going to expose something much more troubling for Joe Biden and his 2020 ambitions. Now, while millions of Americans struggle to make ends meet under the anemic Biden-Obama economy, remember, 13 million Americans, food stands, 8 million more poverty, lowest labor participation rate since the ‘70s, that was their record.

He wanted no part of this. And that's not all. In May of 2016, the Ukrainian entry or energy company that shelled out a fortune to hunter Biden was facing a major corrupt investigation by Ukraine's top prosecutor.",

That's weeks before the special counsel investigation officially ended. The records state, quote: On March 4th, 2019, the Judiciary Committee opened an investigation into threats to the rule of law, encompassing alleged obstruction of justice. One critical purpose of the committee's investigation is to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president. The timing matters because days later in mid-March, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told \"The Washington Post\" that she was against impeachment, unless there is compelling and overwhelming evidence because she said it would divide Americans. And earlier this month, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler made the impeachment investigation official on CNN. The new court record suggests it began months earlier.",

Joining us with reaction, author of the upcoming book, the sequel, the second in the series, \"Witch Hunt\". That's on the heels of his number one bestseller, \"The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History\", and that it is, Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, and Judicial Watch president, Tom Fitton. Let's start, Gregg -- you had a great column about Andy McCabe and his rise to power today. We are still awaiting whether or not he is going to be indicted for lying and leaking. I don't know what the problem is because all these other people that lied and leaked, they ended up -- you know, let's go to the list: General Flynn, set up, by the way, by McCabe and Comey in a way that denied him I believe his Miranda rights. And then we've, let's see, Manafort, then we've got Cohen, and we got Papadopoulos. Why would it not apply to McCabe and Comey?",

The same legal standard ought to apply to him if there is any justice in our system of justice. This was a criminal referral by a neutral party, the inspector general of the Department of Justice, who said he lied not once, but four times. He said he never leaked information to the media, \"The Wall Street Journal.\" In fact, he did. He said he had no idea who authorized that leak when in fact, he's the one who authorized it and then, he was allowed to correct the record and in a tape-recorded interview continue to spew his false denials. So, you know, again, if we are going to apply an equal standard of justice and not selective prosecution based on politics, Andrew McCabe ought to be criminally prosecuted.",

You know, I don't understand the idea that you would wait for the big stuff while exonerating them or refusing to prosecute them for the little stuff the response ought to be is that we are considering this as part of a broader investigation and we are going to defer our prosecution decisions until we have all the flies and material in if indeed that is the real reasoning here. But you know, Mr. McCabe, you know, we just had documents come out a week or so ago. I think we talked about it here. 14 leaks exposed at the senior levels of the FBI. FBI special agents. Not one prosecution and one of those leaks highlighted in these documents that we received is the McCabe leak and the detail is lack of candor under oath and lack of candor not under oath. Both of which could be crimes if any other American committed it especially when you look at McCabe's desire to go after Flynn and ambushed Flynn with those FBI agents sent over with Strzok. The idea that Flynn who did not lie to the FBI then according to the evidence that this man would be allowed to get away with lying to investigators both under oath and not under oath, both of which are crimes, I can't - it would be terribly disappointing to millions of Americans of the Justice Department in addition to what--",

So when McCabe, when General Flynn said well, I need a lawyer and McCabe tells him no and then Comey brags about doing something he wouldn't do in the Obama or George W. Bush Administration and took advantage of the chaos and sent his guys in and when they had already unmasked General Flynn, they had a chapter and verse on everything he said. Remember, the FBI guys didn't think Flynn was lying. So then he has to ask the question, well, why would he admit that he was lying? Okay, world number one is going bankrupt, number two, they are threatening his family. They are saying we are just going to have to go after your son, too. I think that's why he said I will fall on the sword for my family. That's what he did. That's how we treat a 33-year-old that that serves in combat.",

Tonight, we are going to expose a shocking level of corruption surrounding sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe Biden and members of his family. We are talking about new clams tonight of nepotism and -- well, possible improper influence. We'll let you decide. It should make you sick to your stomach. How do all these people go into government and get so rich and their families get all these special deals with countries that they are governing and doing deals with? All right. \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, he will be here in a moment. He has a full report. Also, we have the very latest blunder from Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and yes, Robert Francis Beto Bozo O'Rourke, whose campaign is now on life support. But tonight, we begin with the breaking developments surrounding convicted Jeffrey Epstein including a new link between Epstein and of the prince of England. This is getting, well, more and more salacious every day. With more, we have our own Trace Gallagher. He's in our West Coast newsroom tonight. These connections deep, Trace."

There are now reports of at least two cameras that are in the hallway outside of the cell where Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself. But \"The Washington Post\" reports that one camera and video footage that is unusable. There apparently is clear footage that was also captured but no one is saying what the clear video might reveal or why the bad video is too flawed for investigators to use. And in the case with no witnesses, video is paramount. Meantime, 16 women who say they were sexually abused by Epstein appeared in court today, calling him a coward and manipulator. One alleged victim said not being allowed to face her predator in court, quote, eats away at her. And finally, Prince Andrew has gotten heat for visiting Epstein after he became a convicted sex offender. The prince calls the meeting a mistake but now, the FBI is conducting a forensic sweep of all Epstein emails, meaning potential exchanges between Epstein and his friends, including the prince. That could very well play a prominent role in the ongoing under age ring investigation -- Sean."

On the campaign trail tonight, creepy, sleepy, crazy Uncle Joe -- well, he has become well-known for the all the wrong reasons. Now, his head- scratching gaffes are now a constant, consistent embarrassment almost every day. He didn't remember what state he was in this past weekend. Of course, his awkward touching and hugging beyond cringe-worthy, pretty gross to me. His small crowds in New Hampshire, Iowa are now causing major concern inside the Democratic Party establishment. His debate performances are beyond lackluster. And tonight, we are going to expose something much more troubling for Joe Biden and his 2020 ambitions. Now, while millions of Americans struggle to make ends meet under the anemic Biden-Obama economy, remember, 13 million Americans, food stands, 8 million more poverty, lowest labor participation rate since the ‘70s, that was their record. While, his family members were allegedly profiting off of his powerful position, many of them. In 2014, at the very same time, Vice President Biden was leading the Obama administration's policy in Ukraine while his son, Hunter, he took a lucrative position on the board of a major Ukrainian gas company. He was reportedly making $50,000 a month even though he had zero experience in the gas industry, no experience in the country of Ukraine. Now, the arrangement was beyond sketchy and according to John Solomon, the \"Washington Examiner,\" well, John Kerry's stepson worked with Hunter Biden in the investment industry and cut all business ties with his former partner. He wanted no part of this. And that's not all. In May of 2016, the Ukrainian entry or energy company that shelled out a fortune to hunter Biden was facing a major corrupt investigation by Ukraine's top prosecutor. In response, well, vice president -- then-Vice President Joe Biden's threaten to withhold over a billion dollars in U.S. loan guarantees. Your tax money, using it as leverage if Ukraine didn't fire the prosecutor that was looking into that gas company that was paying his son all this money. And, ultimately, Ukraine relented to Biden's demands and sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe, he bragged about the whole thing on camera. Watch this."

We told you about the China influence and other corruption. Especially Peter Schweizer's book goes into great, great detail about that. And according to \"Politico\", Biden's younger brother James, well, he received a generous half a million dollar loan from a wealthy donor also with deep ties to Ukraine. Now, more recently, James Biden was accused of offering medical companies special access to his own brother. Joining us with more is investigative reporter. He's the executive vice president of \"The Hill\", John Solomon. John, by the way, also has a big story out tonight about how the president can avoid a GOP fumble on health care. It's @SeanHannity on Twitter. We'll be tweeting that out. John, let's start with this appeared in the Ukraine. Peter Schweizer think they're really good job talking about his son Hunter on Air Force Two. No experience in the hedge fund business either, so to speak, and yes, he gets a huge massive payday two weeks after traveling with his dad to China. Talk about Ukraine first."

Just about anywhere that they could get their hand out for money. That is going to be a problem. A conflict for a guy that wants to had a party that wants to make ethics an issue in the 2020 election. I can report on my own front that these documents you are talking about, we've had some favorable discussions in my lawsuit with Justice Department and State Department, thanks to the Southeastern Legal Foundation, I would expect in the next six to 10 weeks, we're going to get the first documents showing what the Bidens were doing at the State Department, at the embassy Kiev.

Poor working conditions, government-sanctioned beatings. And in case Bernie forgot, that's how China deals with extreme poverty. And today, China's massive working class, they remained some of the poorest people on this earth. Bernie Sanders wants to bring that system right here to the USA. Great. Or t least the very least, he wants the high tax socialist system in Finland where the government of Finland just collapsed. How many Democrats, how many socialist, liberals have you heard over the years that we need to be like Finland? Yes, their government class, why? Because of the extreme cost of their entitlement programs. It sounds like the New Green Deal already tried and failed. Think about how many people on the Democratic side of the aisle have praised Finland for years for that system that just collapsed. And Sanders socialist policies -- well, they are terrible. They won't work. They will lead to poverty. But according to the staff at one iconic San Francisco restaurant -- well, his personality is just as bad as his politics because the owner of John's Grill reported that during a recent dinner with his campaign staff, Bernie Sanders was rude, cranky, didn't want to shake anyone's hand, they didn't want to take pictures with any of the staff. Well, it seems like him on an average day when I watch him. But some one might want to remind Bernie Sanders that is running for president, not the supreme leader of the communist dictatorship. And Bernie is now running neck and neck with fellow socialist, Elizabeth Warren. Yes, 1/1,024. Pocahontas, as the president calls her. And according to \"Politico\", her fake, fraudulent, lifelong claims of Native American ancestry is weighing her down. As it turns out, the American people do not trust somebody who lied for decades about their own race and claim they are something that they're not to gain position. And as Bernie and Warren now battle it out with sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe, way, way, way down at the bottom of the pack is, well, Comrade de Blasio. At least he came on the show. I've got to give them some credit. But then you have Robert Francis Beto Bozo O'Rourke. Now, barring some kind of miracle, his campaign is essentially dead and done and buried. He is now pulling close to 1 percent. In order to garner any kind of attention, well, Bozo is now lobbing desperate political Hail Marys. And on the campaign trail, he actually put his full support -- pay attention, this is an about abortion -- his full support for, quote, abortion. It's not really abortion. That would be called murder, infanticide, up to one day before full-term delivery. In other words, he would support infanticide of a fully grown baby that can live independently. He would make that perfectly legal. And Beto Bozo also blamed the U.S. for an ongoing drought in Guatemala. We are responsible because everything bad is America's fault. Right, Robert Francis?

That's weeks before the special counsel investigation officially ended. The records state, quote: On March 4th, 2019, the Judiciary Committee opened an investigation into threats to the rule of law, encompassing alleged obstruction of justice. One critical purpose of the committee's investigation is to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president. The timing matters because days later in mid-March, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told \"The Washington Post\" that she was against impeachment, unless there is compelling and overwhelming evidence because she said it would divide Americans. And earlier this month, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler made the impeachment investigation official on CNN. The new court record suggests it began months earlier."

      "utterance": "Well, you are right. Look, Andrew McCabe is a guy who is helped put people behind bars for lying. The same legal standard ought to apply to him if there is any justice in our system of justice. This was a criminal referral by a neutral party, the inspector general of the Department of Justice, who said he lied not once, but four times. He said he never leaked information to the media, \"The Wall Street Journal.\" In fact, he did. He said he had no idea who authorized that leak when in fact, he's the one who authorized it and then, he was allowed to correct the record and in a tape-recorded interview continue to spew his false denials. So, you know, again, if we are going to apply an equal standard of justice and not selective prosecution based on politics, Andrew McCabe ought to be criminally prosecuted."

And one other thing that I keep hearing is that they are waiting for the full damning story before they move forward. There are criminal referrals with any legal action or indictment grand jury. Your thoughts on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, the idea that you might have a Democratic jury I think is just excuse making if that is the standard, no Democrat will ever be indicted for corruption here in Washington, D.C. it was the excuse not to prosecute Hillary Clinton during white water and it can't be excused again because that's a get out of jail free card for the Democratic liberals establishment running this town even though Trump is President. You know, I don't understand the idea that you would wait for the big stuff while exonerating them or refusing to prosecute them for the little stuff the response ought to be is that we are considering this as part of a broader investigation and we are going to defer our prosecution decisions until we have all the flies and material in if indeed that is the real reasoning here. But you know, Mr. McCabe, you know, we just had documents come out a week or so ago. I think we talked about it here. 14 leaks exposed at the senior levels of the FBI. FBI special agents. Not one prosecution and one of those leaks highlighted in these documents that we received is the McCabe leak and the detail is lack of candor under oath and lack of candor not under oath. Both of which could be crimes if any other American committed it especially when you look at McCabe's desire to go after Flynn and ambushed Flynn with those FBI agents sent over with Strzok. The idea that Flynn who did not lie to the FBI then according to the evidence that this man would be allowed to get away with lying to investigators both under oath and not under oath, both of which are crimes, I can't - it would be terribly disappointing to millions of Americans of the Justice Department in addition to what--"

We can't have a dual justice system in this country and look at all the people that Papadopoulos, Manafort, Cohen, General Flynn, which I want to ask you Gregg. So when McCabe, when General Flynn said well, I need a lawyer and McCabe tells him no and then Comey brags about doing something he wouldn't do in the Obama or George W. Bush Administration and took advantage of the chaos and sent his guys in and when they had already unmasked General Flynn, they had a chapter and verse on everything he said. Remember, the FBI guys didn't think Flynn was lying. So then he has to ask the question, well, why would he admit that he was lying? Okay, world number one is going bankrupt, number two, they are threatening his family. They are saying we are just going to have to go after your son, too. I think that's why he said I will fall on the sword for my family. That's what he did. That's how we treat a 33-year-old that that serves in combat."
