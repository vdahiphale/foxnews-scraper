Sometimes, you have a big fight and then you get back together again. But I think that the state dinner tonight in Buckingham Palace behind me again shows just how enduring the relationship between the United States and Britain really is. The fact that President Trump has gotten so much criticism by so many politicians here in the U.K., and the queen is saying, I don't care what any of you say, I think it's important to have President Trump over for a state visit. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And this is only the third time that the queen has given a state visit or at least so honored a United States president with a state visit. It was President Bush in November of 2003, President Obama in 2011, and now President Trump in 2019. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the queen's words, as she was giving her toast -- and you see her standing there -- that she -- a lot of it was about D-Day and the shared sacrifice of trying to liberate France and the rest of Europe from the Nazi stronghold, but also saying that: \"We are bound by the strength and depth of our economic ties. And, as we look to the future, I'm sure that our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us.\" And the president returning the compliment to the queen as well, saying there is so much that binds together the United States and the U.K. And we will see that for the rest of this evening, at least. We have seen, though, in other corners the divisions that I talked about. The London mayor and the president have never had any kind of a good relationship. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Jeremy Corbyn, who is the leader of the Labor Party and a person who could, depending on how the next few months go, wind up as prime minister, though it's probably highly unlikely that he would, doesn't like the president at all, is going to be speaking to one of the big protests that will be protesting the president's presence here tomorrow. So that's another person that doesn't like the fact that the president is here. And we see a lot of protesters out in the streets tonight. We will see some tomorrow as well. But the very fact that the president and the queen can come to common ground on this ceremonious occasion here at the palace tonight, and then the solemn ceremonies that will take place in the next few days at Portsmouth on Wednesday, which is the part, the port in the U.K., where all of the allied forces departed from, bound for the beaches of Normandy. And then the president in Normandy on the 6th, which will be the 75th anniversary of D-Day, to give praise and to honor those who fought and gave their lives to dislodge the Nazis from France and then start the drive toward Berlin. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It is a very, very special occasion here tonight, despite the fact, Neil, that some people believe that the queen should never have done this. The president will have meetings tomorrow with Theresa May, their last time together before Theresa May steps down as the prime minister, several issues of great importance on the table, Brexit, trade. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president doesn't like the fact that the U.K. is going to use Chinese- made Huawei components and its 5G system. So those two will have a lot to talk about as they speak together for the last time. So still lots ahead, even though today is winding down here in the U.K. -- Neil.",

I want to show you something that indicates how fractured this give and take has hit our economy and the fear of a global slowdown. This is a look at a 10-year treasury note. Now, without getting arcane here, it is down to 2.08 percent. Now, to put that in perspective, it was at a little north of 2.5 percent not more than a couple of weeks ago. That tells you something, that people are running to the safety of treasury bonds and notes because they're fretful of the slowdown going on in the economy and at least a safe place to park money if the stock market's going to have a rout. And for the Nasdaq today, it slipped into correction territory, in other words, falling now better than 10 percent from its highs reached on April 30. The Dow and the S&P 500, they're down about 7 percent or so from their highs. But that correction stop for the Nasdaq jarred a lot of folks rich in technology issues that have been taking it on the chin maybe because of concerns about what's happening in China and how this growing trade friction could develop into something worse, and, of course -- and we will get into this in a bit -- antitrust investigations into them.

And they just cut away from a dinner honoring president of the United States' royal visit and royal treatment for the president of the United States, for the queen, the third president she has so honored. It is a big day and a big event. There are the protests. It comes with the territory. But there are also some promising signs in what was once deemed to be sort of a tested relationship. It is still tested on trade issues, on political issues, on climate change issues. But when it comes to our common bonds, these two countries, which used to be far, far, far apart, when they were once one together -- of course, we got our independence, and then we have got really a nice ally in it for each of us. The fallout from all of this and what is in store now for a president who has a very busy week ahead of him, to John Roberts in London with more. John, what's next on the agenda?"

      "utterance": "Relationships are never easy, are they, Neil. Sometimes, you agree with each other.  Sometimes, you don't agree with each other. Sometimes, you have a big fight and then you get back together again. But I think that the state dinner tonight in Buckingham Palace behind me again shows just how enduring the relationship between the United States and Britain really is. The fact that President Trump has gotten so much criticism by so many politicians here in the U.K., and the queen is saying, I don't care what any of you say, I think it's important to have President Trump over for a state visit. And this is only the third time that the queen has given a state visit or at least so honored a United States president with a state visit. It was President Bush in November of 2003, President Obama in 2011, and now President Trump in 2019."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And the queen's words, as she was giving her toast -- and you see her standing there -- that she -- a lot of it was about D-Day and the shared sacrifice of trying to liberate France and the rest of Europe from the Nazi stronghold, but also saying that",
      "utterance": "\"We are bound by the strength and depth of our economic ties. And, as we look to the future, I'm sure that our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us.\" And the president returning the compliment to the queen as well, saying there is so much that binds together the United States and the U.K. And we will see that for the rest of this evening, at least. We have seen, though, in other corners the divisions that I talked about. The London mayor and the president have never had any kind of a good relationship. Jeremy Corbyn, who is the leader of the Labor Party and a person who could, depending on how the next few months go, wind up as prime minister, though it's probably highly unlikely that he would, doesn't like the president at all, is going to be speaking to one of the big protests that will be protesting the president's presence here tomorrow. So that's another person that doesn't like the fact that the president is here. And we see a lot of protesters out in the streets tonight. We will see some tomorrow as well. But the very fact that the president and the queen can come to common ground on this ceremonious occasion here at the palace tonight, and then the solemn ceremonies that will take place in the next few days at Portsmouth on Wednesday, which is the part, the port in the U.K., where all of the allied forces departed from, bound for the beaches of Normandy. And then the president in Normandy on the 6th, which will be the 75th anniversary of D-Day, to give praise and to honor those who fought and gave their lives to dislodge the Nazis from France and then start the drive toward Berlin. It is a very, very special occasion here tonight, despite the fact, Neil, that some people believe that the queen should never have done this. The president will have meetings tomorrow with Theresa May, their last time together before Theresa May steps down as the prime minister, several issues of great importance on the table, Brexit, trade. The president doesn't like the fact that the U.K. is going to use Chinese- made Huawei components and its 5G system. So those two will have a lot to talk about as they speak together for the last time. So still lots ahead, even though today is winding down here in the U.K. -- Neil."

In fact, I believe there's just one lone protester behind me who is protesting President Trump's banquet and his attendance at that banquet. But it is tomorrow where we're expecting the real protesters to come out.  And their estimates are up to 250,000 people who might take to the streets of London.  But it's not just among the people where the protests are taking place. It's also among some of the higher political echelons. And we have seen, as we just heard there from John Roberts, Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn speaking out, but also the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has had a longstanding feud with President Trump here. He spoke earlier today. Here's what he said."

And there are so many things about President Donald Trump's policies that are the antithesis of our values in London, plus our values as a country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALL",
      "utterance": "President Trump, though, hit back very quickly after that, saying: \"Sadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as mayor of London, has been foolishly nasty to the visiting president of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone-cold loser, who should focus on crime in London, not me.\" Security across London has, of course, been incredibly high, as it as with any presidential visit; $35 million is what the security operation has cost. The U.K. government have brought in another 10,000 officers to London to help with it. And that giant blimp which we saw last year depicting President Trump as a baby has been given permission to fly again tomorrow, been given permission by Sadiq Khan. At the same time, there are people who are saying that all these protests are rather shortsighted, especially as the U.K. is at such a crossroads with Brexit, and at a time when relationships with the U.S. are so important. And many people tomorrow will be listening out for some mention of a free trade deal. President Trump has said so in the past, and certainly, if Brexit goes ahead and the U.S. is there and President Trump is willing to offer something like that, that will be huge step forward. The other big question is whether or not he offers some kind of endorsement for the future leader, the future prime minister this country. We don't know that, though he is meeting with Prime Minister May just days before she stands down. So he comes at a very interesting time -- Neil."

Turns out your lungs are more powerful than his, but great perseverance, Benjamin Hall, reporting live from London. All right, now the take on all this is Brooke Rogers from The New York Post. We have got former Florida Republican Congressman Allen West, business developer Tom Meoli (ph). Brooke, let me get your take on timing of protests. I understand it. It's everyone's right to protest a visit in free countries. But I just think of this week in general, this being the 75th anniversary of Normandy, that maybe , maybe, in this environment, at this time, a visiting president of the United States, bring it down a bit. No matter how you feel about Donald Trump, it just seems, this particular week, this particular anniversary, rude."

I think that tensions in Britain in general are very hot, so maybe that he is getting a little -- a little shade off of that. It's true that it's probably not an appropriate time. At the same time, this is -- people have very strong feelings about it. I think that people -- the British people are very frustrated with their own government in general. And we're seeing a lot of that in terms of Theresa May has been kind of the face of dysfunction in Britain right now."

Susan, what do you make of these protests? And I always stress, I mean, if you're very passionate to protest, you're passionate. And I get that. And I know that. And I know there are a lot of people who either love Donald Trump or hate Donald Trump, but he is the American president. He does represent this country. And almost any other time, public protests are fine, but not to allow them to speak in Parliament, that's their call. They just dismissed Parliament, so that it wouldn't even be an issue. And some of this other stuff going on in the city of London, I know the back and forth with that city's mayor and this president go back sometime.

So you had them out in California last week taking potshots at the president and calling for impeachment. So sort of a parallel universe going on right now, but you would hope that that -- that politics would end at the water's edge. It has not. Trump is not afraid to punch back and meddle in British politics, as we have seen over the years. And he's going to take some heat from that because of it."

Look, both of you are going to your room without supper, which, for me, would have been a fatal call. But, Allen West, I'm looking at this right now and this thriving relationship, despite all the controversies, and now a government that is wrestling with who the next prime minister will be and a party trying to choose that. We do know one thing. Whether it's Nigel Farage, who we know comes through this, or Boris Johnson, these are populist figures who very much relate to and some say planted the seeds for Donald Trump himself and his election a couple years back. So, something is in the European waters there that very closely mirror the populist positions this president has taken. I don't know who came first or who is -- who drove this first. But it is a phenomena that you can't ignore. I'm looking at the president's own approval ratings, weak as they are deemed in this country. They are a lot stronger than certainly his host's, certainly the French president, certainly the German chancellor, the Italian premier, and I could go on and on. What happened?"

And as a son of a man who fought in World War II, I was also there in Europe standing against the Soviet Union specter with British soldiers and also stood with British soldiers in Helmand Province down in Afghanistan. I think it's very important that we understand those ties that bring us together against the specters of Nazism and the Soviet Union and also Islamic jihadism. And that's what we should be focused on. When I look at what is happening with President Trump and in Europe, in the U.K., you have people that rejected that collectivist body politic called the European Union. And I think that the Brits need to understand that, right now, as they go forward, one of their best trade partners can be the United States of America to help them with their economic growth and prosperity. And I think you're seeing a lot more of that populist movement, if you want to call it that, across Europe. We seen it in Brazil with their new president as well, where the people want to be focused upon for their own, let's say, manifest destiny, instead of these collectivist globalist viewpoints."

And to an earlier view that is the United States that could prove that trading linchpin for Britain if it's left on its own or leaves the European Union without a deal, I'm just wondering how that will all come together, if it comes together at all."

      "utterance": "I mean, I think the fact that the United States and the U.K. at this time are still in communication with each other, you have -- you have figures like Mayor Khan who have been very vocal in their opposition to Trump. But when it comes down to it, the major figures still are in communication with Trump, and it will depend a lot on who the next prime minister is. We have seen both the Labor Party and the Conservative Party taking huge hits because of the Brexit mess, and the Brexit Party has flown to the front. So I think that whoever the next prime minister is, if they can work with Trump, with whoever comes around in 2020, I think that it will continue."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, that was Rick Grenell earlier with me on Fox Business Network talking about the fact that everyone wants to do business with the United States. That is very true. So, when it's in peril, as it seems to be right now, of getting a China trade deal done, and now that we have upped the ante, going after the Mexicans and putting 5 percent tariffs on a lot of goods that they import to us -- or export to us -- we import from them -- there are big questions here whether this could continue. I want to show you something that indicates how fractured this give and take has hit our economy and the fear of a global slowdown. This is a look at a 10-year treasury note. Now, without getting arcane here, it is down to 2.08 percent. Now, to put that in perspective, it was at a little north of 2.5 percent not more than a couple of weeks ago. That tells you something, that people are running to the safety of treasury bonds and notes because they're fretful of the slowdown going on in the economy and at least a safe place to park money if the stock market's going to have a rout. And for the Nasdaq today, it slipped into correction territory, in other words, falling now better than 10 percent from its highs reached on April 30. The Dow and the S&P 500, they're down about 7 percent or so from their highs. But that correction stop for the Nasdaq jarred a lot of folks rich in technology issues that have been taking it on the chin maybe because of concerns about what's happening in China and how this growing trade friction could develop into something worse, and, of course -- and we will get into this in a bit -- antitrust investigations into them. We got Ann Berry joining us. We got Jonas Max Ferris. Ann, the fear seems to be that a slowdown is now almost a given, and the Federal Reserve seems to be, at least from one district president, greasing the skids for just that. What do you think?"

So, in as much as we have seen noises that the Fed is watching very closely what's going off -- into the trade environment, I think that's good news.  But, nevertheless, as you said, Neil, I think the unexpected nature of some of these trade moves has really rattled the market. And seeing that yield curve inversion just adds to the fear of a recession coming."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, this isn't just a little bit of a drop, Jonas, in interest rates. This is a big drop. Now, the flip side of that, it's going to make buying a home a lot more affordable. I mean, the 30-year mortgage now is at 3.99 percent. So there is that. Which benefits then?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONAS MAX FERRIS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, they're watching it and seeing how much damage they did raising short-term rates too early, too high last year. That is a benefit. And that's the self-correcting benefit, that it's so much cheaper now to refinance a mortgage, because that slowed down too a few months ago and last year, when rates were high, or just buy a new home. The problem is, people are -- consumers and investors are actually both kind of fearful right now, and not dying to go buy a new home, even though it's cheaper now on a monthly basis than it was just even a few weeks ago, leave alone last year. And hopefully those things will keep us out of a recession, as will the current state of tax breaks and tax cuts that went into effect. I got to say, the tariff war gets a lot of presses as what is the drag right now and why interest rates are going down, investors are scared. I think it's like number three after the tech area problems, which really what was driving the market higher anyway."

      "speaker": "BERRY",

I think the key to this, though, Neil, is looking at this on a sector-by- sector basis, because you still see some elements of the economy that are continuing to do exceptionally well. Where you're seeing slowdown is in retail earnings, for example. When you look at the manufacturing data, we're now at levels that we last saw in 2016. Tech, we are thinking is regulatory issues. But if you actually look at earnings and if you look at the upticks in their fundamental business models, you're still seeing enormous growth where innovation is leading the way."

And, certainly, London, Buckingham Palace have it all, other places, castles that the queen has at her disposal. It's -- it really is literally majestic.

Andy Ruiz, a journeymen, as they like to say, a Mexican boxer by descent, doesn't look like fit as a fiddle. Maybe that's in the eye of the beholder. And who am I to judge?
