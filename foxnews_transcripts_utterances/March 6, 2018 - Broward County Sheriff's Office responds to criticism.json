Trump won by defying the conventional wisdom of the establishment and he has continued to do just that.

Democrats asked for amnesty for 800,000 DREAMers. OK. Well, Donald Trump didn't actually try to meet them halfway, he actually went toward them. He raised them a million, as an amnesty for 1.8 million illegal immigrants. Now I wasn't wild about that offer, frankly, but it did show Donald Trump's willingness to compromise and frankly to get something done. All the Democrats had to do was agree to border security and a wall and of course, to end the absurd policy of chain migration. So, to save the DACA people, who can refuse that deal? Well, the answer is the Democrats could, because it would have given Donald Trump a win and deprived Democrats of a crucial campaign issue.

We cannot stand by idly while China floods our country with cheap steel and dominates the global market. Think about it this way, in 2000, that was before they became a member of the World Trade Organization, China accounted for 15 percent of global steelmaking capacity. By 2016, China had almost quintupled its share to nearly 49 percent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Does anyone think for a minute any of the experts think about where China will be by 2025 in steelmaking? Consider the national security implications of that. If you think that they are going to make our tanks and destroyers in a global conflict for us? The troubling thing is that when the establishment is wrong, as they have been on China, tax cuts, the illegal invasion of our country, they still lack the humility to admit they were wrong. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } National Journal reporting today that former President George W. Bush compared his administration to the Trump administration. Bush said, ‘sort of makes me look pretty good, doesn't it?’ Well, actually it doesn't unless endless wars, a financial crisis, unchecked immigration and leaving office with a 28 percent approval rating is pretty good. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, George W. Bush, God bless them, love him, great guy, he didn't vote for Donald Trump, so I frankly don't care what he has to say about Donald Trump at this point in time. For eight years, George W. Bush, the establishment of the GOP, was mute during the tyranny of the Obama administration. And now like old faithful he spouts off at every opportunity to bash President Trump either off the record or on the record. Resistance is not part of the solution and repeating the failed policies of the past is getting us nowhere. My message to the establishment of both parties. We've tried your expert ways for decades. It led to the rise of Communist China, which is now poised -- we don't turn things around, to be the dominant economic and military power in the world. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now President Trump, sometimes it feels like he's doing it all by himself, is trying to confront that threat and turn it around before it's too late. The globalist critics out there don't seem to care about with the freedom of the American people, whether it will be jeopardized, our ability to chart our own destiny, our own course the way that Donald Trump frankly sees it. The 2016 election results in those battleground states showed that the heartland was not ready to state its freedom to the gods of globalism. Those people empowered the president to protect their liberty and restore their economic independence and that's what he's doing. The experts be damned. And that's the angle.

They would become freer, America was going to be stronger as a result, our national standing, our international standing was going to be improved. This was Bill Clinton, George Bush, Alan Greenspan, the list goes on and on. Now all these years later the facts are in and my point is do the experts ever get held accountable to what has happened to freedom inside China, our standing, our steelmakers, our aluminum production, and I think it's time that people are actually held accountable. Trump is actually trying to do that, and he gets trashed 24/7 by the media who can't stand to be proven wrong at issue. That's my point.

Let me read to you what the Broward sheriff's office said in its fact-check on body cameras. Any suggestion that Sheriff Scott Israel or any other deputy from Broward Sheriff's office ordered body cameras to be turned on prior to entering the schools is false. What's your reaction to that? We have two well-placed sources tell us that in fact it was the case that they were told not to enter unless they had their body cameras on.",

He admitted to shooting a 19-year-old Brendan Tevlin in late June of 2014 as Tevlin sat at a traffic light in West Orange which is a few miles from Newark.

Now just look at the president's proposed to the DACA deal. Democrats asked for amnesty for 800,000 DREAMers. OK. Well, Donald Trump didn't actually try to meet them halfway, he actually went toward them. He raised them a million, as an amnesty for 1.8 million illegal immigrants. Now I wasn't wild about that offer, frankly, but it did show Donald Trump's willingness to compromise and frankly to get something done. All the Democrats had to do was agree to border security and a wall and of course, to end the absurd policy of chain migration. So, to save the DACA people, who can refuse that deal?

Gary Cohn argued one point, no tariffs, and other people, Bob Lighthizer, Wilbur Ross, they went for the economic nationalist point of view. Gary Cohn's worldview lost out. The populist vision that won Donald Trump the election won the day. Now this may have been brewing for a long time with Gary Cohn, and let's face it, working in the White House, getting hammered in the media for your every move, it takes its toll, it's not easy. But from an outsider's perspective, it certainly looks like Gary Cohn picked up his marbles and went back to Goldman Sachs. We cannot stand by idly while China floods our country with cheap steel and dominates the global market. Think about it this way, in 2000, that was before they became a member of the World Trade Organization, China accounted for 15 percent of global steelmaking capacity. By 2016, China had almost quintupled its share to nearly 49 percent. Does anyone think for a minute any of the experts think about where China will be by 2025 in steelmaking? Consider the national security implications of that. If you think that they are going to make our tanks and destroyers in a global conflict for us? The troubling thing is that when the establishment is wrong, as they have been on China, tax cuts, the illegal invasion of our country, they still lack the humility to admit they were wrong. National Journal reporting today that former President George W. Bush compared his administration to the Trump administration. Bush said, ‘sort of makes me look pretty good, doesn't it?’ Well, actually it doesn't unless endless wars, a financial crisis, unchecked immigration and leaving office with a 28 percent approval rating is pretty good. By the way, George W. Bush, God bless them, love him, great guy, he didn't vote for Donald Trump, so I frankly don't care what he has to say about Donald Trump at this point in time. For eight years, George W. Bush, the establishment of the GOP, was mute during the tyranny of the Obama administration. And now like old faithful he spouts off at every opportunity to bash President Trump either off the record or on the record. Resistance is not part of the solution and repeating the failed policies of the past is getting us nowhere. My message to the establishment of both parties. We've tried your expert ways for decades. It led to the rise of Communist China, which is now poised -- we don't turn things around, to be the dominant economic and military power in the world. Now President Trump, sometimes it feels like he's doing it all by himself, is trying to confront that threat and turn it around before it's too late. The globalist critics out there don't seem to care about with the freedom of the American people, whether it will be jeopardized, our ability to chart our own destiny, our own course the way that Donald Trump frankly sees it. The 2016 election results in those battleground states showed that the heartland was not ready to state its freedom to the gods of globalism. Those people empowered the president to protect their liberty and restore their economic independence and that's what he's doing. The experts be damned. And that's the angle. Joining us now for a reaction here Washington is Sebastian Gorka and former assistant to President Trump and Fox News contributor, and here with me is Philippe Reines, who is a former advisor to Hillary Clinton. If your phone goes off during my ANGLE -- I'm saying your name wrong."

For the last 20 years, the foreign affairs crowd, the Council on Foreign Relations, they sold us this narrative that as soon as China became a member of the World Trade Organization, most favored nation status, would play the sound bites ad nauseam him on the show over the last two weeks. They would become freer, America was going to be stronger as a result, our national standing, our international standing was going to be improved. This was Bill Clinton, George Bush, Alan Greenspan, the list goes on and on. Now all these years later the facts are in and my point is do the experts ever get held accountable to what has happened to freedom inside China, our standing, our steelmakers, our aluminum production, and I think it's time that people are actually held accountable. Trump is actually trying to do that, and he gets trashed 24/7 by the media who can't stand to be proven wrong at issue. That's my point. I think it's really interesting analysis that people want to say let's talk about Gary Cohn or Stormy Daniels. That's ridiculous. America is going to make a comeback because this president actually wants to stand up for the American worker. That's the story to cover. Go ahead."

Your party has said -- they predicted Armageddon on the Paris Accords. They predicted apocalypse because of tax reform. They said the world would be set on fire if we recognize Jerusalem as the eternal state, the eternal capital of the Israeli state. What happened? Nothing. None of those things happen. Your party failed America as much as the GOP rhino establishment. If you don't want to defend it, I understand because it's indefensible. This man was elected by the steelworkers of Youngstown, Ohio, that have seen factory after factory close down and think about this logic, Laura. Did you hear that in the last week, we can't do these tariffs because there's only 600,000 Americans in the steel industry, so what? Why shouldn't there be a million?

Now, previously the lawmakers supported the decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to let the DOJ's inspector general investigate his department. Let's discuss this important development. We have other news we got to get to with chief political reporter at the ‘Washington Examiner,’ Fox News contributor, Byron York, and former Hillary Clinton presidential campaign advisor, Richard Goodstein. All right, guys, no one is coming to blows on the set. You guys are going to make your points. Let's talk about first the special prosecutor point. Richard, you got this Michael Horowitz, inspector general at the Justice Department. By all accounts, he seems to be a very professional individual and his report should be coming out four to six weeks from now. But Congress doesn't think that he has the same powers that a special prosecutor would have in these circumstances given everything we've learned. What's your take?"

This is yet another one. The fact of the matter is we know everything we need to know having nothing to do with Carter Page and the FISA warrant, which is that the Russians offered to help Trump, Donald Jr. said love it. The Russians proceeded to help him and Donald Trump 100 times on the campaign trail mentioned WikiLeaks and urged the Russians to break the law and steal from Hillary Clinton."

There's no reason that it has to be duplicated in other committees. Now inside the Justice Department right now we have this respect inspector general report coming up in four to six weeks. It's an internal investigation into the way the FBI and the Justice Department handled a Hillary Clinton email affair. There's a lot of questions you can ask about that and people are expecting a pretty interesting report. The point that Gowdy and Goodlatte are making now, a lot of other Republicans too is not on this specific issue, this looking into the FISA warrant and all of that. There are so many people outside the Justice Department like Christopher Steele, like Sidney Blumenthal, the people who were in the Justice Department but who have not left like James Comey and Andrew McCabe. All of those people are not under the jurisdiction of the inspector general, so that's why they think they need a special counsel to look into it."

The sheriff's office is also denying reports that a captain told deputies to form a perimeter around the scene instead of going into confront the shooter. It says the perimeter was formed after the shooting had stopped. Joining us now with reaction is Jeff Bell, president of the Broward County Sheriff Deputies Association, and former L.A. police detective Mark Fuhrman. Gentlemen, great to see you. Jeff, let's start with you. Boy, they were issuing today after all these days that these reports were out there a flurry of denials. Let me read to you what the Broward sheriff's office said in its fact-check on body cameras. Any suggestion that Sheriff Scott Israel or any other deputy from Broward Sheriff's office ordered body cameras to be turned on prior to entering the schools is false. What's your reaction to that?

The people that were in charge of that scene where the deputies that first arrived. They were in charge of that tactical scene, they make all the calls. To have anybody make any kind of call on the radio is incompetence at the very best, and probably gets worse from there. It seems that there is nothing that they can account for immediately. It takes them a week, 10 days to come up with an excuse that still doesn't pass muster on what happened at that location. Those deputies didn't go in for a reason, but that doesn't let them off the hook. Those deputies are deputies, they are cops. They have a situation there and they need to act. They don't have want to wait for an order. They capable and train. They need to go in and confront the shooter. That was their job."

And this reminds of the Las Vegas shooting where we still haven't seen videotapes of the shooter checking into the hotel, bringing all the bags. Just like it never happened. We never see the video.

I've said it before, $887 million revised budget last year in the sheriff's office and we don't even have our own gun range. That's unacceptable. And the training that we do have, I have got to give credit to the sergeants and deputies that have gone to classes with what little they have to work with.

I think he has inherited a due bill from the Obama administration with some pretty unattractive options, one of which is the possibility of military force so that North Korea doesn't end up with nuclear weapons. And I think one thing the North now believes is that he's not afraid to carry through on that option. He doesn't want to do it, let's be clear, but unlike some of his predecessors he's not afraid to do it to protect American citizens. And that should have an effect on North Korea and China."

Who really worked hard on this?"

This is something -- in many cases he might say I don't care about North Korea or Iran except they've got nuclear weapons and it's a danger to Americans if they get the delivery capability for them. So I think he's driving the train. That's my impression."

They haven't done a blessed thing really to cause that result. I think they felt North Korea was really somebody else's problem. I think they are a little bit worried about it now precisely because we got so many of the White House was going to do something, who might impose tariffs on China. Can you imagine that?"

      "utterance": "The actor captured the spirit of the man who saved his country from the Nazis. His defiant words rallied the people of Britain and gave them courage to hold out long enough for the Americans to arrive. And together they destroyed the evil that was the Third Reich. Churchill is revered as the man who saved Europe and perhaps western civilization, but that isn't good enough for the people of the PC police, who launched a furious and unhinged backlash against the Oscars for honoring the great men via Oldman's best actor award. One tweet called Churchill a genocidal racist and the film an attempt to rehabilitate the British Empire's war criminals. Nice. Another tweet called him, quote, a bigot who was ideologically little different from Hitler and who was culpable in the starvation death of 3 million Bengalis. We are not going to re-litigate their revisionist history here. It's so pathetic. But Churchill was an indomitable leader who didn't mince words. He could be mercurial and often unreasonable, but here's what his critics overlook. Churchill might not have been a perfect man, but he was a great man because he alone had the courage to defy the naysayers and do what victory required."

A man who said he was on a jihad to avenge U.S. policy in the Middle East pled guilty today to killing a college student in New Jersey and he confessed to killing three other people in Washington state. He was 34-year-old Ali Muhammad Brown, a Seattle resident. He admitted to shooting a 19-year-old Brendan Tevlin in late June of 2014 as Tevlin sat at a traffic light in West Orange which is a few miles from Newark. And he also took responsibility for the fatal shooting of Dwone Anderson-Young, 23, and Ahmed Said, 27, earlier that month in Seattle after they left a gay nightclub, and for the deadly shooting of Leroy Henderson, 30, in the Seattle suburb of Skyway in April the same year. My goodness. And, again, hardly any coverage anywhere, but we've got to keep these stories at the forefront for all of you. That is all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream is up next with a phenomenal show on tap as always."
