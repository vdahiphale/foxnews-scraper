      "sentences": "Welcome to HANNITY. We begin with this FOX News alert: the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump, will join us for an exclusive interview. That's mere moment away. First, a quick recap of, well, Joe Biden's sippy cup's, pathetic, incoherent, at times angry and unhinge performance in Geneva today, on top of his disastrous G7 meetings. Let's be clear: The so-called summit with Vladimir Putin did absolutely nothing to advance any American interests in any way. That's a fact. Instead, Vladimir received a massive platform in exchange for a zero concessions whatsoever and then Putin use that platform to take shot after shot after shot at our country, the United States of America. Joe, of course, was nowhere to be found correcting the record, because he was afraid to stand next to Vladimir, probably because he is not capable of doing it. Putin did not commit to ending the cyberattacks against our country. He didn't take responsibility for the hijacking of over 100 U.S. companies, nine federal agencies. He didn't agree to free Americans now wrongfully imprisoned in his hostile regime of Russia. He didn't take responsibility for the Havana syndrome attack against U.S. diplomats. He didn't agree to stop poisoning and killing his political enemies. He didn't agree to curtail his military aggression in Eastern Europe and around the world. And yesterday, Russia conducted, oh, a massive naval drill, oh, about 300 miles off the coast of our state of Hawaii, the first time they have done this since the Cold War. Hmm, I wonder, Joey, if that was a coincidence when you think your pal Vladimir did it on purpose. We all know the answer. Now, Putin also gifted a spy satellite to the mullahs in Iran. How generous of him. Joe Biden was unable unwilling to hold Putin accountable for anything. As the chairman of the Human Rights Foundation put it today, even on MSDNC, Putin got what he wanted. Does that surprise anybody? Remember, just after Joe shuttered the Keystone XL pipeline high-paying career jobs for our fellow Americans in the energy sector, skill-specific jobs that he just took away with the stroke of a pen, then Joey turns around and gives Vladimir Putin, you know, the nod. He literally says okay on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline into Germany. That would bring the country that we're helping to defend against Russia, that would bring them closer and help make Russia richer again, and by overriding the State Department recommendation. Joe is told not to do it and he did it anyway. He gave the waiver and lifting all U.S. sanctions on the project. And what do we get in return for this grand gesture that will enrich Vladimir Putin and Russia? Nothing. We got nothing. Appeasement doesn't work, has never worked, never will work, especially when the commander-in- chief is like Joe frail and weak and constantly, cognitively, well, weakened. Putin doesn't respect and he doesn't fear Joe Biden in any way. So, let me be clear: we are not rooting for that hostile actor, that murderer, that killer from that hostile regime. He's a killer. He's a thug and frankly he's evil. He's a criminal in charge of a massive nuclear stockpile. So, obviously, it is critical that the us has a president who is sharp, mentally alert, tough, tenacious and a president willing to turn the screws on Vladimir to keep him in check. Unfortunately, Joe is not that guy. This week, Joe bumbled and bumbled his way through Europe, embarrassing the U.S. every step of the way. Today, he showed up to the summit with a pile of flash cards that he was constantly referencing and had a hard time keeping up with. Following the summit, no joint press conference. Why? Because the administration knew darn well Joe would be humiliated and for good reason. Instead, Joe delivered a short scripted speech from a teleprompter. If I had to bet, it was probably written by his staffers before they left Washington. And get this, during the remarks, well, president sippy cup once again botched his favorite line from your Declaration of Independence. Don't believe it? We got the videotape.",

But even that was too strenuous for president sippy cup. Now, just watch as Joe becomes completely unhinged after a very normal, reasonable question, even from a fake news CNN reporter.

A few minutes after that outburst on the tarmac, Joe was still very agitated, whining that the media was being too negative.

That would be a tough question. I don't remember you ever being asked that question. Ultimately, zero agreement struck. So the so-called big summit wasn't so big at all. Joe isn't worried. He thinks that Putin will change his malignant ways because he wants the world community to like and to respect him. That's not how it works, Joe. Is Joe really that dumb? I'm hoping he's just playing dumb on TV. Now, Putin doesn't give a rip with the United States or what Europe thinks or feels. He cares about power. He cares about money. He runs his country like a mob boss. He will continue to kill his political rivals and he will conduct criminal activities all around the world and probably bribe top children of (ph) vice presidents moving forward -- unless he's seriously challenged. Now, sanctions, financial penalties, the expansion of U.S. oil, gas are critical tools for American peace through strength diplomacy with Russia. But sadly, Joe Biden prefers the different approach, appeasement giving up energy independence, getting rid of American jobs but waivers for Vladimir. As we stated, that approach is never going to work. President Trump will respond to all this in just a few moments. First, joining us, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Jim Jordan, along with former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Mark, we start with you tonight. Your overall feeling about this. And to me, I think one of the greatest weaknesses -- the reason I suspect Joe wouldn't stand next to Vladimir and do a press conference is because whatever they prepared for Joe to say probably before leaving Washington, if they stuck with the talking points and it didn't happen, Vladimir would have corrected him right then and there and embarrassed him on the world stage, that's my suspicion.

He saw the weakness of Joe Biden, the president of the United States. He never saw that when Donald Trump was in the White House.

Okay, the -- I don't know of any Trump that got paid a penny from any oligarch in Russia, but I do know a guy by the name of Hunter with no experience that got three and a half million dollars from a Russian oligarch, the former first lady of Moscow.

How many times was Steve Mnuchin in the press shop addressing and outlining sanctions that we were taking against Russia? You had the CAATSA legislation that was signed. You -- there was banned Russian software in the first year. There was export restrictions. There was the Global Magnitsky Act.

What he got today was kind of a reset. Our ambassadors are going back to work in the respective capitals. There's going to be ongoing dialogue between our two nations about strategic issues like cyber security and nuclear issues. But there was nothing to really hold Vladimir Putin accountable.

You're always must-see TV, but I think we need to make that happen you know one of the things that you said earlier that I think Hillary Clinton said that you need to deal with Putin differently in public and differently in private, you know, I can't tell you that was so much farther from the truth and my experience with Mike Pompeo at the State Department. You know, when Pompeo went out and said something to the press, it's exactly what he said to Putin and to Lavrov, the foreign minister, who we have met with many times. And in fact, I think it's dangerous to try and have a public persona and a private persona. That makes no sense to me. Just be exactly who you are. Now, when you're looking at what is Putin trying to get out of this, this is really just -- it's really sort of a normal meeting. I don't know why they called it a summit. You know, my -- like you, Sean, my inclination is perhaps they didn't want to put Putin and Biden together because Secretary Blinken was embarrassed in Alaska by the Chinese when they lashed out. And so, of course, that allowed for 45 minutes for Putin to rail against the United States lie, do all the things that Putin normally does. So I think that there there's two big questions that I think that your viewers have to think about, Sean, for the next four years. One is we are in a nuclear arms race with China and with Russia right now. This administration may not be talking about it, it's probably not at the front of mind for everyone watching, but you should know that China and Russia are engaged in a nuclear arms race even if we are closing our eyes and not wanting to deal with it. So if we want to have the -- this administration, President Biden says that he wants to have more talks on nuclear weapons with the Russians, if the Chinese aren't included in this, it's a fallacy. And so that's what we -- we need to be seriously looking at that and we need to seriously continue to look at the cyber side.",

DONALD TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, I guess the overall is, we didn't get anything. We gave a very big stage to Russia, and we got nothing. We gave up something that was unbelievably valuable. I stopped the pipeline Nord Stream. And that pipeline was stopped. And it was given back, and nothing was gotten for it.

And, frankly, we're lucky we have the vaccine. But the vaccine on very young people is something that you got to really stop. You have to get back to running your country. I mean, I don't see reasons -- and I am a big believer in what we did with the vaccine. It's incredible, what we did. You see the results. But to have every school child where it's 99.99 percent -- they just don't -- you know, they're just not affected or affected badly -- having to receive a vaccine, I think is something that you should start thinking about, because I think it's unnecessary.",

Putin did not commit to ending the cyberattacks against our country. He didn't take responsibility for the hijacking of over 100 U.S. companies, nine federal agencies. He didn't agree to free Americans now wrongfully imprisoned in his hostile regime of Russia. He didn't take responsibility for the Havana syndrome attack against U.S. diplomats. He didn't agree to stop poisoning and killing his political enemies. He didn't agree to curtail his military aggression in Eastern Europe and around the world.

Hmm, I wonder, Joey, if that was a coincidence when you think your pal Vladimir did it on purpose. We all know the answer. Now, Putin also gifted a spy satellite to the mullahs in Iran. How generous of him. Joe Biden was unable unwilling to hold Putin accountable for anything. As the chairman of the Human Rights Foundation put it today, even on MSDNC, Putin got what he wanted. Does that surprise anybody? Remember, just after Joe shuttered the Keystone XL pipeline high-paying career jobs for our fellow Americans in the energy sector, skill-specific jobs that he just took away with the stroke of a pen, then Joey turns around and gives Vladimir Putin, you know, the nod. He literally says okay on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline into Germany. That would bring the country that we're helping to defend against Russia, that would bring them closer and help make Russia richer again, and by overriding the State Department recommendation. Joe is told not to do it and he did it anyway. He gave the waiver and lifting all U.S. sanctions on the project. And what do we get in return for this grand gesture that will enrich Vladimir Putin and Russia? Nothing. We got nothing. Appeasement doesn't work, has never worked, never will work, especially when the commander-in- chief is like Joe frail and weak and constantly, cognitively, well, weakened."

So, obviously, it is critical that the us has a president who is sharp, mentally alert, tough, tenacious and a president willing to turn the screws on Vladimir to keep him in check. Unfortunately, Joe is not that guy. This week, Joe bumbled and bumbled his way through Europe, embarrassing the U.S. every step of the way. Today, he showed up to the summit with a pile of flash cards that he was constantly referencing and had a hard time keeping up with. Following the summit, no joint press conference. Why? Because the administration knew darn well Joe would be humiliated and for good reason. Instead, Joe delivered a short scripted speech from a teleprompter. If I had to bet, it was probably written by his staffers before they left Washington. And get this, during the remarks, well, president sippy cup once again botched his favorite line from your Declaration of Independence. Don't believe it? We got the videotape."

That would be a tough question. I don't remember you ever being asked that question. Ultimately, zero agreement struck. So the so-called big summit wasn't so big at all. Joe isn't worried. He thinks that Putin will change his malignant ways because he wants the world community to like and to respect him. That's not how it works, Joe. Is Joe really that dumb? I'm hoping he's just playing dumb on TV. Now, Putin doesn't give a rip with the United States or what Europe thinks or feels. He cares about power. He cares about money. He runs his country like a mob boss. He will continue to kill his political rivals and he will conduct criminal activities all around the world and probably bribe top children of (ph) vice presidents moving forward -- unless he's seriously challenged. Now, sanctions, financial penalties, the expansion of U.S. oil, gas are critical tools for American peace through strength diplomacy with Russia. But sadly, Joe Biden prefers the different approach, appeasement giving up energy independence, getting rid of American jobs but waivers for Vladimir. As we stated, that approach is never going to work. President Trump will respond to all this in just a few moments. First, joining us, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Jim Jordan, along with former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Mark, we start with you tonight. Your overall feeling about this. And to me, I think one of the greatest weaknesses -- the reason I suspect Joe wouldn't stand next to Vladimir and do a press conference is because whatever they prepared for Joe to say probably before leaving Washington, if they stuck with the talking points and it didn't happen, Vladimir would have corrected him right then and there and embarrassed him on the world stage, that's my suspicion.

Okay, the -- I don't know of any Trump that got paid a penny from any oligarch in Russia, but I do know a guy by the name of Hunter with no experience that got three and a half million dollars from a Russian oligarch, the former first lady of Moscow.

Never forget this too -- the Obama Biden administration, remember what they gave Ukraine. They gave them MREs and blankets.

If you look at the actual actions, not the words but the actions that President Trump took in addressing Russian wrongdoing, there's over 52 actual sanctions, executive orders and legislation that the president was responsible for in taking on Russia. It's 2017 alone, you had President Trump addressing the Yahoo hack and imposing sanctions. You had Treasury sanctions. How many times was Steve Mnuchin in the press shop addressing and outlining sanctions that we were taking against Russia? You had the CAATSA legislation that was signed. You -- there was banned Russian software in the first year. There was export restrictions. There was the Global Magnitsky Act. There was legal weapons -- Jim Jordan sort of alluded to it -- but there was legal weapons that were actually delivered lethal weapons to Ukraine, and there was another other actions taken by the Trump administration. What I just shot off there was just what happened in 2017. And another narrative that's upside down, it was Donald Trump that signed the executive order in September of 2018 addressing Russian interference in American elections.

What he got today was kind of a reset. Our ambassadors are going back to work in the respective capitals. There's going to be ongoing dialogue between our two nations about strategic issues like cyber security and nuclear issues. But there was nothing to really hold Vladimir Putin accountable.

You're always must-see TV, but I think we need to make that happen you know one of the things that you said earlier that I think Hillary Clinton said that you need to deal with Putin differently in public and differently in private, you know, I can't tell you that was so much farther from the truth and my experience with Mike Pompeo at the State Department. You know, when Pompeo went out and said something to the press, it's exactly what he said to Putin and to Lavrov, the foreign minister, who we have met with many times. And in fact, I think it's dangerous to try and have a public persona and a private persona. That makes no sense to me. Just be exactly who you are. Now, when you're looking at what is Putin trying to get out of this, this is really just -- it's really sort of a normal meeting. I don't know why they called it a summit. You know, my -- like you, Sean, my inclination is perhaps they didn't want to put Putin and Biden together because Secretary Blinken was embarrassed in Alaska by the Chinese when they lashed out. And so, of course, that allowed for 45 minutes for Putin to rail against the United States lie, do all the things that Putin normally does. So I think that there there's two big questions that I think that your viewers have to think about, Sean, for the next four years. One is we are in a nuclear arms race with China and with Russia right now. This administration may not be talking about it, it's probably not at the front of mind for everyone watching, but you should know that China and Russia are engaged in a nuclear arms race even if we are closing our eyes and not wanting to deal with it. So if we want to have the -- this administration, President Biden says that he wants to have more talks on nuclear weapons with the Russians, if the Chinese aren't included in this, it's a fallacy.

DONALD TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, I guess the overall is, we didn't get anything. We gave a very big stage to Russia, and we got nothing. We gave up something that was unbelievably valuable. I stopped the pipeline Nord Stream. And that pipeline was stopped. And it was given back, and nothing was gotten for it.

Then I'm going to take it one more step further. If it was Donald Trump that did everything Joe did here, and then it was Donald Trump's son, Don Jr., Eric Trump, that had monies transferred to their company from a Russian oligarch, the first lady of Moscow, why do I suspect you would be accused day and night, night and day, 24/7, of some time of -- type of family enrichment and collusion?

It was a disgrace, an absolute disgrace, that it should happen. And it really was dangerous and very bad for our country. But I guess you probably see. It was a few days ago up to 12. And now it's up to 19 different things where we were accused, and it turned out to be absolutely false, whether it's the Wuhan lab, the good old Wuhan lab. When I mentioned that, it was like a firestorm. Hydroxychloroquine, now great reviews are coming out on that. They didn't want to see it, I mean, creating a lot of problems and death, frankly, death. And they were willing to do that in order to try and take shots. But it's all coming out. I think the people understand it. I think that, in many ways, we're stronger now than ever before.

And Pulitzer is another one that's been disgraced by this whole last four- and-a-half-year period, five-year period. But, literally, from the day of that wonderful ride down the escalator, from that moment on, investigation after investigation. And the people that were guilty, they -- they just float right through. How it wasn't done, DOJ didn't do anything about it, I guess they felt they want to be soft. This group doesn't feel that way. But you know what? I left that up to DOJ. I left that up to the people running DOJ. And I wasn't involved. I would say that probably, maybe less involved than I should have been. And maybe I should have been forcing it. But a lot of very guilty people were not in any way prosecuted. And I'm talking about very, very serious things. If you look at Comey and McCabe and the two lovers and all the things that went on, and they weren't prosecuted, if you read the Horowitz report, and, of course, everyone still waiting for Durham, what happened to Durham?

And they didn't do anything with it. It's incredible, actually. Incredible. Very sad. Very sad for the country. But, you know, I guess they felt they shouldn't. And yet, this administration feels the exact opposite. If people don't do anything wrong, they want to go after them. Big difference. And it's -- you know, it's -- it's a tough standard. But hopefully, you have an attorney general now that will be fair. But I will say that the people running the justice -- and the people in it, don't forget, you have tens of thousands of people, and they were put there by Obama. They were put there by everybody. They were put there by a lot of people that came, including Clinton. But they were also put there by Bush. And you know, you see what goes on with that whole group. So you have a lot of people put in there by Bush and Clinton, you know, put there by Obama. And then you put some in yourself, and you can't do anything about it, I guess, I don't know. But I think that they were very, very soft, and maybe rightfully so. But they were very, very soft. And probably, they wanted to be very fair. But a lot of people don't look at it that way. It's a shame. There was such guilt and such a horrible thing happened. They were spying on my campaign. You know, if you think about it, all the way back, almost at the beginning, when I -- when I made a statement that my campaign was spied on, it was one of the biggest moments. It was -- nobody could believe it. Then it turned out that I was more than spied on, much worse than being spied on. But they didn't do anything about it.

And what they're supposed to be paying is very low, two percent, and they're paying half. And so, we protect you. We have 52,000 soldiers over there, which is like a major, major city, frankly. They make a fortune with us. And then they go and they pay Russia billions and billions of dollars for energy. So I said, so let's get this straight, to Angela, I said, we protect you. And the people that we protect you from, the country, you're paying billions of dollars, how does that work? And there are others. So, I got NATO to pay $430 billion more than they were paying, because the United States was paying for almost all of it. I mean, think of it. We pay for their protection. And they -- excuse the word -- they screw us on trade. It's the only word that's really descriptive enough, because they are in many ways worse than China or as bad as China on trade. How many Chevrolets are being sold in Berlin? Not too many. How many Chevrolets are being sold in Paris? Not too many. Maybe none. And yet, we sell their products -- their wines and their cars and their Mercedes, and their BMWs and everything else. We sell it all over our country. And all of that was stopping. We were ready to go. And then we got hit by the pandemic. And nobody did as good a job with the pandemic as we did. And that's why we are leading the world in terms of coming back. And that was all set long before Biden came in, including the fact that we came up with vaccines in less than nine months when a lot of people, everybody said it was going to take three to five years and you probably wouldn't be successful.

I would have loved to have taken them off as soon as they got their act together. I think we had a, you know, great shot at having an unbelievable relationship with Russia. It could have been fantastic. It could have been really beneficial to both countries. You know, they need economics. And we need things that they have where they have very valuable land in terms of mineral rights and many other things. And a lot of good things could have happened. I had a very good relationship with Putin. But nobody treated him tougher. He understood. Nobody ever heard of the pipeline until I got involved. And I said, wait a minute, the pipeline is going to Germany and all over Europe, what's going on? Why are we protecting you people? You know, again, and I just -- it was just unbelievable. I got so much for that. And to give up the stoppage, I mean, we -- I stopped it. And to give it up -- and then if you see what they did -- and the number is really 48,000, not 8,000, but you see what they did with the Keystone XL Pipeline where they stopped it almost on the first day.

You're not going to do for Pennsylvania, for Texas, for all of these places where we're doing so well with energy, we're not going to be energy independent in two months from now. They're making windmills all over the place to ruin our land and kill our birds, to kill everything.

It's really just catch and we will send you to one of the states, free transportation. You see we're -- you know, we're up dramatically, nearly 200,000 illegal immigrants a month. And they're just being processed. And that opens up other areas of the border for cartels, human smugglers, drug smugglers. Your take on how to fix this?"

      "utterance": "So, we had the most secure border in the history of our country, Southern border, in the history of our country. It's never been so good. It was hard getting it there, because we had to win lots of lawsuits. And that included on the wall. The wall would have been finished within months. All of the material is sitting right there rotting. They stopped it like very early. First, second, third day, they stopped it. Now they want to start it again, which is interesting. Go tell the contractors that. But it was sitting there. And now it's sitting there rusting. And it's a shame. We were -- it took us two-and-a-half years to win all the lawsuits. And it was almost complete. And then they came in, and they stopped it. And one of the reasons -- though, still, we built almost 500 miles of wall. And one of the reasons we have been so successful is because, even though it has gaps, which were easily closed, very easily, it has gaps, what happened is, the wall was so good in terms of illegal immigration. And you mentioned things that people don't mention, drugs. Drug smuggling was down to the lowest point that it's been in years, and also human trafficking, usually of women, by the way. It's a vicious business, and it's a big business. And we had that down to the lowest point in years and years and years. And now, it's worse than ever."

You have got Florida Senate seat, Georgia Senate seat, North and South Carolina. You've got New Hampshire. You've got Wisconsin. You've got Ohio. You've got Arizona. If that's not a bellwether, I don't know. What do you anticipate your involvement for 2022 will be? You started endorsing some people. You are going to be out on the road. And what are your thoughts with 2024? Will you be making a comeback?"

      "utterance": "So, I'm very honored to say that my endorsement means more than any endorsement that has ever been given by anybody. I mean, you know, we're winning. We just won Republican Party chairman of North Carolina and of Georgia and of other places. We just won -- there are two races in Texas. We won a great race in Louisiana. This is just intermediate to what's happening. I will be working and getting a lot of great people elected. And, again, they go up 20, 30, 40 points sometimes. People -- the fake news doesn't like talking about it. But the numbers are really incredible. So, I'm working on '22, getting a lot of good senators and a lot of good congresspeople elected. And then we will be making a decision on 2024. But, if you look at the numbers, people are liking me more now than ever before. But I think that's -- the reason is, they're watching what's happening with our country. They're watching no energy independence. They're watching the border. Never has there been a scene like what's happening at the border, and the death that's being caused. This isn't just border. This is death and criminals pouring into our country. They're looking at the economy. They're looking at inflation. They're looking at interest rates. They're looking at gasoline prices. And I guess it's making me very popular."

Nobody was ever even close to that. And we did it twice, because then we did it after the pandemic. We came with a vaccine. We did a lot of great things. And we did it after. But I was under siege with fake investigations and everything. And I was doing this while I was under siege from phony people with phony Russia, Russia, Russia that was caused by Clinton and the DNC Democrats and all of that. And we did it. We built Space Force. We did -- you know, we did -- we rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cuts in history. Not even close. We did ANWR, which they have already excluded..."
