      "sentences": "Welcome to HANNITY this busy Friday news night. And tonight, we are tracking multiple developing stories, including a ridiculous criminal indictment against Steve Bannon because he won't participate in the Democrats January 6th political charade with a predetermined outcome. Now, coming up we actually have a comprehensive list of Democrats who also need to be indicted for actual crimes. And tonight, we'll also show you the latest terrible horrific economic numbers every family in America is feeling it. And another bizarre moment from Kamala Harris in France. Plus, a new development from the Durham probe. And later, a full report on cartel violence now raging inside the United States as the crisis on our southern border moves north, as it spirals even further out of control. But first, the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse will soon be coming to an end. On Monday, we will hear closing arguments and then the jury will be headed to the deliberation. Today, the prosecution, they asked the judge to allow the jury now to consider several lesser charges hmm I guess they figured out what we all know and that is their case is not going very well and now at the 11th hour, they are attempting to lower the bar. Maybe they overcharged in the beginning. Now, some of these requests have been accepted. Others have not. Several other charges are still under consideration by the judge who once again berated the prosecution and again for good cause. Take a look.",

No matter what happens with the charges, the facts in this case, they remain the same. Based on video evidence and there is a lot of it, and eyewitness accounts there was a lot of that as well. It is apparent that 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was defending himself from imminent bodily harm or even death, in other words exactly what the Wisconsin law allows for. Now the first individual shot and killed, a 36-year-old man named Joseph Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum was a pedophile, convicted of sexually abusing five little boys ages 9 to 11. Prior to the riot in Kenosha, Rosenbaum was in a psychiatric hospital for attempting suicide and according to Rittenhouse and other eyewitness accounts, Rosenbaum charged written house assaulted him and then attempted to grab his gun before Rittenhouse ultimately defended himself and discharged his weapon. Now, Rittenhouse was then chased by an angry mob we've shown you this tape of rioters who knocked him to the ground, attempted to literally curb stomp his head right into the pavement. Now, one of the individuals chasing him was a year old named Anthony Huber. Now, Huber was also a convicted felon who once held his own grandmother and brother at knife point. He was ultimately charged with false imprisonment and choking his brother later he faced drug and disorderly conduct charges on the night of August the 25th, Uber assaulted Rittenhouse with a skateboard and then attempted to grab his gun before written out shot and killed him. His life was in imminent danger. Now, shortly thereafter, the third individual who was shot but survive, his name is Gaige Grosskreutz, he pointed a loaded gun at Rittenhouse's head. He admitted it on the stand under oath pointed a loaded gun at his head before Rittenhouse shot him in the arm in self-defense. Now, this guy Grosskreutz was a 26-year-old college senior who was previously convicted of a gun charge and several other misdemeanors. Now, despite all the facts in this case, the video evidence, the eyewitness accounts, the mob, the media, their friends and the Democratic Party, they're all eager to vilify and have been from day one 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse. They all made up their minds months ago before any evidence was presented. They rushed to judgment. They obviously don't believe in due process. They don't believe in the presumption of innocence. He was enemy number one from day one. Watch this.",

He also wore -- oh God forbid, an American flag tie on veterans day and his ringtone was a version of Lee Greenwood's \"God bless the USA\" and he made a joke about a supply chain crisis.

They were wrong on Ferguson. They were wrong on Baltimore, Freddie Gray, or many were wrong in UVA, the Duke Lacrosse case, Richard Jewell, oh, remember that kid from Covington High School, yeah, he's going to be a billionaire. And when their feelings and opinions are derailed by facts and logic, well, the left just screams racism. What a shock. Everything the left doesn't like apparently is racist everything every voter who doesn't vote the right way -- well, we'll call them a racist too. Every two years, every four years, that's their playbook. Every American that doesn't agree with them every person that dares get in their way, if Democrats really cared about what really happened in a riot, why don't they pay attention to the 534 violent riots that took place in the summer of 2020. Where is that commission, Liz Cheney? Maybe they should start a commission just like they did with the violent riot that we condemned on January 6th. They don't seem to care about truth or justice or equal justice or equal application of our laws, or the pain and suffering. They only care about the narrative. Remember in the summer of 2020, dozens of Americans died, thousands of cops were injured, billions in dollars in theft and property damage and arson. And joining us now with more, the author of the book \"The Case for Vaccine Mandates,\" Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, along with FOX News legal analyst Greg Jarrett. Gregg, we'll start with you tonight. To me, this case is based on evidence. We're going to stick to the evidence in this case. We've got witness testimony. We have a lot of it, most of it helps Kyle Rittenhouse. Then we've got video evidence, we've got a lot of that. You see him being chased by an angry mob. You see that he's trying to get away. You see that he's on the ground and somebody's about to take their foot slam it into his face right into the pavement. His life was at risk. Then you got the prosecution star witness. I don't see a guilty verdict on any charges with the exception perhaps of the gun charge.",

I think you're absolutely right this is a case that disintegrated before the very eyes of the prosecutors who called the witnesses and put on the evidence that in the end tended to defeat their own arguments and support the claims of self- defense asserted by the accused. I think it's clear to me at least that the prosecutors overcharged this case uh and they did so because I think they were under enormous pressure from, you know, the woke mob fueled by the liberal mainstream media that glamorized all the violence that you saw in the streets that terrorize communities across the United States. But most of all, what's important to me is that the judge here is scrupulously trying to protect the rights of the accused as stated in the Constitution. There's prosecutorial misconduct the judge could still declare a mistrial. He has one other option here and that is if he lets it go to the jury and the jury convicts on the top count this judge can actually set aside that verdict as a miscarriage of justice and direct a verdict to a lesser count or an acquittal we saw this happen in the famous nanny case in Massachusetts. So we'll have to wait and see. But I think this judge is loath to step in here he wants to see what the jury does.",

One, did this person act as a reasonable, mature adult? That's one possibility. The other one, did he act as a 17-year-old would act under the circumstances, he experienced in the Guts case in New York, the famous get subway case, the appellate court reversed the conviction because they said the standard was too objective and you have to make the standard fit the particular person. But the biggest issue in this case is that the radical left media is denying due process denying the presumption of innocence, making you two sides lying, lying about the judge. I've been in front of more judges than all of these TV commentators together, this judge is not acting any differently than judges all over the country. They berate prosecutors, they berate defense attorneys, they berate everybody. If this judge were ruling in favor of the prosecution, I guarantee you, Jeffrey Toobin and CNN and all those guys would be praising him to the sky as they did in other cases. This is not justice. This is partisan injustice.

They thought Kyle Rittenhouse had killed black men. They had no idea that the people shot had been white. I mean, this is a realization that what has been presented by the media is completely and factually different from what has been the fact of the matter and thank goodness this is being televised. And let me just tell you what I find fascinating here -- this trial is a very good example of prosecution gone wild. It is what the left used to care about. It was about yes having the defendant be protected. It was about -- and even now, the left crows about needing reform and I agree that there is bias in the system, and we are seeing it play out in this trial, for all Americans. This is an example of how things can go wrong and shame on every liberal who is trying to jump into the pool here, to hang this guy because it serves the narrative, it serves the nature of what the left is looking for. Gone is this idea as Mr. Dershowitz aptly put, the notion of civil liberties. This is an astounding exposure of what is possible what can go wrong in a trial. The judge is handling it perfectly and I would say it does go back - - the best example I think is the Baltimore police officers not just overcharged but should not been charged the jury exonerated them and -- the jury is partly a target of all this rhetoric of all the heated anger and the and the not so veiled threats and this is what we have to deal with I think but this is an excellent example of what we fight against and shame on every liberal and leftist who is embracing the nature of and not just end due process, but an end to defense in this case.",

They were wrong on Trump-Russia collusion. They get it wrong every time. They rush to judgment then they create expectations in a community and people expect a certain result that likely is never going to happen. And then there is often sadly at times this reaction people can't believe that what they told was going to happen didn't happen, but people that told them didn't tell them the facts the evidence and the truth of the case. You know, Sean, it's very simple. They have no shame and you're assuming -- Tammy's assuming that they deal with facts. They don't have any facts. They lie. They have no shame. You will not get -- all those cases you mentioned, they're not embarrassed. They just move to the next story because they have a narrative. The narrative is to lie to get their objective, their objective is to convince people that this country is evil, this country is racist, this country is unfair to the little guy. They don't care about the little guy. They're just pushing their agenda to basically destroy this country. This is a perfect example of a lie that is being exposed in a courtroom. I've been a lawyer for years. That judge is spot on. That prosecutor is wrong. He has violated Kyle Rittenhouse's constitutional rights. The issue here is this -- regardless of the outcome, the left will move on to the next case and the concern that I have is the aftermath when justice is served, because this young man should not be found guilty of any first- degree crimes whatsoever. The blowout is, will the city pay for it? Will the county pay for it? Will there be this riot, this disturbance?

Look at this analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and remember many Democrats also want to sneak in a SALT deduction plan which would be a boon for high earners in blue states. In other words, they get to deduct their state and local taxes, not a benefit in a low tax state. Ask yourself, even if inflation surges and prices spike and energy costs rise, why are Democrats so eager to spend trillions more? Why are they so committed to doubling down on failure? Could it be that they know that to get the country back on track, it would mean reinstating Donald Trump's policies?

They abused the FISA court system to deny one American Carter Page's rights, spy on a presidential candidate, a presidential transition team and yes, President Donald J. Trump.

Where's the probe on the summer riots of 2020? But ask yourself, where are the indictments for Comey, McCabe? You might remember the Horowitz report -- yes, they referred them for some of the very same things that Republicans, conservatives, names you know got uh arrested and charged with and even convicted on. Strzok, Page, the rest of this deep state cabal for their role in what was the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in history. And remember back in 2012, when Eric Holder -- he was held in contempt, why didn't the DOJ ever indict him? And what about former IRS official Lois Lerner? She was held in contempt, she never got charged. But we only charged Steve Bannon? And according to multiple reports, Bannon is the first person to be indicted for contempt of Congress since 1983. Of course, if you're a conservative, you get five years in jail for jaywalking. If you're a Democrat, you pretty much can commit any crime and you're not held accountable for anything.

Now, coming up we actually have a comprehensive list of Democrats who also need to be indicted for actual crimes. And tonight, we'll also show you the latest terrible horrific economic numbers every family in America is feeling it. And another bizarre moment from Kamala Harris in France. Plus, a new development from the Durham probe. And later, a full report on cartel violence now raging inside the United States as the crisis on our southern border moves north, as it spirals even further out of control.

Today, the prosecution, they asked the judge to allow the jury now to consider several lesser charges hmm I guess they figured out what we all know and that is their case is not going very well and now at the 11th hour, they are attempting to lower the bar. Maybe they overcharged in the beginning. Now, some of these requests have been accepted. Others have not.

No matter what happens with the charges, the facts in this case, they remain the same. Based on video evidence and there is a lot of it, and eyewitness accounts there was a lot of that as well. It is apparent that 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was defending himself from imminent bodily harm or even death, in other words exactly what the Wisconsin law allows for. Now the first individual shot and killed, a 36-year-old man named Joseph Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum was a pedophile, convicted of sexually abusing five little boys ages 9 to 11. Prior to the riot in Kenosha, Rosenbaum was in a psychiatric hospital for attempting suicide and according to Rittenhouse and other eyewitness accounts, Rosenbaum charged written house assaulted him and then attempted to grab his gun before Rittenhouse ultimately defended himself and discharged his weapon. Now, Rittenhouse was then chased by an angry mob we've shown you this tape of rioters who knocked him to the ground, attempted to literally curb stomp his head right into the pavement. Now, one of the individuals chasing him was a year old named Anthony Huber. Now, Huber was also a convicted felon who once held his own grandmother and brother at knife point. He was ultimately charged with false imprisonment and choking his brother later he faced drug and disorderly conduct charges on the night of August the 25th, Uber assaulted Rittenhouse with a skateboard and then attempted to grab his gun before written out shot and killed him. His life was in imminent danger. Now, shortly thereafter, the third individual who was shot but survive, his name is Gaige Grosskreutz, he pointed a loaded gun at Rittenhouse's head. He admitted it on the stand under oath pointed a loaded gun at his head before Rittenhouse shot him in the arm in self-defense. Now, this guy Grosskreutz was a 26-year-old college senior who was previously convicted of a gun charge and several other misdemeanors. Now, despite all the facts in this case, the video evidence, the eyewitness accounts, the mob, the media, their friends and the Democratic Party, they're all eager to vilify and have been from day one 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse. They all made up their minds months ago before any evidence was presented. They rushed to judgment. They obviously don't believe in due process. They don't believe in the presumption of innocence. He was enemy number one from day one. Watch this."

They were wrong on Ferguson. They were wrong on Baltimore, Freddie Gray, or many were wrong in UVA, the Duke Lacrosse case, Richard Jewell, oh, remember that kid from Covington High School, yeah, he's going to be a billionaire. And when their feelings and opinions are derailed by facts and logic, well, the left just screams racism. What a shock. Everything the left doesn't like apparently is racist everything every voter who doesn't vote the right way -- well, we'll call them a racist too. Every two years, every four years, that's their playbook. Every American that doesn't agree with them every person that dares get in their way, if Democrats really cared about what really happened in a riot, why don't they pay attention to the 534 violent riots that took place in the summer of 2020. Where is that commission, Liz Cheney? Maybe they should start a commission just like they did with the violent riot that we condemned on January 6th. They don't seem to care about truth or justice or equal justice or equal application of our laws, or the pain and suffering. They only care about the narrative. Remember in the summer of 2020, dozens of Americans died, thousands of cops were injured, billions in dollars in theft and property damage and arson. And joining us now with more, the author of the book \"The Case for Vaccine Mandates,\" Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, along with FOX News legal analyst Greg Jarrett. Gregg, we'll start with you tonight. To me, this case is based on evidence. We're going to stick to the evidence in this case. We've got witness testimony. We have a lot of it, most of it helps Kyle Rittenhouse. Then we've got video evidence, we've got a lot of that. You see him being chased by an angry mob. You see that he's trying to get away. You see that he's on the ground and somebody's about to take their foot slam it into his face right into the pavement. His life was at risk. Then you got the prosecution star witness. I don't see a guilty verdict on any charges with the exception perhaps of the gun charge."

      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I think you're absolutely right this is a case that disintegrated before the very eyes of the prosecutors who called the witnesses and put on the evidence that in the end tended to defeat their own arguments and support the claims of self- defense asserted by the accused. I think it's clear to me at least that the prosecutors overcharged this case uh and they did so because I think they were under enormous pressure from, you know, the woke mob fueled by the liberal mainstream media that glamorized all the violence that you saw in the streets that terrorize communities across the United States. But most of all, what's important to me is that the judge here is scrupulously trying to protect the rights of the accused as stated in the Constitution. There's prosecutorial misconduct the judge could still declare a mistrial. He has one other option here and that is if he lets it go to the jury and the jury convicts on the top count this judge can actually set aside that verdict as a miscarriage of justice and direct a verdict to a lesser count or an acquittal we saw this happen in the famous nanny case in Massachusetts. So we'll have to wait and see. But I think this judge is loath to step in here he wants to see what the jury does."

I think in response to public opinion, the woke mob that was loud at that time, I believe that there's they overcharged right from the get-go and now they're seeking the possibility of lesser charges on some counts, and I and I believe that they with as you had said they likely are trying for a mistrial they want to do over. Now -- go ahead."

      "speaker": "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "They're not going to get a mistrial. The judge wants this to go to the jury. The key issue here is going to be the instruction to the jury. There are two possible instructions. One, did this person act as a reasonable, mature adult? That's one possibility. The other one, did he act as a 17-year-old would act under the circumstances, he experienced in the Guts case in New York, the famous get subway case, the appellate court reversed the conviction because they said the standard was too objective and you have to make the standard fit the particular person. But the biggest issue in this case is that the radical left media is denying due process denying the presumption of innocence, making you two sides lying, lying about the judge. I've been in front of more judges than all of these TV commentators together, this judge is not acting any differently than judges all over the country. They berate prosecutors, they berate defense attorneys, they berate everybody. If this judge were ruling in favor of the prosecution, I guarantee you, Jeffrey Toobin and CNN and all those guys would be praising him to the sky as they did in other cases. This is not justice. This is partisan injustice. This is an attempt by the hard left mob to influence the outcome of the case not only by the way they describe the case, but by implicit threats that if there is an acquittal, there will be consequences.

I think the prosecution definitely wants a mistrust. But I agree with you, it's not going to happen.

You played the clip of Bakari Sellers on CNN who's a lawyer, he should know better than that saying that this judge is showing his conservative credentials, that is a an obtuse ignorant statement. This is a judge appointed by a Democrat. He's a law and order judge. He's the longest serving judge in Wisconsin. He's highly respected and as I said before he cares dearly about the Constitution and protecting the rights of an accused in trial. That's -- that is the duty of every judge and I wish every judge were as scrupulous as this one."

      "speaker": "TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, obviously not. I mean, that's what has been swirling around here, including on social media with many blue chick liberals, recognizing that looking at the details of what's coming out in this trial are completely contradictory to what the media has been telling them. They thought Kyle Rittenhouse had killed black men. They had no idea that the people shot had been white. I mean, this is a realization that what has been presented by the media is completely and factually different from what has been the fact of the matter and thank goodness this is being televised. And let me just tell you what I find fascinating here -- this trial is a very good example of prosecution gone wild. It is what the left used to care about. It was about yes having the defendant be protected. It was about -- and even now, the left crows about needing reform and I agree that there is bias in the system, and we are seeing it play out in this trial, for all Americans. This is an example of how things can go wrong and shame on every liberal who is trying to jump into the pool here, to hang this guy because it serves the narrative, it serves the nature of what the left is looking for. Gone is this idea as Mr. Dershowitz aptly put, the notion of civil liberties. This is an astounding exposure of what is possible what can go wrong in a trial. The judge is handling it perfectly and I would say it does go back - - the best example I think is the Baltimore police officers not just overcharged but should not been charged the jury exonerated them and -- the jury is partly a target of all this rhetoric of all the heated anger and the and the not so veiled threats and this is what we have to deal with I think but this is an excellent example of what we fight against and shame on every liberal and leftist who is embracing the nature of and not just end due process, but an end to defense in this case."

They were wrong in Baltimore as Tammy just mentioned. They were wrong with Cambridge. They were wrong with UVA. They were wrong with Duke Lacrosse. They were wrong with Richard Jewell. They were wrong on Trump-Russia collusion. They get it wrong every time. They rush to judgment then they create expectations in a community and people expect a certain result that likely is never going to happen. And then there is often sadly at times this reaction people can't believe that what they told was going to happen didn't happen, but people that told them didn't tell them the facts the evidence and the truth of the case. You know, Sean, it's very simple. They have no shame and you're assuming -- Tammy's assuming that they deal with facts. They don't have any facts. They lie. They have no shame. You will not get -- all those cases you mentioned, they're not embarrassed. They just move to the next story because they have a narrative. The narrative is to lie to get their objective, their objective is to convince people that this country is evil, this country is racist, this country is unfair to the little guy. They don't care about the little guy. They're just pushing their agenda to basically destroy this country. This is a perfect example of a lie that is being exposed in a courtroom. I've been a lawyer for years. That judge is spot on. That prosecutor is wrong. He has violated Kyle Rittenhouse's constitutional rights. The issue here is this -- regardless of the outcome, the left will move on to the next case and the concern that I have is the aftermath when justice is served, because this young man should not be found guilty of any first- degree crimes whatsoever.

Look at this analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and remember many Democrats also want to sneak in a SALT deduction plan which would be a boon for high earners in blue states. In other words, they get to deduct their state and local taxes, not a benefit in a low tax state. Ask yourself, even if inflation surges and prices spike and energy costs rise, why are Democrats so eager to spend trillions more? Why are they so committed to doubling down on failure? Could it be that they know that to get the country back on track, it would mean reinstating Donald Trump's policies?

According to the Durham indictments, the Obama Biden deep state cabal is at the center of all of this Clinton-coordinated misinformation, including Biden's own national security adviser Jake Sullivan. And add to that, what we already know, deep state intel officials were all willing participants. They abused the FISA court system to deny one American Carter Page's rights, spy on a presidential candidate, a presidential transition team and yes, President Donald J. Trump. And the indictment also revealed that one of Steele's primary sub-sources was working with a longtime Clinton operative.

      "utterance": "Well, I completely disagree with your premise. It's one thing to say allegations should be investigated and they were, it's another to say that we should have foreseen in advance that some people were lying to Christopher Steele, which is impossible course to do. None of that serious misconduct is in any way diminished by the fact that people lied to Christopher Steele."

      "utterance": "But unfortunately, the unequal standard of justice is still on full display tonight, after former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was indicted by the Biden DOJ for contempt of Congress. By the way, I have complete contempt for Congress, most of them anyway, for not complying with a subpoena as part of the Democratic sham, predetermined outcome January 6 probe. Where's the probe on the summer riots of 2020? But ask yourself, where are the indictments for Comey, McCabe? You might remember the Horowitz report -- yes, they referred them for some of the very same things that Republicans, conservatives, names you know got uh arrested and charged with and even convicted on. Strzok, Page, the rest of this deep state cabal for their role in what was the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in history. And remember back in 2012, when Eric Holder -- he was held in contempt, why didn't the DOJ ever indict him? And what about former IRS official Lois Lerner? She was held in contempt, she never got charged. But we only charged Steve Bannon? And according to multiple reports, Bannon is the first person to be indicted for contempt of Congress since 1983. Of course, if you're a conservative, you get five years in jail for jaywalking. If you're a Democrat, you pretty much can commit any crime and you're not held accountable for anything. Now, we know there's one standard for Democrats and one standard for the rest of us. Here with reaction, Congressman Devin Nunes, along with former State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus. Morgan, you get a scale of a hundred on a one-to-ten scale on taking down Adam Schiff. I'm glad somebody finally did."

      "utterance": "Well, I don't know that I did that I'm glad you think so, Sean. For me, it was just important that he get asked tough questions that quite frankly should have been asked before I had the opportunity to do so, and I'm very grateful to \"The View\" for allowing me to ask these tough questions. And what was more surprising to me is that the congressman appeared somewhat surprised that someone was asking them of him. I had hoped and I know this is very naive of me, Sean, I had hoped that maybe he would be pensive and reflective and talk about what he had learned after -- you know, reading this dossier into the congressional record, right, defending it, promoting it. That obviously didn't happen and the exchange, the rest is history."

      "utterance": "Devin, you were up to your eyeballs in dealing with the corrupt, congenital liar that I call Adam Schiff. But more importantly, where is every other news organization? And when is Adam Schiff going to be held accountable for all of the lying and leaking he was involved in?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA)",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's one of the keys, Sean, is that these Pulitzers that all of these reporters want, it's fine as you talked in your little monologue before this segment that they've corrected some stories. But I can tell you, there's many stories that they have not corrected, and there are stories that should be corrected. You know, we had this thing right the whole time and I think when you look at the at the Democrats and the things that they've spewed, it's really hard to believe at this point that they would still defend Christopher Steele knowing what we know now that Steele wasn't really doing anything other than just taking fake information. He was hired to put out fake information. So to say that someone was lied to is just preposterous. It's not true. It's more deflection and obfuscation that these guys are doing. And, you know, if these news organizations really want to get on the right side where you and very few journalists were, there were only a few of you that were actually trying to dig into this, they needed to do a lot more digging on what did the Democrats in Congress know and when did they know it, especially about the Steele dossier? Because I will remind you of this one point, Sean and you will remember this, Harry Reid, former Senate leader, Democrat, in August of 2016, he knew about the dossier. So it's unlikely that others didn't know about the dossier at that time either."

      "utterance": "Yeah, Sean, I've been here in the Kenedy County for the past several days on right-alongs with Texas DPS conducting operations to capture people illegally trespassing onto ranches. These are not just ranches, Sean, and you think of big, sprawling ranches. These are actually family ranches. There are family homes. There are people that live here for generations, their children to live there, their wives live there. These are ranches that have been around for a long time. And what they are seeing is incredible. Think about this, Kenedy County has about 3,000 residents, and we are getting 2,800 illegal crossings onto ranches in this county every single week. In some cases, the people are tapping on the surveillance cameras and looking in. I can't even imagine the horror. And not only that, the crimes have been surging here along the border. I spoke with Brent Smith. He's an attorney and he's a rancher. I want you to take a listen to what he had to say."

      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Brent, one of the big issues that we have been seeing over may be in the past several months is the increase of Texas DPS said a endemic increase in crime and cartel crime on this side of the border from murders to targeted killings. Is that something that we should be concerned about? Is this something you will see an increase across the country?"

    {
      "speaker": "BRENT SMITH, RANCHER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Right now, cartels control both sides of the border and the violence that they have seen on media and the reports, there is not much of a difference in cartel and ISIS at this point. And it is when you go over the border. When I grew up, I was allowed to basically go outside on the ranch as long as I stayed in shouting distance. My mom had a pretty good voice and could holler at me. But now, we don't let our children go out unless they have an adult with them with a weapon."

      "speaker": "CARTER",

      "speaker": "CARTER",

They're seeing an increase actually of narcotics coming through and some new designer narcotics they keep a close eye on which they say is more powerful than fentanyl. I hope to bring those reports to you very soon -- Sean."

Here to explain more, Arizona Senate candidate -- he is the state of Arizona attorney general, Mark Brnovich, is with us. We are not following the rule of law. We are not only not following it but the federal government, our president, is aiding and abetting and lawbreaking. And it seems little that the states can do to prevent it. Is there anything we can do if the states capture people in the country illegally, why can't they send them back?"

      "speaker": "MARK BRNOVICH, ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "You know, Sean, it's absolutely heartbreaking to see what's going on. And you're right, the state jurisdiction is very, very limited and that is why elections have consequences. And so, when Joe Biden and his enablers like cartel Kelly are allowing the cartels to seize operational control of the border as Sarah mentioned, this will affect not only areas like Texas but this is coming to our neighborhood soon. Not just the violence with the cartels but also with drug overdoses, addictions. We are seeing record amount of fentanyl flooding into the country. As a prosecutor we see the price of fentanyl fall, price of heroin fall and that is because there is more supply. And so, this is going to affect all of our kids, all of our neighborhoods and shame on the Biden administration and shame on cartel Kelly for turning a blind eye as Americans are dying in our streets as a result of their failed policies, the catastrophe they created. They created this, Sean. You know, we talk about the climate change and all the other stuff, that it is not a man-made crisis. This is a man-made crisis greeted by Joe Biden."

    {
      "speaker": "BRNOVICH",
      "utterance": "This is exactly the problem, Sean, as you know the president is the apex of the power when you talk about national security and the border security, and the Biden administration is literally refusing to follow existing law. So, what we've done is we filed lawsuit over the public charge rules, Supreme Court has accepted that case, where the Biden administration is incentivizing and monetizing people coming here. We sued some of the other states and we sued over failure to deport people, deportation order. So we are doing everything we can in courtrooms, but the reality is, the Biden administration through the dark of night is dispersing hardened criminals into all of our neighborhoods."
