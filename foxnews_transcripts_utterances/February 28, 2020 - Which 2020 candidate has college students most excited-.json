The fact that they are willing to pour this much money into her campaign says two things. One is it says how terrified these big money establishment Democrats are of Bernie Sanders.

Now, we are coming to you live from the historic Palmetto Brewery, the oldest brewery in the state. Of course were coming for the beer. I mean, is there politics involved? Yes. All right, Charleston is absolutely hopping tonight. The President just rapped a massive rally at the Coliseum a few miles from here and just to give you an idea about how passionate the crowd was, folks were barbecuing. I kid you not they brought their own barbecues, at 4:00 am this morning. That is just the kind of excitement and enthusiasm that the Democrats are trying to emulate, to try to get going in their own party for tomorrow's primary. Now throughout the hour we are going to be talking to some of our favorite analysts, South Carolina voters, and those who know the state best. Along the way we are going to show you our own interactions with the voters today, including from Fox News own Gianno Caldwell who is on the other side of the state at Joe Biden's rally tonight. Now as for Joe, the Former Vice President seems poised to win based on the latest polls. He's up about 12 points in the \"Real Clear Politics\" average. You might remember, I told you these last night that those most invested in the Biden blowout tomorrow are the Democrats and the media establishment. They see Sanders as a threat and they hope Biden can you know pull out a comeback move and catapult himself and his lagging campaign ahead for the Super Tuesday contests that are coming right down the pike. Now Biden himself thinks a victory tomorrow might wrap up the whole thing for him."

Look even if Biden does win big tomorrow, he still has major problems and I'm going to talk about them tonight, walk you through this right now. Here's the first problem, his continuous dream of just gaffes and just bizarre statements. It seems to be getting worse not better. Now just listen to some of what he said just in the last 24 hours."

      "utterance": "There is a weakness in the Biden campaign that is obvious. It's not just a weakness in the candidate. A Former Vice President, two-term Vice President, Obama's guy should be just sucking in money. He is broke. That shows a lack of enthusiasm, not just at the grassroots level, where he needed that, but also at the top."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Van Jones himself seems bored, doesn't he? And three, third problem, one-third of the Democrat delegates are awarded and that doesn't look good for Biden, okay. In California he is going to get his clock cleaned by Bernie who is up, on average, today it was about 17 points in the latest polls. Meanwhile, Biden is pulling under 15 percent in the state. And that means he might not even meet the viability threshold to get any delegates, because that is how many there are in California. It's a huge treasure trove. Now the last three polls out of Texas have Bernie leading and Biden thought at some point was going to be his firewall. It's just not adding up now that doesn't even take into account commanding leads that Bernie has in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Utah, states that will also be voting on Super Tuesday. Now given all of this even with a Biden win tomorrow, here is my question. How can the Democrat establishment deny Bernie the nomination if this is what the landscape remains after today, after tomorrow? Joining me now is Chris Bedford, Senior Editor at \"The Federalist\" and Vice Chairman of the Young American's Foundation. He's been following the Democrats around South Carolina for the last few days. Also with me is a Drew McKissick, South Carolina GOP Chairman, a man who knows the ins and outs of the state better than most. All right Chris, barring some epic collapse, Biden looks like he is going to be assured of a victory but his appearances on the trail have just been - it's actually kind of sad. If got to say. I've been sad because it personally actually have always liked Biden. He's actually kind of a lovable personality. I've always really liked him. But it's almost like someone needs to stop him."

    {
      "speaker": "CHRIS BEDFORD, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "It's time for the early voting corralled dinner. Joe Biden is an extremely likable person. He has got a lot of history, his donors are originally gave term on that but it's been clear that he probably should retire for some time. What he could get tomorrow, which would be a big win for him, potentially, is if he actually just gets literally a big win ten points or more points that he can carry and because the worst thing for any candidate, even worse than this lack of money is the stink of loser. And if people think you're a loser, they're not going to back you no matter what, especially in the Super Tuesday states. If he does well he can stay in this race and \"The New York Times\" reporters are actually showed that the Democratic Party is willing to break their own party to stop Bernie Sanders the super delegates from being the nominee. If he can make to the conventional alive he might actually either be the nominee or at least the king maker."

You know there's people aren't really excited about supporting his campaign and his problem here is not, whether he wins here or not when you leave here you're going into states where he doesn't have much organization, he has to spend money. Bloomberg has dropped half a billion dollars in 20 states and so what are they going to do even if he wins here? If he wins by ten, or he wins by five, whatever it may be. They've got a structural problem over the long term and that is proportional delegate allocation in all states and it took how long for Hillary to put Bernie away last time in the two person race and now you're talking about three, four, five people going all the way to the convention? They've got a math problem and then you get to the super delegates, on a second ballet. What are they going to do? Half of those guys are guys are elected officials who are running on the battle, this fall they don't want to run with Bernie on top of the ticket. So they take it away from him, his folks burn the party down and either way, heads we win tales they lose."

Why are there local party officials and Hollywood movie stars that are there to try to pump up the crowd because Joe Biden is not really pumping up the crowd? Why isn't he down there stumping for the guy who he thinks is the future of the Democratic Party? Candidates are really worried.

All right, now despite suggestions from some of the folks that you just heard that the General Election will be Sanders versus Trump, Joe Biden and the never Bernie Democrats see South Carolina as the decisive 2020 primary contest. They may have a point. According to \"The Washington Post,\" since first becoming a binding primary in 1988, the state contest has become a bellwether for important constituencies Southern African-American voters. Now on top of that, the eventual Democratic Nominee has won the Palmetto primary every election year with the exception of '88 and 2004. Joining me now is Gibbs Knotts Political Science Professor at the College of Charleston and Author of \"First in the South\" why South Carolina's Presidential Primary matters and Jamie Lovegrove, Political Reporter at \"The Post and Courier\" Knotts, will South Carolina's reputation of clarifying things for the Democrats be intact after this?"

This is the only way that she can still have a shot at staying this - in this thing in the long term. It just requires her to totally give up on all the things that she said were so central to her appeal all along. I'm authentic I'm not going to do these deals with all these rich guys.

That is exactly the definition of what a leader is not. A leader is not someone who says hey, as long as everybody does what I'm going to say then I will lead the way. That is not how it works. The truth of the matter is Elizabeth Warren will literally say anything it takes to get elected, or whatever she thinks it will take to get elected. But to me, the most interesting thing about all of this is to look at the amount of money that this new Super Pac is pouring into her campaign, this dark money that she and a lot of Democrats say are the problem, the root problem with politics today. The fact that they are willing to pour this much money into her campaign says two things. One is it says how terrified these big money establishment Democrats are of Bernie Sanders. And it also says how comfortable they are with someone like Elizabeth Warren sticking up for their interest in protecting the status quo for Democrats."

But I've got to tell you, the real lesson I think that we are going to get from tomorrow is that the South don't truck with no socialists. They do not like the brand of extremism that they see from this Democratic Party from Bernie Sanders and to a degree from Elizabeth Warren as well. They want a Democratic Party that is actually going to reach out to moderate voters and they're worried that by going too far left, having too much extremism, they're going to end up losing to Donald Trump."
