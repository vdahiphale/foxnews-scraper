      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Longtime Trump adviser, Roger Stone, was arrested on Friday by federal agents and charged with seven felonies. None of the charges had anything to do with Russian collusion or election meddling. But you'd never know that from the penalties he faces. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If convicted, Stone could die in prison. Nobody in Washington seems to find that punishment excessive. Many have cheered it.

Soon, we'll forget it ever happened. But before we do, it is worth taking just a moment to consider a few basic questions about it if only because nobody else is going to. First, why did the Justice Department stage what was, in effect, a military assault on Roger Stone's house? Stone himself asked that question on ABC over the weekend.

      "sentences": "That's pretty standard, as you know. But is it pretty standard to send dozens of Federal Agents with rifles to arrest an unarmed 66-year-old man who's been charged with a non-violent crime? Well, no. It is not standard. It is shocking. And any honest person who pays attention could tell you that. Roger Stone who was there says there were 29 agents on the scene along with 17 vehicles, two of them armored, and a helicopter overhead. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If that's an accurate accounting, it means the Feds sent more armed men to Roger Stone's house in Fort Lauderdale than they did to Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, just for some perspective on this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, what was the justification for doing that? Prosecutors knew perfectly well that Stone was not a flight risk. He's broke. He doesn't even have a valid passport. They could simply have called his lawyer and told him to surrender. That's the actual standard in cases like this. But they didn't do that. Instead, they went in with guns drawn. So, who decided to do that, and how much did it cost taxpayers? We spent the last two days trying to answer those questions. And it tells you a lot about contemporary America that we couldn't, we still have no idea. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Justice Department wouldn't answer us. The White House, which supposedly oversees the Justice Department, didn't even respond. Maybe they don't know the answer to those questions. Possible! They don't control Robert Mueller. Nobody controls Robert Mueller. Mueller can send armed men to your home to rouse you from bed at gunpoint, just because he feels like it, and there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it. Mueller has an unlimited budget and no timetable. He doesn't have to answer questions. He can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, to whomever he wants. He cannot be fired. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mueller is the single most powerful person in America, and yet nobody voted for him. Hmm!

Huh! Nobody in Washington catches the irony in any of this. Mueller himself is a threat to our democracy, the most powerful man elected by nobody. Our media don't ask questions about any of this or even acknowledge that it is a question. They've chosen sides. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's Roger Stone from our show on Friday night. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We, journalists, says CNN, need to fight back against the \"Fringes of the Right\" who just want to \"move the story away from what it should really be,\" which, it goes without saying, CNN decides. They decides what the story should really be, and if you don't agree, you're on the fringes of the Right. In other words, \"Shut up, you guys. Stop asking questions. We don't feel like answering.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But this show persisted because that's our job. And so, we asked both CNN's official spokesmen and the kid you saw playing Media Reporter on the screen a very simple question. Did Mueller's office help you with your story? The response, of course, feigned outrage. \"How dare you? You're Right-wing. Be quiet.\" But when we kept pressing them, an interesting thing happened. They didn't deny it. So, to be totally clear, here's the specific question that we asked. \"Did federal law enforcement officials confirm the raid on Roger Stone's house to CNN before it happened?\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Very simple question. And when we pressed it, CNN dropped the fake outrage. They just refused to answer because, of course, CNN talked to Mueller's people before the raid. There was never any doubt about that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All the barking aside, Mueller wanted the raid on Roger Stone's home caught on tape, and publicly aired, as a warning to other disobedient witnesses about what can happen to you if you step out of line. CNN was happy to oblige. So, CNN acted as the Public Relations arm of the Mueller investigation, as they have before, and then they lied about it in the most self-righteous possible way, and set those kids out on TV to lie some more. So, it answers a lot of questions. No wonder CNN seemed so eager to defend Friday's raid, and to belittle and attack and marginalize anyone who asked honest questions about it. The network is no longer covering Robert Mueller. They're working with Robert Mueller, and you should know that as you watch it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Kim Strassel writes for The Wall Street Journal editorial page, and she joins us tonight. Kim, great to see you. So, before we get into any of what we've just been talking about, there was news today from - from the Administration that the Mueller investigation is reaching its final stage.

That's how hip and modern Gavin Newsom is. But that's not all. He's also decided he doesn't want to live in the Governor's Mansion in Sacramento anymore. Instead, Newsom is moving in to a $3.7 million estate in an upscale suburb. Newsom has kids and he calls the neighborhood more kid-friendly than Sacramento. The problem is that Gavin Newsom cares deeply about climate change. He says that a lot. He cares a lot more about it than you do. He's a really good person. For an ardent environmentalist like Newsom, the California Governor's Mansion is a perfect place to live. It's within walking distance of the State Capitol. It's a no-emission commute. His new home is an hour ran - round-trip for the entire entourage, the frosted window suburban entourage. That's a big carbon footprint. There goes the planet. And there's another problem too, maybe a bigger problem. Newsom also cares about diversity. He talks about diversity a lot, probably about as much as he talks about climate change. And for diversity aficionados, Sacramento is heaven. In 2002, Harvard University and Time magazine described Sacramento as \"America's most diverse city.\" The city's public school students speak 43 languages. About 40 percent don't speak English at home. You would think Gavin Newsom would want his kids right there in the center of all that diversity, but no. Instead, he's moving them to one of the least diverse neighborhoods in the entire State of California. It's a place where the demographics look like 1950. In other words, it's very, very White, which is something that Newsom thinks as very, very bad or says he does. But does he really believe it? Not really, because he's moving his family there. You're starting to figure out how this works? So, you make policies that totally change the country. Then you attack anyone who criticizes those policies as evil, and then force them to be quiet or fire them if they won't. And then you personally move as far as you can away from the effects of those policies, preferably behind a wall somewhere. That's the trick. And to be fair, it's not just Gavin Newsom who does this. They all do that, all of them. Well it's well-established, at least on TV, that there is no crisis at all on the U.S.-Mexico border. The very idea of that is insane.",

There are already two children who died in custody. They were ill when they entered custody. But there are many people that are now coming into Border Patrol custody. And in - in most cases or many cases, they're surrendering, so they're actually actively seeking out Border Patrol knowing that they're going to get medical services. They're actually having to set up now screening facilities, frontline screening facilities, for Border Patrol to deal with people showing up who have H1N1 Flu, scabies, a whole list, a litany of different communicable, very serious diseases that they have to be treated for, by the way, courtesy of the taxpayer, that often requires taking them to the nearest hospital, which takes one or two depending on the sector Border Patrol agents to accompany them to the hospital, all this, of course, paid for - paid for by Uncle Sam. And then, you also have to deal with the drain on resources. Border Patrol guys are saying, \"Look, we've got enough problems as it is.\" They had about 30,000 - close to 30,000 family units alone. That doesn't include unaccompanied minors. It doesn't include people that are just trying to cross illegally, the old-fashioned way, by themselves that are showing up, turning themselves in. And now, what's happening is, Border Patrol's being turned into a de facto Red Cross on our Border for people who are coming up with serious illnesses, diseases, people who were eight or nine months pregnant, this is happening in increasing numbers every month.

The most important example of which is probably Trump's very vehement denunciations of the Germans for buying natural gas from Russia, one of their most important exports on which their economy depends, rather than buying it from the U.S. Really weird behavior for somebody who is being blackmailed by Vladimir Putin, he keeps doing exactly the opposite of what Putin wants. The Roger Stone indictment is like all of the other Mueller indictments. And that is the number of people that Mueller has indicted for what the original Mueller letters said he was supposed to find out, namely whether there was criminal coordination between the Trump campaign, on the one hand, and Russian government, on the other hand, with respect to the 2016 - 2016 election, that number is zero. That was the number before Roger Stone's indictment. That continues to be the number after. It's not an investigation that's complete, but it's been - it's coming up on two years, it's like a year and eight months, I don't know what the future holds. Maybe Mueller will someday indict people for that. So, maybe he'll cure cancer. But as a journalist, all I can do is say what has happened up until this point.

      "sentences": "You may have read about a wave of layoffs in the media last week. More than a 1,000 people lost their jobs, mostly in online news. Some of the biggest losses were at BuzzFeed, about 220 employees got fired there. BuzzFeed is run by a guy called Jonah Peretti. Peretti isn't just a media CEO. He's an icon in the tech world. He's a living embodiment of the values of modern big business. Peretti first became famous a number of years ago when he attacked Nike for running sweatshops. And the attention from that helped him break into the media. And from there, he helped found The Huffington Post and, eventually, BuzzFeed. As a boss, Peretti transitioned smoothly from the traditional leftism of his youth to the new and far more lucrative version of woke capitalism that so many CEOs now practice. Peretti spent a lot of time extolling the virtues of inclusivity and diversity and, of course, attacking Conservatives as racist. At the same time, Peretti crushed the efforts of his own staff to unionize. He argued it wouldn't be right for BuzzFeed because unions are only good for \"Replaceable employees.\" BuzzFeed staff were apparently so special, they didn't need unions. Well it turns out they did. Now, more than 200 of BuzzFeed's employees understand that they were, in fact, quite replaceable. After firing them, Peretti tried to weasel his way out of paying his employees for any of their unused paid time off until the public outcry became so great that he finally caved and paid. \"This is very common,\" Peretti told them, and that's true. Greedy, stupid bosses who buy a pass from the business press by mouthing progressive platitudes are indeed very common. They're everywhere, unfortunately. What's rare are humane bosses who care about the people who work for them. We could use more of those. Well Mike Rowe has a new scholarship program trying to send young Americans to trade schools. And in doing that, he's willing to work with a bunch of different organizations, some of which not everybody likes. And for doing that, he's been accused of \"selling-out.\" Mike Rowe joins us tonight. So Mike, I mean this in the best way, but I like it when you're attacked, because unlike most people who get attacked on social media, you write these long, very thoughtful replies that actually inform us, and this is no different.",

None of the charges had anything to do with Russian collusion or election meddling. But you'd never know that from the penalties he faces. If convicted, Stone could die in prison. Nobody in Washington seems to find that punishment excessive. Many have cheered it. Officially, Stone was charged with lying, something most of our political elite engage in every day. But his real crime was flamboyance. Stone has spent the last 40 years giving the finger to the people in charge. In the end, they got him. They always do. Stone's arrest is already fading from the headlines replaced by the latest political crisis of the moment or some new skirmish in the ongoing culture wars. Soon, we'll forget it ever happened. But before we do, it is worth taking just a moment to consider a few basic questions about it if only because nobody else is going to. First, why did the Justice Department stage what was, in effect, a military assault on Roger Stone's house? Stone himself asked that question on ABC over the weekend. Watch."

      "utterance": "That's pretty standard, as you know. But is it pretty standard to send dozens of Federal Agents with rifles to arrest an unarmed 66-year-old man who's been charged with a non-violent crime? Well, no. It is not standard. It is shocking. And any honest person who pays attention could tell you that. Roger Stone who was there says there were 29 agents on the scene along with 17 vehicles, two of them armored, and a helicopter overhead. If that's an accurate accounting, it means the Feds sent more armed men to Roger Stone's house in Fort Lauderdale than they did to Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, just for some perspective on this. So, what was the justification for doing that? Prosecutors knew perfectly well that Stone was not a flight risk. He's broke. He doesn't even have a valid passport. They could simply have called his lawyer and told him to surrender. That's the actual standard in cases like this. But they didn't do that. Instead, they went in with guns drawn. So, who decided to do that, and how much did it cost taxpayers? We spent the last two days trying to answer those questions. And it tells you a lot about contemporary America that we couldn't, we still have no idea. The Justice Department wouldn't answer us. The White House, which supposedly oversees the Justice Department, didn't even respond. Maybe they don't know the answer to those questions. Possible! They don't control Robert Mueller. Nobody controls Robert Mueller. Mueller can send armed men to your home to rouse you from bed at gunpoint, just because he feels like it, and there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it. Mueller has an unlimited budget and no timetable. He doesn't have to answer questions. He can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, to whomever he wants. He cannot be fired. Mueller is the single most powerful person in America, and yet nobody voted for him. Hmm! He is a living rebuke to the principles of our democratic system. At the same time, our leaders tell us that we need Robert Mueller, an all- powerful, unelected prosecutor, accountable to no one, to protect us from threats to, brace yourself here, democracy. Huh! Nobody in Washington catches the irony in any of this. Mueller himself is a threat to our democracy, the most powerful man elected by nobody. Our media don't ask questions about any of this or even acknowledge that it is a question. They've chosen sides. Here's Roger Stone from our show on Friday night."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Save that tape! It's one for the ages because it summarizes everything. So, just to recap what you just heard. We, journalists, says CNN, need to fight back against the \"Fringes of the Right\" who just want to \"move the story away from what it should really be,\" which, it goes without saying, CNN decides. They decides what the story should really be, and if you don't agree, you're on the fringes of the Right. In other words, \"Shut up, you guys. Stop asking questions. We don't feel like answering.\" But this show persisted because that's our job. And so, we asked both CNN's official spokesmen and the kid you saw playing Media Reporter on the screen a very simple question. Did Mueller's office help you with your story? The response, of course, feigned outrage. \"How dare you? You're Right-wing. Be quiet.\" But when we kept pressing them, an interesting thing happened. They didn't deny it. So, to be totally clear, here's the specific question that we asked. \"Did federal law enforcement officials confirm the raid on Roger Stone's house to CNN before it happened?\" Very simple question. And when we pressed it, CNN dropped the fake outrage. They just refused to answer because, of course, CNN talked to Mueller's people before the raid. There was never any doubt about that. All the barking aside, Mueller wanted the raid on Roger Stone's home caught on tape, and publicly aired, as a warning to other disobedient witnesses about what can happen to you if you step out of line. CNN was happy to oblige. So, CNN acted as the Public Relations arm of the Mueller investigation, as they have before, and then they lied about it in the most self-righteous possible way, and set those kids out on TV to lie some more. So, it answers a lot of questions. No wonder CNN seemed so eager to defend Friday's raid, and to belittle and attack and marginalize anyone who asked honest questions about it. The network is no longer covering Robert Mueller. They're working with Robert Mueller, and you should know that as you watch it. Kim Strassel writes for The Wall Street Journal editorial page, and she joins us tonight. Kim, great to see you. So, before we get into any of what we've just been talking about, there was news today from - from the Administration that the Mueller investigation is reaching its final stage.

So, as someone who covers the criminal justice world for a living, give us some perspective. Late middle-aged guy, no history of violence, no passport, no firearms in the home, under investigation for over a year, emails and texts already in the possession of the Prosecutor, would you send dozens of armed men to arrest him? Is that normal?"

    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "No, of course not, of course not. And, of course, it's not normal. And as you said, the standard operating procedure here would be to call his lawyer, and ask him to surrender. And I think it gets to the other point of your opening as well too. Mr. Mueller, unfortunately, does not answer to anyone. And, as a result, we can bring up these topics. You can call and ask the question, \"Why did you do it?\" He doesn't have to answer it. And he - he doesn't have to answer to anybody in the end. And - and that is one of the reasons that we should hope that all of this is ending, especially when you look at the list of people he's gone after, and the crimes for which they've been gone after. Nearly, all of them crimes that he claims that they have committed after he was appointed as Special Counsel, not any, for the time period he was actually asked to investigate, at least not of Americans."

All five have been taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital, which is a Level I trauma center. Police say one suspect is dead. And despite numerous reports of one or more other suspects being barricaded inside the residence, police have no word on other suspects. In fact, SWAT teams are now on scene using robotic cameras to search for any other potential suspects. We should note, a neighbor did say earlier that he could hear police trying to negotiate with somebody inside, which is not to say there was someone inside.

That's how hip and modern Gavin Newsom is. But that's not all. He's also decided he doesn't want to live in the Governor's Mansion in Sacramento anymore. Instead, Newsom is moving in to a $3.7 million estate in an upscale suburb. Newsom has kids and he calls the neighborhood more kid-friendly than Sacramento. The problem is that Gavin Newsom cares deeply about climate change. He says that a lot. He cares a lot more about it than you do. He's a really good person. For an ardent environmentalist like Newsom, the California Governor's Mansion is a perfect place to live. It's within walking distance of the State Capitol. It's a no-emission commute. His new home is an hour ran - round-trip for the entire entourage, the frosted window suburban entourage. That's a big carbon footprint. There goes the planet. And there's another problem too, maybe a bigger problem. Newsom also cares about diversity. He talks about diversity a lot, probably about as much as he talks about climate change. And for diversity aficionados, Sacramento is heaven. In 2002, Harvard University and Time magazine described Sacramento as \"America's most diverse city.\" The city's public school students speak 43 languages. About 40 percent don't speak English at home. You would think Gavin Newsom would want his kids right there in the center of all that diversity, but no. Instead, he's moving them to one of the least diverse neighborhoods in the entire State of California. It's a place where the demographics look like 1950. In other words, it's very, very White, which is something that Newsom thinks as very, very bad or says he does. But does he really believe it? Not really, because he's moving his family there. You're starting to figure out how this works? So, you make policies that totally change the country. Then you attack anyone who criticizes those policies as evil, and then force them to be quiet or fire them if they won't. And then you personally move as far as you can away from the effects of those policies, preferably behind a wall somewhere. That's the trick. And to be fair, it's not just Gavin Newsom who does this. They all do that, all of them. Well it's well-established, at least on TV, that there is no crisis at all on the U.S.-Mexico border. The very idea of that is insane."

On one front, you just have now the increase in very serious medical cases, and this is - is problematic at a number of levels. You have people who are showing up, as we know. There are already two children who died in custody. They were ill when they entered custody. But there are many people that are now coming into Border Patrol custody. And in - in most cases or many cases, they're surrendering, so they're actually actively seeking out Border Patrol knowing that they're going to get medical services. They're actually having to set up now screening facilities, frontline screening facilities, for Border Patrol to deal with people showing up who have H1N1 Flu, scabies, a whole list, a litany of different communicable, very serious diseases that they have to be treated for, by the way, courtesy of the taxpayer, that often requires taking them to the nearest hospital, which takes one or two depending on the sector Border Patrol agents to accompany them to the hospital, all this, of course, paid for - paid for by Uncle Sam. And then, you also have to deal with the drain on resources. Border Patrol guys are saying, \"Look, we've got enough problems as it is.\" They had about 30,000 - close to 30,000 family units alone. That doesn't include unaccompanied minors. It doesn't include people that are just trying to cross illegally, the old-fashioned way, by themselves that are showing up, turning themselves in. And now, what's happening is, Border Patrol's being turned into a de facto Red Cross on our Border for people who are coming up with serious illnesses, diseases, people who were eight or nine months pregnant, this is happening in increasing numbers every month.

It includes the way that the asylum system has not been addressed so that Con - and Congress really has to actually pass laws, because right now, if you understand the system, there are many different ways to game it. You can come into the country effectively and skip the entire line and stay in the United States. And even though you won't get asylum in the end, you'll be in the interior of the U.S. That has to be addressed by Congress. There's also a crisis of - of lawlessness. I mean one thing, I think, is interesting is when you see all these people who are going on TV and saying, \"You can't lie to the FBI, you can't lie to the federal government,\" when it has to do with the Mueller probe, well the same laws apply, same laws about lying to Federal Officers, to Border Patrol and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.

In almost every important instance, including right now in Venezuela, giving arms to the Ukrainians, who are opposed to the Russians, bombing the Russian client state in Syria, imposing incredibly harsh sanctions on Russian oligarchs, Trump has acted contrary to the interest of the Kremlin. The most important example of which is probably Trump's very vehement denunciations of the Germans for buying natural gas from Russia, one of their most important exports on which their economy depends, rather than buying it from the U.S. Really weird behavior for somebody who is being blackmailed by Vladimir Putin, he keeps doing exactly the opposite of what Putin wants. The Roger Stone indictment is like all of the other Mueller indictments. And that is the number of people that Mueller has indicted for what the original Mueller letters said he was supposed to find out, namely whether there was criminal coordination between the Trump campaign, on the one hand, and Russian government, on the other hand, with respect to the 2016 - 2016 election, that number is zero. That was the number before Roger Stone's indictment. That continues to be the number after. It's not an investigation that's complete, but it's been - it's coming up on two years, it's like a year and eight months, I don't know what the future holds. Maybe Mueller will someday indict people for that. So, maybe he'll cure cancer. But as a journalist, all I can do is say what has happened up until this point.

And I think that this has been one of the problems as the press has completely given up its adversarial role when it comes to questioning prosecutorial power, what the CIA does, what the FBI does.

Some of the biggest losses were at BuzzFeed, about 220 employees got fired there. BuzzFeed is run by a guy called Jonah Peretti. Peretti isn't just a media CEO. He's an icon in the tech world. He's a living embodiment of the values of modern big business. Peretti first became famous a number of years ago when he attacked Nike for running sweatshops. And the attention from that helped him break into the media. And from there, he helped found The Huffington Post and, eventually, BuzzFeed. As a boss, Peretti transitioned smoothly from the traditional leftism of his youth to the new and far more lucrative version of woke capitalism that so many CEOs now practice. Peretti spent a lot of time extolling the virtues of inclusivity and diversity and, of course, attacking Conservatives as racist. At the same time, Peretti crushed the efforts of his own staff to unionize. He argued it wouldn't be right for BuzzFeed because unions are only good for \"Replaceable employees.\" BuzzFeed staff were apparently so special, they didn't need unions. Well it turns out they did. Now, more than 200 of BuzzFeed's employees understand that they were, in fact, quite replaceable. After firing them, Peretti tried to weasel his way out of paying his employees for any of their unused paid time off until the public outcry became so great that he finally caved and paid. \"This is very common,\" Peretti told them, and that's true. Greedy, stupid bosses who buy a pass from the business press by mouthing progressive platitudes are indeed very common. They're everywhere, unfortunately. What's rare are humane bosses who care about the people who work for them. We could use more of those. Well Mike Rowe has a new scholarship program trying to send young Americans to trade schools. And in doing that, he's willing to work with a bunch of different organizations, some of which not everybody likes. And for doing that, he's been accused of \"selling-out.\" Mike Rowe joins us tonight. So Mike, I mean this in the best way, but I like it when you're attacked, because unlike most people who get attacked on social media, you write these long, very thoughtful replies that actually inform us, and this is no different."

Let's face it, it's also great publicity. It's hard to give away--"

I'm reduced to shameless plugs on your show because I don't really know how else to put that message out there without inflaming somebody, who's going to start the sentence with \"Mike Rowe, I've always been a fan of yours but dot dot dot,\" till you sat down with that son of a gun over there and said this. Now, all of a sudden, you're on the naughty list forever."

Lots of people jump up and down. Moral preening is definitely the coin of the realm at the moment. When you hear someone talking about how he's morally superior to you, check and see how he treats his employees, find out what his kids think of him. That's really the test. There's no other test. That's about it for us tonight. Tune in every night at 8 p.m. to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Try and break its fetters, if you can.
