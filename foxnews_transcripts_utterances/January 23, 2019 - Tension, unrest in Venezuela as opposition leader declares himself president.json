They have both backed billions of dollars for it in the past. But for some reason now, it's a big problem. And much further, south of the border today, a not entirely unrelated story is playing out. The beginning of the end of the dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. Who oversaw the death of democracy in his country and drove it into the ground. No food, no medicine. And if you spoke up to complain, you were likely to be thrown in prison. Today, President Trump announcing that the United States would no longer recognize Maduro as Venezuela's President. One day after Vice President Mike Pence released a video appealing directly to the Venezuelan people."

But it is true that political upheaval and barely functioning governments in Honduras and Guatemala have driven the movement of these caravans north, that's a fact. And also a fact now in Mexico today, where migrants are reportedly being given tagged bracelets. They're being told to keep moving it north to United States border. So, here we are. In moments, my exclusive interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said this week, new winds are blowing across the world and they are blowing in Venezuela tonight. But first, Isaias Medina, a former senior diplomat representing Venezuela at the U.N. He left that post in 2017 to fight what he calls the \"humanitarian apocalypse\" in his country. Isaias, good to have you with us this evening.

I want to thank President Trump for supporting the restoration of democracy in our country, and for supporting our new President Juan Guaido. I could not feel better to see the wind changing as you had mentioned. And now, to see that a new young strong president is taking over and filling the void that has been created by Maduro's expiration of his term. This is a very important matter in the region because Maduro's regime has become a clear threat to the maintenance of peace and security in the American hemisphere. And I do -- I have no doubt that also his relationships with international terrorist organizations like FARC, ELN, and Hezbollah are also are a very clear risk to the national security of the United States."

    {
      "speaker": "MEDINA",
      "utterance": "Well, the presidents are very clear. It's a very cruel dictatorship that has created an economic meltdown for their own interest of grand corruption. But also, the worst part is the humanitarian deterioration that they have induced through weaponization, of starvation, and medicine scarcity for social control and to remain in power. This has broken down, and today we've noticed how hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan have taken the streets. And have spoken out to change this regime that has brought hunger and death to the Venezuelan people."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It's heartbreaking. I know you could understand it. And there were subtitles on the bottom. But, it's hard for -- I think, for Americans to imagine walking to a hospital with your child and being told by the doctors, \"You know, I'm sorry. We wish we could help. There's just -- there is no any medicine here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEDINA",
      "utterance": "Martha, if I can tell you something that, that they use this social control card. It's a socialist control card that was actually issued by ZTE in China. And they try to control people. And who doesn't use this card, it is walking down death row, because you will not be able to get any assistance either in hospitals, in food, or even gasoline. They were trying to control the population at such extent that they were just killing hundreds of people daily. This is why it's so important that the Trump administration and the international community has supported Juan Guaido as our new president in charge. To take control and bring back and restore not only justice through peace, but the rule of law which is so important, and democracy. To be able to free our people and our territory from a mafia failed state."

      "speaker": "RIVERA",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I totally agree with your previous speaker. My old daytime talk show used to air in Venezuela. So, I used to travel quite frequently to the country. Wonderful people, a middle-class country with some of the largest petroleum reserves on earth. To see that crumble first on the Hugo Chavez, and then, his protegee, Nicolas Maduro has been heartbreaking. To see them rendered so desperate as to drive them to use their constitution to usurp the presidency of the country. I witnessed Juan Guaido, a 35-year-old charismatic, very popular opposition figure who heads the National Assembly. Whether the army though in Venezuela honors what they have done remains to be seen it could be. You know, we have our immigration crisis, but it could be that what we're watching developed in Venezuela is the beginning of a Civil War. I hope not, but it is a great interest to me that Canada and Brazil and Chile and Peru, all back the United States, all back President Trump in supporting Juan Guaido as the new president of Venezuela. Remember, two Russian supersonic nuclear bombers visited Venezuela just in December. So, this could be part of a -- of a -- you know a real-world chess match here."

He was then released but he is -- he's a courageous person because he's in a very tenuous situation as he tries to do this. And as you say, he's got the backing of the United States and other very strong countries. I want your thoughts on this whole State of the Union situation before I let you go. What do you -- what do you see in all of this?"

    {
      "speaker": "RIVERA",

But to do something to, to deny the American people the State of the Union address. That we've watched our entire lives, the ceremony, the president coming in. You know, the congressman trying to attract his attention one side rising the other side sitting. You know, stone face the Supreme Court of the United States there. You know, all the leaders of the government, says it is a democracy writ large and to see it undercut by partisan politics, is the end of refusal to negotiate a compromise is something that is just appalling to me. Why doesn't Speaker Pelosi who cares so deeply about these issues, why don't you sit opposite President Trump and say, OK, I'll give you $1 billion for the wall, not $5 billion? Build 800-miles, not seven. You know, we've negotiate, compromise. Compromise is painful for everybody, but this refusal to speak and that to cancel this grand event on the world stage like this, I think is really an embarrassment to the United States, and it sustained on democracy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, and there's a really a great irony when you think about it, Geraldo. The State of the Union is not necessarily to come out and say everything is perfect. It's to come out and explain to everybody what the State of the Union is. And it's complicated right now. But there's a reason to convey that message and explain it and lay it out. That's why it's in the Constitution so that people will have that opportunity to hear from the president. I mean, it's really incredible. So, we'll see how it plays out. Maybe there is hope. Geraldo, thanks. Good to see you tonight."

What I did was try to explain to those who were sitting there in Davos why it is that America has been an enormous force for good over these two years of the Trump administration. How our policies make not only Americans safer but the whole world and contribute to economic growth and wealth creation and freedom all around the world. Those were the things I talked about. The importance of the nation-state as the fundamental building block for national security and frankly for stability and regions as well. It can sometimes seem disruptive. It can sometimes seem like America is acting in ways that are causing trouble. But these fundamental premises that that were built out over 70 years ago need to be relooked and that's what President Trump is driving."

President Trump understands that strong nations will have alliances that work on behalf of their countries and all countries and so that's what we're trying to do not only with NATO. But when every organization in the world isn't working, isn't delivering security for the American people, if it is we'll reinforce and where it's not, we'll work to make it better.

The defeat of the Caliphate, ISIS Caliphate in Syria is almost complete. We're going to stay there till it's done.

I assure you that none of these things sat well with Vladimir Putin. Let's talk about Iran. Do you think they're happy that the largest set of sanctions ever emplace in an economy that is likely to fall into recession by the spring of this year makes the Iranians happy? To see the global coalition against Iran that has been put in place not only Arab countries but countries from Asia and Africa will join us in February in Warsaw for a ministerial that will address Middle East stability in Iran.

First step, stopping there testing of their missile program. Second step, stopping their nuclear test. Those still continue. There's been real progress made. There are many conversations going on.

In fact, he reportedly said, \"I have shot five people.\" Both police officers and sheriff's deputies then set up a perimeter and negotiations with the shooter began but were unsuccessful. Though it's unclear if the standoff and the delay in medical attention led to victims losing their lives. Finally, the sheriff's SWAT team in a SWAT vehicle rammed through the front doors and that's when the suspect gave himself up. The first sign of grim news came from Highland's County commissioner Don Elwell who wrote on Facebook, quote, \"getting more information now, none of it is good. Please keep praying.\" And sure enough, the sheriff soon confirmed the worst. Watch."

I mean, my daughter is a senior right now. Making connections to seniors who have already committed to college or have a job lined up or going into the military is not a very easy thing to do. But what you can make a connection to their life and one way to do that is what I call bridge lessons. This is not unusual. I have been doing this for years.

      "utterance": "I do want to ask you about another story here with regard to some announcers that you've written about who you believe are perpetuating a stereotype about black quarterbacks. And this has been researched in terms of the language that commentators use when they compare black quarterbacks and white quarterbacks. Explain -- explain what you see in that situation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUNGY",
      "utterance": "Well, and I believe it's totally unintentional. I don't think it's a thought process at all but you see, you know, the black quarterbacks described as athletic, as having great arm strength as all the physical tools and you just rarely hear about the cerebral part of it. Patrick Mahomes has played outstanding football for the Kansas City Chiefs. His first year, he is doing some amazing things. But all I tend to hear about is the great athletic plays. He has a great grasp of the game. He understands the game. He processes it mentally. He is a leader. I would just like to hear more of those types of adjectives describing some of our African-American quarterbacks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUNGY",
      "utterance": "I think many times we do see the great athleticism and we say wow, but we don't always take into consideration that other side of the coin and the mental part of it and leadership and all the things that go into being a great quarterback."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, I want to -- there is also a piece in the San Francisco Chronicle that takes a look at whether or not it's time for Collin Kaepernick to return to the NFL. They say there is sort of a quarterback shortage out there and that a lot of people agree that that he deserves another shot that he's done his time for no crime, as they wrote. Do you agree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUNGY",
      "utterance": "Well, when you are the quarterback you are the face of the franchise. There is a lot of things that go into it. And I know I believe there are some teams that Collin Kaepernick could play for and help and benefit but they are saying what's the return? Do I want to turn off my fan base? Do I want to, you know, stand up against the backlash? Maybe it's not worth it. And I think that's where Collin is now. He's definitely one of the top 30, 35 quarterbacks in the NFL. He should be playing. But right now, he isn't."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, just the face alone they've said his face looks like Kavanaugh. That haughty kind of smirk, and if smirking is a crime lock me up, Martha. I do it all the time. Just think injustice if you look at what happened. The country is reacting the same way that it reacted during Kavanaugh and once all the exculpatory evidence comes out. For instance, the accuser, in this case the Indian, was lied and said that these white kids were attacking these black protesters. He never even served in Vietnam. Now he said when he came back from Vietnam, he was called a baby killer and spit on. He never went. And then you know what he did after this protest? He tried to invade a mass at a cathedral in Washington, D.C. and security prevented him from coming in. So, there is all this stuff that's coming out and the media is trying to slither away from it like they did in the Kavanaugh story."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, all the things that you point out are accurate and, you know, this story has to be presented in its entirety which is the lesson really of this whole story. You know, and I went back this morning and watched what was being said to the boys as well, they had said you were the product of incest. You're an incest baby. They've called him homophobic slurs. I mean, and I think that also hasn't gotten enough attention."
