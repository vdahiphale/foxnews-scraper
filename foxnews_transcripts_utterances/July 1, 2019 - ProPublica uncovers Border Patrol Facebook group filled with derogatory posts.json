Ocasio-Cortez tweeting today \"9,500 CBP officers sharing memes about dead migrants and discussing violence and sexual misconduct towards members of Congress. How on earth can CBP's culture be trusted to care for refugees humanely? P.S., I have no plans to change my itinerary and will visit the CBP station today.

In this case close communist society that we have that in common North Korea and in China in those days but there's been two meetings between these leaders prior to this and I think that's makes it very different. And also it's -- I think it's largely symbolic taking a step in in North Korea but clearly the president has something in mind here and that the talks have been stalemated ever since the Hanoi summit sort of blew up and Kim Jong-un went home empty-handed and not getting the sanction relief, that was clearly his major objective in those negotiations. And as a result of that, we've been trying to get the talks restarted that working-level and have not succeeded even our personal envoy Stephen Bingham personally involved in that endeavor and secretary Pompeo trying as well. So I think what the President said is OK, I'm going to get this done myself and he has done that. So the working groups are now going to meet and let's see if we can get some progress here. To be frank about it, Martha, we have less leverage and we had 18 months ago. And the reason is that Russia has never complied with the sanctions.

But here we are. Can we make some progress or not? And will there be some possible compromise? I think the administration is likely in a different place, Martha, in a sense that if Kim Jong-un comes in with something substantive much more so than what he had put on a table the last time, and it is a step in the right direction done at the working level, it's likely that we would make some accommodations to him on sanctions and not have him go home again without that.

The social media has been tough on him. But social media does not win and lose campaigns. Voters do. He is still the number one in the polls today.

But he is handling this all wrong. He could actually take a lesson from Donald Trump on this when it comes to this identity politics attacks. The reason Democrats use them, Martha, is because they're effective. You're seeing it -- you're seeing it in the polls. Accusing people or insinuating that they're racist. When in fact, listen, I'm not a Joe Biden fan, Martha, at all. I think he's a horrible candidate candidly. Joe Biden is not a racist. And people who would be lobbying these charges at him know this, but these charges work.

It's a secret Facebook group in ProPublica, the independent investigative journalism organization alerted the public to some of the downright disgusting posts. Now, the group is made up of current and former members of the U.S. Border Patrol. The banter in the group is derogatory. Members are caught making fun of migrant deaths, including the father and daughter found dead in the Rio Grande last week. Members in the group say that the father and daughter are \"too clean\", and suggests that members of the Democratic Party faked and edited that upsetting photograph. Martha, several of the images on the site are of a sexual nature, not only are immigrants depicted this way. Several members of Congress are as well, including Democratic Congresswoman's Veronica Escobar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Now, one member encouraged others to throw burritos at the congresswoman but didn't call them congresswoman, used another word. Ocasio-Cortez tweeting today \"9,500 CBP officers sharing memes about dead migrants and discussing violence and sexual misconduct towards members of Congress. How on earth can CBP's culture be trusted to care for refugees humanely? P.S., I have no plans to change my itinerary and will visit the CBP station today. Now, Ocasio-Cortez lived up to that promise, she spent the day in Clint, Texas near the El Paso.

And I can tell you that, that is providing the essential meals, essential hygiene products, essential bathing schedules for these folks that we have that are coming into our custody. Having said that, as I said before, we are not long-term, not meant to house long term or short term detention facilities.

Last weekend, we had a young child that an agent jumped in the water, saved, performed CPR, and brought the child back to life. So, we hear those stories every day.

It's unfortunate but it is an indication, this ProPublica expose is an indication of that kind of moral exhaustion within the Border Patrol now that cannot be tolerated.

In the end, they called it the week that changed the world. Since the beginning of Nixon's presidency, he had hinted wanting to establish a new relationship with China. Kissinger went on several trips to test the waters. The immediate result of the stunning visuals of seeing these two world leaders together was a thaw in relations and ultimately a shift in the Cold War balance that eventually led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. It also opened the door to China becoming an economic powerhouse, a huge new market for the United States, but also a trade relationship that is now fraught with spying and mistrust. Now nearly 50 years later are we witnessing a similar seismic moment. Over the weekend, President Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to step foot in North Korea. Here now to analyze this, General Jack Keane, Chairman of the Institute for the Study of War and a Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst. General Keane, always good to see you, sir."

      "utterance": "Well, it's not an iconic moment, certainly, when Nixon and Mao Zedong never had been a meeting like that before. In this case close communist society that we have that in common North Korea and in China in those days but there's been two meetings between these leaders prior to this and I think that's makes it very different. And also it's -- I think it's largely symbolic taking a step in in North Korea but clearly the president has something in mind here and that the talks have been stalemated ever since the Hanoi summit sort of blew up and Kim Jong-un went home empty-handed and not getting the sanction relief, that was clearly his major objective in those negotiations. And as a result of that, we've been trying to get the talks restarted that working-level and have not succeeded even our personal envoy Stephen Bingham personally involved in that endeavor and secretary Pompeo trying as well. So I think what the President said is OK, I'm going to get this done myself and he has done that. So the working groups are now going to meet and let's see if we can get some progress here. To be frank about it, Martha, we have less leverage and we had 18 months ago. And the reason is that Russia has never complied with the sanctions. They're transferring oil out on the high seas, they're backdooring us on economic assistance. China after the first Singapore summit opened the aperture and began to increase economic assistance to North Korea. We know this for a fact and I think we should have hammered them for it. We have not, possibly because of the trade negotiations that have been going on, the toughness surrounding all of that. But here we are. Can we make some progress or not? And will there be some possible compromise? I think the administration is likely in a different place, Martha, in a sense that if Kim Jong-un comes in with something substantive much more so than what he had put on a table the last time, and it is a step in the right direction done at the working level, it's likely that we would make some accommodations to him on sanctions and not have him go home again without that. Secondly, I don't think we'll see a summit between the two leaders unless there is something on the table that both working groups can agree to and define that as progress in terms of their mutual interest."

It would change the nature of their country. But he's got a gamble whether or not that means you know, that he would be completely cut off and you know, who knows what would happen to him if he opened up that way."

And I think Kim Jong-un and President Trump has these instincts about him because he's talking to him more than anybody else is from the United States certainly that Kim Jong-un wants something more than what his grandfather and his father want. Remember, they were interested in preservation of the regime. That's why the nuclear weapons and that's why the huge conventional military that they have. Kim Jong-un has seen more of the world, understands what the potential is. I think he wants something much more for his country along the lines that you're suggesting. And I think that is why the personal diplomacy that people are so critical about possibly has a role to play here because it helps to earn his trust.  At the end of the day, he's going to want economic prosperity to some degree for his country but he wants a guarantor of security because that is what those nuclear weapons are all about and we're going to have to put that on a table gradually for him.

TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: Martha, Marcus Lemonis is the CEO and chairman of Camping World which owns Gander R.V. in Statesville, North Carolina. The recreational vehicle retailer has a permit to fly a 1,000 square foot flag which is about 25 by 40. The company is currently a 3,200 square foot flag or 40 by 80. Statesville has repeatedly demanded the flag be replaced. Marcus Lemonis and Camping World have repeatedly refused posting on the company Facebook page, quote, \"This is about more than just the flag. This is about our veterans, military, and the men and women that have sacrificed for this great country. They are the reason we fly the flag and they are the reason we will not take it down.\" So, the city sued Camping World seeking a $50 a day fine, if it wins is already above $12,000. But Lemonis and his company have gotten support from more than 150,000 people who signed a petition back in May entitled \"Let Camping World and Gander outdoors fly the American flag.\" Here is a supporter of the flag at that time followed by the mayor of Statesville.\" Watch."

It's about a culture. This is a problem with a kid wearing a hoodie in the first place. Our nominee needs to have the language to talk about race in a far more constructive ways,\" says Cory Booker. And the frontrunner seems to be taking a bit of a hit after the debates. Look at the new CNN poll showing Biden's lead slipping now to just 5 percent. To single digits -- depending on which one you look at here -- just days after Kamala Harris confronted him on race relations during that debate. He is down 10 points since last month. She is now closing in on him. Joining me now, Dan Bongino, author of the upcoming book \"Exonerated: The Failed Take Down of President Trump by the Swamp,\" and Robert Wolf, a CEO of 32 Advisors. Both are Fox News contributors. Gentlemen, thank you for being here. Robert, let me start with you. How do you think Joe Biden is feeling about this whole thing right now? ROBERT WOLF, CEO, 32 ADVISORS: Well, it's definitely been a humbling 48 hours to say the least since the debates. The polls have obviously been incredibly tough on him. The social media has been tough on him. But social media does not win and lose campaigns. Voters do. He is still the number one in the polls today. And it's not surprising that Cory Booker and Kamala Harris went after him because he is leading in South Carolina and that's probably the most important state for them in the early primaries."

She is half Indian and half Jamaican.\" And he retweeted \"Is this true? Wow.\" And he got some heat for that. Do you think that was well placed?"

You know, black voters are going to be decisive in a lot of early primary states. There's no doubt about that. Here's the problem, Martha. Biden is a gaffe fest. We've known that from the start. But he is handling this all wrong. He could actually take a lesson from Donald Trump on this when it comes to this identity politics attacks. The reason Democrats use them, Martha, is because they're effective. You're seeing it -- you're seeing it in the polls. Accusing people or insinuating that they're racist. When in fact, listen, I'm not a Joe Biden fan, Martha, at all. I think he's a horrible candidate candidly. Joe Biden is not a racist. And people who would be lobbying these charges at him know this, but these charges work. And until he takes a stand like Trump did, and listen, I'm not going to listen to this and fights back, it's just going to keep on happening. But yes, he can recover."

I mean, obviously -- I would imagine -- I shouldn't say obviously because I don't know personally. But I would imagine that this is, you know, a campaign consensus that it would be a good idea for him to come out and talk about his struggles with addiction, which I think most families in America have someone who has struggled with.

Or when people wanted or were forced to bake a cake for a gay couple and then yet, Sarah Sanders cannot get service. Or we have 500 sanctuary cities and that's supposedly OK to nullify federal law. But nobody on the conservative says you know what, I don't want the Endangered Species Act or I don't want federal handgun registration. And so, I have a sanctuary. It doesn't work that way.

But they are so extreme they got a whole menagerie. I mean, the New Green Deal and reparations and abortion to the point of infanticide and then the wealth tax of 70 to 90 percent income tax the abolition of everything. Abolition of ICE, the abolition of the electoral college, student debt and Medicare for everybody. They're tagged with that. And they're not doing what Barack Obama did in 2008 where he didn't get tagged like that so in the main election he couldn't be ridiculed or attack by General McCain as being for Reverend Wright or for gay marriage or for deficit spending."

It's either because they're an echo chamber and they just decided that nobody is going to be the left of anyone and they are not listening to the larger country because these issues don't -- they don't poll 51 percent. Or maybe they think they can educate us, you and I, the American people to have enough time and money to join them. Or maybe they want to lose. I mean, Barry Goldwater in 1964 and George McGovern in 1972 pretty much had an extreme position and wanted to lose nobly rather than to win as a centrist or pragmatist."
