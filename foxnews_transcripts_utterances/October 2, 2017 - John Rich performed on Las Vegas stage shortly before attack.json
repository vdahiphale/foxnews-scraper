His family says he wasn't heavily into either one of them, and we do not know his motivation, but we can tell you at this point in time, it was a significant effort, and there was significant planning that went into this shooting. Just consider that he was inside the Mandalay Bay hotel room where the shooting happened for the better part of four days, and during those four days, he brought up at least ten different weapons. We believe the number will go higher, but right now we're sticking with ten weapons brought up there. And now you've got security, you've got Las Vegas metro police, and the FBI scanning over surveillance video trying to figure out exactly how he snuck those weapons inside.

We talked to experts all day and they said that sounds an awful lot like an automatic weapon. Well, Fox News has in fact confirmed that there was an AR-15 that was modified into a fully automatic weapon, which means it keeps firing as long as you are holding the trigger down. Thousands of rounds of ammunition. It takes a lot to get one of those weapons. It's one more detail that went into this. And then if you look at the windows themselves at the Mandalay Bay, we're talking about a two bedroom suite and you've got two different windows that face separate angles. He built different platforms. And then Stephen Paddock got up on those platforms and he was able at different angles to fire down on the crowd as many rounds as possible, as quickly as possible, which is why it was so deadly and so lethal. Fifty eight, the death toll, they believe that will also rise. Over 500 people were injured in this. So far, there is no link to any terrorism. Again, no political affiliation, no religious affiliation. We should note that Stephen Paddock lived in Texas. He lived in central Florida. He lived in California. And he decided a couple of years ago to move out to Mesquite, Nevada, about 75 miles north of Las Vegas. He bought himself a two-bedroom house there. He was an avid gambler. And his dad, we learned, was a bank robber but he had no criminal record. All he had was a traffic ticket, and now we know that he's behind the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.

And he has family in Central Florida, and he got tired of the humidity in Central Florida so we decided to move here to Nevada. But as far as any kind of political rants, religious rants, there was nothing that we could find that was linked to him at all, which is surprising because you know and I know that within minutes after these types of shootings, as soon as we get the name, you can put it up on social media, you can run it against all these different data banks, and you come up with, in most cases, a fairly significant amount of information. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In this case, we came up with a traffic ticket, and came up with the fact that his dad was a bank robber.

That's all police would confirm for us. They said because she is out of the country that she was in any way involved in the shooting. However, they said when she gets back in the country they will thoroughly question her because she might know a lot more than she's indicating right now. She is not a suspect in the shooting, but she is still a person of interest in the overall crime. She has a lot more depth in her personal social media footprint. She is on Facebook a lot. She called herself a happy grandma and a mom. And she loves her grandkids and she loves more than anything just traveling around and doing things. But again, there's no religious or political affiliation tied to her Facebook page either. It's simply, hey, she talks to her sister-in-law, and her sister says she looks great for 62. And she says yeah, we got good genes. There is nothing to indicate that she's been talking to anybody on any black-market websites or anything aside from just family relationships on Facebook, and run on the mill stuff that you see any 62-year-old woman would have. Again, we're still trying to figure out if there's a relationship between Stephen Paddock and Marilou Danley, or if they were just roommates.

His family says he wasn't heavily into either one of them, and we do not know his motivation, but we can tell you at this point in time, it was a significant effort, and there was significant planning that went into this shooting. Just consider that he was inside the Mandalay Bay hotel room where the shooting happened for the better part of four days, and during those four days, he brought up at least ten different weapons. We believe the number will go higher, but right now we're sticking with ten weapons brought up there. And now you've got security, you've got Las Vegas metro police, and the FBI scanning over surveillance video trying to figure out exactly how he snuck those weapons inside. And I want you to listen again very quickly now to some more nats of the shooting because I want to make a point after this. Play the gunfire again very quickly."

We talked to experts all day and they said that sounds an awful lot like an automatic weapon. Well, Fox News has in fact confirmed that there was an AR-15 that was modified into a fully automatic weapon, which means it keeps firing as long as you are holding the trigger down. Thousands of rounds of ammunition. It takes a lot to get one of those weapons. It's one more detail that went into this. And then if you look at the windows themselves at the Mandalay Bay, we're talking about a two bedroom suite and you've got two different windows that face separate angles. He built different platforms. And then Stephen Paddock got up on those platforms and he was able at different angles to fire down on the crowd as many rounds as possible, as quickly as possible, which is why it was so deadly and so lethal. Fifty eight, the death toll, they believe that will also rise. Over 500 people were injured in this. So far, there is no link to any terrorism. Again, no political affiliation, no religious affiliation. We should note that Stephen Paddock lived in Texas. He lived in central Florida. He lived in California. And he decided a couple of years ago to move out to Mesquite, Nevada, about 75 miles north of Las Vegas. He bought himself a two-bedroom house there. He was an avid gambler. And his dad, we learned, was a bank robber but he had no criminal record. All he had was a traffic ticket, and now we know that he's behind the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. How do you get from a traffic ticket to there is what everybody is trying to figure out now, Kimberly."

No real Facebook history to actually work with. We know that he managed some apartments down in Mesquite, Texas, and that he lived in California for a while. And he has family in Central Florida, and he got tired of the humidity in Central Florida so we decided to move here to Nevada. But as far as any kind of political rants, religious rants, there was nothing that we could find that was linked to him at all, which is surprising because you know and I know that within minutes after these types of shootings, as soon as we get the name, you can put it up on social media, you can run it against all these different data banks, and you come up with, in most cases, a fairly significant amount of information. In this case, we came up with a traffic ticket, and came up with the fact that his dad was a bank robber. And beyond that, everyone is wondering where do you go? How do you get from Mesquite, a gambler, living with a woman, we don't know if they were in a relationship or if they were just roommates, but you're living with a woman out there, and suddenly you take the precise and meticulous time to plan something as horrendous as this with no track record of any kind of rants or violence.

I start thinking about ISIS. It leads me -- I'm just wondering, who is this person and why we don't know more about her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Well, we know her name is Marilou Danley, right? She's 62- years-old. And we heard the same things today. She could be in the Philippines. She is definitely out of the country. That's all police would confirm for us. They said because she is out of the country that she was in any way involved in the shooting. However, they said when she gets back in the country they will thoroughly question her because she might know a lot more than she's indicating right now. She is not a suspect in the shooting, but she is still a person of interest in the overall crime. She has a lot more depth in her personal social media footprint. She is on Facebook a lot. She called herself a happy grandma and a mom. And she loves her grandkids and she loves more than anything just traveling around and doing things. But again, there's no religious or political affiliation tied to her Facebook page either. It's simply, hey, she talks to her sister-in-law, and her sister says she looks great for 62. And she says yeah, we got good genes. There is nothing to indicate that she's been talking to anybody on any black-market websites or anything aside from just family relationships on Facebook, and run on the mill stuff that you see any 62-year-old woman would have. Again, we're still trying to figure out if there's a relationship between Stephen Paddock and Marilou Danley, or if they were just roommates. But we know the reason her name came up, Greg, is because her debit card was found inside the hotel room, so he brought it in there for some reason."

And some of the other weapons that were found in the hotel room, how many were there? And what types of weapons were they? And did he use just the converted AR-15 to do the shooting, or did he use other weapons? Where do we stand with the tracing of whether these were legally purchased and where, and where does that stand?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. All good weapon, Jesse -- I mean, good questions, Jesse. We don't really know at this point in time. We just know about the AR-15. We know it was modified, which kind of explains the rapid fire. We know, that we were told at least -- at least 12 or 13 guns. We've heard as many as 20. We have sources telling us there were 16, 18, 20 guns in there. We haven't really specified exactly which guns they were. We know he use the automatic. We don't know the other he used, and we don't know the lineage of any of those weapons, where he got them. Did he buy them illegally? His brother only said, look, we think he's got a couple guns in his house. We always knew that. He's a hunter. Beyond that, the family didn't have any more information about the weapons. So very early when we're talking about tracking, tracing weapons, all we know is that there was, apparently, according to what we've -- what they have told Fox News, a fully automatic modified AR-15 was used in the shooting, Jesse."

      "utterance": "Trace, I'm so interested in his background. So we know he worked for Lockheed Martin for a few years, I think as an accountant. And then, he does not go into the military. He never had any military background. Nonetheless, from what we have learned so far, he was able to not only obtain these weapons but then to, as you described to Jesse, to manipulate, fix them, so they became automatic, which raises in my mind some questions like, well, in Las Vegas, I think you don't even have to be registered to buy a gun or to possess a gun, no limits on concealed carry or open carry, but what about the hotel, the Mandalay Bay? Do they allow you to just bring in as many guns as possible? And do people who work at the hotel see that he had a tripod set up by the windows?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "No, and there's -- we're up against the clock, Juan, but no. We're not saying that he modified the gun. We're saying the gun was modified. So I don't want to make the stretch that he actually did this himself because I have no idea what capacity he had as either a marksman or his gun ability. We just know that he was a hunter. That's about as far as it went. He was at one time an accountant, and he flew airplanes. He has a private pilot's license. He's registered to one or two aircraft. And his history with weapons, he was in the military. Where he got the ability and the sense to actually build these platforms so that he could shoot down and cause the most death and destruction is really one of those questions that we will learn in the coming hours and days, Juan."

And there is a little country bar that I have in Las Vegas that I own, and we went over there as Big and Rich and cowboy to play a little after show set. So we were over there on stage there and got to tap on the shoulder that there was an active shooter. What they told us is that they thought there were multiple active shooters and didn't know where they were. And so we immediately stopped playing and got everybody away from the windows and try to secure the location. I made a phone call back to a friend of mine who plays with Jason Aldean, and couldn't believe he actually answered the phone but he did, said they had just thrown him and a bunch of guys into pickup trucks and were, you know, burning rubber out of the parking lot trying to get them out of there. And that the bullets were literally flying through the tour buses, through the instruments on stage, through the rigging. He said he looked up at the back of the pickup and all he saw was bodies everywhere. It's unbelievable."

He throws his hands up and says, hey, guys, it's me. And they said get back on the bus. I mean, I've got to say, LAPD and all the first responders activated instantaneously on this deal.

And so, I actually had a Minneapolis police officer, off-duty, was in my bar hanging out, and he came up to me and showed me his badge and he says I'm officer -- I forget his last name. But I'm an officer, and I am not armed for the first time ever. I can't believe it. Are you armed? I said yes, sir, I am armed. And I have my concealed weapons permit, and I said yes I am armed. He goes can I have your firearm so I can hold point on this front door? And so I handed over my firearm to him. Everybody got behind him.

I know they're not the only ones that do it. But country music singers to me are some of the most accessible to their fans. You personally put yourselves out there. You feel very close to them.

We talk to them. We'll go have fun with them. Our concerts are very interactive with our fans. I mean, I'm a country music fan. So I'm a fan of other singers. And we all know it's like a big family out there. There was one guy that I'm good friends with named DJ Silver. You go look him up. He's a great guy. And he plays with Jason Aldean. Man, this guy tells me that his 6-month-old son who I met before the show and got a picture with, his 6-month-old son and the nanny who was watching him were in the room next door to the shooter on the 32nd floor. Literally in the room next door. And he went for about three or four hours and didn't know where his son was. I mean, you look out and you see these country music fans. Let me tell you something. These people were coming to the show from Southern California, from Arizona, Nevada. They were from all over the place. About."

And her husband came over to me and said John would you mind coming over and talking to my wife and try to calm her down? And so I said absolutely. So I'm over there with my arm around this Canadian lady, you know, try to calm her down and get the situation to try to be as calm as possible.

I think Jason Aldean had been on stage 20 minutes it said before this occurred. Had there been fireworks?

And when you hear the rat-a-tat-tat-tat, you kind of see everybody pause for a minute and go, what am I hearing? Because, you know, you could maybe it is part of the show. Maybe its pyro technique or something is going on. But I think, you know, when you hear that level of gunfire you know that's a fully automatic weapon going off somewhere.

It would be easier than say perhaps a stadium, like a football stadium or something, because it was outdoors and pretty wide open. Thank goodness.

The question tonight, can we do anything to prevent these types of incidents? Joining us is law enforcement analyst and former Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel Scott Mann. Thank you, sir, for being with us tonight. If you go to a large event in an urban center, you're a soft target. And there's lots of different ways to try to protect ourselves but, ultimately, if somebody wanted to do this from that far away, with that kind of weaponry, is there any way that we can further protect ourselves?"

Is that, you know, what was once off limits and stuff that happened, you know, over there in other countries, other places, it's now here. And like Trace said, you know, the shooter clearly conducted a premeditated ambush. He was in that hotel for several days at a time. And as I look at it tactically, you know, he did all the things that you would do to construct a premeditated, devastating ambush. And I do believe in many ways that we're going to continue to see these kinds of attacks in public domains where we never saw them before. And I don't see it going away anytime soon."

One of the rules we learn in combat is all of the first reports are almost always wrong. The things that we know over time, it just starts to add clarity to it, almost like you're walking toward a ridge line that's fuzzy and then it becomes more clear. So a lot of this we're going to figure out as we go, to include motivations and things like that. But just looking at the indicators, looking at the amount of time he stayed in the hotel ahead of time, the two vantage points that he chose, putting himself up on a pedestal to shoot like that, it just tells me -- and today, you know, there's readily accessible information. I believe it was either Dana or Kimberly who said that you can find that stuff online pretty easily, right? But this guy certainly demonstrated a level of proficiency. I mean, over 50 killed, 500 wounded. I haven't seen a battle like that in Afghanistan that resulted in those kinds of U.S. casualties."

Are we showing too much, are we showing too little?"

      "speaker": "MANN",

We're so close to history now, but I do think history is going to show that the 24-hour news cycle does have an impact on this kind of thing. And certainly, you know, violent extremist groups like ISIS, al Qaeda. And I believe even if this guy does turns out to be a lone wolf, you know, the fact that they can be on the ticker, right, so to speak, within a matter of seconds, they can reach around the world. It's not lost on them. I mean, look at how high media for ISIS, I mean, they get better and better at real-time, you know, horrorism that they put on YouTube and mobile devices. So, yeah, I do believe that the 24-hour news cycle does play a role on this. I think the thing we have to guard against more than anything else in the initial moment when this happen is speculation. And I know there's airtime we've got to fill and stuff like that. But right now we've got to let the dust cleared, let law enforcement do their job, and then we make recommendations and make moves.

When you see that this man went through a tremendous amount of planning, at least as the facts suggest that we know it thus far. The room being ordered in advance, two shooting platforms being set up, making sure that housekeeping didn't go to the room for a number of days so that he could, you know, remain undetected. As we started gathering, still, a lot of forensic evidence involved -- cameras, you know, from all directions into the hotel. But what do you do? Because it seems to me that the way this crowd was set up, the large volume, the panic that ensues when people are trying to escape. He's got that platform and an advantage, having a fully automatic weapon. To me, that's like a kill box. You're squared off; you're pinned in to do maximum casualty and damage."

And I mean, to some degree, I think this is going to be our new reality in certain circumstances. One of the things that I would say, though, I do believe that we're going to have to start looking hard at Israel and Colombia and other countries around the world who have learned to still thrive and live their lives, you know, in these kinds of things. And like John said, we have to continue to live. We have to continue to move on. And you think about the number of folks today who were plugging bullet holes with their fingers, who were carrying wounded on improvised litters, who were giving comfort to dying strangers in their final moments. It's going to be everyday Americans that have to step up and step into the breach and deal with this kind of thing. Congress is not going to solve this problem. It's going to be us coming together as people and figuring out different ways to continue to thrive. That's just how it's going to have to go."

But with that number of weapons systems and being that overtly visible, I mean, just from a tactical perspective, I suspect he snuck those weapons in. You know, in suitcases and things like that and prepositioned them over a period of time. And like Trey (ph) side, he was in there for several days. So a good amount of premeditated prepositioning occurred. I suspect it was done with cover and concealed carrying cases. And they were assembled in the room. I don't think the laws that were in place there -- and again, look at Paris, a complex attack. London, complex attack. San Bernardino, where the laws were very stringent, complex attack.

I mean, in situations like this, the first and foremost thought that anyone should have is really to, you know, pray for the people that have lost loved ones. Can you imagine if it's one of your family members? Or somebody that you were still -- so many people were calling in, emailing and saying -- trying to locate someone, not even knowing, being separated from them during this incident. Whether or not they are alive, are they critically injured, or in some hospital. Some people were held back by the hotels. It was total chaos and pandemonium. And when you look at the number of lives lost today, that should just be foremost on everyone's mind, about how we can love each other and get along better, seek to understand and improve a situation. On behalf of humanity, whether it is having a discussion about laws like this, or what brings somebody to commit a heinous crime like that, that's where the -- the focus and the thought should be."

However many people died, four times as many people are being saved in a hospital by doctors. Right now, friends helped friends to safety. People helped strangers to safety. And law enforcement was running towards the bullets. So all those kneelers in the NFL out there, they need to recognize, when they are kneeling during the anthem, they're kneeling, and we're supposed to be honoring law enforcement, law enforcement that's trying to save lives, not take lives. So I hope next Sunday when the anthem is played, people do kneel out of respect to law enforcement. Right now, a lot of stuff looks really small when people are making politics over San Juan. There was a congressman that was trying to impeach the president today. \"SNL\" called the president, I think, a cheap cracker. That has to stop. And people have to choose the side of good over evil.

Everyone is still assembling all the facts, the forensics. There's a tremendous amount of information that needs to be put together and assembled, especially when you see a crime scene of that magnitude and size. So many people have to be spoken to. Evidence collected from such a wide, large area; 22,000 people in attendance. So perhaps this person didn't have a very prominent social media or digital presence or, you know, framework for them to glean some information, but there's got to still be phones. There's got to be interviews with neighbors, or people who know him. Or going back in a certain period of time, especially, given his age. And, you know, I'm anxious and looking forward to getting that information and letting the authorities, you know, do their job and perhaps, hopefully, to find some answers for some of these lost loved ones and family members that are grieving to understand how this happened, why and how we can prevent it."

Someone said to me today when the story just broke, \"I'm really glad that the shooter wasn't a minority.\" And I thought to myself, what does that have to do with it? It's not about the race of the shooter. It's about the motivation of the shooter. And like Kimberly said, we don't know that motivation yet. And that's the key. And we're going to find out a lot within the next couple days. I'm not personally ready to rule out a terror angle. I'm just not. I know the federal officials have said no, but I think there's a lot more information out there. I'm also willing to accept the fact, if it comes out there, that this guy might just be deranged, and he could have a personal issue. Could have flipped and could have gone nuts. His father was a criminal. Who knows? It could have been as simple as that. Either way, we don't know as much as we need to know before speculating."

      "utterance": "Well, I think it's reasonable, after -- after one of these incidents for people to say, \"How can we prevent this from ever happening again.\" But we don't even know what happened. Sound familiar? So that's why I think, like, waiting for just a moment to find out. Because what if it turned out that there were some sort of ISIS connection? And that takes the NRA piece off the table. So obviously, this is a huge tragedy. We will continue to have a gun control debate in this country, and there might be persuadable people. If they could show some specific ways that they think it could actually be prevented, maybe that could be brought to the voters and we could all decide."

So if you want to talk about gun violence, you're going to have to -- we're going to have to talk about that, as well. I wanted -- you know, I talked to a couple of really smart people. Jennifer Hesterman brings up a really good point about all of these attacks are happening towards the end of an event. Whether it's Arianna Grande, the Bastille Day parade. You've got to know your -- she says you've got to know your exits and have a plan. Because we don't -- we always think about it. We're always looking inside an event. We're not looking outside an event. But there's an interesting thing. Yesterday Scott Adams did a video talking about how they were going to be no more outdoor events because of the advent of drones, the idea that you can attack from above. What this was was a drone attack. This was the first drone attack on an audience. Because you're above going down."
