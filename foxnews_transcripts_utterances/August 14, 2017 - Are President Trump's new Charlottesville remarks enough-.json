You denounce them specifically, and then you do it again and again and again, and then you do it one more time for good measure. That's what presidential leadership would have looked like in this moment. And we didn't have it. You had it for many members of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats.

We know what it looks like when he wants to condemn somebody. He's done it to journalists. He's done it to his political foes. He's done it to the media. He does it repeatedly. He did it again today to the CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier, when he resigned from the president's manufacturing council. The fact that he didn't do it for two days suggests that it wasn't an accident.

Good evening to all of you. Steve, would you like to begin tonight? Where are we on this story?"

      "speaker": "STEVE HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD",
      "utterance": "Look, the president's silence over the first two days of this controversy said a lot more than his words earlier today. Whenever you have white supremacists and neo- Nazis holding hate rallies that lead to violence and eventually committing acts of domestic terrorism, you denounce them harshly. You denounce them specifically, and then you do it again and again and again, and then you do it one more time for good measure. That's what presidential leadership would have looked like in this moment. And we didn't have it. You had it for many members of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats. Tom Cotton called out white supremacists specifically, said that what they were preaching was anathema to the United States and its founding and its history. The problem I think for President Trump beyond this missed opportunity and great moral failure, is that we know what it looks like when Donald Trump wants to call somebody out. We know what it looks like when he wants to condemn somebody. He's done it to journalists. He's done it to his political foes. He's done it to the media. He does it repeatedly. He did it again today to the CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier, when he resigned from the president's manufacturing council. The fact that he didn't do it for two days suggests that it wasn't an accident. So it's disappointing that the president would do this, but it's not surprising."

And then today he comes out and he explicitly condemns racism. He calls on Americans to love one another. He mentions the victims by name. And still everyone the media took issue with it. If you are doing that, you are sort of just predisposed to have a problem with what Donald Trump --"

      "utterance": "That's total nonsense. That's absolutely nonsense. The president didn't make a specific condemnation of these groups. He had done it before. This is what happened with the David Duke episode back in March of 2016 when he gave a grudging disavowal and then he was offered an opportunity to give a real disavowal. He refused three different times to do it. Then he lied about why he did. You can make it about the media if you want to but at some point it's got to be about the president."

      "utterance": "This is not a media story. This is a presidential story. What is shocking is that the president of the United States did not have the instinctive, reflexive, automatic response you would expect of any American leader and what we saw across the spectrum in American leadership and among the populace in being utterly revolted by these rightwing, white supremacists, neo-Nazi groups. And if the president did not do what was absolutely natural, that's what makes it a story. The fact that he said, oh, yes, and then he added, in his statement on Saturday he adlibbed \"on many sides.\" And he repeated it, \"on many sides.\" Where did that come from? Yes, of course, there is a denunciation to be had of the left, but this was begun by, instigated by, created by neo- Nazis, KKK, and white supremacists. They were the ones who created the beginning of this incident. And one of them is the one who killed a woman, injured a lot of others. It seems to me you start by denouncing what is obvious. And the fact that the president did not, had to do it to days later, is simply stunning. I'm not begrudging him that he said it now, but I remember in the campaign he used to mock his other candidates, his competitors, for reading from a prompter. He had to read from a prompter the name of these groups rather than spontaneously answering on his own on Saturday when he was on his own."

People are taking -- they are not listening to what Donald Trump actually set on Saturday, and they are not reading the actual full comments he gave where he was explicitly denouncing bigotry and violence, where he called on people to come together. And the fact is that there actually is a violence problem on both the left and the right. In recent years Americans have seen violent protests everywhere from Portland, Berkeley, Ferguson, Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, Brooklyn, Baltimore. All throughout the country people have experienced these violent protests. There was an assassination attempt on Republicans by a totally mainstream progressive leftist activists, and there is a problem on all sides. And people need to come together and denounce all those things and not tar the entire Democratic Party as being part of the leftist violence, not tar the entire Republican Party as being part of the rightist violence."
