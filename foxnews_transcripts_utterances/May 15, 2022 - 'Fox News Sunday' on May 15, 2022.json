Really the question should be asked, why were the tribes fighting the state of Oklahoma to protect Native victims in the U.S. Supreme Court Castro-Huerta, we just got before -- argued before the Supreme Court? The tribes fought the state from trying to protect and prosecute a bad guy that wasn't even native to protect the Native victims. So again, we're for law and order in eastern Oklahoma.

And yet, Obama at the time was telling the American people, don't worry about it, we're going to vet everyone. And what we were watching as Americans was very unnerving. And I'm sure the people will remember that. We were looking at the Pulse nightclub shooting. We were watching people take vehicles, weaponize them, and run people down in the street. We were looking at the San Bernadino shooting. We were looking at some very unnerving things that as Americans we thought would never happen here. And at that time, I was hosting a show called \"Truth Exchange,\" and I would have all kind of ideas, and was leaning into helping the public begin to have those conversations. And so those are some of the -- that's the context around a lot of those tweets. The overwhelming majority of the tweets that are now being presented are not even full thoughts. They're not even full sentences. And yet, people take it and they begin to build their own narrative around it. So I can't provide a lot of context because, again, it's almost 10 years ago. That's how far they have to go back to try to find anything on me. What I can say -- although I can't provide a lot of context to that because it's a half thought and everything is not there for me to be able to speak to it. What I can say is that I love my country. And I have always loved my country. And I have always been willing not to blink in the face of difficult discussions. We're facing a lot of difficult discussions. And on those 1,500 miles traveling all around the commonwealth, people feel squeezed and no one is asking me about my tweets. What they're talking about are the illegal immigration, we're on track for 4 million unlawfully present people this year alone. They're talking about inflation. I had someone call me the other day saying they're driving over an hour because they heard a rumor about baby formula milk.

This is a photo of the suspected gunman now given to us just last night by police. Buffalo police say they've identified the gunman as 18-year-old Payton Gendron. Just hours after that shooting, the teen was arraigned on first degree murder charges. Investigators say he drove more than three hours from his small rural hometown down state to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in Buffalo's history. Now, the shooting happened around 2:30 Saturday afternoon at this Tops Grocery Store in Buffalo. You can see that crime scene there. First, police say Gendron shot three people in the parking lot and then 10 more inside. Officers say he was armed with an assault rifle and dressed in tactical gear from head to toe.

So, let's talk about another law that you signed much like in you're your neighboring state Texas has done, allows for private causes of action for anyone who attempts, completes or facilitates an abortion. This could be including someone who pays for one after a heartbeat is detected, roughly six weeks. We've got brand new FOX News polling on this and how people feel about at that six-week mark. About 50 percent they say at six weeks abortion should remain legal. Now, your law as I understand, it has no exemptions for rape or incest. And the argument is a victim may not know at six weeks that she is pregnant. So, what do you say to a woman who finds herself in that situation, lives in your state and feels like she's got no options?"

But you have to choose -- that is a human being inside the womb. And we're going to -- we're going to do everything we can to protect life and love both the mother and the child. And we don't think that killing one to protect another is the right thing to do either. And our heart is super compassionate about that. We want the churches, we want all the services, the state, the nonprofits to come around with adoption services and that is -- that's super, super hard. And we're going to do everything we can to help them. But aborting that child, we don't think, is the right thing to do."

      "speaker": "BREAM",

So, in Oklahoma, to look at the stats of what a woman is facing there with a child, 21.3 percent of children live below the poverty line, 71 percent of SNAP participants are in families with children, and Oklahoma ranked 42nd overall in child wellbeing. A \"Washington Post\" opinion headline puts it this way: The GOP roars about abortion. Then they abandon the children. So what is the plan in Oklahoma to help women if you're advising them to carry through on these pregnancies when they are up against some real challenges?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STITT",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, here's the deal. Is the answer to the socialist Democrat left to abort poor kids? I mean, that's just ridiculous to even kind of quote those types of stats. We have a free market in Oklahoma. We believe that God has a special plan for every single life and every single child, and we want everybody to have the same opportunities in Oklahoma. And aborting a child is not the right answer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "I want to ask you how this may tie in with a recent Supreme Court decision. The McGirt decision from 2020 says, basically, crimes that are committed that take place on a reservation. They will be -- by Native Americans. They're going to face prosecution in a tribal or federal court. It's not going to be something that the state can prosecute. Now there are questions about, do you think there would be doctors who would say, well, we can get around these state laws, we can perform abortions on reservations. People can come to us if that's the care they want to seek."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STITT",
      "utterance": "Well, that's something that a lot of Oklahomans, we've heard the rumblings as well. You know, the tribes in Oklahoma are super liberal. They go to Washington, D.C. They talk to President Biden at the White House. They kind of adopt those strategies. So, yeah, we think that there's a possibility that some tribes may try to set up abortion on demand. They think that you can be 1/1,000th tribal member and not have to follow the state law. And so, that's something that we're watching. But I'll tell you this, Oklahomans will not take -- will not think very well of that if the tribes try to start up abortion clinics, abortion on demand in eastern Oklahoma because the expansion of tribal lands includes the city of Tulsa now which is a million person MSA."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "I want to talk further of this issue of the tribal lands, the separation there. Nearly half of all Oklahoma land, at least big swaths of it, are part of a reservation. You vetoed a bill that would have required the state to recognize tribal convictions in the same way it acts upon convictions from, say, state municipal courts. It had 96 percent support from your legislature."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes said this",
      "utterance": "It's unfortunate that governor vetoed the public safety bill. We welcome opportunities to collaborate and work together. Our governor continues to be uncooperative and unwilling. So I want to give you a chance to explain why you vetoed that and what's going on there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STITT",
      "utterance": "Yeah, first off, that wasn't a bill that I requested. That wasn't a bill that the Department of Public safety requested. That was a tribal bill that they were trying to get across the finish line, and it didn't reciprocate. They were wanting the state of Oklahoma to accept all tribal convictions whether they had jurisdiction or not, but it wasn't reciprocated. They weren't willing to take on the state side as well. And so, we're not going to expand tribal jurisdiction in the state of Oklahoma. We want to have an honest conversation. Really the question should be asked, why were the tribes fighting the state of Oklahoma to protect Native victims in the U.S. Supreme Court Castro-Huerta, we just got before -- argued before the Supreme Court? The tribes fought the state from trying to protect and prosecute a bad guy that wasn't even native to protect the Native victims. So again, we're for law and order in eastern Oklahoma. They're trying to confuse the situation. Oklahomans want to protect and we want to be able to prosecute the crimes in eastern Oklahoma and right now, they're telling us we don't have that right."

For the government to insert itself in that conversation between a doctor and a woman, a faith leader and a woman, is simply wrong. I think we need to approach this a different way. I think there's a lot of common ground around reducing unwanted pregnancies, empowering women and men with birth control. And really generating a culture of responsibility about what it means to be a parent."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",

Let's talk about that because when \"AP\" polls specifically by trimester frameworks, and they asked people, should it be legal or illegal -- at 80 percent, when we get into the third trimester, people say it should usually be illegal. Even \"The New York Times\" noted in an article updated this May, the United States is one of over a dozen countries that allows abortions for any reason beyond 15 weeks of pregnancy. \"The Times\" goes on to note that includes North Korea and China. Is that the company that Coloradans wants to be in?"

When you know that, you know, you might be near birth and you find out your baby doesn't have lungs and won't live for more than a few minutes outside of the womb -- I mean, this is a really difficult thing that women face. And the right answer is, of course, to make sure that we trust people to make that decision and people have the freedom to do that. We don't say big governments are going to insert itself and tell them how to handle something that sadly really doesn't have a right answer."

It's in the realm of how women understand that there's options. And, by the way, that includes adoption. We implemented free preschool in Colorado. We're making daycare more affordable. We want to make sure that people know about these things. And, of course, we want to make sure that we can increase access to birth control and -- for both men and women, and really build that culture of responsibility and also, understanding the importance of consent for both men and women to help reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies."

I want to take a look at some of the numbers that you're dealing with out there. Food prices up over 9 percent, utilities up over 17, and housing about 8 percent.

So any context then for those particular tweets?"

    {
      "speaker": "BARNETTE",
      "utterance": "Yes, let me just say in almost all of those tweets, you know, especially when you look at the time frame we were living in at that particular time, we had the Obama administration bringing in a lot of Syrian refugees at that time. I was watching the former FBI director, James Comey, testify, I believe, in front of the Senate, saying we can vet until the cows come home and we won't know who these people are. And yet, Obama at the time was telling the American people, don't worry about it, we're going to vet everyone. And what we were watching as Americans was very unnerving. And I'm sure the people will remember that. We were looking at the Pulse nightclub shooting. We were watching people take vehicles, weaponize them, and run people down in the street. We were looking at the San Bernadino shooting. We were looking at some very unnerving things that as Americans we thought would never happen here. And at that time, I was hosting a show called \"Truth Exchange,\" and I would have all kind of ideas, and was leaning into helping the public begin to have those conversations. And so those are some of the -- that's the context around a lot of those tweets. The overwhelming majority of the tweets that are now being presented are not even full thoughts. They're not even full sentences. And yet, people take it and they begin to build their own narrative around it. So I can't provide a lot of context because, again, it's almost 10 years ago. That's how far they have to go back to try to find anything on me. What I can say -- although I can't provide a lot of context to that because it's a half thought and everything is not there for me to be able to speak to it. What I can say is that I love my country. And I have always loved my country. And I have always been willing not to blink in the face of difficult discussions. We're facing a lot of difficult discussions. And on those 1,500 miles traveling all around the commonwealth, people feel squeezed and no one is asking me about my tweets. What they're talking about are the illegal immigration, we're on track for 4 million unlawfully present people this year alone. They're talking about inflation. I had someone call me the other day saying they're driving over an hour because they heard a rumor about baby formula milk. We have some very real issues and that is what -- that is the reason why I'm surging and doing so well is because throughout this entire time I've kept the main thing the main thing and that's Pennsylvanians."

You know, so Democrats have their own issues and I truly believe that as we continue to move throughout this year, the American people, and specifically Pennsylvanians, are going to again begin to prioritize their -- their kitchen table issues above a lot of the other noise that we're hearing right now. People are unnerved. People are just afraid. They -- I think most people know something has gone fundamentally wrong with how our nation is being governed. And while my two primary opponents were spending $60 million attacking themselves, refusing to go to the base, we had seven debates and Mehmet Oz and David McCormick only showed up to two. We had a number of forums and I can only recall them showing up to two. And then while they were attacking one another on television, I was out here with the people. We spent less than $2 million and they're mad. They're mad because I didn't ask for permission to be in this space. I just walked in because this is my country. And our country is in trouble.

And so where you have a lot of concern about our institutions, which is a good thing to have, this sort of blithe disregard for a real attack on an entire branch of government trying to work through a very complicated issue is not -- is not good for the country."

It says \"whoever with the intent to interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge in the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near a building or residence occupied, or used by such judge, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year or both.\" So, Mo, why isn't the Justice Department getting involved? They get involved in a lot of things but don't seem too interested this time."

I will say politically I'm against these protests outside of their homes for a number of reasons. One, I just think it's wrong. Number two, I just think it is not going to be successful, right? They're not going to sway any justice. But number three, we spent the last couple of minutes talking about the protests outside of justices' homes instead of talking about the content, instead of talking about the real threat to Roe v. Wade. And if -- and as a supporter of having access to abortion, of Roe v. Wade, I'd much rather be having this conversation than whether or not we are protesting -- where we are protesting."

      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, so Senate Democrats this week tried to pass something that they kept calling it -- it kept being entitled the codification of Roe v. Wade, but many people think it was far beyond that. The World News Group has a piece entitled \"More Radical than Roe,\" said the proposed law was much more extreme that: abortion on demand for any reason and at any point up until birth. For the first time in our nation's history, Schumer's law would have done away with religious liberty protections for medical providers who object to performing abortions on religious or conscience grounds. It would have also allowed for sex-selective abortions. So even pro-choice Republicans, and they were joined by Joe Manchin, said they cannot go that far."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Right. I think that the Senate bill was actually appalling. It goes far beyond anything that really approaches just codifying Roe. A few senators were asked questions about that on the Democratic side. And Mazie Hirono of Hawaii said, let's not get bogged down in the details. Well, the details actually matter quite a lot and the details were disgusting. They're actually quite similar to the bill just recently signed into law by Governor Polis, your guest earlier in the program. He was sort of dancing around your question."

      "utterance": "What it actually is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Right. The answer was yes, unfortunately. But he didn't really want to spell that out. He did say that this issue, abortion, should come down to the hearts and minds of women, not the laws of men. Well, he's a male governor who signed a bill into law that, according to a new YouGov poll, flies in the face of 65 percent of what American women believe on this question. So I think that you saw, in these two governors on the program today, very different approaches that represent in each case a pretty small segment of the American electorate and sort of public opinion, whereas many other people, there's a messy middle here on a lot of these issues, that doesn't really seem to be getting a lot of attention from some of the loudest voices."

      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So, Catherine, how does the White House then assess this? The president is upside-down on almost every issue that we poll on. The Democrats really need something to rally around for the midterms. Do they feel like this is it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CATHERINE LUCEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly Democrats do think that this is potentially a galvanizing issue. They think this motivates women voters, some of those key groups that they think are important, you know, in some of these tough districts in the fall. You know, suburban women. But they are now hoping that this will help, you know, bring people out, you know, get people energized in an election that is looking very, very challenging for Democrats. The president's numbers are really low. People are frustrated by inflation. They're frustrated now about, you know, the shortages of baby formula, for example, which is a real issue for parents. The question is how much this does. You know, what I've heard from a lot of analysts and from pollsters is that Democrats still need an economic message. They need an economic message. They need to be able to talk to people about inflation. They need to be able to show that they're doing things on this. But people do think that this could help on the margins."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, and to the economy, seven in 10 Americans told Pew Research, in a poll released this week, inflation is, quote, \"a very big problem for the country today.\" Mo, as we talked about, I mean, the president is upside-down. Democrats are upside-down on these things. And people vote with their wallets. Do you think it's salvageable, the midterms, this issue with the economy?"

      "utterance": "This is actually a fairly messy election season, I think. And there's so many unknowns that are still coming in, right? How does Roe v. Wade play into this? How does any number of issues play into this? How does yesterday's tragic shooting in Buffalo and the issues that come from that change sort of our collective thinking? Having said all that, yes, inflation is a big problem. It is going to be the number one issue. And that's why you see the president out there over the past week being much more assertive and aggressive in talking about the issue and trying to, number one, say here's what Democrats and my administration are going to try to do; and number two, increasingly drawing a contrast with Republicans, increasingly drawing a contrast with how Senator Rick Scott's tax plan will negatively impact people."

      "utterance": "Right. But you're seeing them start to try to draw a contrast between the two sides. And look, they're even beginning to see how they can try to connect the economic argument to issues like Roe v. Wade. You brought up some great statistics in your interview with the governor of Oklahoma a little while ago. He didn't seem -- he seemed to be caught a little flatfooted by some of those, economic impact of some issues. So I think you're going to see Democrats lean into it a lot more, but they're -- they're facing some serious headwind in..."

      "utterance": "Well, also, I think one of the challenges for the White House, right, is they're trying to, as Mo said, create a choice for voters, say, look, it's us versus the Republicans, here's what Republicans would do. Republicans will raise taxes. But it's typically very, very hard to shift a midterm election from what is a referendum on the party in power."

      "utterance": "Yes. And also, you know, with inflation in particular, you know, the White House also denied that that was a problem for a very long time and tried to -- tried to pretend it away. And the fact that they are grasping at something like Roe v. Wade, I think, also underscores just how desperate they are for an issue that, as you point out, galvanizes things. But go back to something that Mo said I think is very interesting talking about, you know, how you would rather be talking about Roe v. Wade. Well, you know, I'm on the opposite side of this issue. I would rather be talking about the issue as well. And that's really what the beauty of -- if this does, in fact, get overturned, it puts this out for a debate so that..."
