      "utterance": "Good evening, I'm Pete Hegseth in for Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” live from New York City tonight. There's breaking news tonight from the White House. President Trump just announced moments ago that the U.S. has reached an agreement with Mexico to stop the invasion -- it is an invasion -- of illegal immigrants and avoid new tariffs. A live report from D.C. is straight ahead. Plus, you saw it here first last night, President Trump firing back at Nancy Pelosi saying she wants him in prison. Now, even the liberal media thinks she is out of line and they are right. And exclusive new details on the investigation into the investigators who spied on the Trump campaign. Congressman Sean Duffy is here to respond. And Joe Biden flip-flops again on controversial legislation while another Democrat fanatic says the Hyde Amendment is an assault on African-American women. Horace Cooper and Leo Terrell are here to debate that. Then exclusively, a college student suspended indefinitely for posing with a gun. She will tell “The Ingraham Angle” her story tonight. But first, the war of words between President Trump and Nancy Pelosi heating up as she calls for him to be imprisoned. The House Speaker reportedly telling her caucus and I quote, \"I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.\" Laura Ingraham spoke exclusively to President Trump in Normandy yesterday. He is how he responded to those ridiculous claims."

    {
      "speaker": "LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST",
      "utterance": "We passed Nancy Pelosi as we were walking up to the stage earlier. She said some pretty harsh things over the last 24 hours, leaked out from her caucus. She said, \"I don't want impeachment, I want him in prison.\" Meaning you, how do you work with someone like that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "I think she's a disgrace. I actually don't think she is a talented person. I've tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done. She is in incapable of doing deals. She is a nasty, vindictive, horrible person. The Mueller report came out. It was a disaster for them. They thought their good friend, Bobby Mueller was going to give them a great report and he came out with a report with 13 horrible angry Democrats who were totally biased against me, a couple of them worked for Hillary Clinton. They then added five more also Democrats. With all of that, two and a half years. Think of it. From before I even got elected, they've been going after me and they have nothing."
    },

      "utterance": "Oh boy. Joining me now, Congressman Sean Duffy and Shane Harris, a Democratic strategist and President of People's Alliance for Justice. Good evening to you both. Thanks for being here. Sean, I'll start with you. It's pretty shocking to see the liberal media admit that Nancy might be a bit off her rocker on this one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. SEAN DUFFY, R-WIS.",
      "utterance": "A little bit of truth coming from the liberal media. That's right, Pete. But I mean, listen, Nancy Pelosi is not crazy. Nancy Pelosi has thrown out some harsh words about sending Donald Trump to prison and what she is trying to do is derail the effort by the liberals, radicals, the socialists and the Democratic Party to actually impeach him. So Nancy Pelosi understands. In 2010, she passed Obamacare. America hated it. It rose our healthcare prices. Didn't do what they promised it would do and she lost the majority. She sees now that she is back in the majority, if they go forward with impeachment, they're going to lose the majority again. She would be the first Speaker to lose the majority twice and so she is trying to say, \"Hey, we'll talk about prison, but let's not do impeachment.\" She is crafty and smart trying to derail the impeachment caucus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "No, she is certainly caught between two sides of her party. Shane, I want to play a little bit of sound of one of Sean's colleagues, Doug Collins from Georgia. He says there's some folks here who are blinded by rage. Take a listen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. DOUG COLLINS, R-GA",
      "utterance": "They're just so blinded by rage at what's going on with this administration that they're willing to make false accusation and that's where the American people, the breakdown in the honesty with Congress has got to get better. Democrats have gotten way over their skis and promising their base, their rabid bases who doesn't like the President that we're going to do these things. At the same time, they would much rather focus on this because they have no legislative agenda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",

      "speaker": "SHANE HARRIS, PRESIDENT, PEOPLE'S ALLIANCE FOR JUSTICE",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the deal and I glad we're having this conversation. You know, when I wake up in the morning, I eat a banana. You know this -- what is going on in this country is bananas. The reality that we're seeing the bickering back and forth is a real issue, but here's what I want to take a look at while we're talking about Nancy Pelosi and this whole push of this version of \"lock him up.\" Here's the deal. The President has proven time and time again that he is unfit to be President. I mean, he broke the law when -- with what he did with Stormy Daniels. That should mean jail time. He clearly broke the law when he began to deal with obstructing justice in the investigation -- the Mueller investigation. That should be jail time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "What law?"

      "speaker": "HARRIS",

      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Well, hold on, Shane, if he had been violating these laws --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRIS",
      "utterance": "Was taking on Hillary Clinton saying \"lock her up.\" He led the Lock Her Up Movement, and now he is mad because they are calling for him to be locked up? Come on, we've got to talk real here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Answer the Congressman's question though, if he broke all these laws then why is Nancy Pelosi so hesitant to actually proceed with impeachment so she ramps up the rhetoric."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRIS",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the thing, Nancy Pelosi is actually very smart. She knows how to play strategic. She is not going to go straight in for this or for that. She is going to be very strategic about her approach and she has always been that way. So to ask and I get what the Congressman is saying, but to ask the question about why is she just now trying to get on this is because she is strategic. She didn't just jump to impeachment when others would. She didn't just do this or do that because others would. She is very strategic. She stands on her own two shoe. She is a strong woman and she knows exactly where to pull the strings at. Clearly, this President is bothered."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Hey, Shane, what I think is bananas is the fact that the Democrats craft a fake dossier and start a fake investigation on Donald Trump and then they claim he obstructed their fake investigation and by the way, he didn't obstruct the investigation. Robert Mueller said that he got complete compliance from Donald Trump. Don McGahn, the chief legal counsel ..."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Actually testified for more than 30 hours. So your real claim is, he attempted to obstruct a fake investigation, but he didn't obstruct the investigation. And Pete, you mentioned this, we have to go back, you know, how did this crazy investigation start? And we're going to find that out and I think you're going to see Democrats running for the hills and wish they would have gone down this road because -- for two years of craziness."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Hold on, Shane, if you're all about true justice -- if you're all about getting to the truth and justice, are you equally concerned as to Sean's point of the origins of this? That may be our own institutions took a lot of latitude in investigating a presidential candidate?"

      "utterance": "Why not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRIS",
      "utterance": "Because the reality is that this President showed real concerns coming into his campaign. Forget when he became President. In this campaign, there was lots of things that have happened. Also, let us be reminded that under the Obama administration, not one indictment in that administration. Under this administration, multiple indictments while the Mueller investigations went on. So clearly there's something wrong. Clearly, there's something wrong with what is going on. And clearly there was a real call to action around this investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "You want to talk about Russian, and this has been litigated so much on Fox and other networks, but the only Russia collusion we saw was with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party with Russian operatives from Russia to craft the dossier and start the fake investigation. We should look at that. It's mindboggling that Mueller didn't actually do that part of the investigation with Russia. How about Hillary Clinton and Democrats?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Well, he ignored that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "They didn't look at it, and so when you hate it, when you hate Donald Trump so much, you do get blinded by the rage and Pete, from where I come from, I'm from Wisconsin, I know you are from Minnesota, this economy has never been better. People love Donald Trump because he wakes up every day and says \"I'm going to fight for you, make your economy stronger, your opportunity greater, your wages rise,\" and they go I might not love every tweet, I might not love every fight that he might get in, but I love what he is doing from me and my family. My kids graduate from school and they get a job. They move out of my basement. They pay their student loans back. It couldn't be better for me and my family all across America and that's if you're out of the bubble."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Even the talk, Shane, without impeachment is not necessarily advancing the ball for Democrats, but gentlemen, standby. On another note, don't forget there are three separate investigations right now on how the Russia investigation began in the first place including the one by U.S. Attorney John Durham who is investigating corrupt former Intel leaders. Chief intelligence correspondent, Catherine Herridge has exclusive new details on that from Washington tonight -- Catherine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Pete, the investigation into the investigators is accelerating. Sources within the Justice Department confirming to Fox News that U.S. Attorney John Durham has been meeting with Attorney General William Barr on multiple occasions in recent weeks. Separately, sources tell Fox News, Durham is quote, \"very dialed in and asking all the right questions\" about alleged surveillance abuse in 2016 and how a surveillance warrant was obtained for Trump campaign aide, Carter Page. That surveillance application relied heavily on the DNC Clinton campaign funded dossier which was unverified, though it's author, former British spy Christopher Steele was well known to the FBI from other investigations. The heavily redacted public record suggests the surveillance application did not rely on a so-called mosaic of Intelligence involving multiple streams of information from independent sources as former FBI officials have claimed. In a recent CBS interview, the Attorney General said there is a significant disconnect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "In fact, I have probably more questions and that some of the facts that I've learned don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "Before the midterms, Republicans who controlled key House committees tried to tee up potential targets for future investigations. Lawmakers point to discrepancies over the handling of the dossier between Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the opposition research and Justice Department official Bruce Ohr or his wife Nellie who also worked for Simpson. Last month, Republican congressman Mark Meadows made a criminal referral for Nellie Ohr over other discrepancies. Durham would handle any prosecution of criminal acts if he uncovers them -- Pete."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Catherine, thank you very much. Well, back now to respond Congressman Sean Duffy and Shane Harris. Shane, you heard that report from Catherine. She is a fantastic reporter getting to the bottom of this. We're hearing that Durham is dialed in, met with Barr multiple times. Now, do you dismiss all of these investigations that are following through on where this came from? You seem to before. If they find things, are you going to dismiss all of that as well?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRIS",
      "utterance": "You know, I do because I think again, I think that we have to be real here about how all of this began and --"

      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "This is being real."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRIS",
      "utterance": "There's clear -- we have to be real because there's real clarity in how all this began. There's been real issues from 2016, clearly showing that this President has been interested in hiding the truth from the American people rather than bringing it forth and I think that you know, again it's very important that this continues."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Sean, they worked with Bob Mueller, the White House Counsel against most people's counsel spent almost 30 hours with that investigation, yet Mueller didn't look into the FISA process which Durham and Barr and others now are. Do you think this means they'll actually finally get to the beginning?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "I think it does, Pete and you know, the bottom line is, this reeks too high heaven. I was a former prosecutor and to think that an investigation where we're using tools that we reserve for people like terrorists were used against the Donald Trump campaign, this reeks to high heaven. And so I'm going to sit back and wait for that report to come out or those three reports to come out and I'm going to take those reports on face value, just like Democrats should have taken the Mueller report on face value, but I think there's going to be a lot of meat on that bone and there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be held to account inside the Obama administration for breaking rules and potentially breaking laws."

      "utterance": "What oversight are they refusing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "We have separation of powers, so the President doesn't have to send his people over to the Congress to testify. There was a two-year investigation, Shane, and you think that a few panels for three-hour hearings inside the Congress are going to do better than Bob Mueller? Because I heard you and liberals for two years say just wait for the Mueller report to come out. Bob Mueller is a sacred cow. He is a great investigator. He did his investigation. He found nothing, so what? Jerry Nadler is going to do better than Mueller?"
    },

      "utterance": "Nothing illegal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRIS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Hold on, guys. And then he basically handed it to Congress and Nancy Pelosi who thinks there's such an ironclad case that she is talking about locking him up instead of moving with impeachment hearings. If they had a close and shut case, Shane, it seems they might move with it. Congressman Duffy, Shane, thank you very much for the spirited debate this evening. We appreciate it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "They send in drugs, illegal drugs, $500 billion, a hundred thousand people are killed, dead every year from what comes through our southern border. They shouldn't be allowing people to come through their country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "When you're the piggy bank that everybody steals and robs from and they deceive you and they've -- like they've been doing for 25 years, tariffs are a beautiful thing. It's a beautiful word if you know how to use them properly. They're letting millions of people walk up through their country and they shouldn't let anybody walk up through their country. They send in $500 billion worth of drugs. They kill a hundred thousand people. They ruin a million families every year. If you look at that that's really an invasion without the guns."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "That was from last night and breaking tonight, it appears Trump's tough talk worked. Within the last hour, the White House announced the U.S. has reached an agreement with Mexico to stop the invasion of illegal immigrants crippling our southern border and suspend the impending new tariffs. Fox's Kristin Fisher is live in Washington tonight with the late-breaking details. Kristin, what do you have?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISTIN FISHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Pete tonight President Trump was successfully able to use the threat of tariffs to get Mexico to the negotiating table and commit to take several concrete steps to help reduce migrants from illegally entering the United States. He made the announcement as he often does on Twitter by saying quote, \"I am pleased to inform you that the United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico. The tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday against Mexico are hereby indefinitely suspended. Mexico in turn has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of migration through Mexico and to our southern border.\" So here's what Mexico has agreed to do. It will deploy National Guard troops to Mexico's southern border on Monday. That's the entry point for many of these Central American migrants. It will allow migrants awaiting conclusion of their U.S. asylum process to be sent to Mexico while they wait and it will provide job opportunities to those migrants. Mexico will also try to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations and if that doesn't work, Mexico will consider taking even more actions. In return, President Trump will not impose that five percent tariff on all Mexican goods which was set to go into effect on Monday. The deal came after three days of intense negotiations here in Washington and despite all of those concessions from the Mexican government, tonight, Mexico's Foreign Minister called the deal fair."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARCELO EBRARD, MEXICAN FOREIGN MINISTER",
      "utterance": "I think it's a fair balance because they have more drastic measures and proposals at the start and we reached some middle point. For instance, they accept to support the program that Mexico proposed in Central America. On the other hand, we accepted to have a more extended version of 235, and to accelerate the deployment of the National Guard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISHER",
      "utterance": "Now, remember President Trump has taken a lot of heat from Democrats and Republicans for threatening Mexico with these tariffs. The President has said that he likes to use these tariffs to negotiate with. So far, it has not worked with China, but Pete, tonight that strategy worked with Mexico."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Well said, Kristin, thank you very much for the latest information. Well, joining me now to react is Harmeet Dhillon, attorney and Trump 2020 Advisory Council member and Francisco Hernandez, immigration attorney. Thank you both. You and I are hearing these results in real-time. I've got the U.S.-Mexico joint declaration in front of me and you heard it, Mexican National Guard to their southern border. Migrants who are seeking adjudication for asylum sent back to Mexico. Mexico agrees with that. And the whole thing reviewed 90 days from now to see whether or not Mexico is actually fulfilling it. So Harmeet, when you look at this and you consider what America gave up, which is a tariff that never was imposed but was threatened, your reaction. HARMEET DHILLON, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY COUNCIL MEMBER: Well, tariffs are not the favored tool of most conservatives, Pete, however desperate times call for desperate measures and as we can see here, it worked and I think it is a great result for America and actually a pretty good result for Mexico as well. Because Mexico has actually been getting the benefit of allowing the current situation there, are a lot of remittances, some $40 billion going back to Mexico every year and it's not working. And so neighbors need to work out their disputes and now in addition to the terms that you mentioned, it's also going to include the National Guard actually fanning out throughout Mexico, interdicting gangs and smuggling rings and helping with that and also providing some support and even potentially jobs to the asylum seekers who are waiting for their applications to be processed in America. So I think it's going to be actually great for those people who are seeking to come to this country as well. They can be in a safe environment and be supported there in Mexico while America makes a rapid determination about whether they're eligible or not."

Are you surprised by this flip-flop? And what does it say about the modern Democratic Party? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Here is what it says. It's very hard for a vice president to get the nomination and get successfully elected. We're watching the extremist provisions or activists in this party influence what this potential nominee's positions might be. It didn't work with Al Gore, and it also is a problem when you are looking long term. You can go all the way back to 1988 or 1984 with Walter Mondale when he was the vice president, and the extremists then got him to contort his lifetime policies so that he embraced positions that took him out of the mainstream. This abortion position is an extreme one that he is embracing.

And they do that with actually relentless predictability.

Yes, we fought to help other countries, but that was not the right for which we actually fought.

The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That's when the United States got into the war. So they started it, we finished it. This had nothing to do with helping people, or preventing them from washing up on our shores. Immigration was simply not the issue at all. So there is kind of, almost a kind of silliness that's going on here. But I think that's what happens when you have like-minded people on a panel. There is no one to check anything that is said. And so a kind of foolishness sort of becomes the norm."

So now she is suing, claiming the suspension violated her Constitutional right. We reached out to the school but they have not yet responded. Dia'mon and her attorney, State Representative Cord Byrd, join me now. Thank you both for joining us. Dia'mon, thank you for joining us for your first interview. We appreciate it. So you were at the range with your fiance. Your cousin is a military veteran. He is taking you to the range to teach you how to shoot. Ultimately you post a photo on Facebook, and your school responds how?"

      "utterance": "They came and got me in the middle of finishing a test. And my assistant principal, she basically confronted me, and she said -- I really didn't know what she was coming to get me for. We walked down the sidewalk to the other principal, and she said you know things you do in the dark come to the light. And I'm like what are you talking about? She said you don't know what I'm talking about? I said, no, ma'am. We got to the other principal, and they basically told me that they were suspending me from school because of a picture that was posted on Facebook, not by me, but by my fiance, of us posing with guns."

Maybe pointing at the camera, which is not necessarily good protocol, is something that people reacted to. I'm not sure. But either way, where is her due process? What recourse does she have?"

      "utterance": "You hit the nail on the head, Pete. This was an instance where the school administration acted as judge, jury, and executioner, and didn't give her any due process. They didn't allow her to put the photograph in context. It was a playful picture. When you listen to the story it was her and her fiance, my Bonnie to my Clyde. So there was no threat made. There was no threat made against anyone. And the school overreacted. But that overreaction violated her Constitutional rights."
