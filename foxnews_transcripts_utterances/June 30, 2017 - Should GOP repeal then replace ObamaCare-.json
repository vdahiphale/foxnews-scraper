We are also told that three people have been shot. We've not confirmed that. I spoke to an individual who was here shortly after the shooting. He said that there were initial reports that one person was shot on the 16th floor of the hospital. That person somehow managed to make it to the ninth floor.

Our affiliate is reporting that he worked here until very recently at Bronx-Lebanon hospital in the Bronx. He recently lost his job. This may have been a work-related incident. But again, authorities have not said anything officially so far about a motive. We expect that in a few moments time, there is going to be a news conference. We're told that the mayor of the city of New York, Bill de Blasio is here as is the police commissioner. But worth emphasizing at this time is that a shooter has been killed, the hospital remains in lockdown, but the situation at this hour still under control. You can see all along the grand concourse which is a major roadway through the Bronx accommodating at least six lanes of traffic is completely, completely shut down. We are told that people were sheltering in place and just a few moments ago, many of them left the hospital breathing a sigh of relief. We expect to learn more in just a few moments.

This sounds really intense, and it is absolutely very important. But from a legal standpoint, it would likely prove to be anti-climactic because as politically motivated as it might have been, that would be nearly impossible to prove because the only legal standard for unmasking is that she needed to learn the name of U.S. citizens who were incidentally collected because it provided some foreign intelligence value. Now that's about as broad of a legal standard as our system allows, but the point is it's allowed. Therefore, absent proof that she actually lied to obtain the information or that she was actually the leaker of the names, her request to unmask the names of Mike Flynn and others was likely inappropriate, likely politically motivated, but not illegal.

It's something we've seen around the country, and now we've experienced here. A tragedy occurred in the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital. I want to say at the outset, thank God this was not an act of terrorism. It is an isolated incident. It appears to be a workplace-related matter. But that makes it no less tragic or no less horrible. One doctor is dead, and there are several doctors who are fighting for their lives right now amongst those who are wounded. As you know, the shooter killed himself but not before having done horrible damage. Our hearts go out to the family of the doctor who passed away. And we're, in both our hearts and prayers, standing in solidarity with the families of all those who were wounded and all those who are fighting for their lives right now. This was a horrific situation unfolding in the middle of a place that people associate with care and comfort, a situation that came out of nowhere. But even in the midst of this horror, there were many, many acts of heroism. I want to thank our first responders: the police officers from the 44 and 46 precincts and from our strategic response group who entered the building quickly, went toward the danger to protect the many, many hundreds of people who were in the building. The firefighters who arrived. This was not was not just an active shooter situation, but there was a fire that complicated matters, and our firefighters did an exceptional job addressing that situation immediately. And then, of course, all of the personnel at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, whose day went from normal to horrifying in a matter of seconds. The doctors, nurses, all of the personnel responded with extraordinary bravery. With cool professionalism, they protected each other; they protected their patients even amidst this horrible situation. I want to express to everyone at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital our profound thanks for all they did to handle this situation and to immediately respond to support their compatriots who were wounded. There will be an opportunity in the coming hours to provide more details of this incident. But at this point, there is a lot that we are piecing together. You will hear from the commissioner in a moment, but I want to say up front, there are many, many details that we're still putting together.

At this hour, there are reports that a gunman is now dead. Authorities say a gunman who began firing shortly around 3:00 is now dead. Not clear if he took his own life or if he was killed by police. We are also told that three people have been shot. We've not confirmed that. I spoke to an individual who was here shortly after the shooting. He said that there were initial reports that one person was shot on the 16th floor of the hospital. That person somehow managed to make it to the ninth floor. And that two additional people were shot, one on the eighth floor, one on the second floor. As for the shooter, our local affiliate is identifying him as Dr. Henry Bello. Our affiliate is reporting that he worked here until very recently at Bronx-Lebanon hospital in the Bronx. He recently lost his job. This may have been a work-related incident. But again, authorities have not said anything officially so far about a motive. We expect that in a few moments time, there is going to be a news conference. We're told that the mayor of the city of New York, Bill de Blasio is here as is the police commissioner. But worth emphasizing at this time is that a shooter has been killed, the hospital remains in lockdown, but the situation at this hour still under control. You can see all along the grand concourse which is a major roadway through the Bronx accommodating at least six lanes of traffic is completely, completely shut down. We are told that people were sheltering in place and just a few moments ago, many of them left the hospital breathing a sigh of relief. We expect to learn more in just a few moments. Back to you."

The odds of securing a new health care deal before everybody hightailed it out of D.C. for the fourth of July recess appeared to be fading. President Trump delivered his own health care surprise to senators today via twitter, he tweeted, quote, if Republicans senators are unable to pass but they're working on now they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date. The president had previously resisted that strategy. The White House responded this afternoon to whether President Trump was having a bit of a change of heart. Listen."

There'll be new insurance companies that are created. Do you think they're going to leave that money on the table? Twenty million people are going to be on the streets and die in this country? It will never happen. We're a nation of entrepreneurs, that's number one. Number two, putting it off isn't going to fix it. Do you think they'll just easily be able to slash taxes?

Explain to the American people we have to get rid of ObamaCare and ObamaCare lite, but we're going to have waiting periods, we're going to have rationing, and people with preconditioned pre-existing conditions and senior citizens they're the ones who are going to be hurt.

Because what you're talking about makes sense, whether you vote for it or you didn't. That's the mandate that they were elected on. Instead, what I see is a fish with another name. It's the same exact policy. In fact, in areas, I think it's going to be worse for certain parts of the country. And it's not exactly what they were put in the White House for, or the senate, or the GOP, or the congress, rather. So I guess this is my question. Wat about for those Americans that want to choose their doctor, that want to have health care they can afford, do that. For those that are dependent for whatever the reason on the government, just something that's catastrophic, it's a very kind of low economic price tag associated with it. And then there's two systems for those that can often and afford to do something private, they do that, and if you can't, you get catastrophic care."

And conservatives know this because things like -- hold on, let me finish, paying two insurance companies, they've have been previously arguing we're illegal according to the constitution.

What is out there for people if we take ObamaCare away? The world is out there for people. Opportunity, investment, all kind of things you cannot think about right now. They'll be insurance companies that propped up. Here's my question to everybody here, if I may. Why can't we choose our own health care?

Now again, whether that was Rice misspeaking or just plain lying, well, I'll leave that for you to decide. Now after -- to appear before a senate hearing to get to the bottom of these questions back in May. Rice has now agreed to testify before the house intel committee next month. And the all-important question will be did she break the law by unmasking Trump associates and her overall handling of classified information. This sounds really intense, and it is absolutely very important. But from a legal standpoint, it would likely prove to be anti-climactic because as politically motivated as it might have been, that would be nearly impossible to prove because the only legal standard for unmasking is that she needed to learn the name of U.S. citizens who were incidentally collected because it provided some foreign intelligence value. Now that's about as broad of a legal standard as our system allows, but the point is it's allowed. Therefore, absent proof that she actually lied to obtain the information or that she was actually the leaker of the names, her request to unmask the names of Mike Flynn and others was likely inappropriate, likely politically motivated, but not illegal. I'll turn to you, counsel, Mark Levin, how did I do?"

Most of the unmasking is done at the request of the FBI, so it's Mr. Comey who needs to testify about this, too. It's Mr. Clapper who needs to testify about this. Mr. Brennan. So the American people could know the point. The point of congress is not to, as you know, charge anybody with anything. It's trying to figure out what took place from a legislative perspective. Let's get those people in, let's get them under oath, let's find out about unmasking, let's find out about the whole thing because Mr. Nunes when he saw those documents he was stunned. By the way, Devin Nunes isn't some right wing coot. He's sort of a moderate traditional Republican from California. And when he saw this stuff, he was flipping out.

We need to take a look at the fact that the standard is so broad for these officials they can just go around collecting for whatever candidates they choose and say, oh, I needed that, I need that, too. I need that, too. And there's no consequence whatsoever. Just because it's somebody that's on their side now, it could be on our side -- I don't even know. I mean, of course, I'm not partisan.

So on the unmasking part, we can have her testify and point to the fact that she, Susan Rice, chose to unmask General Flynn when the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA said, no, he needs to stay masked. There's nothing about unmasking him that's going to make the country safer. There's a reason she did it, likely politically as you point out, and if that's OK with everyone, that's fine with me. But then she goes -- and you point out, she goes one step further and said, I didn't leak, and we're supposed to believe Susan Rice that she didn't leak when she lied -- I'm going to say it, Eboni. She lied about Benghazi. She was the one who went out on five different talk shows on September 25th and said it was a video that inspired Benghazi, and she knew very well, we know in hindsight now, that she was made well aware that it had nothing to do with the video and it was a terror attack.

But that makes it no less tragic or no less horrible. One doctor is dead, and there are several doctors who are fighting for their lives right now amongst those who are wounded.

And we're, in both our hearts and prayers, standing in solidarity with the families of all those who were wounded and all those who are fighting for their lives right now.

With cool professionalism, they protected each other; they protected their patients even amidst this horrible situation. I want to express to everyone at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital our profound thanks for all they did to handle this situation and to immediately respond to support their compatriots who were wounded. There will be an opportunity in the coming hours to provide more details of this incident. But at this point, there is a lot that we are piecing together.
