Are media commentators on the left being purely partisan in saying Trump pressured Ukraine's president by withholding military aid and are they largely downplaying questions about the conduct of Joe Biden and his son Hunter? Are media commentators on the right dismissing the rough transcript despite the fact that Trump repeatedly asked Ukraine's help in investigating the Bidens and the 2016 hacking of the Democrats? What about Trump accusing the fake news media of working with Democrats to exploit a \"nothing call?\" And will the saga so dominate the coverage for months that just about everything else will be blotted out? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" One week after the first report of a whistleblower's complaint in The Washington Post days after The Wall Street Journal described the controversial call in which President Trump asked Ukraine's leader about investigating Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dropped her opposition and announced an official impeachment inquiry.

I don't think it's something that is necessarily impeachable, but it's pretty clear the way the media is rooting for this one because they wanted to basically un-president him from the very beginning. I think there is a cry wolf scenario here that is a problem for the left and for the media because this seems like a legitimate story to me.

People get away from the simple fact and say, oh, it's the press's fault, even though from my perspective as someone who has a career as a reporter, you can't fault reporters for reporting the news.

They have lots of leaks and a lot of people are acting on self-interests and grudges. A lot of people in fact this week were pointing fingers even at John Bolton, the former national security adviser. That's inside base law but to your point, I don't think that you can hold The New York Times anything but accountable for this leak about who this man is because I do think that it is very dangerous and, again, I wonder why they did it."

So that doesn't surprise me that he says that, but you really sense the hostility building here between the president and the press at this point. I don't think there's anything you can do about that. The question about whether the whistleblower is a spy, again, this is a guy who has had his phone calls leaked, things going on in the office leaked by White House, it's really incredible what goes on in terms of his own staff not supporting him."

So let's get to the Biden part of this. Trump and his allies said that what Biden did is the real scandal, openly pressuring Ukraine, using federal money as leverage when he was vice president to fire a controversial prosecutor who had a case against Ukrainian oil giant that was paying big bucks to his son Hunter Biden, although Hunter Biden was not personally accused of wrongdoing.

And again, I don't think either one of those is exclusively true. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can say what the president did in this request is a problem. But also there are serious questions that Biden needs to answer. So far, he really has hunkered down and done nothing. When Trump is out there talking to the press constantly, Biden is not talking at all. I would like to know, for example, how does the point person for the Obama administration on Ukraine policy, the vice president of the United States, how does his son get hired by this gas company for 50 grand a month with no relevant expertise whatsoever?

I'm out there to prove it was something else going on, that the Democrats are really behind a lot of this collusion. And that's what he said he's doing. So, what do we do in the media? What's our role? Should we be listening to the defense attorney a little more closely? Should we be following on the things he's talking about a little more closely or should our attention just be turned on whatever the president did on the phone and whatever other collusion or corruption things involved the president and not what his so-called defense attorney wants him to do?"

Al Green, the congressman from Texas said it in his own words that we must impeach him in order to not have him get reelected. This is all political, it's all politics, that's what this is about."

And Nancy Pelosi as you remember, she is the one who had been holding the line, and now that she has been for it, there are over 218, they have 225 Democrats, that's the majority of the House that could bring the impeachment articles."

That is before we have one single fact, there was no quid pro quo, there was no pressure, there was no seven or eight times of Biden mentions. There was no withholding of anything. This is classic Democrats. Look, I want to know a little bit and I think this is where we're going to be headed which is who is this whistleblower? And are they on team Brennan, Clapper, and Comey? Were they part of the Peter Strzok insurance policy? Look, we have a lot of questions about this whistleblower and their credibility."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. I agree it's important and I also think that we're -- the president made the decision controversial in some quarters to put out the call, and we can all argue about it and that's why we have here to make the case. David Bossie, great to see you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Joining us now from New York with a very different point of view is Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic strategist who once worked for Bill Clinton. And Hank, the media are all in on this impeachment story to put it mildly but only a few journalists seems to be are asking about whether Nancy Pelosi jumping on this band wagon could backfire on her party, why is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANK SHEINKOPF, FORMER CLINTON-GORE CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT",
      "utterance": "Because it seems too logical that it won't. Look, it will, it's the timing is bad, it will take forever to get this accomplished. There'll be no trial in the Senate and the better way to have done this properly is they want to beat Donald Trump and pick up seats in the House would have frankly to wait and fight it out on the battlefield, that would have been much smarter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, Mitch McConnell did say the other that there would be trial in the Senate, but leaving that aside, if it would be much smarter, if the ultimate goal for the Democrats is to get the president out of office and if he looks vulnerable in the election or at least they think they can beat him, why are they driving the impeachment train, you know, given the seriousness of these allegations?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEINKOPF",
      "utterance": "The allegation is serious, and frankly, there is an internal battle within the party. There are people who want to see it happen now and they think they can win this battle before November and they'll give them a bump and try to take the Senate back. That's not necessarily the case. And frankly, you know, Americans have been pretty clear about the impact of foreign policy discussions of any kind in presidential elections and they haven't mattered much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, that's interesting because Nancy Pelosi said during all the months when she was resisting pressure from her progressive wing that impeachment can work if it's bipartisan. Well, it's not anymore bipartisan right now, President Trump has really high approval ratings among Republicans. So, shouldn't journalists ask wasn't she right in the first place, that one-party impeachment doesn't necessarily work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEINKOPF",
      "utterance": "Howie, that's really the question. They should ask that question and be very, very analytical about it. The fact is Nancy Pelosi was right, the Democrats are wrong overall and this -- whether it backfires or not is not the question but it won't provide what they want. What they want is Trump's removal, it's not likely to happen unless you win it by election, you can't do it any other way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What happens to any semblance if a Democratic in gender or any of the president -- and not that a lot was going on with the Hill but the president out there is saying now we can't do guns, we can't do infrastructure, we can't do a trade deal -- the coverage of that it seems to me will be utterly obliterated by impeachment, impeachment, impeachment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEINKOPF",
      "utterance": "That's the good news for the president, nothing gets accomplished and he gets to get into a battle. And you know, an era event where news has really become entertainment and gossip unfortunately. He wins that gossip and entertainment argument, he's highly entertaining, there's a tremendous amount of gossip here. Rudy Giuliani is the great defender of the president and he'll be very telegenic and create controversy. So, what is that do? It takes all eyes away from government and all eyes go to politics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Do I see embedded in your response there, suggestion that to the extent that television is performance art that the Democrats, most of them are kind of boring or at very at least can't compete with the Trump show?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEINKOPF",
      "utterance": "The Trump show is ongoing show, it seems to be rewritten every day, it's got new acts, it's kind of Ed Sullivan, whatever you expect will be there and will be there with intensity and he's done very well at the Democrats, well, they kind of believe that this is not about entertainment and there's something else going on and they're missing the point. Trump entertains, they bore."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. Glad you're not holding back. Now Hillary Clinton was on Jane Pauley this morning, CBS Sunday morning talking about the man who beat her, let's take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE",
      "utterance": "I believe he knows he's an illegitimate president. It's like applying for a job and getting 66 million letters of recommendation and losing to a corrupt human tornado."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Now Hillary has been off the media radar for some time, is it helpful to your side that she's out there denouncing Trump again?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEINKOPF",
      "utterance": "Listen, she's not going to get much ink and she won't get a lot of attention because you know, someone who was a news man for many, many years, she's old news and she's not much news, not important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Interesting by the way, Washington Post has story today saying the State Department is investigating dozens of current and former officials who sent messages to Hillary Clinton's private e-mail, some of which have been retroactively classified, state says this is routine, it took this long to get to it, others are raising questions about the timing. So, finally, Hank, you know, many media outlets say that the Trump-Ukraine call bringing up Biden is absolute outrage, dirty trick, it violates the Constitution, I mean, we are seeing some pretty heated rhetoric."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEINKOPF",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Could it be like the Russia investigation that much of the country simply isn't that exercised about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEINKOPF",
      "utterance": "They're not exercised about it because it doesn't -- it's hard to make sense if it's not a single-fact issue, it's complicated, it has shades, it has nuance. The most interesting to me though, is that, with the Manafort investigation, with all of these investigations, what we see is the more unseemingly side of political consulting and lobbying and consulting practices, generally overseas, that's not good news. What the president is trying to do is through Hillary all over again. Trump is -- excuse me, Biden is Hillary because Biden is corrupt. Well, let's see if that works."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You just called out your political consulting profession which shows you're being very candid. And thanks for the candid commentary. Hank Sheinkopf, great to have you on the show."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEINKOPF",
      "utterance": "My pleasure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Still to come, will coverage of the coming impeachment hearings wipe out just about everything else?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The press is obviously been busy chronicling the number of Democrats backing impeachment. And after Nancy Pelosi's announcement it soared past 218 more than half the house. But some pundits are also questioning the impact on her party. Joining us now from Charlottesville, Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Institute of Politics. Let me start with this, Larry, I have a strong feeling that much of the media, most of the media are excited about impeachment not just because they think it would vindicate all of the investigative reporting on Donald Trump but because it will a major boost to clicks and ratings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA",
      "utterance": "Well, that was certainly true during the Nixon impeachment hearings, it was certainly true during the Clinton impeachment process. Here's a little historical fact for you. The other impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868, of course they didn't have television back then."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Of course."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "But the hottest ticket in Washington was the seat in the gallery, I mean, this is just the way it is, it's a big story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, no clicks during the Nixon impeachment. It's pre- internet but certainly curing Clinton. So, in fact, Bill Clinton after the House impeached him and after the Senate acquitted him in the early 1990s, 73 percent approval rating because it was essentially a one-party impeachment. Are the media open to the possibility that this could all backfire on Pelosi and Democrats because if you look at polls, and I know you do, impeachment is not that popular with the overall electorate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "I think they will actually be led by polls not just their own but others that they see and as you know we have an awful lot of polling. If the public responds negatively they want to be with that because it's reflected in their ratings, so they may be reluctant about it but I think they will follow public opinion if that's what happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, it seems to me that, you know, by Pelosi authorizing because she was the one holding all of this back, Pelosi authorizing an impeachment inquiry, isn't she pretty much committed to having a vote and is it pretty obvious that any articles of impeachment would pass? Or you're suggesting that if the public really turns against this and the media starts to show skepticism that they might pull back and not actually carry through with the impeachment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Well, anything is possible at this early stage, I suspect they will impeach him. The key for Pelosi is whether she can get this over quickly, and she's trying, you know, I was surprised that they immediately said we're going to try to get this over by Thanksgiving in the house. We'll see. I bet that doesn't happen but that's what she said. If they don't get it over by February 3rd which is the start of the presidential voting in Iowa, they're going to be in deep trouble."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. I know some people say well, they are rushing it, and obviously they want to -- they have him -- they think like they have the momentum now. But you've led me to my next question, which is, even if it happens, if it's all wrapped before the Iowa caucuses, what would be the impact on the 2020 Democratic primary race of all this wall to wall coverage on impeachment, every possible forum, won't it consume with the exception of Joe Biden who obviously is a player in this, wouldn't it consume most of the available media oxygen from almost all these other candidates?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Yes, yes and yes. I mean, look, you've covered lots of stories simultaneously."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I like when the guests agreed with me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I like when the -- that's good."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I've known you for a long time, Howie, I don't want to argue you through the segment. But look, the essence of it is that the candidates are trying to get out their message on healthcare and gun control, fill in the blank, and there's only so much air time and also people are getting tired of the campaign. It always happens about this time. The same people are showing up for the most part on the debate stage for the once a month debate. So, I don't think they benefit from this, they'll only benefit from getting it over relatively quickly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. I mean, again, Biden is sort of an exception and he's got to play some defense here because of the attempt to turn the spotlight on him. But if you are, you know, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren, I mean, not that they won't get some coverage but, you know, less than half a minute it seems to me that they are just going to make fewer headlines."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "And what -- what is to distinguish them from one another? They're all going to endorse the impeachment, so, I guess, you know, you say well, one used more strident language than the other, who cares. They are all going to agree on this subject, they need to get back to whatever is motivating their personal campaign's base."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "That's what will either get them elected or defeated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Biden has been a little bit less pro-impeachment but certainly says it should be looked at. Larry Sabato, great to see you."
