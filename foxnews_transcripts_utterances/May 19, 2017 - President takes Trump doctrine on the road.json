      "sentences": "President Trump is currently en route to Saudi Arabia with the first lady Melania Trump, leaving the United States just hours ago to kick off his first overseas trip. The president is slated to meet with the Saudi king and other members of the Saudi royal family during his stop with combating terrorism expected to be a major focus. The president is also scheduled visit Israel including a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Then onto the Vatican which will include an audience with Pope Francis. In a stop in Belgium where President Trump is expected to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to NATO. And finally, President Trump will wrap up the 8-day trip attending the G-7 summit on the island of Sicily.  And with the president in the air, anonymous leakers are behind two fresh reports taking direct aim at President Trump. The New York Times is reporting that during his meeting with Russian officials last week, President Trump called former FBI director James Comey a, quote, real nut job. And that Comey's firing had relieved, quote, great pressure on him. Meanwhile, the Washington Post is reporting that a senior White House official is now a significant person of interest in the Russia probe. Don't forget, however, that both newspapers have had to walk back other recent reports about Comey and Russia, so it's really hard to know who to trust at this point. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The president is slated to meet with the Saudi king and other members of the Saudi royal family during his stop with combating terrorism expected to be a major focus. The president is also scheduled visit Israel including a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Then onto the Vatican which will include an audience with Pope Francis. In a stop in Belgium where President Trump is expected to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to NATO. And finally, President Trump will wrap up the 8-day trip attending the G-7 summit on the island of Sicily.  And with the president in the air, anonymous leakers are behind two fresh reports taking direct aim at President Trump. The New York Times is reporting that during his meeting with Russian officials last week, President Trump called former FBI director James Comey a, quote, real nut job. And that Comey's firing had relieved, quote, great pressure on him. Meanwhile, the Washington Post is reporting that a senior White House official is now a significant person of interest in the Russia probe. Don't forget, however, that both newspapers have had to walk back other recent reports about Comey and Russia, so it's really hard to know who to trust at this point."

And Spicer added as the president stated for thorough investigation will confirm that there was no -- this is the operative part here -- no collusion between the campaign and foreign entity. So they're staying on that, nonetheless the leaks continue to happen."

The timing though, you know, you wait until the president leaves for this 8 day trip, and now all of this comes out. I'm a little suspicious of it. But ultimately, I want to know more. I want to see the receipt. I know Vladimir Putin offered up to give us transcripts. I don't know how much we trust transcripts from Vladimir Putin. But, they would be interesting."

So he's going to do this trip that -- noteworthy that President Obama's first trip was to Egypt where he kind of apologized for American exceptionalism, whatnot. President Trump is out there saying we're going to fight terror and we're going to fight it with our allies and that's where he went. He went right to Israel. He's going right to Saudi Arabia. He's going right to Egypt. All of our strongest allies in the Middle East."

No more nation building, handing out lollipops, Democratizing, none of that stuff that they appreciate and they can't really handle. I mean, we prop up guys like el-Sisi these days, and that's the way to go. President Trump going to Saudi Arabia first to give a speech on Islam in front of Muslims who are receptive to him. I mean, it's amazing. A little bit like Tim Tebow giving address before the adult video awards to be quite honest with you."

They like him over there."

First of all, he's got to come to the point where he admits the western wall is a part of Israel. His administration has to say that. And secondly, of course, the rumors are that the intelligence leaked to the Russians came from an Israeli.  So there's a real trip later on in this trip becomes very important because all of the sudden the Jewish people who are excited about Trump because Obama was a -- all of the sudden now he's got to regain the trust of the Jewish people."

And this is the version of Trump that I like when he kind of change his mind a little bit on foreign policy where he's diplomatic and he's making an effort to go out across the aisle and talk to people. But do you think that this is going to be in the news as much because all this Russia stuff is in the news? I looked at Google search results, the amount of time people are searching Trump-Russia and it goes in spike. The highest spike was when that BuzzFeed thing came out, and then when the Flynn thing came out it spike again, but it was a little lower. And then, there's not a spike with the Comey firing, but it was a little lower. So it does seem like people might be losing interest in this story."

Because the only reason we've got competing narratives about whether Comey was fired because of Hillary's emails and the botched job, I agree with you Bernie on that, or was it because of the Russia investigation.  The only reason those are competing narratives, E, because the White House, you know, wasn't on one page."

Fox news, however, living up to fair and balanced motto 52 percent negative, 48 percent positive.

The new video showing Turkish President Recep Erdogan actually observing the brawl, and it's raising questions about whether or not he was involved in ordering it. Shortly before that fight starts, it appears that Erdogan gives instructions to a member of his team, who then speaks to another man, and then the fight starts just seconds later. Yes. It doesn't look good. He was just -- the fact that he was just watching it, like, \"Oh, that's cool. That's fine.\" You know what, buddy? That's not how we do things at our house."
