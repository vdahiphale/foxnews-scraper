Just last week he was tweeting that we need better relations with Russia and that people who were calling for him to confront Vladimir Putin on these poisonings or on election meddling in the United States or calling on him not to congratulate Vladimir Putin for a sham election, the president pushed back on that and said that these are people who don't want good relations with Russia, between the United States and Russia, and we are all better off if there are good relations with the United States Russia.
