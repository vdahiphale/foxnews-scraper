President Obama neither sought nor received permission from Congress, approval from Congress, to do this, which paved the way for the way Trump was able to roll it back. They have no one to blame --"

      "utterance": "Iran joins the long list of people in this world who did something very important, never dreaming that Donald Trump would ever become president of the United States. They made a calculation that the United States had made a strategic turn in its approach to the Middle East, that they were now going to sort of like mix into China, they were going to open to Iran, and that this would continue on a bipartisan basis where perhaps Hillary Clinton would be elected.
