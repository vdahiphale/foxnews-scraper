I'm glad you mentioned that, because, you know, coming into the summit, some newspapers, including The Times, described the president as a bit of a black sheep of the family because of his sort of cantankerous nature before coming here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so a lot of us are wondering, what might that family photo look like? Well, let me show you. OK, I will just say it this way. It looked fine on the surface, Neil. A lot of smiles that you would well imagine you would see in that sort of a photo. But it still makes you wonder. Beneath the surface, was there tension there? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Obviously, not a lot to draw from the picture itself. I did notice that Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, appeared to leave a little quickly, while the president and German Chancellor Angela Merkel pulled up the rear there. Now, the president did, by the way, speak to Macron, meet with the French president briefly. He has been highly critical of the president's push to level the playing field on trade. Now, before leaving for Washington -- or leaving Washington for Quebec, the president made this very clear. He has one word in mind when it comes to trade, and that's reciprocity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The largest demonstration of the day was expected to be here at the National Assembly. It was a small crowd. And just beyond us there, Neil, that's the entrance to the Old City. That's where many of the shop owners boarded up in anticipation of violence. And so far, fortunately, we haven't seen it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We can tell you there was an incident this morning where a group of protesters blocked a highway. There was a standoff with police in riot gear at that location. Some of them burned couches. There were chants and so on. Eventually, that crowd was dispersed after a couple of people were arrested. Last night, we were witness to a very large demonstration, or larger, perhaps 800 to 1,000 people who marched from a park about a mile- and-a-half over to this area next to the National Assembly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It was peaceful for the most part. A lot of chanting. Some of them were wearing masks or bandannas covering their faces. And then they did set fires or set off flares when they got to the street, and there were a couple of arrests last night as well, but, today, pretty calm. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Nothing like we saw here, Neil, in 2001 during the Summit of the Americas, when there were 30,000 to 50,000 demonstrators who did millions of dollars worth of damage and had violent clashes with police officers. I was here, witnessed them throwing bricks at officers, tearing up sidewalks, smashing windows, doing millions of dollars in damages. There were hundreds of arrests in 2001. But this time around, Neil, a much calmer scene so far, largely, it seems, in part, to the fact that the summit is actually 88 miles northeast of Quebec City.

It's more concerning, like you said, though, if he is talking about pardoning thousands of people. I don't have any issue with it, as a criminal defense attorney, because I actually have some names. And, President Trump, if you are watching, you can call me, and I will give you some more to add to that list of clients of mine who I would like to see receive presidential pardons.

      "utterance": "Forget the protest outside. Is the real battle about to go down inside? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And so many summits, so little time. In an hour from now, the president is set to sit down with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit. Now, they looked happier earlier for the so-called group photo. Not so sure how they will be feeling a bit when they're just one-on-one alone. We're all over all of this with Kevin Corke in Quebec City, where all of this is going down, and Rick Leventhal on those protests that are now just heating up. We begin with Kevin. Kevin, what does it look like in there?"

      "speaker": "KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Neil, very interesting. I'm glad you mentioned that, because, you know, coming into the summit, some newspapers, including The Times, described the president as a bit of a black sheep of the family because of his sort of cantankerous nature before coming here. And so a lot of us are wondering, what might that family photo look like? Well, let me show you. OK, I will just say it this way. It looked fine on the surface, Neil. A lot of smiles that you would well imagine you would see in that sort of a photo. But it still makes you wonder. Beneath the surface, was there tension there? Obviously, not a lot to draw from the picture itself. I did notice that Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, appeared to leave a little quickly, while the president and German Chancellor Angela Merkel pulled up the rear there. Now, the president did, by the way, speak to Macron, meet with the French president briefly. He has been highly critical of the president's push to level the playing field on trade. Now, before leaving for Washington -- or leaving Washington for Quebec, the president made this very clear. He has one word in mind when it comes to trade, and that's reciprocity."

Right now, we are not going to live with the deals the way they are. European Union treats us very unfairly, Canada, very unfairly, Mexico, very unfairly. With that being said, I think we will probably very easily make a deal."

      "speaker": "CORKE",
      "utterance": "Very easily make a deal. We're not sure exactly what the deal might look like. But just to give you a sense, Neil, of what the president calls unfair trade, look at what he tweeted. \"Canada charges the U.S. a 270 percent tariff on dairy products. They didn't tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers.\" Now, the bilat coming up with Trudeau a little bit later on, of course, we will bring you a readout as soon as we get it. In the meantime, the president is here and is expected to leave a little bit sooner than originally planned. Looking forward to making his way to that next summit you talked about, the one in Singapore with North Korea -- Neil."

      "speaker": "RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Neil, we're outside the National Assembly, which is completely encircled by police officers in riot gear. They have batons and shields and helmets all the way around the building. And what you see here are some of those buses? Those have been ferrying officers, SWAT teams around the city as needed. And a bunch of them, probably a couple hundred officers at least, just went into this park. Many of them have now left. You can see some officers up on the hill there because a group of demonstrators had headed this way and they wanted to fend them off. The largest demonstration of the day was expected to be here at the National Assembly. It was a small crowd. And just beyond us there, Neil, that's the entrance to the Old City. That's where many of the shop owners boarded up in anticipation of violence. And so far, fortunately, we haven't seen it. We can tell you there was an incident this morning where a group of protesters blocked a highway. There was a standoff with police in riot gear at that location. Some of them burned couches. There were chants and so on. Eventually, that crowd was dispersed after a couple of people were arrested. Last night, we were witness to a very large demonstration, or larger, perhaps 800 to 1,000 people who marched from a park about a mile- and-a-half over to this area next to the National Assembly. It was peaceful for the most part. A lot of chanting. Some of them were wearing masks or bandannas covering their faces. And then they did set fires or set off flares when they got to the street, and there were a couple of arrests last night as well, but, today, pretty calm. Nothing like we saw here, Neil, in 2001 during the Summit of the Americas, when there were 30,000 to 50,000 demonstrators who did millions of dollars worth of damage and had violent clashes with police officers. I was here, witnessed them throwing bricks at officers, tearing up sidewalks, smashing windows, doing millions of dollars in damages. There were hundreds of arrests in 2001. But this time around, Neil, a much calmer scene so far, largely, it seems, in part, to the fact that the summit is actually 88 miles northeast of Quebec City. And also there just aren't as many protesters here in Quebec City this time around -- Neil."

It's sort of like a G7 or what they are calling a G6 plus one, with the United States being the odd man out and the target of a lot of criticism from colleagues who say he is going too far putting on tariffs or threatening to his friends. Let's get the read from the former State Department official Anja Manuel. Anja, very good to have you back."

And you know this better than I do, that presidents have routinely had problems with our friends and more pointedly the Canadians taking, them to the World Trade Organization or other entities because they don't play fair, Barack Obama quite a few times, when it came to everything from lumber to, you know, American wine makers who felt that they were not getting a fair shake selling their product in Canada, British Columbia, more to the point. What make this impasse different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANUEL",
      "utterance": "You are absolutely right, Neil. I would say everyone needs friends, including a powerful country like the United States. So when we have disputes with our allies and friends, as we often do, you keep them quiet and behind the scenes and you don't let them explode out into public the way this has happened. We should be working with our allies, especially the Europeans and Canadians, to push back against the biggest mercantilist of all, China, rather than picking a fight with them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, you know, a lot of these cozy trade deals that some of these countries have with us, including Canada, including Mexico, including many of the European Union countries, now, these have evolved over decades, as you have reminded me in the past, and even the present participants of these meetings probably don't even know the details. But they have happened. And this president, maybe unlike his predecessors, maybe unwisely, unlike his predecessors, is choosing to give it a microphone. Now, what is the proper approach to take or what are they urging him to take?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANUEL",
      "utterance": "There has certainly been protectionism both by the Europeans and by the Canadians. We in the U.S. have been guilty of it to protect some of our industries as well. I think the WTO is still the number one body to go through and then private, quiet, behind-the-scenes negotiations. You can be tough. You just don't let it spill out in public, because it makes us look bad. And it makes us, the United States, the odd man out, when actually China should be the odd man out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you think that there is a method to this, though, on the part of the president, Anja, that he is sending as much a message to the Chinese? Look at how I get tough with my friends. Just take a gander how I will treat you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANUEL",
      "utterance": "I don't want to speculate on what the president's thinking is. But I think the message he is sending in this case in particular is not very helpful. And you can see that by the Republican senators getting worried. Senator Corker has introduced legislation that would get Congress involved on the steel and aluminum tariffs. Other Republican senators this week urging the president to ratchet down the rhetoric, the angry rhetoric against our closest friends in the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANUEL",

      "utterance": "The economy is certainly doing well. I think the jury is very much out on trade and whether we're actually going to get better trade deals. I know, on NAFTA, for example, some substantial progress has been made. That agreement does have to be updated. We do need protections for U.S. workers. But there is also at some point where you need to have a little give and take, rather than just blowing the whole thing up. So I hope we can get back to those more constructive conversations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

And this was Democratic candidate Barack Obama, who said that if he ever came to power he would change it and fast and align it more closely with America interests and even faster. That was then. What's the big deal and the difference now? Just approaches? Let's get the read from presidential historian, bestselling author Doug Wead. I forget that, that many an American president has had problems with our neighbors and best friends. They have all expressed it differently, but they have all expressed it, right?"

Now, of course, you were mentioning Pierre Trudeau, of course, the father of Justin Trudeau, famous liberal of his time and the mirror opposite of Richard Nixon, as you also point out. So, how much does that politics play into this? I was surprised, the number of beefs and problems that President Obama had with the Canadians and in petitioning the WTO, I think, no fewer than 34, 36 times during his presidency. He won a lot of those battles at the WTO. And people smarted from that because he did go after Canada a lot of the times. But I guess bygones were bygones or they were settled in the president's favor, so they could argue, well, we went through the normal channels. Our president is not going through the normal channels, but he argues the normal channels rip us off. How does that play?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEAD",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, it plays big. And there was a big difference with Obama. You are right. There was also the Keystone XL pipeline. That was devastating to Canada. And that was Obama's decision. But Obama had an advantage. He had the media backing him up. Today, Donald Trump has the media, I wouldn't call it anti-American, but you can certainly say it's anti-Trump. So Trudeau and our French allies, our British allies, they smell it. They know it. They know that if they attack the United States and our policies, the American media will side with them against Trump. That's a big difference. And I have to say one thing, Neil. You brought up the politics of it. If you study Canada and its history, there has always been a very strong element of people who are anti-American. The funny part about it is, Americans love Canadians. And these particular Canadians, it just drives them up the wall. They say, you're so dumb, you don't even know we don't like you."

But, well, in this particular fight, the foreign press has not been kind to one Donald Trump. And all of this ahead a bigger meeting that the president is having, in fact, the reason why he is leaving early, that one in Singapore. That's the one that's getting all the world's attention -- after this."

Now, the U.S. and North Korea, if they actually come away from this with something, even if it doesn't appear to be eye-popping progress, but something, then it could change everything. Now, of course, what would something be? The author of \"The Operator,\" former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill, with me. Rob, good to have you."

      "speaker": "O'NEILL",
      "utterance": "Well, there are so many arguments with that, because a lot of people are saying that Kim Jong-un is sort of playing along, knowing that President Trump could be out in a few years, seven years at the most. And then he could play the next administration, which his grandfather, Kim Il- Sung, and then Kim Jong Il and then Kim Jong-un..."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'NEILL",
      "utterance": "I don't think it is. I just think, with a lot of the technology coming up, that Kim Jong-un wants to maintain power. And the way he maintains power is without an invasion of his country. He really wants to avoid an invasion. That was one of the things that he was saying in the demilitarized zone and then in South Korea, that if we can guarantee the U.S. will not invade, which we really don't have interest in doing, he gets to sort of maintain power. And that's a whole different ball of wax once they get the technology in there. But if he realizes -- he gets to keep power with nukes. He knows that is a deterrent. But if he can get rid of them, hopefully releasing some of the -- some of the pressure of the economic sanctions, he gets more stuff in there, his people, not that he really cares about his people, but, if they get fed, that, again, will come with him maintaining power. Just to get a face-to-face with the leader of the free world, which no one in North Korea ever has, that's a step in the right direction. And he can hear face to face, along with an invite to Mar-a-Lago or to the White House. He wants to be legitimized. He wants to keep his power. This is definitely a step in the right direction. Even if nothing comes out of it, they have already started negotiating. Once, they called it off, called it -- put it back on. And then President Trump is going to leave the G7 summit tomorrow early to get to Singapore to start. This is a great first step in foreign policy."

What, do we just ignore them?"

But it seems to me, even I said he was crazy before on television. He might not be as crazy as we thought. But, you know, he wants to be legitimized. And he wants -- hopefully, they see what kind of -- look at the wealth in Seoul, South Korea, compared to Pyongyang. And they got a lot of that because of capitalism and because of cooperating with the world. There is a lot of good stuff. And right now, they are trading mainly with China and some with Singapore, which is why -- one of the many reasons why the summit is going to be in Singapore. But if they can trade with more people and they don't -- they're not necessarily under the thumb of the Chinese, that could be in their interest. We will see. You have got to figure, since the early '50s, the people have been being lied to, being told this family are gods, and it's going to take a lot to bring them around."

Let's get the read from Gary B. Smith and Melissa Armo. Melissa, this just seems weird at face value, that the markets would climb with all these worries. Then I see $100 trillion worth figure, and I go, maybe it's just people feeling more robust and bullish that is driving it."

We are right at a critical level for the S&P and the Dow. If we get over 26000 in the Dow, we are going to make new highs. And I never thought that would happen this summer. Let me just say, if we make new highs in the next few months this summer, that is so early and unexpected to me for the way the price action looked back in February, when we fell.

They feel like, I can go out and I can put money or spending something on a credit card and things are going to be OK. Instead of when people voted Trump in, they wanted change so badly, they didn't care at any cost. They didn't care that Trump never was in government before.

The Senate Intelligence Committee has some of the highest level of secrets in our government.

Where do you see this going? And do you agree with those who say, whatever it happening in the circle of people who used to be associated with then candidate Trump, that this still means that there is no target in one Donald Trump?"

With regard to Manafort, he has only been charged with financial crimes that really had nothing to do with his time as campaign manager or anything having to do with the Trump campaign or the election from 2016. And as far as them wanting to throw him in jail, that has to do with allegations from prosecutors that he was engaged in witness tampering while he has been out on pre-trial release, therefore, violating the terms of his bond, his own-recognizance release."

This, of course, the latest one being the sentence relief that he provided for Alice Marie Johnson this week. She was serving a life sentence over a nonviolent drug charge. And she thanked the president profusely. But are we looking at this the correct way here? Let's get the read from attorney Whitney Boan. Whitney, I was surprised to see, as we look at this point in respective presidencies, that the president is actually pretty low on the totem pole when it comes to pardons. He has had five. But some presidents have had far more, like Bush Sr. at this point in his presidency or Ronald Reagan before that or Jimmy Carter or even Gerald Ford."

First is whether or not he is abusing the power in terms the number of pardons he is issuing or if he is commuting sentences in a disproportionate manner. That's a separate issue than whether or not people disagree with the substance of maybe why he is pardoning people or the people who he is choosing to pardon in terms of -- obviously, there has been a lot of controversy -- less so about Alice Johnson -- but about the sheriff from Arizona, in terms of his..."

    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOAN",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, what I make of it is this. We are in a day and time where everything our president does is being scrutinized. Prior presidents since Bill Clinton, basically since his administration, and then through G.W.'s and Obama's, they have slowed their pace in terms that they wait, like you said, until later in the presidency to start making these pardons, because they are kind of comfortably within their term. We are only 504 days in here. And so you combine those factors and, yes, it seems like maybe this is a lot, but it's really not. It's more concerning, like you said, though, if he is talking about pardoning thousands of people. I don't have any issue with it, as a criminal defense attorney, because I actually have some names. And, President Trump, if you are watching, you can call me, and I will give you some more to add to that list of clients of mine who I would like to see receive presidential pardons. But -- and then, certainly, there's a lot of people that have been treated unfairly. I just think it's scary to people, and maybe rightfully so. And maybe we just pay attention to the fact that he has this newfound power, and he is like a kid in a candy shop. And we don't want it to be that we are just throwing around pardons because we can. We want it to have meaning. We want it to have significance. And we want it to be fair."

A pardon basically gives you immunity from any further punishment as a result of a presidential pardon."

The only problem here is that, in sort of the free market, you can always walk away from a deal, because you can just find another company to do the deal with. But you can't just say, oh, well, I'm just going to find another Canada to deal with right now. So, I think that that is the challenge here, is that this is a different kind of deal that he is doing with countries, rather than with companies.

      "utterance": "Well, you know, I agreed with Trump, the president, on a lot of things, but here I'm kind of -- I don't think the whole team should be penalized just because -- or punished just because of a couple players. Like, last year, when the Astros won, you had Beltran and Correa, they both didn't go to the White House to be honored, but the rest of the team went. So, just because have you an outspoken LeBron and Steph Curry doesn't -- or Steve Kerr as well -- I don't think that should hurt the other players from being honored. It's a privilege. Just because you don't agree with the president doesn't mean that you don't respect the office of the president."

And then he's going to then say, well, you know what? No one is coming then. You have ruined it for everybody. Everybody, out of the pool."

And this rover, this has been traversing the lunar -- I'm sorry -- the Martian surface now for the better part of five, six years. Anyway, they seem to have indicated, NASA, that it's discovered the elements that have been there for life billions of years ago. It's a big deal. We're sending up another capsule that is going to actually burrow inside the planet. We always look for life up there. And now there are indications, at least at a time, it might have had it."
