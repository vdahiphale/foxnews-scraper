All of that while we're in the middle of the rush to get fans in the stands and some fannies back in airline seats, specifically the middle seat. We are live at Yankee Stadium in New York and Chicago's Wrigley Field this opening day, as baseball returns, and so too fliers. Delta and United Airlines taking steps to get more people in the air, citing pent-up demand for summer travel. We're on top of both. Very glad to have you, everybody, I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" We have got Anita Vogel here looking in on a lot of developments, but we should also be telling you that some of the activity that you have seen, particularly progress that we have seen on the economic front, having nothing to do with infrastructure, had markets soaring today. We will get to that in a second. Let's first go to Aishah Hasnie on opening day and how they're getting prepared for it across the country. She's at Yankee Stadium in New York. We will also be hearing from Garrett Tenney in Chicago with the latest on how things are going their. First to Aishah.",

It doesn't mean the stadium was packed. And that, of course, is because of all those COVID restrictions. The Yankees had to limit capacity down to just 20 percent, which is just under 11,000 people. Let me just show you, if you can pan over to the left, here are some fans enjoying the beautiful day, taking some pictures out with the family. It is a great day for baseball to be back. Now, there is a new normal, though, as you mentioned, a lot of different safety precautions that fans had to go through to get inside the stadium. They had to provide a negative COVID test or proof of vaccination, get their temperature checked. And, of course, they have to be wearing those masks. Now, none of it mattered to these fans, who are just ready for some live-action baseball.",

Compare that to a year ago, when the average was just 171,000.

And, today, Frontier Airlines became the latest American airline to go public, raising $570 million in an initial public offering, according to its parents company.

So, people who are vaccinated essentially can stay together without wearing their masks, if they're in small groups. That's what the CDC is beginning to indicate. However, many of us are still wearing masks and still social distancing, because the numbers have flattened out, but we're still seeing an increased number of cases in the emergency room and in the hospital. There's about a 10 percent increase all of a sudden and a 3 percent increase in deaths. So, we're not out of the woods yet. And we really have to, if we can, mitigate.

However, we have not really paid much attention to what's called cellular immunity. We don't measure that. We just measure the antibodies to the virus. And we look at people who are and who are not infected in the placebo group vs. the test group. I suspect that the percentages of protection are far greater than 90 percent, something like probably 98 percent or even 100 percent, as we're seeing in young people, simply because cellular immunity, which is different than humoral immunity, is very, very strong and robust in most of us.",

This is after that new law passed along party lines just last week. And now we also know today that Major League Baseball is reportedly exploring options to move its All-Star baseball game possibly away from Atlanta this summer. Now, all of this got started when a group of Black business executives, Merck CEO Ken Frazier and former American Express CEO Ken Chenault, started calling on corporate leaders to speak out against these new voting laws in Georgia, saying that the law will disproportionately hurt voters of color. Now, as you just mentioned some of the claims, let's just review a couple of them, because they're making a lot of buzz. And let's set the record straight here. Democrats say the law will end voting hours early. But that's not true. The fact is that voting on Election Day will run from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., which is the same as current polling hours. And as for early voting, the new law requires that polls stay open from 9:00 to 5:00 at a minimum. Local officials are free to keep them open longer if they want to. Now, that time frame is established to replace a previous vague requirement that said early voting had to happen during normal business hours. Now, there's also a claim that water is prohibited, but actually polling workers are free to set up self-service water stations for voters. Now, yesterday, a number of companies issued statements expressing support for voting rights generally and condemning the new Georgia law. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said it is wrong. And Delta CEO Ed Bastian called it unacceptable. Now, meanwhile, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is punching back, as you just heard. He's defending this law, saying that it expands access to early voting and makes the process more secure. But all of this public debate comes as Republicans have proposed more than 250 bills in 43 states that address voting, and as Washington Democrats propose a bill that would make voter registration automatic nationwide, and would expand early and mail-in voting. All of those measures, Republicans say, would benefit the Democrats -- Neil.",

And, today, Frontier Airlines became the latest American airline to go public, raising $570 million in an initial public offering, according to its parents company.

So, people who are vaccinated essentially can stay together without wearing their masks, if they're in small groups. That's what the CDC is beginning to indicate. However, many of us are still wearing masks and still social distancing, because the numbers have flattened out, but we're still seeing an increased number of cases in the emergency room and in the hospital. There's about a 10 percent increase all of a sudden and a 3 percent increase in deaths. So, we're not out of the woods yet. And we really have to, if we can, mitigate.

However, we have not really paid much attention to what's called cellular immunity. We don't measure that. We just measure the antibodies to the virus. And we look at people who are and who are not infected in the placebo group vs. the test group. I suspect that the percentages of protection are far greater than 90 percent, something like probably 98 percent or even 100 percent, as we're seeing in young people, simply because cellular immunity, which is different than humoral immunity, is very, very strong and robust in most of us."

Well, let's start treating the information highway the same way we treat the international -- or interstate highway. And this is as much infrastructure as anything else. We have got schools that need to be built. That is infrastructure, affordable housing that needs to be built. That is infrastructure. We have got to get our kids online learning. We have to get the health care delivery system, telehealth, telemedicine. All of that requires broadband.

You just had a guy sitting in the White House who was doing crazy stuff. And what happened? We ruined the affordable housing market when we dropped the rate down to 21. Get it back up to 28.

When you're building highways, when you're doing broadband, when you're developing these communities, it all gets right back up to Wall Street. So, I have never been able to understand why people who make so much money off the investments of people's expenditures keep trying to keep people from getting the money to spend.

I mean, I have been doing this over 25 years now. And we know exactly the tactics of these people. And for them, it's just a profit. So, for us, we had not seen that type of tactic in the outskirts of the El Paso region, like in the New Mexico area. That terrain is desolate. That terrain is very rocky and mountainous. So, when we see an image like that, that raises my alert and my worry that they may continue to try these tactics further out in the desert area, like Lordsburg. New Mexico, or Fort Hancock, Texas, where it's not urban. It's very remote. It's very rural. And the logistics and the challenges that exist for Border Patrol agents to get to those locations are quite high. So, I worry when I see images like this and the tactics that smugglers are using really hurting these children. This is a very vulnerable population. Everyone is an agreement that these children, we need to protect them. We need to keep them safe. We need to keep them healthy and fed and clean. That's our number one priority. But when we see images like this, I tell you I am appalled. I committed myself to working with law enforcement on the south side and Mexico. I want this guy.

This is after that new law passed along party lines just last week. And now we also know today that Major League Baseball is reportedly exploring options to move its All-Star baseball game possibly away from Atlanta this summer. Now, all of this got started when a group of Black business executives, Merck CEO Ken Frazier and former American Express CEO Ken Chenault, started calling on corporate leaders to speak out against these new voting laws in Georgia, saying that the law will disproportionately hurt voters of color. Now, as you just mentioned some of the claims, let's just review a couple of them, because they're making a lot of buzz. And let's set the record straight here. Democrats say the law will end voting hours early. But that's not true. The fact is that voting on Election Day will run from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., which is the same as current polling hours. And as for early voting, the new law requires that polls stay open from 9:00 to 5:00 at a minimum. Local officials are free to keep them open longer if they want to. Now, that time frame is established to replace a previous vague requirement that said early voting had to happen during normal business hours. Now, there's also a claim that water is prohibited, but actually polling workers are free to set up self-service water stations for voters. Now, yesterday, a number of companies issued statements expressing support for voting rights generally and condemning the new Georgia law. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said it is wrong. And Delta CEO Ed Bastian called it unacceptable. Now, meanwhile, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is punching back, as you just heard. He's defending this law, saying that it expands access to early voting and makes the process more secure. But all of this public debate comes as Republicans have proposed more than 250 bills in 43 states that address voting, and as Washington Democrats propose a bill that would make voter registration automatic nationwide, and would expand early and mail-in voting. All of those measures, Republicans say, would benefit the Democrats -- Neil."

My granddaddy, Martin Luther King Sr., said that laughter was a city too busy to hate. And so we can discuss, negotiate and fix this. So we're not really at the same place with the voter issue at this time. However, the cancel culture will say to you, if I don't like you and don't agree with you, out you go. And I do caution everybody not to get into that position. We need to learn to live together and work together as brothers and sisters. And that way, we will not perish as fools, Neil."

Do you believe that?"

He still loves America, and so do I. But I don't think that we are retaliating against what may or may not have happened with the last election. It's time for an overhaul of the election, period, whoever the president happens to be. And so we can cry voter fraud when we're not winning. And both sides do that, of course, as well. And then, when we are winning, if we committed fraud, we don't admit it. And a lot of times, I have seen voter fraud in Georgia myself. I was elected twice as a state legislator."

And I believe more people actually voted for President Trump than we actually saw here in Georgia. I'm very convinced that is true. And then my god-daughter, Angela Stanton-King, ran for office. And one of the larger polls where her vote was, they had some kind of water problem that didn't really exist, and they shut the polls down. And something happened to the votes. Now, all that really did happen. So, as I say, though, please hear me. These kinds of shenanigans go on in every election. And I agree that we need to get a handle on it and start having people have our votes protected. The votes just need to be fair."

It may be even a little bit too little, too late. That's possible. You have to look at it that way as well. And with the Democrats being so successful in their efforts, then they are going to be a little bit quiet. Now, if it had flipped the other way, they'd be screaming, hollering, yelling, because you remember, because you remember, the prior election, prior to 2016, they had a total fit. They didn't believe it. It was just a -- and they say, hey, that will never happen again. And they got very, very busy to make sure it didn't, didn't they?"

In the meantime here, you heard James Clyburn, the big Democratic power player in the House, talk about the fact that everything that's in this infrastructure package has to do with infrastructure. And, furthermore, he would like to see added taxes in that, that could raise still more money. I wonder what Andy Biggs, the Arizona Republican, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, in fact, the chairman, what does he make of that? After this."

I mean, just a passing view of this has a lot of -- that does not sound like infrastructure. He insists everything sort of comes back to that, and that this does have to do with infrastructure and jobs and all of that wrapped together. Count my next guest not quite smitten with that idea. Andy Biggs is the Arizona Republican, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who has whisked off a letter right now to let the president know, others know, wait a minute, what you got here isn't that. It's not infrastructure. Actually, your argument, Congressman, is that a very small part of it is for infrastructure. Is that -- is that right?"

You're not thinking of basically racial equity and justice and destruction of freeways, $20 billion to take down freeways that are considered racist. You're thinking of building streets, improving streets. You're thinking of repairing bridges, the things that move people and freight around this country. That's kind of what you think of when you think of transportation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "I would be surprised if you saw anybody kind of support this. It's -- Neil, it's just too -- too much and -- spending and not enough dealing with the issues of transportation infrastructure that we actually have. So, yes, I'd be surprised."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, I understand the Republicans not liking a lot of the tax hikes that go with this, the corporate rate up to 28 percent, the global rate here that could effectively add another 20 percent to that. I mean, we could go on and on about that. Would you be open to any other type of funding to support infrastructure, albeit not maybe at these levels, at $2.25 trillion, but what would you be open to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what this is doing, Neil, is, it's actually presenting to us an opportunity to look at the way that Congress actually budgets and appropriates. The whole system's broken, and we're funding stuff that the federal government has no business funding. So, maybe -- maybe certain federal transportation projects are what we should be funding. Well, if we're going to do that, then let's find a way to pay for it. And maybe we -- the best way to do that is eliminate some of the bad federal spending that we're doing, rather than increasing taxes, which actually will suppress the economy, has the chance to actually cause us to lose jobs, considering the additional pressures."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Not until we have had the deep dive. I mean, look, when people got to Congress 15 years ago, they were told, we will balance the budget in five years. And then it was -- then it was in 10 years. And last I heard, they were talking 15 or 20 years. It's never going to get balanced if you say, well, we're going to support transportation funding to the level of X, Y, Z, and we're going to -- we're going to cause these taxes to go up. We're not looking at user fees. We're not looking at excise fees. How about looking at the totality of what we're spending and saying, maybe we shouldn't be in this area, maybe this is not where the federal government should be? And this notion that you can -- you can throw $2 trillion it and then have people like AOC said, let's throw another $8 trillion top of that, that's where you start getting some dangerous business. And don't forget, Neil, the reason that so many businesses were coming back, the reason the economies were so solid in some aspects was three things. Number one, we were energy-independent before the COVID. We were also -- we'd reduced our business taxes and we had reduced regulation (AUDIO GAP) come back to the country. Now, I wonder, if you raise these taxes, are you going to push jobs out of the country? So, when they say it's a jobs act, it's going to be only government jobs. And that's the infrastructure they're trying to set up."

Congressman Biggs, thank you very, very much. Again, if investors were worried about any of this eventually coming to gouge them, they had a funny way of showing it, all the major averages advancing on optimism that, at the very least, it's going to stimulate things.
