      "sentences": "Welcome to that great '80s show, where everything old is new again, including inflation. It's now running at a 6.8 percent clip. That is the highest level in nearly four decades. Now, the last time we saw prices running up this fast, Ronald Reagan was president, \"E.T.\" was the top film at the box office. Larry Holmes was the heavyweight boxing champ of the world. And Prince Charles and Lady Diana had just welcomed their first child, William, to the world. That was then, but no bundle of joy for consumers right now, And let's just say no signs things are slowing down right now. Far from it. The cost of a steak is up nearly 25 percent from a year ago, bacon up 21 percent, fuel oil 59 percent, and gas 58 percent. Supply chain shortages aren't helping, but growing frustration with a White House that many shoppers say isn't helping either. But is that really fair? And is that even right? Today, we will ask the White House's top economic adviser, because the National Economic Council director, Brian Deese, is here, and only here. Welcome, everybody. Glad to have you. Happy Friday. I'm Neil Cavuto Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" And we have got Jacqui Heinrich at the White House on what the president is saying about all of this, and Lydia Hu in New Jersey on how small businesses are trying to deal with all of this. Let's begin with Jacqui -- Jacqui.",

The price of gas nationally is falling. The price of natural gas is down 25 percent from its November levels. So we're seeing some moderation that front. But prices are too high. And that's why we are very focused here on the things that we can do to unstick these supply chain bottlenecks that are affecting every country around the world. The thing that's unique about the American recovery right now is how strong our economic growth is, strongest in 40 years, how strong our labor market is, lowest unemployment claims since 1969.

And that's what you're seeing us do, and also to take action to try to reduce costs for families. And this Build Back Better Act that we're debating in Congress right now, there has never been a piece of legislation in modern American history that would reduce costs for families more in areas where they are really feeling it, prescription drugs, for example. The cost of insulin affects millions of families around the country. The cost of child care, this bill would cut by more than half the cost of child care that a typical family is facing, not only reducing costs, helping get more people to work, because, by providing affordable child care, parents, and particularly women, can get back into the work force. So there are steps that we can take right now that would help propel the strength of this recovery, while easing price pressures. So that will continue to be our focus.",

But the opportunity we have to address them in a way that won't add to inflationary pressures is pressing right now. And that's the logic of this bill.

And we can get to the video right now. What you're looking at is out of Chiapas in Southern Mexico. As you mentioned, what this was, was a tractor-trailer truck loaded up with almost 200 mostly Central American migrants that tried to take a turn. It flipped over, and everybody spilled out. And the results were catastrophic, the latest numbers we're hearing right now, 54 migrants dead, another 105 injured. This is making it one of the deadliest accidents involving migrants in the past several decades. One of the riders who was in that truck who survived told local media there was just too much weight when they tried to make the turn. The truck just couldn't handle it. Horrible situation there. Want to direct you to another situation going on, though, if we can pull up this video out of Yuma, Arizona. What you're looking at here are migrants who have just crossed into Yuma illegally just walking around the city openly without any Border Patrol there to apprehend them. Border Patrol completely overwhelmed down there. They don't have the manpower right now. The Yuma mayor saying that more than 6,000 migrants have passed through Yuma in the past several days. That is a 2600 percent increase since October 1, he says. Take a look at this photo right here. Some of those migrants, as they were walking through the city, stopped by to get a quick bite of food at McDonald's. Again, Border Patrol just does not have the manpower down there right now. These migrants were never encountered by agents. So the mayor of Yuma has now declared a local state of emergency, writing in part that he had to do it -- quote -- \"because due to the unprecedented numbers of migrants entering the city prior to being processed and released by Border Patrol,\" he says, \"the influx of these undocumented persons entering the Yuma area is resulting in a humanitarian and border crisis\" -- end quote. And, Neil, earlier today, I reached out to the offices of both Democratic senators for the state of Arizona to ask them if they have got any comment about what's going on in Yuma. Senator Mark Kelly's office got back to me, saying he was on the phone with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, urging him to take immediate action and send more federal resources down to the Yuma area. However, when it comes to Kyrsten Sinema's office, I never heard back -- we will send it back to you.",

Now, the last time we saw prices running up this fast, Ronald Reagan was president, \"E.T.\" was the top film at the box office. Larry Holmes was the heavyweight boxing champ of the world. And Prince Charles and Lady Diana had just welcomed their first child, William, to the world. That was then, but no bundle of joy for consumers right now, And let's just say no signs things are slowing down right now. Far from it. The cost of a steak is up nearly 25 percent from a year ago, bacon up 21 percent, fuel oil 59 percent, and gas 58 percent. Supply chain shortages aren't helping, but growing frustration with a White House that many shoppers say isn't helping either. But is that really fair? And is that even right? Today, we will ask the White House's top economic adviser, because the National Economic Council director, Brian Deese, is here, and only here. Welcome, everybody. Glad to have you. Happy Friday. I'm Neil Cavuto Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" And we have got Jacqui Heinrich at the White House on what the president is saying about all of this, and Lydia Hu in New Jersey on how small businesses are trying to deal with all of this.

The president had cited today it'll reduce costs for things like health care, prescription drugs, child care.

And that is a sign of the strong economy, because they can and they will. All of this inflation presumably stops when people eventually get to a point and say, we're going to stop doing that. That has not happened. Will it? Brian Deese is the director of the National Economic Council, joins us from the White House. Director, very good to have you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEESE",
      "utterance": "We never put too much stake in one month's data. But what I can tell you is that the data in November, they were high, but they -- it was less strong than in October. And about half of the increase in November was driven by energy and cars. Those are both sectors where we have seen some moderation in prices even since November. The price of gas nationally is falling. The price of natural gas is down 25 percent from its November levels. So we're seeing some moderation that front. But prices are too high. And that's why we are very focused here on the things that we can do to unstick these supply chain bottlenecks that are affecting every country around the world. The thing that's unique about the American recovery right now is how strong our economic growth is, strongest in 40 years, how strong our labor market is, lowest unemployment claims since 1969. So we are uniquely well-positioned to address what our real challenge is here with prices. And that's why we're focused on taking the steps that we can, including around the ports, moving things through our supply chains more quickly."

      "utterance": "Director, I could see what you and the president have been saying about coming out of a pandemic, where the economy was essentially in park, and any sort of activity after that or getting back to normal, you are going to see a spike in prices. But it seems as if the administration was caught off-guard as to the seriousness and the widespread nature of this."

      "speaker": "DEESE",
      "utterance": "I don't think that that's fair. I think, if you look at -- for supply chains, for example, the president supply -- has signed an executive order on supply chain resilience on February 25 of this past year. He launched a Supply Chains Disruptions Task Force over the summer. We have been at these issues for some months, even as we have seen very strong economic growth underlying our recovery. We have known that, as you come out of a pandemic, you look at these data that are comparing to a year ago. A year ago, the economy was on its back."

A couple of months ago, we sat down with business and labor and the terminal operators and said, we need to get these ports going 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In the period since, the dwell time, the amount of time that containers are sitting on docks, has come down about 50 percent. You see Walmart, Target, other big retailers are saying goods are moving more quickly through the supply chain as we get through this -- the squeeze of the holiday season. So I think we are making progress on that front. But this has been a focus of ours for some time. It will continue to be, because it's important to try to moderate those prices."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, there was criticism early on, Director, that the White House seemed to be dismissing the severity of these price increases, seemingly hanging it on the rich, and that they're the ones who are forced to pay these higher prices, when, in fact, everyone was. I mean, you widened it, addressed this, so there's no use in going back at that. But I am wondering now how this gets to be fixed. I mean, isn't this really up to the Federal Reserve? Doesn't it need to start raising rates, to start doing the kind of maybe dramatic, some call it unpleasant, action to get this under control?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEESE",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly, monetary policy plays a role. I'm going to leave that to the Federal Reserve. We respect the independence of their decision- making. From the fiscal policy side, what we need to do is continue to take steps to address what are global supply chain issues. And that's what you're seeing us do, and also to take action to try to reduce costs for families. And this Build Back Better Act that we're debating in Congress right now, there has never been a piece of legislation in modern American history that would reduce costs for families more in areas where they are really feeling it, prescription drugs, for example. The cost of insulin affects millions of families around the country. The cost of child care, this bill would cut by more than half the cost of child care that a typical family is facing, not only reducing costs, helping get more people to work, because, by providing affordable child care, parents, and particularly women, can get back into the work force. So there are steps that we can take right now that would help propel the strength of this recovery, while easing price pressures. So that will continue to be our focus."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, well, it would be a first, right, in American history if a big spending package ultimately reduced inflation. It's usually the opposite. But you mentioned some of these features in that measure, sir, as helping out those who need child care assistance and the rest. We didn't have any of those features back before the pandemic. And for a while, we had an unemployment rate as low as 3.5 percent. So, if we didn't need it then, why do we need it now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEESE",

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But it's not, right? I mean, the CBO says that it's going to fall about $400 billion short in revenue over 10 years. Now, I don't put any faith in any estimate that's over six months, but, having said that, they don't say it is fully paid for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEESE",
      "utterance": "Well, what the CBO estimated today was a hypothetical bill that is not Build Back Better. The CBO, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the official scorekeepers, have looked at this bill and said that it is, in fact, fully paid for. But to go to your question, we have faced challenges of rising costs of health care, rising cost of child care, rising costs of housing well before this pandemic. And they were imposing real challenges on American families, even when we were in the pre-pandemic economy. These challenges are not new. But the opportunity we have to address them in a way that won't add to inflationary pressures is pressing right now. And that's the logic of this bill. Particularly, you take something like housing, we have underinvested in the supply of affordable housing in this country for years now. Doing that now will help lower the cost of housing for American families. And if we pay for it, it won't add to aggregate demand or add to inflationary pressures."

Brian Deese, national economic adviser to the president of the United States, National Council director, thank you again. Very good having you. To his point of, if there is panic about what's happening on the inflation front, the market has a funny way of showing it, all the major averages rallying this week, on average, about 3 to 3.5 percent. And, by the way, the S&P 500, that's at an all-time high. So, for now, no worries. For now. We will have more after this."

      "speaker": "BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Neil, good afternoon to you. That's right, two big stories going on with immigration right now. We will get to the first, though, that crash you mentioned, that horrible crash. And we can get to the video right now. What you're looking at is out of Chiapas in Southern Mexico. As you mentioned, what this was, was a tractor-trailer truck loaded up with almost 200 mostly Central American migrants that tried to take a turn. It flipped over, and everybody spilled out. And the results were catastrophic, the latest numbers we're hearing right now, 54 migrants dead, another 105 injured. This is making it one of the deadliest accidents involving migrants in the past several decades. One of the riders who was in that truck who survived told local media there was just too much weight when they tried to make the turn. The truck just couldn't handle it. Horrible situation there. Want to direct you to another situation going on, though, if we can pull up this video out of Yuma, Arizona. What you're looking at here are migrants who have just crossed into Yuma illegally just walking around the city openly without any Border Patrol there to apprehend them. Border Patrol completely overwhelmed down there. They don't have the manpower right now. The Yuma mayor saying that more than 6,000 migrants have passed through Yuma in the past several days. That is a 2600 percent increase since October 1, he says. Take a look at this photo right here. Some of those migrants, as they were walking through the city, stopped by to get a quick bite of food at McDonald's. Again, Border Patrol just does not have the manpower down there right now. These migrants were never encountered by agents. So the mayor of Yuma has now declared a local state of emergency, writing in part that he had to do it -- quote -- \"because due to the unprecedented numbers of migrants entering the city prior to being processed and released by Border Patrol,\" he says, \"the influx of these undocumented persons entering the Yuma area is resulting in a humanitarian and border crisis\" -- end quote. And, Neil, earlier today, I reached out to the offices of both Democratic senators for the state of Arizona to ask them if they have got any comment about what's going on in Yuma. Senator Mark Kelly's office got back to me, saying he was on the phone with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, urging him to take immediate action and send more federal resources down to the Yuma area. However, when it comes to Kyrsten Sinema's office, I never heard back -- we will send it back to you."

I'm just wondering, where does that stand right now?"

He's in Phoenix -- or he came to Phoenix. But he's hiding from the border. He took a flight to San Diego, and then San Francisco. The administration is completely nonresponsive. So, yes, we are surging state badges to the border. We're trying to support the brave men and women of Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection, along with ICE, but they're undermanned, and they're under-resourced from our federal government. So we need some attention on the border right now, in addition to what we're trying to do in Arizona and places like Texas."

What do you make of the all-or-nothing pattern?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUCEY",
      "utterance": "Well, this is due to the Biden administration's policies. We have actually asked them to reinstate Title 42. But they're doing it much like their Afghanistan exit plan, piecemeal, without really thinking it out. So it's happening in El Paso right now, where you can return a migrant back to Mexico legally, but it hasn't been instituted in Arizona. That's why you have the surge from the cartels taking these people to a place where they find a wide-open border that's unprotected. Now, we're putting all the manpower we can on the border and trying to support our federal partners. But there's just a complete lack of attention and seriousness from Joe Biden and his border czar, Kamala Harris."

      "speaker": "DUCEY",
      "utterance": "That's accurate. They're instituting it piecemeal. So it's happening right now in El Paso, to my understanding. We do not have Title 42 authority here in the state of Arizona. So the cartels take advantage of this. They use the humanitarian crisis that is so heartbreaking on your screen to actually get the drugs, the fentanyl, the methamphetamine and the cocaine across the border, and then to surge it all over our country. And this is something that is infecting all of our schools and neighborhoods, and not just in Arizona and border states. When you hear about these fentanyl overdoses, those dangerous drugs and poisons came across our Southern border. This is a law enforcement function. We're going to do everything we can in Arizona, but it's like a balloon, Neil. When you squeeze it and protect Arizona and Texas, they will then go to New Mexico and California."

Today, they do it on online marketplaces, Amazon.com, Facebook, and other places.

The Sheriffs Association is accusing the Biden administration of not helping to curb that problem. Let's get a review from Jonathan Thompson with us right now. It's interesting when you look about -- at the argument they're making.

It's not Democrat. I remember Senator Biden sitting in the well OF the Senate not too long ago -- don't want to age us -- calling for 100,000 more cops in the country. I think we're getting to that point now. We do have a crisis ON our hands. I don't care how anybody wants to categorize it. Sheriffs have asked for help. Sheriffs need help. If we don't get it from the feds -- and we're not getting it. Let's be honest. Sending 70 officers OR deputies to L.A. and San Francisco, that's a drop in the boiling ocean. It's not going to -- it's not going to do a thing for the rest of this country, where we have a systemic problem with crime. And if we have to do it ourselves, like Sheriff Grady Judd is doing with the attorney general in Florida, then that's I guess what we will have to do.

And the sad thing is, we all in law enforcement have been saying this since before November of last year. We saw the problem coming. We have told the administration. We told the previous administration the problem was coming. It's here. It's in our face. And sheriffs have got to decide how they're going to solve these problems with the chiefs in their jurisdiction. And if the feds can help us, we want their help. We want their partnership. This is probably the single most important infrastructure item the country needs. If you can't have a safe street, you can't have a safe community, you're not going to be able to go out and buy anything. You're not going to be able to buy anything. You're not going to be able to live your life. So we have got to do something. Right now is the time. We can do it. I think the president has the message. I think he understands the nature of the problem. I think there are some around him that want to minimize it and say, hey, we have got it solved. Look, we have all got to recognize this is our problem. This isn't -- this isn't the left or the right or the middle. This is every one of the Americans' problem. And sheriffs are here to help solve that problem. But we do need a collective approach to this from our federal partners."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's so far no real coordinated approach with this. Something's got to be done. Jonathan Thompson, thank you very, very much. We will see where this goes. In the meantime here, we are looking at other developments that are scant getting attention right now, but a Buffalo Starbucks that has now gone the unionization route and another one in the same area that could follow suit, as Amazon is forced right now to redo a union vote that it thought it had won little more than a few weeks ago. Is there a pattern here? We explore -- after this."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, methinks the president is in favor of union jobs, and they are the rage right now and the direction this has been taking. And, surprises, surprises, even at Starbucks, known to be one of the more generous employers across the country, with wages at around $20-an-hour level and some benefits, including incentives and bonuses for college educations and the like, one store unionized there, reaction from workers there. Another one is close to following the same route. Hans Nichols has been tracking all of this. The Axios reported joins us right now. What do you make of these developments, Han?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANS NICHOLS, AXIOS",
      "utterance": "Well, from the Biden administration's perspective, Neil, they're big picture is that they want more union participation. They want higher union involvement. And they think that unions drive wages upwards. And this sort of dovetails into the overall inflation argument. And when you ask White House officials about inflation, before privately, now publicly, they're saying it. They're really making a pro-wage argument. And that is that, yes, there's inflation, but you're also seeing inflation in wages. And the term they use is sort of real wages. And what real wages are, according to the White House, is, they're rising. And that's their theory of the case. Now, they will get into some specifics sometimes, like, as you saw this afternoon, he weighed in on the situation out there at Kellogg -- Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right, right, where striking workers there are being replaced by others. And that's got his wrath right now. But what is interesting in the Buffalo case and Starbucks in general is, it's one of the country's more generous employers, again, with pay averaging close to 20 bucks an hour, sometimes, in some areas, $23 an hour, and a host in a range, a wide range of benefits. And yet that is targeted and succeeds at least in one store. Another could go the same way not too far for unionization. That's a big, interesting development. What did you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NICHOLS",
      "utterance": "Well, look, you never want to draw too much and make a big broad proclamation from a couple of incidents, right? I mean, remember, earlier in the year, it was down in Amazon where the Amazon workers voted not to take the collective bargaining route. And some people jumped out on that and said, well, look, this means that everyone's really happy at Amazon and a unionization effort isn't really viable at Amazon. So, I'd be hesitant to sort of weigh in too much and extrapolate too much from one case. It is interesting, right? The numbers are probably what makes it the most interesting, and that is that these employees are paid above, well above even what people like Bernie Sanders are talking about as a new federal minimum wage."

And those are the kind of jobs that President Biden, for the most part, is talking about."

They claim that, in \"It's A Wonderful Life,\" that -- this is incredible to believe, but Jimmy Stewart gets misogynistic, that he grabs his wife and kisses her. And that ticked them off. And don't even get me started on Mr. Potter. The bottom line is that there are a few others they don't like either. But I figured, who can I get to talk about the big moral implications of this going forward for the world, for society, for humankind as we know it?
