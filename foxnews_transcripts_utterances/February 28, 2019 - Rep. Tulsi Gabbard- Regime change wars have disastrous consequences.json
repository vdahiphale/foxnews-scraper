      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" The North Korea Summit ended early. The President rejected North Korea's negotiating position as unacceptable and bad for the United States. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? We'll find out just ahead. And then Democratic Presidential candidate, Tulsi Gabbard has all but been expelled basically from her party. Her crime? Opposing war. Always happy to talk to her on this show though. She'll join us later. But first, Michael Cohen spent a decade as Trump's high-profile lobbyer, toady, defender and personal attorney. And then one day, he decided that he hated Donald Trump and became Donald Trump's mortal enemy. A big change. How did that happen? Well, Cohen told Congress this week that he had a kind of a road to Damascus experience. He was personally and is morally offended by what his boss said in two occasions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } First, after the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, that was the summer of 2017 and later, when he watched Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland about a year later. Those two scandals, both of them fraudulent, entirely manufactured by the left and its servants in the media changed Michael Cohen's mind forever. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Democrats must have been gratified to hear that. Michael Cohen is a sensitive, progressive now. He is tormented by climate change and his own toxic masculinity. He is basically a one-man crusade against privilege. He is a new man. That's his story. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, now comes a \"Daily Mail\" piece that puts a different gloss on it. It turns out, just weeks before the FBI raided his offices last summer, Michael Cohen was shopping a book proposal. In the manuscript, which the \"Daily Mail\" has, Cohen professes love and admiration for Donald Trump. In the book proposal, Cohen defends the President against claims that he is quote, \"crazy, dumb, paranoid, in over his head or a liar,\" all claims that Cohen made this week before Congress. Keep in mind that Cohen wrote the book proposal well after Charlottesville and Helsinki, those scandals that just changed him as a man. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It turns out that Michael Cohen is not a very reliable narrator. But too late, he is the narrator the Democrats have chosen, and they are stuck with him. They brought him to Capitol Hill yesterday in the hope, the expectation that he would prove the Russia conspiracy true. He didn't, instead he demolished that conspiracy. Nobody on the left wants to admit that, but we have the tape. Let's start with the claim that Cohen held secret meetings with Russian agents in Prague in an effort to steal the 2016 election. On its face, it sounds nuts, but they have been telling you that for years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Back in 2017, I did a war game where I looked at what happens if there was a nuclear war with North Korea in 2020. You know what happened in that war game? Eight million people died. And the reason why the deal toll didn't go any higher is because the computer broke because we didn't hit the casualty assessments high enough and the programming broke. So the thing is this, we need to understand the most important thing with North Korea that we need to have is peace. Because look, let's face it, a lot of countries have nuclear weapons. That's terrible. That makes me feel uncomfortable. But you know what? Deterrence works. Because Kim Jong-un knows one thing, if he uses nuclear weapons, he is dead. So we need to have a little bit more realistic expectation about what is going on with North Korea because our threat perceptions are out just way out of whack.

If he decided to use them, millions of people would be dead. So look, the first thing that we need to do is we need to start a dialogue with North Korea. That's why last night, I was so adamant about a peace declaration because how are you going to convince Kim Jong-un to disarm if you are at war with him technically. So I think that's the first step. But the most important thing is this, let's put the actually nuclear disarmament at the end of the process. Let's start at the beginning of having with some sort of relationship.

So what we find is that bio-mass, burning wood and fossil fuels kill about seven million a year from smoke. And so that smoke is just a function of all of that waste product being in the air, people breathing it.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" The North Korea Summit ended early. The President rejected North Korea's negotiating position as unacceptable and bad for the United States. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? We'll find out just ahead. And then Democratic Presidential candidate, Tulsi Gabbard has all but been expelled basically from her party. Her crime? Opposing war. Always happy to talk to her on this show though. She'll join us later. But first, Michael Cohen spent a decade as Trump's high-profile lobbyer, toady, defender and personal attorney. And then one day, he decided that he hated Donald Trump and became Donald Trump's mortal enemy. A big change. How did that happen? Well, Cohen told Congress this week that he had a kind of a road to Damascus experience. He was personally and is morally offended by what his boss said in two occasions. First, after the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, that was the summer of 2017 and later, when he watched Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland about a year later. Those two scandals, both of them fraudulent, entirely manufactured by the left and its servants in the media changed Michael Cohen's mind forever. Democrats must have been gratified to hear that. Michael Cohen is a sensitive, progressive now. He is tormented by climate change and his own toxic masculinity. He is basically a one-man crusade against privilege. He is a new man. That's his story. Well, now comes a \"Daily Mail\" piece that puts a different gloss on it. It turns out, just weeks before the FBI raided his offices last summer, Michael Cohen was shopping a book proposal. In the manuscript, which the \"Daily Mail\" has, Cohen professes love and admiration for Donald Trump. In the book proposal, Cohen defends the President against claims that he is quote, \"crazy, dumb, paranoid, in over his head or a liar,\" all claims that Cohen made this week before Congress. Keep in mind that Cohen wrote the book proposal well after Charlottesville and Helsinki, those scandals that just changed him as a man. It turns out that Michael Cohen is not a very reliable narrator. But too late, he is the narrator the Democrats have chosen, and they are stuck with him. They brought him to Capitol Hill yesterday in the hope, the expectation that he would prove the Russia conspiracy true. He didn't, instead he demolished that conspiracy. Nobody on the left wants to admit that, but we have the tape. Let's start with the claim that Cohen held secret meetings with Russian agents in Prague in an effort to steal the 2016 election. On its face, it sounds nuts, but they have been telling you that for years."

He was the guy who went to Prague who had this secret meeting with the Russians. He was the guy who had all of the information. And the only way yesterday's hearing make sense was if they were really trying to interrogate this Russia collusion conspiracy theory. It doesn't make sense to ask questions about Donald Trump as a businessman because that's not a proper area for government oversight. It's not very seemly to have Congressional investigators facilitating a violation of attorney-client privilege.

The FBI has all of his documents, and he has publicly stated about a man he hates, Donald Trump, that none of these widely believed threats and the Russia conspiracy are true.

I have said on your show and on other shows for well over a year now that there is no evidence that Donald Trump - President Trump conspired to violate the criminal laws with the Russians -- conspired with the Russians to violate criminal laws. But I have also said and I hear just so few of the networks whether it's MSNBC, CNN or Fox, just kind of giving the basic balance. So while I think there is no evidence that Trump conspired to violate criminal laws relating to Russian election interference, on the one hand, there are a lot of things still that are worth investigating on the other, that are still worth investigating. Michael Cohen is not the last word. The fat lady has not sung. I think we should wait see what the Mueller report says. I mean, look, Trump's campaign manager was sharing polling information with a Russian intelligence agent. The family, his son was eagerly taking meetings from Russian surrogates wanting to spread dirt on Clinton, from Russia intelligence surrogates wanting to spread dirt on Clinton, so while I think there is no evidence that Trump violated the criminal laws in a conspiracy with Russia, I think there are things that are still worth looking at."

Now, I know some people are going to say, \"Oh, that's very low expectations.\" Let me just tell you a very quick story. Back in 2017, I did a war game where I looked at what happens if there was a nuclear war with North Korea in 2020. You know what happened in that war game? Eight million people died. And the reason why the deal toll didn't go any higher is because the computer broke because we didn't hit the casualty assessments high enough and the programming broke. So the thing is this, we need to understand the most important thing with North Korea that we need to have is peace. Because look, let's face it, a lot of countries have nuclear weapons. That's terrible. That makes me feel uncomfortable. But you know what? Deterrence works. Because Kim Jong-un knows one thing, if he uses nuclear weapons, he is dead. So we need to have a little bit more realistic expectation about what is going on with North Korea because our threat perceptions are out just way out of whack. I mean, we really need to be a little bit more realistic."

I mean, everybody was calling for a regime change in North Korea. Let's do a bloody strike. Do you know how many armaments North Korea has? They might have as many as 60 nuclear weapons. If he decided to use them, millions of people would be dead. So look, the first thing that we need to do is we need to start a dialogue with North Korea. That's why last night, I was so adamant about a peace declaration because how are you going to convince Kim Jong-un to disarm if you are at war with him technically. So I think that's the first step. But the most important thing is this, let's put the actually nuclear disarmament at the end of the process. Let's start at the beginning of having with some sort of relationship. That's not appeasement. That's not being Neville Chamberlain, that's just being realistic."

The President said the terms were unacceptable to the United States of America and he flew home. There he is. Back in this country, the Green New Deal almost overnight it seems like has taken over the environmental agenda of the Democratic Party. Young pioneer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says we are going to ground our planes, ditch our cars, and stop having kids for the sake of the planet. We even need to stop eating hamburgers.

People don't remember President Obama, we spent $150 billion on renewables between 2009 and 2015 and we just kept encountering the same kind of problems everywhere that were related both to the essential unreliability of solar and wind. They just depend on when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing, which is 10% to 40% of the years and then also something that people are not as aware of which is the low energy density of sunlight and wind and basically what we have been finding is that the lower the energy density of the fuel, in this case, the sunlight and the win, the bigger the environmental impact, you just have to use a lot more natural resource including land to generate very much electricity."

And when I read up about it, all of the accidents and was shocked actually by how few people died in Chernobyl, and the most recent accident, Fukushima, the scientists agree that nobody will die from the radiation that escaped, and that, too is explained by the energy density. So what we find is that bio-mass, burning wood and fossil fuels kill about seven million a year from smoke. And so that smoke is just a function of all of that waste product being in the air, people breathing it. With nuclear, even in the worst accident, only a tiny amount of material escapes, and so the energy density of the fuel also determines just how much air pollution there is going to be."

The second is that in the '60s, more in the '60s, but still around today, there were concerns that too much cheap energy, too much nuclear energy would result in over-population and over-consumption. And then the third one, which in some ways is the most powerful is just a really strong desire to use energy to harmonize with the natural world that turns out to be a bad idea, because the more natural resources we use, the worse it is for the natural environment."

But one thing many of them appear to agree on is wholeheartedly embracing the foreign policy agenda of Bill Kristol, whether it is Syria or Venezuela, or Russia, there is an opportunity for the United States to sponsor violent conflicts somewhere in the world, they support it. The only exception to this is Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. She is a sincere progressive. She is a veteran and she says she wants to keep America out of pointless foreign wars and for that, she has been repeatedly attacked in Washington. Congresswoman Gabbard joins us tonight. Congresswoman, thanks very much for coming on. I know that you have been criticized for straying out of approved media outlets. I am sure you'll be criticized for coming on the show tonight. I just want to reassure Democratic voters, we disagree on many, many - probably most things. You are a sincere progressive, but one place that I admire your courage is your unwillingness to go along with the foreign policy views of everyone else in Washington. And really have been attacked for it. Why do you think that is?"

In Congress now for over the last six years, I have served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as the Armed Services Committee and I have seen how self-serving powerful politicians from both parties have continued this foreign policy regime change war view, where they think that we, the United States should be acting as the policeman of the world and that we should continue to go around and overthrowing and toppling dictators or countries who we don't like, costing us, the American people trillions of dollars in the process, causing more suffering in the countries where we go and wage these wars and oh, by the way undermining our own national security as we are seeing playing out before our eyes in countries like North Korea."

So while I am deeply concerned about the fact that this Summit yesterday ended without an agreement, because we need to see denuclearization in the Korean peninsula, it's not surprising because of this policy, this regime change war policy, that again, leaders in both parties in the Foreign Policy establishment here in Washington have perpetuated over and over and over again."

But not pointing out the fact and not facing the truth that in each of these different example of regime change led by the United States, it has resulted in far more suffering for the people who they are supposedly trying to help. And there's a lot of different motives for this. You can look at corporate greed. You can look at who actually benefits financially from these wars if you want to see why they are continuing and why it perpetuates again by self-serving powerful politicians and leaders in both parties."

The other day, we covered the left's discovery that knitting is racist. Right after that segment aired, you e-mailed us in volume. Here are a few. From Linda Devine, quote, \"Hey, some of those shorts were of crochet, not knitting. Please don't lump us in with those horrible knitters.\" Fair point. Charles Doby wrote this, \"I am offended that this video is showing crocheters who use one hook instead of two that is used in knitting. Make it stop!\" Exclamation point. And this from Myca Lynn Beller, quote, \"You know a man probably put that segment together and has no clue about the difference between knitting and crocheting.\" Oh, busted. It's true. We would never want to lump crocheters in with those racist knitters, but we want to warn people that crocheting could always choose to self-identify as knitting. So actually, there's some fluidity in the handicrafts community that we should think about. We will be back tomorrow. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
