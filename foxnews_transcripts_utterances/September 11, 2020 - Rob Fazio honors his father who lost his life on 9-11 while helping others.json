And he thought it was going to be an easy day. Just before he had walked into the classroom, he'd been told that it appears a small twin-engine prop plane had crashed into one of the towers at the World Trade Center in New York City. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I remember his reaction to hearing that was, oh, what a horrible accident.

The door shut. I'm standing there when the acting national security adviser on the trip, a Navy Captain Deborah Loewer, said: \"Sir, it appears another plane hit the other tower at the World Trade Center.\" And that's when I knew it couldn't have been an accident, it couldn't have been a coincidence. And so I had to pass a test that chiefs of staff have to pass all the time. Does the president need to know? Sometimes, you pass the test. Sometimes, you don't pass it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This one, yes, the president needed to know. And I thought about what I would say. I walked into the classroom and finally got the chance to go up, without -- I didn't want to interrupt the cadence of the event. They were second graders sitting in front of the president, getting ready to read a story with them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The press were all -- was surprised that I had walked into the back of the room.

He did not see me coming. I leaned over and whispered into his right ear: \"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\" I then stood back from him, so that he wouldn't ask me a question or start a dialogue. I presumed there was a boom microphone picking up everything that was going to be said, and I didn't want to have a dialogue with him. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But it was an unbelievably rare message to deliver to a president.

He's also leveraging this idea that the recovery -- he's acknowledging there's a recovery, just saying it's not working for everybody. And that sort of plays into one of Biden's strengths, which is that voters think that they trust more -- trusts him more and he cares more about people like them. Then the last thing he's doing is, he's trying to walk away from some of the more radical elements of the party, the ban on fracking, New Green Deal, those sorts of things. But, as we have just seen, this is going to -- at some point, it's starting to run and will run into -- headlong into his vote in favor of NAFTA, his vote for most favored nation status with China.

So, I think -- I always think it's smart for someone like Biden now, as he did in the general, to not every day just be hammering on and saying Trump's the worst person ever, Trump is the worst president, because I think it hurts him with some of these swing voters who are trying to make up their mind. And I think it actually one of his advantages as we head into the general, that he's able to make some of these kind of acknowledgments.

He was OK. But, no, no, no, no, he was worried about his people, 175 co-workers who worked in that tower, wanted to make sure they all got out. So he got them out. He did the best to get each and every one of them out. They're alive today because he did that, a good many of them. He held the door for them, even though it slammed on him when he most needed it. His son, Rob Fazio, has become a quick friend of mine. I have known him all the years, watch him grow and get married, have a child. I understand, I understand another one could be on the way. But I'm deeply honored to have you back, Rob. And I always think of your dad this time. And I'm so glad we're on remote, because, emotionally, I think I might be able to handle this better than last time. But here's the thing about your dad. You didn't know 19 years ago where the heck he was, like so many they were missing. And you would put out signs and photographs, here he is, here he is, if you see this man. And then, to coax your dad, there were the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups attached to that. What did that mean? ROB FAZIO, SON OF SEPTEMBER 11 VICTIM: It was something where he had a heart condition. He wasn't allowed to eat sweets, but he did anyway. So, we put on a flyer: If found, please feed Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. And he's become such a symbol of positivity that the 9/11 Museum actually asked if they could have the onesie that our daughter Reese we named after him to be in the museum. They also asked, Neil, if we could have one of your onesies as well. So, I thought maybe you would check on that.",

And he thought it was going to be an easy day. Just before he had walked into the classroom, he'd been told that it appears a small twin-engine prop plane had crashed into one of the towers at the World Trade Center in New York City. And I remember his reaction to hearing that was, oh, what a horrible accident. The pilot must have had a heart attack or something."

And so I had to pass a test that chiefs of staff have to pass all the time. Does the president need to know? Sometimes, you pass the test. Sometimes, you don't pass it. This one, yes, the president needed to know. And I thought about what I would say. I walked into the classroom and finally got the chance to go up, without -- I didn't want to interrupt the cadence of the event. They were second graders sitting in front of the president, getting ready to read a story with them. The press were all -- was surprised that I had walked into the back of the room. I came in kind of backstage. And I remember Ann Compton from ABC gesturing, \"What's up?\" And I motioned two planes crashing in. And she motioned back, \"What?\""

I presumed there was a boom microphone picking up everything that was going to be said, and I didn't want to have a dialogue with him.

Leaving the virus aside, the high crime, the inefficiencies, the high taxes, all of that combining to create an environment that at least the commissioner indicates won't be hospitable maybe for quite sometime to come. A number of business leaders have already relayed that to the mayor of New York City. We're going to talk to one of them.

But the city also faces a deficit of $9 billion over the next two years, which might include 22,000 layoffs of government workers in the coming weeks. But citizens are concerned over the spike in violent crime. Over the past four weeks, there has been a jump of nearly 50 percent in killings, shootings more than doubling from last year. De Blasio says he has asked for more money from New York state, which they have not yet authorized. But some good news for the city today, as the biggest bank in America is getting back to work. J.P. Morgan announced that its senior trading and sales staff will be back to the New York City offices by September 21.

I think you saw a movement occur this week in the past seven days around restaurants. Now, that's 25 percent capacity. And I think the governor has been helpful in guiding it to potentially it could get to 50 percent. I spoke to a great restauranteur, Danny Meyer, today, who is hopeful that he could see up to 25, get from 25 to 50. I think the real issue is how the New York City partnership always worked. It's a partnership between government, all those companies that signed on, and bringing better things to the city. And we want to be part of the solution. And I'm hopeful that the letter causes us to have more help to guide all the things that need to cause our people to feel safe. I was down at the memorial this morning across from our office. And it was somewhat heartening seeing the amount of people there. And, of course, 9/11 is always a very tough day for the world, for America, and specifically for New Yorkers and those in Lower Manhattan. But there was an outpouring of people there.

Is it that bad, that nothing can happen under this mayor because he has been tone-deaf to some of these concerns?

But it will resume full-throttle tomorrow, as the candidates hit the campaign trail and target a lot of these battleground states, where jobs are the issue, and, more importantly, American jobs. Don't be surprised if you keep hearing this made in America theme that will be very big both for Joe Biden and the president of the United States. Tom Bevan of RealClearPolitics with us right now, David Burstein, the Democratic strategist, Lauren Claffey, the Republican strategist. So, Tom, this issue now, the economy becomes a front-and-center issue again. In battleground states, it's sort of like a flip of some of this other stuff. Some of the gains that they had seen were stymied by the virus, as they were elsewhere, but the concern about jobs that could still migrate to other countries or particularly south of the border. The president's been arguing, it's a lot better with the trade deals he crafted than the ones Joe Biden and Barack Obama crafted. Who's winning this argument thus far?"

I mean, it's just starting to get joined, I mean, obviously. But Biden is doing some really smart, shrewd things, right? Number one, he's copied Trump's playbook. I mean, everything he's talking about sounds like it could be right out of Donald Trump's mouth, in terms of bring jobs back to America, building things in America, buying things made in America. He's also leveraging this idea that the recovery -- he's acknowledging there's a recovery, just saying it's not working for everybody. And that sort of plays into one of Biden's strengths, which is that voters think that they trust more -- trusts him more and he cares more about people like them. Then the last thing he's doing is, he's trying to walk away from some of the more radical elements of the party, the ban on fracking, New Green Deal, those sorts of things. But, as we have just seen, this is going to -- at some point, it's starting to run and will run into -- headlong into his vote in favor of NAFTA, his vote for most favored nation status with China. And he's going to have to answer those questions. And so far, he hasn't -- his initial swipes at those answers have not been adequate, I don't think."

And there's stubborn kind of, how do I balance that to say, well, this president is doing a worse job, when, statistically, the gains that he was experiencing were better, certainly prior to the virus, than the Obama/Biden administration. How do you play that?"

And now we're in the current reality, which I think, for a lot of voters, supersedes the trade deals that may have been signed back at the beginning of this year. And, look, you did see in that interview Biden acknowledge some of the improvements over NAFTA. And the deal does include big parts of TPP, which, of course, Obama and Biden put together and championed, along with people in Congress. And there was some bipartisan support for USMCA. So, I think -- I always think it's smart for someone like Biden now, as he did in the general, to not every day just be hammering on and saying Trump's the worst person ever, Trump is the worst president, because I think it hurts him with some of these swing voters who are trying to make up their mind. And I think it actually one of his advantages as we head into the general, that he's able to make some of these kind of acknowledgments. But it doesn't change the fact that the economic reality today, there was a pandemic. A pandemic did happen. The response was not handled well. And here we are, and people are hurting all over this country. And I would -- the more important thing than a trade deal is the failure, current failure on both sides of Congress to actually get a new stimulus relief bill done for people who are hurting from the pandemic."

I believe now it's down to three that are in that category, six others that might be near that category, but way down. In other words, the trend is could be the president's political friend here, if this stabilizes, and that's why Joe Biden is now pivoting to this issue of manufacturing jobs and how secure you are in these battleground states, because he knows that. What do you think?"

    {
      "speaker": "LAUREN CLAFFEY, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST",

However, the economy and their jobs and the being able to provide for their families is often number two. Health care is number three. I mean, it's all right there. So, especially when you're targeting Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, these battleground states that are very blue-collar, labor-heavy, you have to talk about these trade deals and these -- and stopping the outsourcing of jobs. So many of these communities have been devastated by jobs going overseas to China, jobs going to Mexico. And so even though the USMCA did not go into effect until July of this year, so we haven't really seen the full effects of it yet, it's still a signature trade deal that Trump can tout that really stresses his populist sentiments. And I think that's another key issue that we're going to see here, less about trade, but more about elitist vs. global -- elitist vs. populism, globalism vs. protectionism, some of these things that really make Americans feel that Biden is out of touch with where they are, and Trump is in line."

Morgan for saying all of their employees are going to come back to work on September the 21st, because that's his goal. He's not winning on some of the other issues, particularly on the coronavirus. So, if he can keep it on the economy, the president thinks he can win. Something that may help him with Jewish voters, though, is -- was announced today, the president announcing that Israel and Bahrain are going to normalize relations.

Kevin, what prompted that?  KEVIN LAWRENCE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TEXAS MUNICIPAL POLICE ASSOCIATION: Well, the fact that the city council decided to cut the police department budget by fully one-third, by $150 million, is what led to it.

He was OK. But, no, no, no, no, he was worried about his people, 175 co-workers who worked in that tower, wanted to make sure they all got out. So he got them out. He did the best to get each and every one of them out. They're alive today because he did that, a good many of them. He held the door for them, even though it slammed on him when he most needed it. His son, Rob Fazio, has become a quick friend of mine. I have known him all the years, watch him grow and get married, have a child. I understand, I understand another one could be on the way. But I'm deeply honored to have you back, Rob. And I always think of your dad this time.

You didn't know 19 years ago where the heck he was, like so many they were missing. And you would put out signs and photographs, here he is, here he is, if you see this man.

Right now, during this time, it's very tough for everyone. And, basically, we weren't sure what we were going to do. My wife woke up 4:30 in the morning. She's the leader of our house. She said, we're going."

And what I like to talk about is how we were. And that brings me back to the connections and the conversations and the sense of community and support. And I feel like America needs to get back there. And that's why I needed to go."

      "utterance": "Rob, the one thing I'm always amazed -- and we have repeated this through the years -- that your dad was safe, could have gotten out, everything was fine, but he had this obligation to go back, make sure everyone else was fine. Those kinds of stories always amaze me, because so many were rushing out of those towers. And here he was staying in there, making sure everyone was OK. And I have always asked you -- and you have always been polite -- does it get you angry, in retrospect, he could have survived, he did survive, everything as OK, but that gallantry cost you a relationship with your dad and your children with their granddad? He'd be 76 years young today. And you never had that, because of that bravery of his. In a way, it's got to have mixed emotions."

      "speaker": "FAZIO",
      "utterance": "I didn't lose my relationship with him. It strengthened my relationship with him. And think about this, Neil. If people around the world know your father's legacy and the spirit and the way he lived his life, my daughter and my next daughter are going to know what a tremendous man that he was and what he did in such tough moments. And I think that's one of the things that we have to do, is realizing acts of kindness are important, but so are acts of understanding, understanding other people, and really just realizing we have a choice in how to respond to crisis or trauma or to not having your grandfather around as a little child. And we intend to raise them to be strong, just like we all are."

      "utterance": "We're hanging in well. There's always a wave of different emotions. And, for me, it's -- it sounds weird, but it's one of my favorite days of the year, because I am able to think about Hold the Door and what we're going to be doing in our next programs. And during this crisis, we are able to reach out to so many people, and that really makes my dad's legacy present."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It's living alive and well in you, Rob. The Hold the Door Foundation, Hold the Door For Others, is something that has grown exponentially to look at the good that can come out of a tragedy. Rob, I wish you well and your beautiful family.
