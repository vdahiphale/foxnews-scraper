And we begin with a tweet from October 15, 2020. On that day, then candidate Joe Biden boldly declare in a tweet: We're eight months into the pandemic and Donald Trump still doesn't have a plan to get this virus under control. I do. He later promised to shut down the virus. Tonight, if there was a plan to shut down the virus, it clearly is not working. According to Biden's own administration, we're now entering in a period of severe illness and death. But today, Joe Biden didn't change course, or offered a new solution. Instead, he doubled down on masks and vaccine mandates and other draconian restrictions, calling them unpopular but effective. Watch.",

And I think it's just been incredibly frustrating as an American citizen to watch failure after failure and feel like we're not getting information whatsoever out of this White House. If you look at specifically where we are right now with the omicron variant, if this White House wanted people to take it seriously and put a little stock in what they say, then they could be transparent with us. They could tell us that while this variant of COVID is very transmissible, it's likely the least lethal COVID variant that we will see. In fact, there has been one death linked to the omicron variant thus far. Instead, they tell us we're going to have a winter for unvaccinated people of severe illness and death for the unvaccinated, for their families. We're going to overrun hospitals. There's absolutely nothing to back that up. But all they want to do is just scare tactics, it's fear mongering. It's all about politics. But they are terrified, Lawrence, Joe just said it. They know 2022 and 2024 is coming up quickly. They know they have failed the American people at every single turn. They don't know what to do about it. So I guess the answer is more control. I guess the answer is to make people afraid, keep the masks going, keep the mandates going, make sure that our frontline workers are leaving their jobs over these insane vaccine mandates. Keep the issues with the supply chain going because of it as well. It's all bad for America. We have no transparency.

You couple that with the fact that we're making them wear masks at a time when they're supposed to be learning how to correlate people's facial expressions with what they're saying, which is a very important part of socialization process. And we're not taking into consideration any of the ramifications of what we're doing. It's like you're going ahead with blinders on. And almost like zombies, everybody has to have this vaccine, you know? The fact of the matter is, we have a tremendous medical system here.

That's certainly contributed to rising gas prices. He opened the borders, so we had a record surge of illegal immigration. The embarrassing and dangerous surrender in Afghanistan. And then, you know, the only solution is spending more money. That's a double whammy. Not only do you create way more -- you know, way more dollars chasing too few goods, so that's the definition of inflation, but you're spending those dollars to make it possible for people not to re- engage in the workforce. So, you don't have the manufacturers to hire enough people, so that also exacerbates the supply of goods. So the policies of the Democrats, this is what we are seeing the results of, but it is their policy. It's accurate to call the Biden administration incompetent, but that's way too kind. These are their policies. The results of their policies were obvious from the start. And now, Americans are waking up to it.",

And when the CBO score came out, Joe Manchin said I can't buy this. Plus, he was highly concerned about inflation, as we all should be. Six-point- eight percent consumer price index for the last 12 months, 9.75 percent producer price index, this is disastrous for the very people Democrats purport to represent -- seniors on fixed income and people at the lower income of our income spectrum. Inflation hurts them the most. You know, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, they're -- they're not going to be harmed by inflation. They're rolling in the dough based on these COVID shutdowns.

He later promised to shut down the virus. Tonight, if there was a plan to shut down the virus, it clearly is not working. According to Biden's own administration, we're now entering in a period of severe illness and death. But today, Joe Biden didn't change course, or offered a new solution.

And this is an administration and president that time after time continues to be completely caught off-guard on things they should see from a country mile away. Wait, the Taliban has captured Kabul? We didn't see that coming. Wait, wait, inflation isn't transitory? It will be here for sometime, wow, we didn't see that coming. Wait, law enforcement isn't the problem? Skyrocketing violent crime is happening because police are demonized and criminals don't fear prosecution because bail laws have been neutered? Wow, we didn't see that coming. And, wait, migrants are flooding the border after we invited them in, stopped building the wall and attacked our own border patrol? Wow, we didn't see what happening. This testing should have ramped up months ago, Lawrence, as you know. As usual, team Biden, daylight, dime short. For them to say we didn't see this variant coming shows you they are exceptional about complaining and placing blame and not so good on governing, on inflation, on crime, on the border, on education, on Afghanistan, find an issue Democrats can win on and run on in 2022, win valuable prizes.

He got Operation Warp Speed done. He got us a vaccine in record time, because he was able to get all of that red tape out of the way.

And I think it's just been incredibly frustrating as an American citizen to watch failure after failure and feel like we're not getting information whatsoever out of this White House. If you look at specifically where we are right now with the omicron variant, if this White House wanted people to take it seriously and put a little stock in what they say, then they could be transparent with us. They could tell us that while this variant of COVID is very transmissible, it's likely the least lethal COVID variant that we will see. In fact, there has been one death linked to the omicron variant thus far. Instead, they tell us we're going to have a winter for unvaccinated people of severe illness and death for the unvaccinated, for their families. We're going to overrun hospitals. There's absolutely nothing to back that up. But all they want to do is just scare tactics, it's fear mongering. It's all about politics. But they are terrified, Lawrence, Joe just said it. They know 2022 and 2024 is coming up quickly. They know they have failed the American people at every single turn. They don't know what to do about it. So I guess the answer is more control. I guess the answer is to make people afraid, keep the masks going, keep the mandates going, make sure that our frontline workers are leaving their jobs over these insane vaccine mandates. Keep the issues with the supply chain going because of it as well. It's all bad for America. We have no transparency. Who knows who is really running the country, and no one believes them, no one buys any of this at this point anymore."

I mean, if you want to see a super spreader event, see how the president doesn't know basic science and what to do when you're coughing and not to get it all over him and put it all over the podium. I mean, this is basic stuff. This is rules for thee, and not for me."

I love this whole thing where, you know, for instance, even the press secretary walks out with a mask, then does a to 45-minute press conference without a mask while reporters are wearing masks asking questions and puts it on and walks back out. There's no common sense in this in any way, shape, or form. But, now, look, I just don't understand how the president and the press secretary particularly really is the face of this administration. And let's face it, continues to attack Joe Manchin as they did over the weekend."

Three quarters of West Virginians oppose the Build Back Better bill. So, if you're Joe Manchin, what else should you have done than say, you know what? If I'm against this, I'm sure if we spend trillions more, that will increase inflation more, we're at a 40-year high, and we should put pause on this until we have a better idea of where we are from an economic perspective, from an inflationary perspective. But, of course, the administration tried to go ahead with this anyway, Democrats did. And, again, this is something they will rue the day that they decided to go big on this instead of trying to get individual bills passed, Lawrence, right? Shavings make a pile, get some little wins here and there on certain issues and then maybe build some momentum. Instead, this was a calculation that when we look back at this presidency, this was the end of it because they went too big and it was too big not to fail."

But he has a constituency who the Democrats, by the way, are making fun of. We'll cover that later. Joe Concha, Lara Trump, thanks so much for joining me tonight.

According to the Biden administration, if we're really, really good and obedient, at some point in the future, we might not have to wear a mask all the time. Here now to react, author of \"Why America Matters,\" former HUD secretary, Dr. Ben Carson. Doctor, thanks so much for joining me tonight. Doctor, you have treated a ton of patients. People know you for what you're able to do that no one else knows is take the twins apart from each other.

And it is developing at a rapid rate from the time of conception. When a baby is born, almost all of the organs have matured except for the brain. The brain continues to develop into your 20s. And we are now trying to take these children and take advantage of the fact that their parents are not involved in a decision-making and trying to twist them and manipulate them and it's nothing short of child abuse, quite frankly. You couple that with the fact that we're making them wear masks at a time when they're supposed to be learning how to correlate people's facial expressions with what they're saying, which is a very important part of socialization process. And we're not taking into consideration any of the ramifications of what we're doing. It's like you're going ahead with blinders on. And almost like zombies, everybody has to have this vaccine, you know? The fact of the matter is, we have a tremendous medical system here. It and why not let people have the real information and work with their healthcare providers, one size does not fit all. Certainly for elderly people, you know, the vaccination seem to make good sense, when you do a benefit/risk analysis. But for young people, particularly for children who are healthy, who have almost zero risk from the virus, why would you now subject them to long- term risks that you don't know anything about."

      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "It's exactly right, Doctor. I got to ask you something. Dr. Fauci was just on another network, MSNBC, and when a reporter asked him if you should allow a family member to your house for Christmas if they haven't been vaccinated, he said, I would don't that. For someone that we trust, Doctor, what is your advice on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "Well, my advice is to use some common sense. If they're -- if your family member has had COVID and has natural immunity, they are safer than somebody who's had vaccinations. If they've had vaccinations, that's good. And if they're healthy and you're healthy, that's good. But, you know, you need to take all those things into consideration. But, you know, to act like the police, that's not necessary, and particularly, given the fact that the omicron variant is not very virulent. You may get a sniffle and maybe a slight cough. You're not going to be very sick. And it's going to spread very, very rapidly. Everybody is going to have it. I predict with all of the testing we're going to be doing, we'll have massive numbers of people who test positive and this administration will have no idea what to do with them?"

We're going to have massive numbers of people who test positive. What are we going to do? Are we going to shut everything down? It doesn't make any sense. And, particularly, if you're dealing with something that doesn't make people very sick, we need to be particularly concerned about our elderly people and the people who have a lot of comorbid conditions and we need to direct our attention to them. But we also need to be looking at therapeutics. You know, we have the Merck anti-viral, we have the Pfizer anti-viral, which show tremendous promise, decreasing hospitalizations by 89 percent. Are you kidding me? We're not pushing that? That should be -- that should be an emergency. We should get that out. And then when people do test positive, we've got something to do."

And it doesn't stop there. According to a new poll from the Morning Consult, just 10 percent of voters say Democratic accomplishments more than they expected. Surge in inflation, rise in energy costs, with no end in sight is a stark reminder of the failure of Joe Biden and the failure of the Democratic agenda. Get this, according to a new CNN poll, Biden's economic numbers have cratered to a point even lower than Jimmy Carter. It shows you how much people are losing confidence with the Biden presidency. Here now in reaction, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson. Senator, thanks so much for joining us tonight. I think a lot of voters are starting to have buyer's remorse because they see that Joe doesn't only not have the stamina, but everything that he promised as far as being a moderate, he sure had lied to the American people and now he wants to blame your colleague, Joe Manchin."

That's certainly contributed to rising gas prices. He opened the borders, so we had a record surge of illegal immigration. The embarrassing and dangerous surrender in Afghanistan. And then, you know, the only solution is spending more money. That's a double whammy. Not only do you create way more -- you know, way more dollars chasing too few goods, so that's the definition of inflation, but you're spending those dollars to make it possible for people not to re- engage in the workforce. So, you don't have the manufacturers to hire enough people, so that also exacerbates the supply of goods. So the policies of the Democrats, this is what we are seeing the results of, but it is their policy. It's accurate to call the Biden administration incompetent, but that's way too kind. These are their policies. The results of their policies were obvious from the start. And now, Americans are waking up to it."

Because it seems like he was very transparent on where he stood on this piece of legislation. He thought it was way too much spending. He communicated that to the White House, he communicated that to the American public. But it seems like the Biden administration weren't willing to, you know, compromise on the issue. And when he said he was done, they decided to have his staffers out there and leak and smear this man."

And, of course, they developed a plan of incredibly dishonest scoring, scoring something that's really about $5 trillion in spending, scoring that at $1.75 trillion. And when the CBO score came out, Joe Manchin said I can't buy this. Plus, he was highly concerned about inflation, as we all should be. Six-point- eight percent consumer price index for the last 12 months, 9.75 percent producer price index, this is disastrous for the very people Democrats purport to represent -- seniors on fixed income and people at the lower income of our income spectrum. Inflation hurts them the most. You know, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, they're -- they're not going to be harmed by inflation. They're rolling in the dough based on these COVID shutdowns. It's the poor people. It's the elderly that are really hurt by inflation -- again, inflation caused by Democrat policies."

If prices are rising out of control, that damages your ability to live in your life. Bette Midler doesn't understand that because she's a very wealthy actress, and God bless her for her success. And for my colleague from New York, he's forgotten that the money that is spent by this administration and the terrible COVID policies, from the two governors of New York now, are what crushed the poor people of my former home state of New York.

Donald Trump got 68 percent of the vote in West Virginia and here you have, you know, Joe Manchin, a Democrat, trying to run and win in a state that's heavily Republican. You have to be smart about your votes. So when you have Bette Midler and attacking West Virginia, West Virginia understands that Build Back Better has a slew of green new deal provisions that kills energy that kills West Virginia jobs and raises their taxes. But if I can make one other point on the race issue, I mean, whether you're socialism or communism, massive debt or inflation, it doesn't care about the pigment of your skin, it affects all of us with different pigment on this panel the same. That's why if you go to Venezuela or Cuba, you can have people with more pigment and they're getting destroyed by this policies. They destroy families and economies equally. And that's why good smart Republicans are standing up and pushing back. Thank God for Joe Manchin saying, listen, this will destroy the American Dream, I don't care if you're poor, or rich, or black, or white, or man or woman, it's going to kill us all.

Republicans, Bryon won't be able to do anything, you know, pass any legislation because Joe Biden will never sign it. So, the best hope for America is we stop this craziness. And if you in the Senate and have a good 2024, you can actually roll back some of these policies. But Democrats understand if you get build back better in the place, they know it's almost impossible to roll those policies back. Remember when John McCain said no to Obamacare and they hailed him as a maverick, isn't he a wonderful Republican who voted no against the reformed Obamacare. Where are the Democrats right now? Saying, you know what? I love Joe Manchin. He's a maverick. He's going his own way. They don't quite say that right now. They hate mavericks in the Democrat Party. But they love them in the Republican Party. But we're going to say no to the agenda and hopefully have a great 2022 and 2024, and get America back on track. And as you said, is to put America first.

Now, authorities say he's linked to several subjects of interest and they don't know how he got the jacket he used as a disguise. And get this, a new report from FoxNews.com citing multiple sources saying even Uber drivers are aiding in the transport of illegal migrants into the U.S. interior. Now, conditions at the border are getting so bad that even Biden is being forced to face reality. The Department of Homeland Security announced they will use funds left over from president Trump to fill in the gaps for the border wall.

Thank you so much, Pastor, so much for joining us."

My mentor Sean will be back soon. Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left you tonight. Thanks so much for joining us. Be sure to follow on Twitter and Instagram @LawrenceBJones. And have a great night. Let your heart not be troubled. Jesse Watters is filling in for Laura Ingraham tonight -- Jesse."
