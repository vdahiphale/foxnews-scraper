Big long day today as we covered the impeachment hearings that will continue on Friday, but you only get one chance to make a good first impression. And Democrats said that they were putting their strongest witnesses out front today to make their case for the impeachment of President Trump to the American public. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York and this is “The Story.” Congressman Eric Swalwell is here. He was asking questions of Bill Taylor and George Kent today. Plus the president's son, Eric Trump with his first response to the case being made against the president. We will also get reaction from former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley.

So that means Wednesday with Watters. Jesse is here tonight. Good day for that. But first, we go back to the big question of the evening. Who scored points today?

Big long day today as we covered the impeachment hearings that will continue on Friday, but you only get one chance to make a good first impression. And Democrats said that they were putting their strongest witnesses out front today to make their case for the impeachment of President Trump to the American public. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York and this is “The Story.” Congressman Eric Swalwell is here. He was asking questions of Bill Taylor and George Kent today. Plus the president's son, Eric Trump with his first response to the case being made against the president. We will also get reaction from former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley. And her surprising answer to the question that she has been asked a lot this week. And of course, it's Wednesday. So that means Wednesday with Watters. Jesse is here tonight. Good day for that. But first, we go back to the big question of the evening. Who scored points today? One Democrat aide was quoted in the Washington Post this morning who said, we're screwed, no bombshells, no revelations, the onus is on us to wow some people this week. But were there wow moments? Just to remind you what those look like, here are some big ones from the past."

They've served all over the world. Ambassadors Taylor signed up after being fifth in his class at West Point to go to Vietnam and they just wanted to do the right thing.

That's what they're they do sort of part of the institution of government in many ways. But when it came to sort of push came to shove, with the cross examination and the questions of them. So what happened because of all of this, and those, you know, kind of fell a little bit flat in terms of what was actually the outcome of the things that they were so disturbed about. What did you think about that?"

This was offensive because this is just not what we do as Americans. We don't ask foreign governments to investigate our political opponents. And I don't think the facts are really in much dispute here. You're going to see that in the next couple of weeks. I think what is in dispute is, is this who we are as a country? And we're gonna have to answer that in the coming week."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And that's something that every American is going to have to decide for themselves as they look at this. So my question for you as, you know, an attorney, you know, in terms of how well your case was made, when it turns out that the things that were discussed, don't actually end up happening. Is that a convincing argument in this courtroom that is the Congress right now?"

So you don't get points as the president when you stop the shakedown because now someone has pulled the fire alarm and the first responders are showing up. But second, in America, you're still held accountable for an attempt at wrongdoing. And I think there's no going back. If we decide as a country that any president, Republican or Democrat can ask foreign governments to investigate their opponents, that that is no longer America. And I think the American people are going to say, we don't want to go there."

What about the argument that Republicans put out there today, which was, you know, that when you sort of go through the -- all of the different points here in this sort of argument that they've laid out, that it falls overall, that it falls -- it falls short, you know, that these guys had second and third hand, I thought one of the most powerful moments actually from Jim Jordan, you know, just sort of putting up points on both sides when people were scoring was when he said, now, he read that part of the transcript which was like, he told him and then he told him, and then he told him, and then he told her, and then she told him. It was like five or six degrees of separation, that neither one of these people had ever had a conversation with the President about any of this."

      "speaker": "SWALWELL",

These witnesses were witnesses to what agents of the president were doing. Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland and Rudy Giuliani. They had firsthand knowledge because they were being asked to carry out the shakedown scheme. But they also laid out what was at stake what it meant to the Ukrainians in a life or death manner to not get this aid. And finally, Martha, if the President of the United States is innocent, he will send the firsthand witnesses, John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney to Congress. If he's guilty, he'll stop us from hearing it hard stop."

This was only coming from the president. Again, I think that's a consciousness of guilt. If he went through the proper channels, he knew that it would be rejected because there is no evidence there.

I would be murdered if I did half of what Hunter Biden did.

Why when he's on the phone with this Ukrainian president, when he opened the door to ask you a question about his political adversary, who he's probably going to run about, he gave them this on a silver platter with that phone call.

He wasn't going to make the second debate and all of a sudden, here's the authority on impeaching my father. The reality is they have a bunch of Doug candidates on the other side, right? Biden can't get through two sentences without stuttering. Warren has zero chance of winning. I mean, I could -- I could go through the list but they're not going to do. Bloomberg. You think Bloomberg is going to win Middle America. He's got zero chance in the world and I could keep on going. They know they don't have anybody. At the same time, you've got markets hitting record highs, you've have this country doing incredibly well. I was walking down the street to come here tonight. People were chanting USA, USA, USA, tell your father to go get these guys. This is a total sham. There is not a single person outside the Washington, D.C. beltway that gives a damn about what happened today. It's boring. They were supposed to put on theater. They did a horrible job.

There was a report in Axios today by an Uber-connected Republican who said Rudy will be cut loose because he was rogue.

Somebody better get answers to these things because it's wrong to this country.

Their star witness today admitted he's never met the president. He wasn't on the phone call with him and he was providing us second and third-hand accounts. The fact of the matter is the aid flowed to the Ukraine. There's no evidence in the transcript we've all read that there was any offer of a quid pro quo.

Is that a path that would ever happen, a secret ballot in the Senate?"

There's no way that people are going to run away from their vote. The President deserves a fair treatment. He's been treated unfairly to this point. And every single one of us needs to listen to the testimony and see a pattern of behavior that started before he was ever sworn into office.

It all started when students from the Daily Northwestern covered protests of a speech by Jeff Sessions. But when the paper published photos of students at the protest that you are seeing right now, and then they were reached out to buy some of the reporters for an interview about what happened that night, they faced a campus backlash. In response, the paper wrote an editorial apologizing, saying, quote, \"Some of our staff members who were covering the event used Northwestern's directory to obtain phone numbers for students beforehand and texted them to ask if they would be willing to be interviewed. We recognize that being contacted like this is an invasion of privacy.\" But that response caused an uproar among alumni and journalist, understandably so. Joining me now, Jonathan Hoenig, founder of Capitalist Pig hedge fund, and a Fox News Network contributor who was once featured on the cover of the Daily Northwestern when he was a student there. There he is. Jonathan, good to have you here. I mean, first of all, the headline is that Jeff Sessions, you know, got shouted out at that place, the protesters were sort of overwhelming, and it became an unsafe situation or potentially unsafe situation and he had to be escorted out of there."
