But that F-150 Lightning that he got into today cost a minimum of $70,000 to purchase and buy. And who drives F-150s? The working class, the middle class, people who need to get back and forth to work, people who do hard jobs that require manual labor. So this idea now that the federal government is going to try and mandate or coerce private companies to not just sell these vehicles but for people to buy them is going to be very difficult considering the front end cost of that. You add in then this inflation on regular everyday goods, whether it's building supplies, food, or other necessary items on top of the gas shortage that we just saw, I'm not sure it's going to be an easy sell for the president when he is up on Capitol Hill trying to get Democrats who represent working class districts in tough elections for 2022, especially in the House, to get on board with this plan.",

They disproportionately benefit wealthy residents of blue states. This was politically one of the smartest things the Trump administration did because it not only gave them billions and billions of dollars of revenue, it put these blue state Democrats in really difficult positions, particularly in the northeast, and also you have in California. And you have progressives, real progressives, like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who have come out against the SALT. And so it's really created an intraparty dispute. And, look, Biden did not put the SALT repeal into his plan, but there's a real push on Capitol Hill from Schumer, Pelosi, and a bunch of members from some of these blue states that are affected who are going to try to put this in the infrastructure bill.

And I think in the early days of this Biden economy, we are seeing an approach that, unfortunately, is going to lead to increasing problems for the working class in America. You're juicing the economy to a great degree. You are seeing inflationary rises in prices for goods that you have to buy, that you need in order to live and work. And I think that while there are a lot of Americans who are insulated from this, this is not the kind of thing that you can survive in the long term if you are a working class American.
