      "sentences": "All right, now, the one thing that the president did propose today and seemed to think he could do this by executive order or at least something to act on his own to do, and maybe work it out in the courts later, is take away these so-called bump stocks, the devices which weren't used necessarily in this school shooting, but was of course a key part of that Las Vegas shooting that claimed 58 lives, a device that essentially can make a semiautomatic weapon behave like an automatic one. But, beyond that, there is some consternation over where the middle ground will be. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's discuss this with the Republican governor of Maine, Paul LePage, who joins me right now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Governor, I know you were with the president today among those governors.

PAUL LEPAGE, R—MAINE: I believe that background checks are absolutely important. But as I said to the president today and asked him to -- we have to take a look at mentally -- mental illness in this country.

And so I think that that needs to be loosened up and we need to have the ability to do that. I do believe that there was a lot of good dialogue today. I think there's a lot of good suggestions being made. But I do believe that we have to get the guns away from people in domestic violence.
