One monster fire in the north near Sacramento and two in the south were too much of the coverage frankly focuses on the homes of celebrities being burned.

To say it doesn't have limit is the actual outlier perspective that I think some people actually think it should have as much money and as much scope as it wants.

So on the night that this happened, there was an MSNBC banner headline, \"the plot to stop Mueller.\" And the thing is, Whitaker, he hasn't done a single thing to stop Mueller, to slow down Mueller, to impede Mueller. Now he might and that would be very big news. But the coverage is all about he could do this and could do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "But it is exactly why the coverage is what it is, because people know that he isn't one of these people who is totally supportive of anything that the FBI might do or anything that this Mueller investigation might do. A lot of people unfortunately at DOJ and FBI have been obstructing efforts to find out exactly what's going on in the agency. He is not in that mold. He is kind of an outsider. So I think that's just a reflection of them understanding that he's different than what they have been dealing with thus far. Sessions was forced to recuse himself, used that honor that he has to take himself completely out of running the department in a couple of the most important things it is doing, the Mueller investigation, but also any investigation into wrongdoing in the 2016 campaign."

It wasn't a good week for presidential rhetoric either, and the American public losses out. We are not getting good questions. We are not getting questions that have fair assumptions.

And I think that's what you saw at the press conference with the first question about white nationalism and then about Mueller.

I worked with all three of them throughout my years in this business and I cannot say enough great things about them.

But the president did summon Hannity on stage along with Fox News' weekend host Jeanine Pirro. And Hannity said that all those people in the back, meaning those covering the event are fake news. The network puts out a statement of disapproval. Fox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events. We have an extraordinary team of journalists holding our coverage tonight. And we are extremely proud of their work. This was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed. Hannity responded to the criticism on his primetime show."

But while I fully respect Hannity's right to say what he wants on the air, for a cable news host, even though a highly opinionated host to praise the president on a campaign rally stage crosses the line. It puts Fox's news division and the journalists who try to cover Trump fairly in a difficult position. It creates a big perception problem for a network that is often accused fairly or unfairly as being too easy on Trump. As the top rated host in cable news, Sean Hannity is an important voice for conservatives. It would be better in my view if he stuck to making his case on television and radio. Two hours before his Fox News show Wednesday night, Tucker Carlson learned that nearly two dozen anti-facetious protestors were outside his Washington home, chanting insults and demanding he leave the city."

The violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable. The group Smash Racism D.C. also made public the home addresses of Carlson's brother and the co-founder of his site, the Daily Caller, creating risk for them. Carlson drew support even from some liberal voices, who don't ordinarily like him such as Stephen Colbert. Fighting Tucker Carlson's idea is an American right. Targeting his home and terrorizing his family is an act of man monstrous cowardice. But Fox co-founder Matt Yglesias in now-deleted tweets said he felt no empathy for Carlson's wife and it was fine to make his family feel the fear that he and President Trump supposedly inspire and others, just appalling. Tucker Carlson is a controversial commentator. But everyone should denounce such intimidation tactics. Leave people's homes and their spouses and their kids out of it.

They took this -- Sarah Huckabee-Sanders took this off infowars, which is a propaganda site that has been banned by a number of platforms including Facebook, Twitter and Apple. By the way, to your credential journalist's point, the president is more comfortable with journalists from infowars than he is from CNN.

He makes other reporters in the room look bad when he's the one out there expressing his opinion, because that type of thing just amplifies unto everybody. The public hates it.

One monster fire in the north near Sacramento and two in the south were too much of the coverage frankly focuses on the homes of celebrities being burned. Now, from the perspective of someone who has some family there, what is not being captured is the fear. Landscapes filled with smoke, the path of destruction unclear, students trapped at the Pepperdine University as flames move toward that beautiful Malibu campus. Local news does its best, but for national journalists, it's hard to get near burning trees and forests. Unlike hurricanes, reporters can stand out in the wind and the rain or floods where they can get into boats and cover rescues. They don't allow for up-close and personal coverage.

But toward the end, I think journalists turned more cautious as the races kind of tighten. And I think they felt badly burned by their own projections in 2016.

But, of course, we have to caution that the Republicans picked up a couple seats in the Senate and won some other key governors' races and lost some as well. So the media is now sort of universally expecting that there will be utter gridlock on Capitol Hill between President Trump and the Democratic House. And I understand they are sort of dismissed pledges of bipartisan cooperation after past elections. But could they be wrong, is this too much of a knee-jerk reaction?"

      "utterance": "The answer is always yes to a question of could they be wrong or could we be wrong. The answer is always yes. Ding, ding, ding. Go ahead, it's Final Jeopardy. But look, they are going to agree on something. Democrats have to have something to show for their new majority in the House, maybe it's infrastructure, maybe it's something else. But they will come together with President Trump and the Senate on something. We don't know what it is. But I think it will be something substantial."
