That's much more important to me than the vaccine. But, on the vaccines, we have many companies that are in final stages for the vaccines, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, all great companies, but many of them. And we're going to have a great vaccine very, very shortly. I think we should have it before the election. But frankly, the politics gets involved and that's OK.

There's never been a time and no president has ever pushed him like I pushed them either, to be honest with you.

And I guess they are therapeutic. Some people don't know how to define therapeutic. I view it different. It's a cure for me, I walked in, I didn't feel good. A short 24 hours later, I was feeling great, I want to get out of the hospital. And that's what I want for everybody.

This was a blessing in disguise. I caught it, I heard about this drug. I said, Let me take it. It was my suggestion. I said, let me take it, and it was incredible the way it worked. Incredible. And I think, if I didn't catch it, we'd be looking at that like a number of other drugs, but it really did a fantastic job. I want to get for you what I got, and I'm going to make it free. You're not if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } going to pay for it. It wasn't your fault that this happened. It was China's fault, and China is going to pay a big price, what they've done to this country. China is going to pay a big price, what they've done to the world. This was China's fault and just remember that. So, we're going to get you the drug. It's going to be free. We're going to get it into the hospitals as soon as you can, as soon as we can. And you'll see some amazing things happen because we have -- our military is doing the if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } distribution. It's called logistics, and they deliver, hundreds of thousands of troops in a matter of days. This is easy stuff for them. Our generals are all ready, we're waiting for the emergency use authorization, and the drug companies have just made a lot of it. So, hopefully, this is going to be not just a therapeutic, it's going to be much more than a therapeutic. You're going to get better; you're going to get better fast just like I did. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, again, a blessing in disguise.

Transparency is supposed to be our friend. I will give you that it is very unique to have transparency in Washington, though. Washington types want to hold the information. That is what they have done. What John Brennan needs to understand is that the information from career intelligence officials from the very beginning was pushed aside and classified away because it didn't fit the narrative that the Obama administration, the Obama/Biden administration, Susan Rice, James Comey, and Brennan, all of them, what they wanted to spoon-feed to the American people. This is just the facts. Anyone who wants to disagree with this should come down on the side of transparency and say let's look at all of the documents, see how this started, see what kind of individuals were briefed, what kind of career intelligence official statements we were dealing with that were pushed aside. Let's have a full, transparent look at the situation.

I have spent 11 years at the State Department. When these types of things happen, we condemn them. We call out opposition parties in other countries who try to do things like this. This was not a peaceful transition of power. They went after candidate Trump. They went after newly elected Donald Trump, the president-elect, his entire team. It's pretty clear. I go back to the fact that there is a lot of foot dragging from Washington, D.C., types. It's not a Republican versus Democrat issue. This is a Washington versus the rest of America issue.

Obviously, the doctor has already spoken about that, that it was a positive test on last Thursday evening when he was confirmed to have the coronavirus. And obviously, the doctor here -- the White House doctor kicked into gear with making sure that he was protected and had the medical treatment there was proper. I can tell you that from our standpoint, I think the doctor put out today - - you know, that there were no antibodies with the amount of review that was done that particular night which would indicate that we caught it very, very early. And so, we're just very thankful that he is where he is at, and we're looking forward to hopefully having not only a healthy president but a healthy America. As we advance the prospects of some of these therapeutics that are coming down the pike, I can tell you, two of them were put in for emergency use authorization today. The president has been very clear. He wants to make sure that those get approved as quickly and as safely as possible. But then, they are given free to everyone so that the American people can have the same kind of treatment that he just received at Walter Reed."

I just want to go back around on this one more time, because it was put out today that the gold star families that were at the event at the White House on September 27, have been told that they may have been exposed to coronavirus when they were there. So, that's why it's so important to know when his case was active, and the places that he went during that time. And also, all the other people at the White House who have since been -- since been seen as positive. So, can you answer that?"

And we've done all of that. And that's to try to make sure that we can mitigate the risk of anybody that has come in contact with it. The good news about the actual incubation period is that we know that generally, that incubation period is about five to seven days. It can be longer, that's why we tell people to quarantine between 10 and 14 days. But part of that contact tracing, we've done all the contact tracing to go back to make sure that anybody that would -- was at risk has been contacted.

It has more to do with the person that looks in the mirror when she gets up in the morning. And so, I can tell you that as we look at this, we believe that we have a number of things that we agree upon, a broad base of support to get a deal. But yet, she was continuing to stick at her 2.2 to 2.4, depending on how you calculate it, trillion-dollar deal. And when Secretary Mnuchin had not only offered 1.6 but was willing to go to 1.7 trillion, she'd rather have zero than that kind of number. Now, I can tell you that maybe, perhaps, the best way to do it is take all the things that we agree upon, start building those back, and passing those out. Leader McConnell, I know, is willing to look at, you know, a separate bill for airlines, and PPP. If we can -- we can look at some of those and start to add to it. But at the same time, if -- you know, if she thinks that she can come back with something that's closer to where Secretary Mnuchin has come up to, I'm sure the president is more than willing to look at, at a counter-proposal. But to date, she hasn't really been doing that. Over the last several weeks, she's been having a lot of conversations and it's been Secretary Mnuchin that's been giving, not Speaker Pelosi."

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "Hi, perhaps you recognize me, it's your favorite president. And I'm standing in front of the Oval Office at the White House, which is always an exciting place to be. I got back a day ago from Walter Reed Medical Center. I spent four days there and didn't have to. I could have stayed at the White House, but the doctors said, because you're president, let's do it. I said, fine. You tell me what to do and I'm going to listen. These are great professionals. They've done a fantastic job. And by the way, not only at Walter Reed, all over the country, we have the greatest doctors in the world, we have the greatest nurses, the greatest first responders, law enforcement, by the way, incredible, firefighters, everybody. They're just great. We have great people. This is a great country. But I spent four days there and I went in and I wasn't feeling so hot, and within a very short period of time, they gave me Regeneron. It's called, Regeneron, and other things too, but I think this was the key. But they gave me Regeneron, and it was like, unbelievable. I felt good immediately. I felt as good three days ago as I do now. So, I just want to say, we have Regeneron. We have a very similar drug from Eli Lilly and they're coming out and we're trying to get them on an emergency basis. We've authorized it. I've authorized it. And if you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad, I think we're going to work it so that you get them and you're going to get them free. And especially, if you're a senior, we're going to get you in there quick. We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready. I have emergency use authorization, all set, and we got to get it signed now, and you're going to get better. You're going to get better, really fast. This is things that nobody even thought of a few months ago. The job that the scientists, the labs, everybody has done is incredible. Then, addition to that, you have various other drugs that help a lot. But these -- I view these, I know they call them therapeutic, but to me, it wasn't therapeutic, it just made me better. I call that a cure. So, I want to get these things done. So, we have to get them done. We have to get them approved, and I want to get them to the hospitals where people are feeling badly. That's much more important to me than the vaccine. But, on the vaccines, we have many companies that are in final stages for the vaccines, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, all great companies, but many of them. And we're going to have a great vaccine very, very shortly. I think we should have it before the election. But frankly, the politics gets involved and that's OK. They want to play their games; it's going to be right after the election. But we did it. Nobody else -- nobody else would have been able to do it. The FDA has acted as quickly as they've ever acted in history. There's never been a time and no president has ever pushed him like I pushed them either, to be honest with you. But the FDA is approving things in a matter of weeks that used to take a matter of years. So, we have these drugs, Eli Lilly, and the others that are so good. But they are, in my opinion, remember this, they're going to say that they're therapeutic. And I guess they are therapeutic. Some people don't know how to define therapeutic. I view it different. It's a cure for me, I walked in, I didn't feel good. A short 24 hours later, I was feeling great, I want to get out of the hospital. And that's what I want for everybody. I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president because I feel great. I feel like perfect. So, I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it. This was a blessing in disguise. I caught it, I heard about this drug. I said, Let me take it. It was my suggestion. I said, let me take it, and it was incredible the way it worked. Incredible. And I think, if I didn't catch it, we'd be looking at that like a number of other drugs, but it really did a fantastic job. I want to get for you what I got, and I'm going to make it free. You're not going to pay for it. It wasn't your fault that this happened. It was China's fault, and China is going to pay a big price, what they've done to this country. China is going to pay a big price, what they've done to the world. This was China's fault and just remember that. So, we're going to get you the drug. It's going to be free. We're going to get it into the hospitals as soon as you can, as soon as we can. And you'll see some amazing things happen because we have -- our military is doing the distribution. It's called logistics, and they deliver, hundreds of thousands of troops in a matter of days. This is easy stuff for them. Our generals are all ready, we're waiting for the emergency use authorization, and the drug companies have just made a lot of it. So, hopefully, this is going to be not just a therapeutic, it's going to be much more than a therapeutic. You're going to get better; you're going to get better fast just like I did. So, again, a blessing in disguise. Good luck."

And it's getting a ton of attention. John Brennan is pushing back in saying that the quotes that were released from him about this effort to get Hillary's campaign to loop the Trump campaign into this Russian conspiracy theory, John Brennan says there is nothing to that. They were just letting the president know what they were picking up on Russian intel. What do you say do all that?"

Look, we've had a lot of people, Susan Rice, James Comey, Brennan, a whole bunch of people scrambling, doing everything they can to not have transparency. Transparency isn't political, Martha. Transparency is supposed to be our friend. I will give you that it is very unique to have transparency in Washington, though. Washington types want to hold the information. That is what they have done. What John Brennan needs to understand is that the information from career intelligence officials from the very beginning was pushed aside and classified away because it didn't fit the narrative that the Obama administration, the Obama/Biden administration, Susan Rice, James Comey, and Brennan, all of them, what they wanted to spoon-feed to the American people. This is just the facts. Anyone who wants to disagree with this should come down on the side of transparency and say let's look at all of the documents, see how this started, see what kind of individuals were briefed, what kind of career intelligence official statements we were dealing with that were pushed aside. Let's have a full, transparent look at the situation. I think that after so many years of hearing Washington politicians and the insiders spoon-feed the American people miss information, we need to go back to the beginning and be transparent.

      "speaker": "GRENELL",

The most important part is making sure that our government, our U.S. government, the greatest country in the whole world, does not weaponize the power that they have, individuals weaponize it against their political enemies. I have spent 11 years at the State Department. When these types of things happen, we condemn them. We call out opposition parties in other countries who try to do things like this. This was not a peaceful transition of power. They went after candidate Trump. They went after newly elected Donald Trump, the president-elect, his entire team. It's pretty clear. I go back to the fact that there is a lot of foot dragging from Washington, D.C., types. It's not a Republican versus Democrat issue. This is a Washington versus the rest of America issue. We have got to clean up Washington. I think what you saw from President Trump just now on the COVID issue is the classic President Trump that we hired. Here is somebody who doesn't talk about filing some sort of piece of legislation or cosponsoring a bill, which is what Joe Biden talks about what he did when asked about his accomplishments. This is President Trump saying, you know what, I experienced this drug. It was amazing. I'm going to get it through the FDA and I'm going to make sure everybody gets it for free who has COVID. That's an amazing outsider perspective. He is a man of action. He is not a man of cosigning pieces of legislation."

We're the greatest country in the world, and we can have policy disagreements, but let's talk about actual facts and policy discussions. Here is a man who attacked me with really shameless words, all because I was trying to be transparent to share information. So he can talk about facts, and he can talk about wanting to see facts, but his whole tirade against me was because I was calling for more transparency. So again, I go back to the fact, this is the Washington game of pretending that you know something on public television, and then when you go into the bowels of the House where you're under oath in front of lawyers, you say something completely different, which is what Susan Rice and Samantha Power and the whole team did. So I think we can settle this. Practical people outside of Washington, they just view this as all Washington talk. And what they would say is, let's just see the transcripts. Let's go back to the facts and look at it. The American people are smart enough to know when they see something, they can come to their own conclusion. But that is just not the way Washington works.

We are just now 27 days from a presidential election where more than half the states are already voting. There is no precedent for the Senate considering a nominee for the Supreme Court this close to an election where voting has already started. I talked with Judge Barrett about some of her writings, some of her opinions, some law review articles, and I asked her questions about judicial philosophy, about how being a former clerk and a follower of Justice Scalia's view of textualism and originalism, how that would actually impact real Americans live. I spoke earlier today a Delawarean, Carrie (ph) from Middletown, who owns a small business, and she and her daughter have preexisting conditions. She is anxious about the future of the Affordable Care Act. As you know that's on the docket for the Supreme Court a week after the election. And I asked Judge Barrett whether she stood by previous comments she has made criticizing Chief Justice Roberts for upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. If the court strikes down the ACA, that will take away protections from half of all Americans, and that is something that Judge Barrett wouldn't speak to specifically, but I really do think is on the docket and on the ballot."

She wouldn't make any specific commitments, but I did press her view, repeatedly stating, that we should be willing to overturn long settled cases. So look, bluntly, my question --"

One of the things, the questions -- don't mean to interrupt you here, but one of the questions that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris haven't answered is whether they would increase the number of Supreme Court justices on the court, or whether they would be for killing the filibuster. Why don't the candidates who are running as opposed to Judge Barrett answer those important questions about changes to our government?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COONS",

But the questions you raise are ones where, if you heard former vice president Biden's remarks in Gettysburg yesterday, where he talked about bringing the country together, about trying to restore bipartisanship, it seems clear to me that what Joe Biden, given his record, given his platform, and given his view of our country, what he would prefer to do if possible is what I hope to do in the Senate if reelected and if we are in the majority. And that's to work across the aisle to deliver real solutions to the problems in front of us. If our democracy works, we won't need to take more extreme measures and change the rules of the Senate. But if we're not able to get partners who will work with us to solve issues right in front of us, like prescription drug prices or the opioid crisis, like getting out of this pandemic or building back better after this recession that's, frankly, largely been caused by President Trump's mishandling of this pandemic, if we don't have good partners for this, then there may be other changes on the horizon. But that's not something we need to consider yet. My hope is we'll be able to work together in the interests of bringing this country together after this election."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But first, a closer look at the Utah State Capitol Building right here in Salt Lake City."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "We are here in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah, right in front of the state's capital as we get ready for a very big night tonight, the vice presidential debate between Senator Harris and Vice President Pence as Democracy 2020 rolls on. KATE BEDINGFIELD, DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR, BIDEN"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOR PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "We have every expectation that Mike Pence is going to be compelling on the debate stage tonight, but Senator Harris is going to make the case for a different vision for this country, a different direction, and for competent, competent, capable leadership."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MERCEDES SCHLAPP, TRUMP-PENCE CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER",
      "utterance": "Vice President Mike Pence is ready. He is prepared to prosecute the case against the California radical extremist of Kamala Harris. And we know that he is going to talk about and ask the tough questions on Kamala."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "The prebattle for the vice presidential debate tonight. In the meantime, we just heard from the Democratic nominee Joe Biden in response to President Trump's statement in the Rose Garden that he thinks it's a gift that God gave him that he got COVID so that he can help others. Here is Joe Biden just moments ago responding."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It's coming."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "We think so."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It's coming."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "OK, it's coming. It's not there yet. Let's bring in our panel -- we'll get it for you momentarily -- Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics, pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, and Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co- founder and president. Let's see. There was a little delay. Now the gremlins are allowing us to play this soundbite. Here we go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE",
      "utterance": "I've got to think before I speak on this one. I think it's a tragedy that the president deals with COVID like it is something not to worry about when already 210,000 people have died. I think it's a travesty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "He starts off by saying I need to think before I speak on this one, and you can hear the rest. Maybe they didn't want us to hear it because it didn't sound great, but we finally played it. Mo, your thoughts on this and what the president said earlier."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS",
      "utterance": "Look, this is the issue. COVID is the issue in this campaign. It is the number one issue on the minds of the voters. The president had an opportunity to turn around his sliding numbers on it, and he didn't seize the opportunity. To come out and say it was a gift because it would help him help people, but at the same time be there saying don't worry about it, don't be afraid of it, downplaying the virus and exposing people around him while he is still potentially contagious, the two just don't match. And that, to me, the president's numbers have not moved. He dramatically needs to change the dynamics of this race if he's going to turn the race around. The clock is ticking. And he's not doing anything to help his case right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Kristen, do you agree with the president's approach to his hospitalization and being diagnosed with COVID?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, POLLSTER",
      "utterance": "The president has had poor numbers on COVID-19 handling in polls going back months. Voters initially gave him the benefit of the doubt but were let down by his handling of this virus, and that has led to him having really tough standing in the polls as the narrative has shifted back from being able to talk about the economy to being really focused on COVID. This virus does not care what your campaign strategy is. It does not care what your messaging strategy is. You can't just turn the page and pretend like the virus has gone away, that it's no big deal, when it is something that is still dramatically disrupting Americans' lives. This was a moment where President Trump could have said, look, I have now seen this face to face. It has come to my front door, and said, here is what I'm going to do besides just wait for a vaccine to help us get through that. But we haven't heard that from the president, and that is why I think this is a missed opportunity for him."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Tom, sorry, but quickly, what are your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER",
      "utterance": "I'll just say for the debate, Mike Pence has to be sharp tonight. He's got to do three things. He's got to defend the Trump administration's record, right, and he has got to press Kamala Harris, and he's got to do it by being aggressive yet respectful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "You were aggressive, yet respectful, and we made the commercial. Thank you. Sorry for the short talk there. When we come back, hour two of our special debate preview.
