      "utterance": "I think Mara is right. It can pass in the Senate. It will just take longer. On the House side, you have the problem, I think Bryon York said this last night here, that what Nancy Pelosi did was basically an exercise in virtue signally. The base of the party is very deeply committed to getting something on DACA. They want to hold Ryan's feet to the fire. She can't force anything so she wants to at least be on record with some very big symbolic show. On the entitlement thing, I've just got to disagree with Brain on this. One of the reasons why this is such a great deal for Democrats is that this would make any possibility of Republicans doing anything through reconciliation possible. Reconciliation is the process by which Republicans in the Senate would only need 50 votes to get something done."

      "speaker": "GOLDBERG",
      "utterance": "That's right. There is no way getting rid of reconciliation that the Republicans are going to be able to do entitlement reform and get enough Democrats to vote for it. This basically guarantees that the Republicans going into 2018 will have no other big legislative items on their agenda. They're not going be able to do any of the fixes to Obamacare that they wanted to do. This one of the reasons why Chuck Schumer really likes the deal. Except for the DACA part, there is nothing in this deal the Democrats shouldn't love, and while there is individual spending I can defend, particularly on the military, this basically amounts to a death knell for the Tea Party messaging of the Republican Party."

      "utterance": "There are a lot, as you know, the Democratic senators in these red states. So after they get this done, there's going to be a lot who have to turn around to their constituents and say yes, I've got to be fiscally responsible, too. So how many do you need to get? You need to get about eight. So if they get the budget that they want and there's a sense on March 6th they will get some type of DACA deal that they could get, why do you think, Jonah, can be a little bit optimistic that people are going to see welfare is a mess. Social Security needs to be addressed. And we can start pulling some of this in with Medicare. And you're about to smirk. How dare you?"
