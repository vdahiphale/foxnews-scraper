He spied on reporters from the AP and Fox News. Constantly attacked this network. The Espionage Act, he use it almost more than any other President combined to go after reporters and leakers.

He is a very good order. He has got the best smile in American politics since Jack Kennedy, and so he's able to use that to good effect. But I think he is making a mistake. I think President Bush is correct that we should probably get out of the Presidential - President to President denigration business because it's bad for the presidency, but it's also bad for the United States. We don't need to be doing that. And I will just say this and you probably feel the same way. I have a lot of international business. When I'm off the shore of the United States, I never criticize President Obama or the Obama administration. We're all Americans. And so, I think it's an unfortunate thing to be doing over there."

George McGovern? You remember George McGovern? The great senator that ran against Richard Nixon, he opened a bed and breakfast after he left the Senate. He couldn't believe the regulations that were in place. And he went out of business after two years. And you can go Google this. It's a \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial.

It doesn't affect the average American's life.

You're a nice guy with a reasonable sense of humor, they need to relax a little bit. And so what we need to do in our country is less demonization and more personalization and just relax.

There was a counter-protest that never materialized outside around her office out in California, but a bunch of her supporters showed up and you know what they did? They burned an American flag. Maxine Waters' supporters burned an American flag and chanted \"America was never great.\" Now, to say that Maxine Waters is the face of the Democratic Party as Donald Trump had said, I think is just a devastating political blow to them in the midterms because she is really hurting the party and the more she does and says and her supporters act like this, the worse it's going to be in the midterms."

I think you have to stand for the flag and not burn the flag, and I think, there should be some level of unconditionality of love for the country, even though people have faced discrimination. The Italians have, the Irish have, obviously, the African- American community came in, in bondage which is a horrific stain on the nation. But we're moving forward and we're making progress and we're trying to make things fairer for everybody in the society, and so, this sort of behavior I think sets us back, and I think it sends a symbol that we are not thinking about it as a community.

    {
      "speaker": "ABERNATHY",
      "utterance": "Exactly. There's no question. Those of us that swim with sharks on a daily basis, I mean, there's over 500 shark-diving operations worldwide that actually use fish to attract sharks so that we can swim with them. The incident rate of an accident happening puts shark diving in between the two sports of badminton and bowling."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, here is what I would do and tell me if I'm wrong. If a shark ever tried to bite me, this is what I would do. I would take my suntan lotion, squirt its eyes out. Try to blind it or if I had a stick in the ocean, like driftwood, and it opened its jaws like that, I'd stick the stick right in the middle so it chomped down and then it couldn't bite and then I'd swim away."

    {
      "speaker": "ABERNATHY",

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay. That is good advice and I will do that. All right, have a great summer and stay safe down there with your friends, the sharks."

I'm joined now by the 2018 Champs Brandon Clark and Matthew Klein, also known as team Troop Unchained. They're here to take on The Mooch and me. All right, boys, here we go. Professional rules.
