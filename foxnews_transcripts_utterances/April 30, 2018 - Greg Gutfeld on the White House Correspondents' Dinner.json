The media calls that a roast. If you did it, it would be called misogyny. But progs play by different rules.

Being on the left excuses everything, you can drive girls into the drink or run the Klan and still sit in the senate as long as you're a Democrat. Now, the comic's defenders will say, but Trump said bad things about women too. You're right. He said bad things about everyone.
