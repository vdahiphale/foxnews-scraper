      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Live tonight in Washington, DC. Thanks for being us tonight. And a patch show, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley, Congressman Mark Meadows, Fox News Contributor Sara Carter and David Bossie are just some of tonight's live guests. But first to my opening statement. So, they decide to trash, belittle and shame the president and his family including the first lady, making fun of their accent, their intellectual capability, their hair, you name it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And they decide to ignore a congressional subpoena for Department of Justice documents on the FISA abuse scandal and the Hillary Clinton investigation. So who are they? And who do we blame for the repeated trashing of the first lady? Why is it open on the First Family? Who do we blame for the refusal to honor congressional subpoenas? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There is only one group to blame, and that group is the Republican Party. How did we get so lost? How is it that these people are so comfortable, so at ease hanging effigy, the bloody head of our president, laughing about killing him in the elevator, laughing about blowing up the White House, threatening to beat up the president? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They criticize the intellect of our president, a Wharton graduate who got a 30 out of 30 on an acuity test when they, Robert de Niro, Chelsey Handler, Madonna, Sean Penn and Johnny Depp never got past the 12th grade. They do it with such ease and no shame. Why? The do it because they can. Because they have learned there are no consequences, that nothing happens to them when they do. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Barack Obama on the other hand, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi promote resistance and obstruction. Police are told to stand down and not arrest. Hollywood jumps in trying to brainwash everyone that the president, Republicans and anyone who believes in law and order is the enemy while ideological federal judges follow the narrative. As President Trump seeks to protect us on our border because Border Patrol agents are swamped, they chant in unison that he is a racist, a fascist. They dither as to whether or not they want their border protected. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And in the case of Oregon's Governor Kate Brown, she refuse border protection and refuse to assist other states three days after she accepted a large donation from George Soros. Hey, Kate, a geography primer, you weren't even in the picture. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look at this map. Your state isn't on the southern border where the operation is being conducted. The Democrats are comfortable doing what they do because they've learned how to wield power like the FBI and the Department of Justice when they decided that one of their own would not be prosecuted. Like when they prioritized illegal criminals over American citizens, proudly declaring themselves to be sanctuary. They have learned what to do when they are in power, covering for their own like allowing a corrupt charitable foundation, which in reality is a pay-for-play international racketeering syndicate. They have instituted a deep state channel government to continue their agenda even when they are gone from power. And unlike Republicans, they've learned to circle their wagons. They are in lock step with each other on Russia collusion narrative when we all know the only collusion was the cash flow of hundreds of millions that went into Bill and Hillary's corrupt foundation for our uranium. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And even though Democrats lost the House, the Senate and the Oval, they are still running the country with the help of establishment Republicans. And as a result, the Trumps are fair game. The president colluded with the Russians and must be impeached. Melania is an idiot. Ivanka's successful clothing line must be removed from the shelves, and Eric's charity gave more than 98 percent to help childhood cancer victims. His charity must be shut down. Donny takes an innocent meeting and they say he has committed treason. Their hate is vicious and it's real. And as they march proudly in their pink hats oblivious to the irony of their deafening silence when their Democrat president was getting sexual favors from an intern in the Oval Office while he was president. It's time for the Republicans to start wielding power. They've got to learn to stop their namby-pamby spineless finger to the wind approach to running the country. It's time for Republicans to stop fighting with each other and start supporting the president. How can you Republicans possibly let the DOJ, the Attorney General, and the FBI stonewall you? Put on your big boy pants and use the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate and prosecute those who violated our laws. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And while you are at it, stop apologizing for our Second Amendment because this ain't going to end well unless and until Republicans get the guts to wield the power to run our government the way it's supposed to be run. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page, #judgejeanine. And joining me now, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley. How are you, Hogan? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Live tonight in Washington, DC. Thanks for being us tonight. And a patch show, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley, Congressman Mark Meadows, Fox News Contributor Sara Carter and David Bossie are just some of tonight's live guests. But first to my opening statement. So, they decide to trash, belittle and shame the president and his family including the first lady, making fun of their accent, their intellectual capability, their hair, you name it. And they decide to ignore a congressional subpoena for Department of Justice documents on the FISA abuse scandal and the Hillary Clinton investigation. So who are they? And who do we blame for the repeated trashing of the first lady? Why is it open on the First Family? Who do we blame for the refusal to honor congressional subpoenas? There is only one group to blame, and that group is the Republican Party. How did we get so lost? How is it that these people are so comfortable, so at ease hanging effigy, the bloody head of our president, laughing about killing him in the elevator, laughing about blowing up the White House, threatening to beat up the president? They criticize the intellect of our president, a Wharton graduate who got a 30 out of 30 on an acuity test when they, Robert de Niro, Chelsey Handler, Madonna, Sean Penn and Johnny Depp never got past the 12th grade. They do it with such ease and no shame. Why? The do it because they can. Because they have learned there are no consequences, that nothing happens to them when they do. Barack Obama on the other hand, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi promote resistance and obstruction. Police are told to stand down and not arrest. Hollywood jumps in trying to brainwash everyone that the president, Republicans and anyone who believes in law and order is the enemy while ideological federal judges follow the narrative. As President Trump seeks to protect us on our border because Border Patrol agents are swamped, they chant in unison that he is a racist, a fascist. They dither as to whether or not they want their border protected. And in the case of Oregon's Governor Kate Brown, she refuse border protection and refuse to assist other states three days after she accepted a large donation from George Soros. Hey, Kate, a geography primer, you weren't even in the picture. Take a look at this map. Your state isn't on the southern border where the operation is being conducted. The Democrats are comfortable doing what they do because they've learned how to wield power like the FBI and the Department of Justice when they decided that one of their own would not be prosecuted. Like when they prioritized illegal criminals over American citizens, proudly declaring themselves to be sanctuary. They have learned what to do when they are in power, covering for their own like allowing a corrupt charitable foundation, which in reality is a pay-for-play international racketeering syndicate. They have instituted a deep state channel government to continue their agenda even when they are gone from power. And unlike Republicans, they've learned to circle their wagons. They are in lock step with each other on Russia collusion narrative when we all know the only collusion was the cash flow of hundreds of millions that went into Bill and Hillary's corrupt foundation for our uranium. And even though Democrats lost the House, the Senate and the Oval, they are still running the country with the help of establishment Republicans. And as a result, the Trumps are fair game. The president colluded with the Russians and must be impeached. Melania is an idiot. Ivanka's successful clothing line must be removed from the shelves, and Eric's charity gave more than 98 percent to help childhood cancer victims. His charity must be shut down. Donny takes an innocent meeting and they say he has committed treason. Their hate is vicious and it's real. And as they march proudly in their pink hats oblivious to the irony of their deafening silence when their Democrat president was getting sexual favors from an intern in the Oval Office while he was president. It's time for the Republicans to start wielding power. They've got to learn to stop their namby-pamby spineless finger to the wind approach to running the country. It's time for Republicans to stop fighting with each other and start supporting the president. How can you Republicans possibly let the DOJ, the Attorney General, and the FBI stonewall you? Put on your big boy pants and use the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate and prosecute those who violated our laws. And while you are at it, stop apologizing for our Second Amendment because this ain't going to end well unless and until Republicans get the guts to wield the power to run our government the way it's supposed to be run. And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page, #judgejeanine. And joining me now, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley. How are you, Hogan?"

And now smugglers are telling people on the other side of the border, \"Come across.

They realize Congress hasn't done anything. They stood up and said, \"We would rather shut down the government...\" if you remember the Schumer shutdown, over hundreds of thousands of people who are here illegally and unlawfully as opposed to the protection of hundreds of millions of American citizens.

This \"catch and release\" was still allowed up until this week. So, the president did a terrific thing in signing that order ending \"catch and release\" and Sessions who has been late to the game is really pushing hard and I applaud him for that. What we need, he is sending 4,000 National Guards and I caution this whole process and this deployment because there are some who are advising the president to send, \"Hey, let's send mechanics to fix the Border Patrol vehicles. Let's send admin support so they can do paperwork and they can do some of the surveillance and their communication center.\" I was a commander of those who did that work and then also, far more importantly, armed soldiers. Actually, issued 120 rounds of ammunition. They were deployed directly on the border, so you had three to five soldiers right on the border with a military vehicle. We actually had a bank of lights that lit them up at nighttime so they were in full plain view."

They didn't need to because that show of force -- everyone in the world knows America's military is the most powerful, so those south of the border, you have to understand, you understand this as a judge, nobody wants to get caught. So, when they see that show of force, they say, \"My god, we are not going through here.\" So, any of these high traffic or built-up areas, that's where you deploy our armed soldiers and that's what's needed."

The president in effect just ordered that for all nine sectors of the Border Patrol, so that is win one for the president. He set the table. The second part of this, he has to deploy, in my recommendation armed soldiers to the border. If you are going to send America's military, that's hard force. Don't send a temp service for mechanics and all of these other support. Support the Border Patrol. They will come in and make the arrests just as they did in UMA and you will see this border is secured once and for all when the wall is built finally with President Trump."

All right, David, what's your take on the two of them on air saying you have got to put on the chyron, which is the little strip underneath that the president is lying."

Look, if they wanted to get better ratings, they would run reruns of \"Gilligan's Island.\" They have to do -- 50-year-old reruns would do better than \"Morning Joe.\" That's a fact. So, I am just saying, they have to do these things because it has become their schtick. And it's really damaging to democracy. It is damaging to our presidency, to the family of the -- the first family. What they do every day in their hate-filled spiel is destroy what I believe is an important fabric, which is that we all want the president to succeed. This is really the first presidency that I have seen that and I have watched him since Ronald Reagan and we all disagree on policy. We disagreed with Barack Obama's own policy, but we weren't..."

She didn't appreciate and she defended her daughters and she should have from those attacks. From irresponsible mean-spirited people. She was offended and she should have been, during her time in the White House. It was irresponsible then and it's irresponsible now."

Ivanka Trump who is in her own right an incredibly successful young woman, mother, working mom, someone who young women have looked up to for years, and now she is here and the left is attacking her. It's again, it's disgraceful."

She has been part of the problem. She is supporting you know, illegals. She supports sanctuary city. She is not for law and order and she was the Attorney General of California. And now she is talking about wanting to see the Attorney General, the Vice president and the president not survive in an elevator. It's a joke. These are not funny things.

There is no source saying he is going to do it, but they are just blabbing so it seems, what do you know? And what should the president do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORRIS",
      "utterance": "Well, sitting down with Mueller is really a sort of three-hour game of \"Gotcha\" against a professional at that game. Mueller's effort will not be to find the truth or to learn Trump's side of the story. It will be to catch him in what could be played as a lie, catch him in saying something that might not be completely true, that Trump may not even realize isn't true. And you know how Trump embellishes and talks on and uses superlatives. He is hoping to trap him in those. His investigation has run out of gas. He hasn't found any evidence of collusion, and now he's hoping to morph it into an investigation into obstruction of justice and hoping to use a comment that Trump may make in an interview to establish that. Trump is insane to go into an interview with Mueller."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know, what's interesting, Dick is that even you know, Mueller should be investigating a crime and we all know that collusion with Russia is not a crime. So, without there being a specific crime other than now the word is it's obstruction of justice, in order to assess whether or not there should be any charge on obstruction of justice, Mueller would have to rely on his pal, Jim Comey and his testimony and must find it credible. But Mueller is pals with Jim Comey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORRIS",
      "utterance": "There is nothing more dangerous than a prosecutor in search of a crime to prosecute. And with these laws relating to making it illegal to lie to the FBI and the literal strict interpretation of what one would say makes that a complete setup for Trump. What I think he should do, is if he feels he has to testify before Mueller, insist that it be with written questions and written answers. Then his lawyers can vet it. He can be sure that there is no way it could be interpreted as a lie and he will come out of this okay. And there is no way that Mueller can argue it has got to be verbal, it's got to be in person. He's talking about the president of the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORRIS",
      "utterance": "He may not have three hours when he's doing nothing to sit with Mueller and chew the fat. And I think if Trump insists on putting it in writing, he can come out of this process alive and then I think, the Mueller investigation falls apart."
