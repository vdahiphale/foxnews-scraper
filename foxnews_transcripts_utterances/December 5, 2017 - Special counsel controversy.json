      "sentences": "I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters and Katie Pavlich -- \"The Five.\" Last summer an FBI agent was pulled from Robert Mueller's special investigation into Trump. Makes sense. Peter Strzok seen there had exchanged anti-Trump and pro-Hillary texts with a mistress who was also on Mueller's team. That's evidence of bias, and let's face it, stupidity. Strzok also had interviewed top Clintonite Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, as well as overseeing the probe into Michael Flynn, which raises this bias test: If Flynn's lies warrant a charge, why don't Huma and Cheryl? It's a good question. Especially when the same lawyer also change a vital phrase in Comey's statement about Hillary's email. \"Grossly negligent,\" my nickname, became \"extremely careless.\" That small change reduced Hillary's action from criminal to merely incompetent and that ironically preserved Hillary's nomination, helping pave the way for Donald Trump. That's pretty hilarious, if you're not a Democrat. You should be really angry. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So do these revelations mean Mueller probe is biased? Maybe. But this whole thing went from being about colluding with Russians to anything involving a Russian. If you rooted for Drago in \"Rocky IV\" then you're guilty. I did. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And it's obvious that the media craves something really big. They want a holiday ham from Mueller, but so far all they got is a fuzzy breath mint.

Rural hospitals have closed.

Strzok also had interviewed top Clintonite Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, as well as overseeing the probe into Michael Flynn, which raises this bias test",
      "utterance": "If Flynn's lies warrant a charge, why don't Huma and Cheryl? It's a good question. Especially when the same lawyer also change a vital phrase in Comey's statement about Hillary's email. \"Grossly negligent,\" my nickname, became \"extremely careless.\" That small change reduced Hillary's action from criminal to merely incompetent and that ironically preserved Hillary's nomination, helping pave the way for Donald Trump. That's pretty hilarious, if you're not a Democrat. You should be really angry. So do these revelations mean Mueller probe is biased? Maybe. But this whole thing went from being about colluding with Russians to anything involving a Russian. If you rooted for Drago in \"Rocky IV\" then you're guilty. I did."

Now, the two major prosecutions of Wall Street firms, Arthur Anderson and Merrill Lynch, he completely botched. One was overturned by the Supreme Court 9-0. The other was overturned by the district court of appeals. So the guy has a track record of prosecutions and convictions being overturned. He's maxed out to the Obama campaign, and he's a partisan people. He doesn't belong anywhere near an investigation. Now, Mueller also -- another investigator, Janine Ray, maxed out to the Clinton campaign. Representing the Clinton Foundation, represented Hillary personally when she was fighting the email thing. So just imagine if the shoe was on the other foot, Gutfeld. And you have prosecutors investigating Hillary, and there're Trump donors, or they work for the Trump organization and they're sending text messages about crooked Hillary. Make America great again.

Then plus, the language, the text messages, the emails. And Sarah Carter told Sean Hannity last night that her sources, there are more emails coming out to show the bias here, and that they're really kind of out to get Flynn and President Trump, then candidate Trump at the time. So this is exactly what you don't want from anybody involved in investigation or injustice. That's the problem here. So you can't just blow it off and say, oh, well, who knows.

Why is it that the inner circle that played around Hillary Clinton was able to have immunity? Why does Cheryl Mills was allowed to be both a witness in the case and also the attorney for Hillary Clinton? And one thing that jumped out at me today is that the Justice Department is not commenting on any of this. So it must be a very awkward place for Jeff Sessions to be in, for his staff to be in, because they're the ones who have to answer to this as well. And they have a problem on their hands when it comes to special counsel. And Rod Rosenstein who appointed the special counsel is the one who is going to have to really look at this and go, we do have a conflict of interest here.

And for him to suggest that because people are forced to buy Obamacare, that they somehow have health care is a complete and outer lie. The insurance under Obamacare doesn't necessarily provide you any health care, first of all, because it's too expensive. And second of all, because there's -- not enough doctors now and the demand for health care has gone through the roof as a result. Waiting time for health care had increased. Rural hospitals have closed. This idea now that we're allowing people to get out of an entitlement program which is Obamacare, of course it's terrifying to Democrats because that mean that people can spend their own money and buy their own health care, opening up a whole another market which is an indictment of government run health insurance."

Here he is saying, \"No one is born hating another person.\" But here is the No. 1 tweet of all for the year 2017. A man asked Wendy's how many times he needs to be retweeted for a year of free nuggets. They tell him 18 million.
