So why didn't you hear much about O's White House? Well, who was brave enough to look? There was never a cozier relationship between a president and the media ever. If the White House were a bed, the press was the mutt dozing at the foot of it. Thank God Obama didn't eat it. Classic. So the media voluntarily took an 8-year sleeping pill with this liver snap only to wake up when Obama's policies lead to the rejection of his party in the election of Trump. Then, no longer Obamatose, they sprung to action. And it wasn't like there were no scandals under Obama: DOJ, IRS, Benghazi. The media's bar was so high in terms of interest, however, they didn't exist. So now you have a woke press chasing down any incident where Trump has a burger whose center isn't hot pink. Now, the funny part is Obama's speech was at a conference where participants were rejected if they shared any part of it. So, you want to know why you never heard about Obama? There's your answer: compliance. Compare that to Trump's White House, the most transparent entity since the invention of scotch tape. And still the press scrambles after him as if they're making up for lost time. It's like watching a fat man climb a mountain after a lifetime of couch surfing and pizza. No wonder they want a Democrat in 2020, they could use a rest. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Isn't it true, Dana, that Obama's lack of scandals were not about scandals but a compliant press that allowed him to operate in total secrecy.",

So just because there's a few thousand activists, you know, bombarding these companies doesn't mean you don't have to cave to pressure. Businesses shouldn't discriminate against people because they support an amendment or not. The ACLU supports the First Amendment. NRA supports the Second. National Lawyers' Guild supports the Fourth. That's fine. What is interesting is that there hasn't been a boycott of the NRA that was triggered by the Chicago situation. There's been almost 100 shootings in Chicago, victims in the last two weeks, and no one said anything about that. That's just interesting to me.",

He's saying, no, we're talking about the election. He's thinking beyond the sale. It's like when a real estate agent takes you to a house that's a little bit out of your range and you walk into one room and he goes, this is definitely your home office. So they're thinking beyond the sale. They want you to be in the house psychologically. This is a perfect bonus room for your pool table. Of course, bonus rooms are terrible because that means relatives stay. So never get a bonus room. You just get a bonus relative. It's essentially trying to look behind whatever present conflict there is. If you're in a fight with your spouse, you start talking about the trip you're going to go on for your anniversary. So you're thinking always beyond the sale."

Get some word out there because also the midterm elections are coming up. This really shores up the base and say, OK, let's get fired up. This is a president who, despite what people are trying to say, wants to run for reelection. He's not tired of it of being president or frustrated. He actually wants to keep doing things and having accomplishments, including winning another term. So this way he can go out and have his surrogates as well, you know, campaign, essentially, fund- raise, go out and support the people they need to win reelection in the midterms and really kind of shore up the base. Also, kind of take some distraction away from all these other investigations. Like Greg said he saying, OK, we're going to get through this because the bottom line is I'm running and I'm going to win again."

Their political standing is a subset of their iconic status in American society. Kamala Harris, that's simply has the big pockets in California behind her. But in all three cases what's interesting to me is that you have women as kind of President Trump's kryptonite. And so, women, overwhelmingly, black women, Latino women, and I think it's 43 percent of white women voted against Trump, so you've get a strong, iconic female figure. And boy, I think that's why Trump went after her."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "There's no comparison in terms of the -- but the second thing to say is that when you look at Trump, he has raised $43 million in the last two years. That's four times more that Obama raised in his first two years. So you understand this is a permanent campaign. He gets a kick out of running. He loves the rallies. Remember, after the November 16th election, he was holding rallies. He had his first campaign rally for 2020 a month after he was inaugurated."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "If I was to draw a bottom line on what he did today, I would say, one, he loves campaigning. He loves the rallies. That when he's happy. He's not a governing guy. But the second thing to say is, Hope Hicks was before the house intelligence committee. Are we talking about what's going on with Hope Hicks talking to investigators? No, we're talking about the distraction."

They opened up this can of worms and made these accusations, and now this is follow-through. And follow-through eventually leads to justice. So we'll see here what happens. He's doing his job.

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "No drama. So to quote the TSA officer whose dog just sniffed my carry-on, let's unpack this. So why didn't you hear much about O's White House? Well, who was brave enough to look? There was never a cozier relationship between a president and the media ever. If the White House were a bed, the press was the mutt dozing at the foot of it. Thank God Obama didn't eat it. Classic. So the media voluntarily took an 8-year sleeping pill with this liver snap only to wake up when Obama's policies lead to the rejection of his party in the election of Trump. Then, no longer Obamatose, they sprung to action. And it wasn't like there were no scandals under Obama: DOJ, IRS, Benghazi. The media's bar was so high in terms of interest, however, they didn't exist. So now you have a woke press chasing down any incident where Trump has a burger whose center isn't hot pink. Now, the funny part is Obama's speech was at a conference where participants were rejected if they shared any part of it. So, you want to know why you never heard about Obama? There's your answer: compliance. Compare that to Trump's White House, the most transparent entity since the invention of scotch tape. And still the press scrambles after him as if they're making up for lost time. It's like watching a fat man climb a mountain after a lifetime of couch surfing and pizza. No wonder they want a Democrat in 2020, they could use a rest. Isn't it true, Dana, that Obama's lack of scandals were not about scandals but a compliant press that allowed him to operate in total secrecy."

They said the IRS scandal was bipartisan, even though 95 percent of the groups who were targeted were conservative. They said the Iran deal was great diplomacy when we ship them a bunch of cash that wound up in Hezbollah's hands.

Just so everybody knows, there's about a 2,000-mile border with Mexico and the United States, because of the Rio Grande and the mountains and all that stuff, the virtual fence, you only really need about 800 miles of border wall. There's already 500 miles constructed. They want to improve upon that and add an additional 300. Now, the Tucson sector chief says when they put the fence up, illegal crossings dropped 95 percent. But what that does it pushes it down to another sector. So, it pushed it to the Yuma sector where you're seeing a lot of illegal crossing. The prototypes look good though. They're about 24 to 30 feet high, you're going to be able to see through them. And they're impenetrable. You had U.S. Special Forces tried to scale them, blowtorch through them. They couldn't do it. It became so dangerous, the testing, that they had to stop doing it. And he's going to go down there and he's going to try -- you know, like an architect would try to look at the specs and take a look.

California had been quite vocal in trying to stop the president on environmental grounds from getting the wall up. But this is -- this is really symbolic, I think, of President Trump. Not only his campaign but his presidency, that he made this promise. It's actually, like, a physical, tangible thing that people can go and look at to say, OK, he made this promise. He's running for reelection. He's announced it. He'd better get that wall up and start it. So I think that's why we're seeing such focus and emphasis on it. And then it has the tie-in piece, as you aptly point out, with DACA and with immigration. And I think he's going to try to be compassionate about it and work with both sides.

All he's saying he wants an enforced system, and 1.7 million people can stay. That's pretty compassionate. What the Dems are saying is the DREAMers can dream on, because it's not coming from us. The Democrats are ticked off, because he might come up with the solution and reverse the false perception that the Democrats have capitalized forever that they are compassionate and that Republicans aren't compassionate. And if Trump ends up being becoming pro-DREAMer, the pro- immigrant, that's going to reverse a polarity that's been around for long time, and it could be a really big deal.

And it wasn't the NRA that failed to protect school safety. That was the sheriff and that was the FBI. There are 5 to 10 million NRA members, and they're most upstanding citizens. Remember, it was an NRA member that actually shot dead that shooter in Texas last year. So just because there's a few thousand activists, you know, bombarding these companies doesn't mean you don't have to cave to pressure. Businesses shouldn't discriminate against people because they support an amendment or not. The ACLU supports the First Amendment. NRA supports the Second. National Lawyers' Guild supports the Fourth. That's fine. What is interesting is that there hasn't been a boycott of the NRA that was triggered by the Chicago situation.

And I don't think that governments should punish companies for expressing their First Amendment right to decide to do whatever they want to do and who they want to give discounts to. What I didn't know is that one of United's captains, his daughter was killed in Florida, in Parkland. She was one of the 17. Her name was Gina Montalto.
