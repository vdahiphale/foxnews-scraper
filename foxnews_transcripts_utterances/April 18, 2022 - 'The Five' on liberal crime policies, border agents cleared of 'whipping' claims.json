America's crime crisis not taken a holiday break over Easter. It was a bloody weekend with three mass shootings. In Pittsburgh, two teenagers are dead and at least 11 people were injured after gunmen opened fire at an Airbnb party, and two separate shootings in South Carolina leaving 18 people wounded. A judge causing outrage after setting a $25,000 bond and supervision for a suspect charged in one of those shootings which would allow him to travel to and from work while wearing an ankle monitor. Police say that he has not yet posted bail. He has remained in jail at this moment. And progressive policies getting called out for the crime wave ripping across the country. Democrat New York City Mayor Eric Adams putting the pressure on woke loss to put dangerous criminals back onto the street.",

And you start to think, well, and all of this arena of society whether it is crime or education, the border, there's a rejection of systems, in structure and process. We should be OK with that but then we started talking about the systemic problems, and we started taking apart these processes. And that's really bad for a society that naturally decays, were already in traffic, were already get older. Things fall apart, that is why you have prisons and you have laws, you have borders and you have standards. And now we're basically saying that the same sensible rules and laws that we have for everybody are now not for everybody because we have the systemic bigotry, the systemic racism so we've reduced, in some cases, eliminated disincentives for crime and then crime goes up. So, you have somebody who is now shooting suspect who was in house arrest. You've eliminated one disincentive --",

What we're seeing now during the holidays you see crime surge among family members. And in the summer, you see crime on the streets among gang members. But today, based upon what the left has done in the so-called social justice agenda is they're making crimes at malls like the one in South Carolina, a club shooting in South Carolina and then at Airbnb in Pennsylvania. We're talking about 10 people shot, 11 people shot, this kid getting out the house monitor with an ankle bracelet. You should be ashamed of yourself. Whoever that judge is should be ashamed of herself or himself. What we've got is progressive policies that are destroying this country. And the truth is that it is the deliberate release of these individuals who go out and commit crime because they have been emboldened by the lack of consequence that we have created with the social justice agenda. There is now a more -- more of an interest in the criminal than the victim and I feel like a broken record I keep saying that. But it's about the violent among us and trying to make them better, when the truth is that what they're doing is making society worse. And you know, this is something that is only going to get worse as people come into the border, you know, they talk about 23 and we'll talk about this later on terrorist list. But there's so many who don't get caught, and you know, they see what's going on. They see Americans aren't being held accountable, why should they? Hell, I'm here for the American dream. And I don't mean to put all, a lot of them are working hard. But what we've got is a message that we have sent to 300 whatever million people, it's OK if you see your neighbor's house and you want something in it, you want the car, if you feel somewhat that's an accident, we'll let you get away with it.

And I think what's going on at least in liberal communities is people feel betrayed by these people that we elected to be ambassadors for our values. So, I'm someone who believes in second chances that I would rather someone who can get it right not go and even spend one night in prison if they can get back on the street and they cannot do it again. But when people are continually letting you down in this way and it doesn't seem like the officials that you put in charge of the problem who you thought had the same values as you get it, then I think people are either going to either stop showing up for elections. I don't they necessarily going to turn on who they vote for, it would take a lot to make the upper west side vote for a Republican. But it does leave an opportunity at least to be having this very tough conversations that Democrats in a lot of cases don't have a lot of answers for. And it will be interesting to see if Republicans can come up with solutions themselves that can appeal to people. Because at this moment in liberal cities you're not turning L.A. red. Right?

Police say that he has not yet posted bail. He has remained in jail at this moment. And progressive policies getting called out for the crime wave ripping across the country.

And you start to think, well, and all of this arena of society whether it is crime or education, the border, there's a rejection of systems, in structure and process. We should be OK with that but then we started talking about the systemic problems, and we started taking apart these processes. And that's really bad for a society that naturally decays, were already in traffic, were already get older. Things fall apart, that is why you have prisons and you have laws, you have borders and you have standards. And now we're basically saying that the same sensible rules and laws that we have for everybody are now not for everybody because we have the systemic bigotry, the systemic racism so we've reduced, in some cases, eliminated disincentives for crime and then crime goes up.

What we're seeing now during the holidays you see crime surge among family members. And in the summer, you see crime on the streets among gang members. But today, based upon what the left has done in the so-called social justice agenda is they're making crimes at malls like the one in South Carolina, a club shooting in South Carolina and then at Airbnb in Pennsylvania. We're talking about 10 people shot, 11 people shot, this kid getting out the house monitor with an ankle bracelet. You should be ashamed of yourself. Whoever that judge is should be ashamed of herself or himself. What we've got is progressive policies that are destroying this country. And the truth is that it is the deliberate release of these individuals who go out and commit crime because they have been emboldened by the lack of consequence that we have created with the social justice agenda. There is now a more -- more of an interest in the criminal than the victim and I feel like a broken record I keep saying that. But it's about the violent among us and trying to make them better, when the truth is that what they're doing is making society worse. And you know, this is something that is only going to get worse as people come into the border, you know, they talk about 23 and we'll talk about this later on terrorist list. But there's so many who don't get caught, and you know, they see what's going on. They see Americans aren't being held accountable, why should they? Hell, I'm here for the American dream. And I don't mean to put all, a lot of them are working hard. But what we've got is a message that we have sent to 300 whatever million people, it's OK if you see your neighbor's house and you want something in it, you want the car, if you feel somewhat that's an accident, we'll let you get away with it.

And I think what's going on at least in liberal communities is people feel betrayed by these people that we elected to be ambassadors for our values. So, I'm someone who believes in second chances that I would rather someone who can get it right not go and even spend one night in prison if they can get back on the street and they cannot do it again. But when people are continually letting you down in this way and it doesn't seem like the officials that you put in charge of the problem who you thought had the same values as you get it, then I think people are either going to either stop showing up for elections. I don't they necessarily going to turn on who they vote for, it would take a lot to make the upper west side vote for a Republican. But it does leave an opportunity at least to be having this very tough conversations that Democrats in a lot of cases don't have a lot of answers for. And it will be interesting to see if Republicans can come up with solutions themselves that can appeal to people. Because at this moment in liberal cities you're not turning L.A. red. Right?

That's like me saying, you know what, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the SALT argument by those people paying taxes in New York, New Jersey and California. And you know, therefore, the tax laws are broken. They're not broken. They are just the way they are. And so, would they say I'm sorry? I don't know. They're not going to.

But it's interesting, to Greg's point, that they are trying to say it's not Joe Biden's fault. One point nine trillion dollars of a COVID bill one year ago, massive amounts of money. You attack American energy oil and gas. I mean, if we went back to drill baby drill, go for wells, pipelines, fracking, we're going to produce energy here.

You know, they ignored Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary last year when he said you guys is going to be a problem. The American Rescue Plan was so big it put so much money in so quickly, that now you have Democrats from the Obama era saying it was too big. So, that's how you helped fuel inflation there. They started to blame Putin. And now -- but given all of this, Senator Warren is actually urging him to go even further left and to do more. So, I actually think that it's letting President Biden off weight easy to say that he's not in charge, and that he's not running the show. I think that he is the one making decisions, and they've been poor decisions. And in some cases, you have to say that perhaps maybe he needs to make some personnel changes, but he doesn't make -- he's either not making decisions, or he's making bad decisions."

And the same thing existed when the Tea Party rose to power on the right that it's -- or even Trump Republicans and Romney Republicans that don't have that much in common. But Elizabeth Warren, to your point, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times today and half of it I disagreed with, but the first half I really agreed with and she had this line, Democrats won elections when we show that we understand the painful economic realities facing Americans. And that's what Joe Biden did in 2020 with the health issue with COVID-19. And Dems do have a chance to hold on to some of these seats and took -- maybe hold on to the Senate. Mitch McConnell even said, I really don't want to get ahead of my skis here.

I mean, I think that's where they're at. And, I mean, this is -- my whole take on why Twitter is so -- the board actually is so upset about Elon Musk coming in, I think when Elon comes in, you're going to -- he's going to want to see all of the algorithms, all of the garbage that they were doing to censor conservatives, what they did in the 2020 election, that might have violated election laws. And if he sees that, exposes it, all of a sudden, they have some real problems on their hands. That's why they're trying to keep him out.

So, what you have is -- the reason why -- I mean, one of the reasons why you have the loudest, hottest takes in media is because reporters are competing for likes, as opposed to stories. They used to go out. Now it's like, if I can get 35 retweets, or then 350 retweets, and then I'm guilty of this, I mean, I did this forever. I was like, sitting here on THE FIVE thinking, will this thing work? Will that thing work? And you can -- it's like playing a video game with jokes and stuff like that. So, I think it's -- but what it's done is it has it has phenomenally changed media. And the only way to unchecked it to get that thing fix is to kill that drug drip and he's got to do that. I also think it's an amazing mind exercise for anybody to think about what would you buy if you could change something? It's not like buying something you love. It's like, you know, I would love to buy Rolling Stone because I grew up listening to -- I'm reading Rolling Stone, and it's a terrible magazine, you know. You want to change it. And I think it's an interesting thing to watch somebody who buys something that they have a problem with, and then they're going to fix it. It's kind of neat.

I'm concerned about the shareholders. So, if this doesn't go to Elon Musk, I think there's going to be a huge action, class action, because that board will have breached its fiduciary responsibility and its fiduciary duties because they -- that board is not there to bankroll an agenda for some political organization that pretty much wants them push anti-free speech agenda. And that's what's going on with Twitter today. All I want is a place where there's free speech, where -- and it doesn't have to be monitored. All of a sudden, they're like, oh, we can't do it. It's too much. It's not too much. If child porn is on there, you shut it down. You know, and if there's a problem with imminent deadly physical force, you shut it down.

And when they get -- when they get on it, they can't get off. And take a look at these various zoos around the country with their drunk panda problems. They're just -- they drink and they just can't control. They fall. It's terrible. Look at this. This is embarrassing. Always landing, you know, it's like -- thank God they've got that fur. Oh, look at that guy. He had like four martinis. This guy had -- yes, that was -- that was after ladies night at the Margaritaville. So, this is it. This is it.

These students from Buckhannon Academy Elementary School read aloud to an attentive group of dogs and cats at the Louis Upshur animal control facilities. As a reward for locking in 96,000 minutes of reading to the animals in one month during a recent challenge, as a result, they got to go and visit their furry dogs and friends. Administrators said they hoped the fun reward would be -- motivate the students and encourage some adoptions. Now, what I want to know is if they read for 96,000 minutes, weren't they already there?"
