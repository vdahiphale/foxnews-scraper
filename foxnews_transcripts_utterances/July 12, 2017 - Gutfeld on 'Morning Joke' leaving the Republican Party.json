But the fact is, Donald Trump's victory owes a lot to Joe. Joe indulged him, flattered him, used him to gain access and ratings. To woo him away from \"Fox & Friends.\" Then when he saw Donald outgrow him, he imploded. But I wish him luck. I welcome his independence, even if it's just another stab at relevance, to be noticed at the next Hamptons cocktail party. I bet he's going to bring his guitar.",
