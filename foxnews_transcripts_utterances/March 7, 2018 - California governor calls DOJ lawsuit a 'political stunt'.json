Entire cities were all you can listen to is Fox News. In California, that's a true sanctuary city, a liberal city. Want to create cities with that? That's the problem with this whole story with the mayor of Oakland. Three words that make me giggle. If you follow the law, and you're breaking the law, you realize that this could easily be reversed. People can do this to you, too. If you believe this law isn't worth following, someone else can do to you -- for example, a sanctuary city for the unborn. I mean, the media would go apoplectic if you said here's a city where we will not perform any abortions at all. That would not happen. That would not happen. But here, you can do that because you agree with this law. And I think what these battles are designed to -- are designed for is to create celebrities, right? If you stand up against evil Trump, you're going to become famous.

Previously, it's sort always been like the feds were on their heels. Well now, by filing this lawsuit, the state is going to have to show up and try to defend themselves on these cases. And I think -- I am not a lawyer, but I think the supremacy clause of the constitution is going to bear out. We know that the courts have been all over the place on this. So it I think this actually is probably a useful exercise for us to find out, OK, where is the law on it? On the political side of things, everyone gets to rally. So, Jerry Brown loved it today. And, everyone on the Democrats will love this today. President Trump's people will have loved what Jeff Sessions did and then they are going to get excited because the president will be there next week, and so it is setting up for like high noon at the border. The last things I would say is I am curious about the point of this mayor, and then the legal point about her tipping off her citizens that the I.C.E. raid is coming. I don't know if it's illegal. But it doesn't have to be illegal for her to be sound wrong -- for it to sound like the wrong thing to do. And I was like -- if she was giving a heads up to a drug lord that the cops were coming and there's going to be a bust, that would be obstruction because she is trying to help out the drug lords. This one, I don't know where this would actually end up but it does feel like it's the wrong thing to do."

These aren't just like regular farm workers that are trying to make a living. These are bad hombres. So keeping criminals in cities is dangerous and dumb. A kindergartener can understand that logic. I don't understand why the Democrats don't get that. States have clashed over issues for years. I mean, over pot, over marriage, over voter I.D. with the federal government, now it's over immigration. The difference here, it's about public safety. And let's just pretend something. Juan, if some local gun dealer wasn't complying with the federal background checks when they sold weapons, the say, you know, I don't agree with that. I don't like the database deal with the FBI. I'm not even going to check to or I am not going to cooperate, it's the same kind of thing. It's dangerous.

The real winners in all of this stuff are lawyers because every issue, that we talk about, it always goes back to lawyers and cases and going to court. And it really is getting boring for me. But I want to add, which lead me to my next point, where is this going actually? Is this something that is worth fighting or dying for? To violate the law to allow symbolic or real sanctuary for illegal aliens, which, Jesse, points out the ones that are being arrested are criminals. Is this something you are willing to fight and die for? Is this like -- do you think this is as big as a fight against slavery or for civil rights, or the women's right to vote?

But what they do and what, Juan, has said when he describes Farrakhan as marginal, that's the strategy. You say that's marginal because you don't want your bad eggs on your side of the political fence to smear your party. So you're saying, we don't take him seriously. He's just a cult figure. But your guys -- your guys over there, David Duke, he's not a cult figure or some dude who organized a stupid march, he's actually got real power.

And you must be honest and therefore, callout both as inappropriate racist rhetoric that has no place in our society today. So we cannot sit here and condone this as some kind of appropriate free expression when it is racist hate speech that should be called out. That is why they are saying, look, fair is fair. Either one side of the equation, you do it to the other. So when people like Maxine Waters and Keith Ellison, and Gregory Meeks are associating with an individual like this, that is inappropriate.

It's a similar argument that they are just called and it figures. Then that actually should be a good thing. I mean if they are actually not having an impact, fine. I don't know.

It should come forward, and then the Tea Party with Rob Fletcher, thinking that it would be appropriate to get another special counsel, where at the same time, you have other Republicans saying, you know what, perhaps this is actually going to be a waste of time and money.

So to me, this is -- you know, I think this presidency is a lot of distraction. You always have to watch the other hand. We've lost Gary Cohn, his top economic advisor.
