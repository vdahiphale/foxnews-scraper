It goes less well when you actually have the political considerations. When you look at that really huge red wave you saw an 2010, that was a response to that test of whether the government should take over a massive part of the economy in the health care scenario. So it's a complicated thing, but certainly effective political messaging at the end. And it is interesting what people are focusing on and what they're not."

They didn't improve it. They got rid of the individual mandate in their tax law this year. That has made the pool sicker and the coverage more expensive. People know Republicans did not come up with an answer on this. They know the president is not telling the truth. This has been an issue in their ads for Democrats the entire campaign. Not impeachment, not immigration. Health care. It is the sleeper issue Republicans are panicked about it. If they take the House back, it will be because of health care."

      "utterance": "I picked West Virginia, and that might surprise some people, because the likelihood, the almost certainty is that Joe Manchin will win. The reason why West Virginia is interesting is that it was won massively by President Trump, and at the moment the Real Clear Politics average puts Manchin ahead by 12 points. But if that falls into single figures, it could suggest that Republicans have a great chance in the states that President Trump won in 2016. That could mean Florida, it could mean Indiana, it could mean Arizona, and Missouri."

      "utterance": "I chose California 39. This is an open seat and it's one of many that will be key to the Democrats actually retaking the House if they are able to do that. What's interesting about this is had Ed Royce not vacated this seat or announced he wasn't going to run again, almost certainly he would have kept it. It's now a toss-up. I think it's a good reminder that a lot of Republicans bought into the hype that this was going to be a blue tsunami, that it was going to be devastating, it was going to be just like President Obama's first midterm where so many seats were lost. And because they bought into the hype, these are actually some of the most vulnerable seats and maybe a good reminder that people should be more cautious about believing things like that."

      "utterance": "And you have it tied. So this, like I said, I think this could be the closest election of the night. I think this race is so fascinating, these two women are both moderates. McSally, an Air Force pilot, colonel in the Air Force is not running as a moderate. She chose not to. Republicans in Arizona are no longer the Republicans of John McCain or Jeff Flake. And so she's running harder to the right, while Sinema has told independent voters I'm for border security, I'm not a liberal, I'm not proud Democrat, and she has run as a moderate. They are both incredibly ambitious people. Sinema has these controversial statements in the past which I think could end up depressing independent vote, but she is way up with independents, and that could be key to her victory."

It will be interesting to see what happens as a result of that."
