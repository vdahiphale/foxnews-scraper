      "sentences": "Well, after a whirlwind trip, that actually want some rave reviews in Europe. President Trump touching down on U.S. soil a short while ago, but while he was basically in the air, a bunch of American media pundits were ripping him. One MSNBC picture even calling him a \"despicable\" human being. Not so nice. As the president also faces growing tensions over two separate trade wars he started, and escalating feud with Nancy Pelosi, and of course, a growing course of Democrats calling for his impeachment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, welcome home, Mr. President. Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum as she too travels home from an outstanding two days of reporting from Normandy, you saw all of that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president wrapping up a productive week of his own. That did not quite fit the narrative that some in the mainstream media try to jam down your throat. The Washington Post declaring way back in Monday, \"Trump's visit to Britain will be remembered as a low moment for a special relationship.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Time Magazine condemning the president's behavior in Europe on day one of the trip. Writing, \"Trump's visit is a reminder that Europe is being bullied by America.\" Except the opposite seems to play out, there was some real success in the U.K. as the president solidified that so-called special relationship. Then, onto France, where he received high praise his speech commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day. So, that original narrative predicting the president would fall on its face, well, it fell apart. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And with media barons across the pond, basically tipping their caps of the president for a rather brief moment, some of his harshest critics here at home admitted he did a good job. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The suspect's name is Ashiqul Alam, he's 22 years old from Bangladesh and was living as a permanent resident in Queens. Police arrested him last night after he allegedly tried to buy two semiautomatic pistols with the serial numbers removed from undercover officers. The FBI had been tracking Alam's movements since August of last year. Investigator say he repeatedly praised ISIS, Al Qaeda, and Osama Bin Laden and said he admired the attack on September 11th. Later, he allegedly began planning his own attack with a suicide vest in Times Square. He also considered Washington, D.C., saying he wanted to kill a senior government official. Agents said Alam planned to use grenades because they could, quote, \"take out at least eight people.\" He allegedly went so far as to record cell phone video of Times Square to map out his targets and on another occasion he said it would make him happy to see the flag of Islam on the Twin Towers or the Empire State building. He also allegedly talked about blowing up a military base and shooting law enforcement officers within an AR-15. The judge ordered him held on no bail, calling him a danger to the community. This is at least the sixth terror plot targeting Times Square since the 9/11 attacks. Back in 2010, a crude car bomb was found smoking in a car just one block south of where I'm standing right now. And in 2017, a man tries to set off a suicide bomb in the subway at Times Square. Both of those bombs failed to detonate. Investigators said this time there was no risk to Times Square that agents were watching this man's move every step of the way, but the criminal complaint against him certainly paints a dark picture of what agents say he wanted to see happen.

The 22- year-old came from a family of West Point graduates. In fact, his father said, quote, \"he was my first child. He was my hero.\" In fact, he is now a hero to so many of us. On a week when we celebrated the 75th anniversary of D-Day and we wonder about the greatest generation and the current generation, there are many in the current generation are doing so much, serving all of us every day. And we salute all of you. That is “The Story” on this Friday night. Martha will be back from France on Monday. I'll be back on \"Fox and Friends\" tomorrow bright and early 6:00 a.m. Eastern.

      "utterance": "Well, after a whirlwind trip, that actually want some rave reviews in Europe. President Trump touching down on U.S. soil a short while ago, but while he was basically in the air, a bunch of American media pundits were ripping him. One MSNBC picture even calling him a \"despicable\" human being. Not so nice. As the president also faces growing tensions over two separate trade wars he started, and escalating feud with Nancy Pelosi, and of course, a growing course of Democrats calling for his impeachment. Well, welcome home, Mr. President. Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum as she too travels home from an outstanding two days of reporting from Normandy, you saw all of that. The president wrapping up a productive week of his own. That did not quite fit the narrative that some in the mainstream media try to jam down your throat. The Washington Post declaring way back in Monday, \"Trump's visit to Britain will be remembered as a low moment for a special relationship.\" Time Magazine condemning the president's behavior in Europe on day one of the trip. Writing, \"Trump's visit is a reminder that Europe is being bullied by America.\" Except the opposite seems to play out, there was some real success in the U.K. as the president solidified that so-called special relationship. Then, onto France, where he received high praise his speech commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day. So, that original narrative predicting the president would fall on its face, well, it fell apart. And with media barons across the pond, basically tipping their caps of the president for a rather brief moment, some of his harshest critics here at home admitted he did a good job."

Just look at the story, I mean, even before he got there, you had the (INAUDIBLE) with Meghan Markle. \"Oh, the president's attacking Meghan Markle. No, he wasn't. She's the one that called him misogynist years ago, and he was responding to that. The president's attacking the mayor of London. No, the Mayor of London went out of his way to write a newspaper article saying that the president wasn't welcome and President Trump, responded. And then, as you pointed out with Nancy Pelosi. He didn't attack her. She was the one that said that he should be in prison. In fact, he started off and has for a long time tried to have a good respectful relationship with Nancy Pelosi and it's only recently that she's gone off the rails. The other week with that, that language, that inflammatory language about a cover-up in the White House, and now with this, this desire to see him in jail. He's responding to that."

She should remember that at the time she was talking about with Ronald Reagan, there were massive protests in London against Ronald Reagan, and the deployment of cruise missiles much bigger than anything you saw with Donald Trump in Germany, right across Europe. And when you bring it up to date and look at the -- look at the way that actually what this president has done is strengthen the special relationship. It really cooled off. In the Obama years, I remember this vividly. I was in Number 10 Downing Street working with Prime Minister David Cameron. When Obama came for his state visit, we were actually told don't even ask him to say the words, special relationship, because Obama doesn't believe in it. He prioritized this is the relationship with the E.U. or with Germany, don't even go there. Donald Trump, clearly loves the U.K., loves the royal family. Wants it to be a special relationship. And so, I think what he did this week is actually strengthen it."

    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",

Because what's quite clear from the story of the Trump campaign and now the presidency is that it's nothing to do with substance, it's nothing to do with anything real, they just don't like him. They think he's vulgar, they don't like the way he looks, the way he speaks, and there's nothing he can do, literally, nothing that will eliminate this Trump derangement syndrome we're seeing now all across the world."

Yes, I saw a lot of coverage on Twitter of how he signed the joint document with the other allies from World War II. I signed it at the top of the page, oh, the end of the world. I saw the -- I saw the media attempting to report that it was his fault that there was a delay in the ceremony when in reality it was because Emmanuel Macron, the head of France took too long to get there and it was supposedly because Trump delayed some -- delayed the event for an interview with Fox, which, of course, ended up being false. And I do think that the media coverage was already pre-set here. They were not going to allow him to have a full victory. And does it help when the president, you know, mouths off too much?"

I mean, the fact is that again, the president was there to pay homage to people who did give their lives in defense of American freedom in Western civilization. And the fact that she feels the need to go after Trump's military record and Joe Biden didn't serve in the military, either. Bill Clinton was presumably a draft dodger. So, this new found, you know, reverence for the idea that everybody has to serve from the same people who want to undercut the military and defund it is kind of amusing."

And those are Democrats that feel that way. I think there was a poll out there that said more than 50 percent of Democrats feel that way. So I think that he needs to stick to his guns.

It is a deeply personal decision that must be left exclusively to a woman and her doctor. And now they're saying, nevermind, let's also bring in the American people and their tax dollars, right. I think that this is one of the truces if you will that we've had in a very difficult debate over abortion, and we can have our differences of opinion and really fight those out in good faith. One of the few compromises that we've hammered out is the Hyde Amendment. It's been in place for many years with supportive Republicans and Democrats. And you're exactly right, there are many Democrats -- setting aside the pro-life Democrats, there are moderately pro-choice Democrats who Biden I think was right there with them and now he's gotten tug, tug, tug over to this really shocking position that is becoming basically mainstream in the Democrat Party."

I don't think there's a single Democrat running for president right now who is not among that 18 percent while 70 percent of the poll supports significant new restrictions on abortion, 70 percent.

Geoff Shepard, who served as deputy counsel of Nixon during Watergate, wrote this on Dean's coming testimony. \"John Dean is a convicted felon sentenced to a prison term of one to four years and disbarred from the practice of law for 45 years but he remained a media hero, the toast of the liberal media eastern establishment because he changed the story of what had happened to safe himself and to sink his former colleagues. Fact is, the ugly truth about John Dean is far different from what the American people have been led to believe.\" Dean takes the oath on Monday 2 p.m. Eastern, Ed. One can imagine his testimony this time will have a little bit fewer ratings points than during the Watergate days. Those hearings at times were seen by 70 percent of Americans."

He went to the unprecedented step of allowing his general counsel to spend more than 30 hours with the special prosecutor. He did exactly the opposite of what happened in the previous cases. Donald Trump should be winning award from the Sunlight Foundation and for others for being as open and transparent as he was. He really should be winning awards."

In Mueller's report, I don't get it, a double negative? He can't find that he didn't commit obstruction? Well, there's no underlying crime. There's no evidence of obstruction, and Mueller is not going to shed any light on that. So, as I said, I think John Dean's testimony is just political theater and I don't think people are going to be riveted to the TV set like they were 40 some odd years ago."

      "utterance": "Good evening, Ed. Investigators say that man unknowingly met with an undercover FBI agent at least 20 times not realizing the Joint Terrorism Task Force was building a case against him. The suspect's name is Ashiqul Alam, he's 22 years old from Bangladesh and was living as a permanent resident in Queens. Police arrested him last night after he allegedly tried to buy two semiautomatic pistols with the serial numbers removed from undercover officers. The FBI had been tracking Alam's movements since August of last year. Investigator say he repeatedly praised ISIS, Al Qaeda, and Osama Bin Laden and said he admired the attack on September 11th. Later, he allegedly began planning his own attack with a suicide vest in Times Square. He also considered Washington, D.C., saying he wanted to kill a senior government official. Agents said Alam planned to use grenades because they could, quote, \"take out at least eight people.\" He allegedly went so far as to record cell phone video of Times Square to map out his targets and on another occasion he said it would make him happy to see the flag of Islam on the Twin Towers or the Empire State building. He also allegedly talked about blowing up a military base and shooting law enforcement officers within an AR-15. The judge ordered him held on no bail, calling him a danger to the community. This is at least the sixth terror plot targeting Times Square since the 9/11 attacks. Back in 2010, a crude car bomb was found smoking in a car just one block south of where I'm standing right now. And in 2017, a man tries to set off a suicide bomb in the subway at Times Square. Both of those bombs failed to detonate. Investigators said this time there was no risk to Times Square that agents were watching this man's move every step of the way, but the criminal complaint against him certainly paints a dark picture of what agents say he wanted to see happen.

The allegation here is that from 2015 to 2018, 43-year-old Dr. William Husel gave 25 patients up to 2,000 micrograms of the opioid, that's 20 times the norm. So Dr. Husel is facing 25 counts of murder, but it's notable that pharmacist, nurses, and other medical technician, a chain of some 30 people all followed the doctor's orders. Now investigators in the Mount Carmel health system in Columbus are trying to figure out why. Most of the patients who died were end-of-life patients, meaning older and seriously ill. And prosecutors say some of the patients were unconscious and unable to feel pain, therefore the doses given by the doctor could not support any legitimate medical purpose.

Here's a tweet from ESPN's Ramona Shelburne. \"Curran says Jay-Z asked for a Vodka soda. She asked if he wanted lime with that, but it was loud at Oracle and she couldn't hear, so she leaned over. That's where the photos of Beyonce looking askance of her come from because everybody was talking about how Beyonce thought she was moving in on her man.\""

We now know the identity of the West Point cadet who was killed in a military vehicle crash just yesterday. Chris C.J. Morgan of New Jersey was a high school wrestling star. The 22- year-old came from a family of West Point graduates. In fact, his father said, quote, \"he was my first child. He was my hero.\" In fact, he is now a hero to so many of us. On a week when we celebrated the 75th anniversary of D-Day and we wonder about the greatest generation and the current generation, there are many in the current generation are doing so much, serving all of us every day. And we salute all of you. That is “The Story” on this Friday night. Martha will be back from France on Monday. I'll be back on \"Fox and Friends\" tomorrow bright and early 6:00 a.m. Eastern. Come check it out. Have a great, great weekend. In the meantime, Tucker is up next. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
