So far they say they are voting against the bipartisan infrastructure bill because there is not a deal on the other one, the reconciliation bill, Build Back Better bill. If 20 progressives vote against it, there won't be 20 Republicans that vote for it to cover that, so Nancy Pelosi will not have that bill passed potentially. She has not put it forward. Let's bring in our panel, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Harold, I called this a game of legislative Democratic chicken up there. But there are phone calls. There's pressure. The president has called into the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and so far they're not budging. And if that's the case, you are going to have to wait. It may punt to December.",

      "sentences": "First off, thanks for having me on and happy Friday, and what a day for the country as we bury Colin Powell. I'd say two things. Put the bill on the floor tonight, Speaker Pelosi and her leadership team should. I think that those progressives who wish to vote against it should be allowed to vote their conscience and then go home and defend it. If I was still in Congress and I represented a district in Memphis, if I had to go home and defend why I voted against the $1.2 trillion bill that would build more roads and bridges, that would build more broadband, make America more competitive against China and I voted against it, maybe I would have a good reason. Bret, I can't think of one right now, but those people should go home and defend those votes. I know Speaker Pelosi doesn't like it bring a bill to the floor where she does not have the votes. But this is one of those moments where I think you have to test the mettle, because if you don't, you could end up in the minority next year. As I can tell you, as someone that served 10 years in the minority, it's much better being in the majority.",

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "sentences": "Well, they may be in the minority anyway depending on what happens one way or the other here. Kimberley, the thing is that it's clear that this strategy by Speaker Pelosi of linking these two bills together has absolutely failed tonight. They have already punted. They say just vote on the infrastructure. We'll deal with the reconciliation later. They don't want to do that. And this is one of the reasons why there is a delay. From \"Wall Street Journal,\" $3.98 trillion trojan horse. If all of the provisions of the bill except green energy tax cuts are made permanent, new spending would increase by $3.98 trillion while the tax revenue would stay at $1.55 trillion over 10 years. This means the real cost of the Sanders-Biden- Pelosi budget is $4 trillion and it will put the U.S. on a path to European entropy. That's what these moderates are saying, we need to see the score. KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes, this is, what, the third or fourth time they have tried to do this? And look, if they'd brought up this infrastructure bill back in September, and Nancy Pelosi had simply said we are holding a vote on it, it probably would have passed. But I think that those numbers you just read out go to the weakness of the progressive Democratic position. They know that the rest of their party is very uncomfortable with this. They know that this isn't necessarily popular in big parts of the country, so they deliberately tied it to that more popular bill to try to force both of them through. And now we are seeing the limits of that policy.",

It is coming to roost here. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Kim and I both did a lot on this story. We actually always knew that it was a Democratic operation. We learned it was Democratic funded, that it was Democratic Party sourced. And yet, the major corporate media coverage said otherwise, causing untold damage. We know, in fact, that one of the people mentioned in this indictment yesterday, Dolan, was meeting with media figures. They already knew that as part of the Russia hoax. They already knew who some of these people were. And this is what is so frustrating about this. Some accountability can be had. We had one FBI lawyer who was indicted for his lies in wiretapping Trump campaign affiliates. We have one DNC, or Democrat party lawyer who has been indicted for his role in the hoax. And then yesterday we have this other operative who was indicted. But there are so many more people that need to be held accountable.

My loser, and I call my loser the person who could have done it better this week is Aaron Rodgers. I hope that he shot straight with his teammates and the league and others including fans about his vaccine status, but it doesn't seem like he did."
