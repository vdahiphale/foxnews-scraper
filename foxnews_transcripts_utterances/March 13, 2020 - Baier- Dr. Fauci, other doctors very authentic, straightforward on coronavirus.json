      "sentences": "The CDC has published guidelines on the coronavirus.gov to enable its -- coronavirus.gov and it's very, very heavily used right now, I will say, to enable every American to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves, their families, and their communities. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } While the risks to young and healthy Americans remains very low -- yes, we've learned about this over the last two weeks -- anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions and those who are most at risk. They have not done very well, older Americans who are -- especially if they have a health problem. They have not done well. We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take and that we see other people take. We want to prevent the spread and the transmission of the disease. It's incredible what sports -- what's happening with the sporting world where so many of the great sports we've gotten so used to at this time of the year. They're not going to be meeting, and they've done a great service actually, but that would be another way that it could be -- problems could be caused. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But this is why I outlined on Wednesday my administration's fact that we've issued a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visits to various places but particularly nursing homes. We should all be working off the same playbook when it comes to protecting Americans. We have to. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We need to be consistent in adopting measure to limit the spread of the virus. The virus is the same whether it's spreading in cities, towns, or rural communities. The tools and tactics for attacking it are similar no matter where you go -- no matter where you go. You have some hot spots throughout the world right now that people would have never thought possible. They're being very seriously affected. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Key among these efforts are breaking chains of transmission between people. These measures have been adapted by many companies, universities, and schools. And we want to protect the safety and the health of their employees and their students. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we've issued by CDC on these commonsense measures. A lot of it's commonsense. For the areas where the virus is spreading, the CDC is advising communities to postpone large gathering, postpone assemblies, social functions, and sporting events, stagger recess and lunch for schools that aren't canceled, limit in-person meetings, increase scheduled cleanings, and cancel work- sponsored travel among numerous other steps that could be taken. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on Earth, and in the coming weeks we will all have to make changes and sacrifices, but these short-term sacrifices will produce long-term gain. And again, I've said we're learning a lot for the future and future problems like this or worse -- or worse. It could get worse. The next eight weeks are critical. We can learn, and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of the doctors say it will wash through. It will flow through. Interesting terms, and very accurate. I think you're going to find a number of weeks it's going to be a very active term. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In times of hardship, the true character of America always shines through. We live in the company of the greatest heroes and the most inspiring citizens anywhere in the world. We want to take care of our people. We want to draw on the strength of our history, draw on the strength of our people, and we will get through this. All together we will just get through. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So much progress has already been made, and frankly the numbers because of steps that have been taken are at a level that a lot of people are surprised, especially when you compare them with other places, with far smaller populations. The spirit and the will of our nation is unbreakable. We will defeat this threat. When America is tested, America rises to the occasion. And to those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones, I want you to know that your federal government will unleash every authority, resource, and tool in its disposal to safeguard the lives and health of our people. So we're with you every step of the way. No nation is more prepared or more equipped to face down this crisis. As you know, we are rated number one in the world. We're also helping other nations. Many of the nations, we're helping them a lot, and they're doing OK in some cases and some cases they're not doing well at all, but we're working with a lot of groups of people and a lot of other nations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } With faith and heart and hope and love and determination, we will succeed, we will prevail, we will be very, very successful and we'll learn for the future. Thank you all very much. If you have any questions, we can take some. Go ahead, John, please. And if you'd like to ask some of the folks up here, would be fine.

And I've mentioned it many times, and I think it's important and appropriate for me to mention it again because it answers your question -- when you talk about preventing infections from without in -- which is the kind of travel restrictions we're talking about -- then how do you handle what you already have in your country? You continue some sort of containment, but you also do mitigation and you try to proportion it to the areas where there are the most infections. The success of that, and how much you make this turn into this, is going to give you the amount of time. If we're successful, it'll be less. If we're not successful, it's going to be more.

But given the sheer scale of this, the president tasked us with bringing together this extraordinary public and private partnership. Today by some estimates when you add all the labs together, and today the president made it possible for every state in the country and their state labs to authorize labs across their state to do coronavirus testing. We're estimating somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 tests a day are able to be performed, but very soon with the program that was announced today, Americans will be able to visit one of the sites closest to them as described on the Web site. If they're symptomatic, if the questionnaire indicates it be able to have a test there, and these incredible companies will process the test and they'll receive that information. But for now, the best advice that we can give for people to speak to their doctor as the president has just said, and if the doctor indicates that physician if it's not a university hospital or an otherwise authorized lab can contact the state lab. And again, every state lab in the country can perform tests today. But what the president charged us with when I was tasked to take over the White House Coronavirus Task Force was open up tests all across the country. The president said a few days ago that we made it clear that any American that wanted to get a test would be able clinically to get a test because I literally heard from the Governor of Washington state who said the doctors in Washington state were saying that if you were only mildly symptomatic they would not order a test, and fortunately the president directed CDC to clarify that. Now, anyone in consultation with their physician regardless of their symptoms can request a test and their doctors will contact those agencies, those labs in their state, but very soon Americans will be able to go into these drive-in sites and be able to obtain and participate in a test.

So they've delivered that to doctor's offices and hospitals, and then they will arrange to pick that up. The important piece in this all is they've gone from a machine that may have a lower throughput to the potential to have automated extraction. I know you don't want all of these details, but it's really key for the laboratory people. It's an automated extraction of the RNA that then runs in an automated way on the machine, with no one touching it, and the result comes out at the other end. So, sample to machine to results.

So, today, as you said, biggest point gains ever for the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq, a massive rally, no other way to say it. You mentioned this, too. Charles, of course, as we got towards the close, we closed at the highs of the session. So, if people are wondering which groups really supported the markets, gave them that juice as we went towards the close, two key groups. You had financials and technology. Now, if you look at the Dow all by itself, Apple, Goldman, Microsoft, American Express, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Visa, they were responsible for half of the Dow's gains. Another indicator that sometimes we focus on just measuring fear, that VIX, that measure of volatility, yesterday, it was above 50. Today, it was halved. You had the biggest drop on the VIX in about three years. So safe to say at least some investors were feeling reassured about what they heard. And, of course, there was this drumbeat run-up to the president's press conference, which was slated to start at 3:00 p.m., started a little bit later, but did seem to reassure a lot of investors, which is why we saw more steam going into the close.

Small example, if we have to go into meetings, here's a small thing. Let's make sure that we have an empty chair next to us when we go into meetings, so that we got at least six feet apart.

While the risks to young and healthy Americans remains very low -- yes, we've learned about this over the last two weeks -- anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions and those who are most at risk. They have not done very well, older Americans who are -- especially if they have a health problem. They have not done well. We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take and that we see other people take. We want to prevent the spread and the transmission of the disease. It's incredible what sports -- what's happening with the sporting world where so many of the great sports we've gotten so used to at this time of the year. They're not going to be meeting, and they've done a great service actually, but that would be another way that it could be -- problems could be caused. But this is why I outlined on Wednesday my administration's fact that we've issued a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visits to various places but particularly nursing homes. We should all be working off the same playbook when it comes to protecting Americans. We have to. We need to be consistent in adopting measure to limit the spread of the virus. The virus is the same whether it's spreading in cities, towns, or rural communities. The tools and tactics for attacking it are similar no matter where you go -- no matter where you go. You have some hot spots throughout the world right now that people would have never thought possible. They're being very seriously affected. Key among these efforts are breaking chains of transmission between people. These measures have been adapted by many companies, universities, and schools. And we want to protect the safety and the health of their employees and their students. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we've issued by CDC on these commonsense measures. A lot of it's commonsense. For the areas where the virus is spreading, the CDC is advising communities to postpone large gathering, postpone assemblies, social functions, and sporting events, stagger recess and lunch for schools that aren't canceled, limit in-person meetings, increase scheduled cleanings, and cancel work- sponsored travel among numerous other steps that could be taken. Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on Earth, and in the coming weeks we will all have to make changes and sacrifices, but these short-term sacrifices will produce long-term gain. And again, I've said we're learning a lot for the future and future problems like this or worse -- or worse. It could get worse. The next eight weeks are critical. We can learn, and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of the doctors say it will wash through. It will flow through. Interesting terms, and very accurate. I think you're going to find a number of weeks it's going to be a very active term. In times of hardship, the true character of America always shines through. We live in the company of the greatest heroes and the most inspiring citizens anywhere in the world. We want to take care of our people. We want to draw on the strength of our history, draw on the strength of our people, and we will get through this. All together we will just get through. So much progress has already been made, and frankly the numbers because of steps that have been taken are at a level that a lot of people are surprised, especially when you compare them with other places, with far smaller populations. The spirit and the will of our nation is unbreakable. We will defeat this threat. When America is tested, America rises to the occasion. And to those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones, I want you to know that your federal government will unleash every authority, resource, and tool in its disposal to safeguard the lives and health of our people. So we're with you every step of the way. No nation is more prepared or more equipped to face down this crisis. As you know, we are rated number one in the world. We're also helping other nations. Many of the nations, we're helping them a lot, and they're doing OK in some cases and some cases they're not doing well at all, but we're working with a lot of groups of people and a lot of other nations. With faith and heart and hope and love and determination, we will succeed, we will prevail, we will be very, very successful and we'll learn for the future. Thank you all very much. If you have any questions, we can take some. Go ahead, John, please. And if you'd like to ask some of the folks up here, would be fine. Please."

It's a great business -- it's a great U.S. business, frankly and I know how important they are to the country -- that includes airlines but the cruise line business obviously was hit very hard. We had a tremendous success out in Oakland, where we moved it -- Vice President Pence did a fantastic job with that. We worked with UK, we worked with Canada. They took their people back -- and Canada's approximately 600 people. UK, likewise, took a large number of people back to the United Kingdom. And we have people quarantined. It was a big operation and it worked out really -- you don't hear about it anymore, it worked out really well.

And that -- that -- that program with the Grand Princess, the ship, is continuing to be administered in the highest standards and orderly way, as the president directed. And American's that needed treatment have received it. I spoke to the governor of Iowa today and some of those who now have been cleared are -- are able, in proper supervision, to be returning to Iowa. They're making arrangements for them to do that. Others in Texas, others in Georgia -- again, it's another example of the extraordinary cooperation of Governor Abbott, Governor Gavin Newsom, and Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia. But to add to that, the president directed me last Saturday to travel down to Miami, we met with all the leaders of the cruise line industry. Several cruise lines have announced a 60-day pause in operations. Our Department of Homeland Security has praised them for doing that because of the unique health challenges particularly presented to seniors with underlying conditions. We have a proposal from the cruise line industry but they're currently considering what other steps that they might take, perhaps even similar to what those other lines have taken. We're anticipating some response on that in the next 24 hours. But as the president said, the American people cherish our cruise line industry, the men and women who work on the ships, the men and women who work on the shore, all the economies that are so benefited by a vibrant cruise line industry. And what the president's directed us to do is, whether there -- whether there is a pause in the moment, as some cruise lines are doing -- and as well all continue to discuss, we want to work with the cruise line industry to ensure that when we come through this that cruise lines and the medical services that are available and -- for the passengers and all of the crew, that -- that -- that cruise lines are safer than ever before and prosper for many years to come."

How long will the American people have to remain on this emergency footing? And for Dr. Birx, as the administration tries to get its arms around this test kit shortage issue, the next glaring need could be respirators and related hospital equipment. So what is the administration doing right now to ramp-up production of respirators and that kind of equipment, should this outbreak persist?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAUCI",
      "utterance": "So when you have an outbreak like this, particularly if you're trying to interfere with it, it's really impossible to predict the time element of when it's going to peak and when it's naturally going to go down. So if you look at the situation where countries really did not get to the point of trying to contain and mitigate very well, you'll see a peak over several weeks and then down again over another several weeks. What we're trying to do with the efforts that we're doing is to blunt that peak. And I've mentioned it many times, and I think it's important and appropriate for me to mention it again because it answers your question -- when you talk about preventing infections from without in -- which is the kind of travel restrictions we're talking about -- then how do you handle what you already have in your country? You continue some sort of containment, but you also do mitigation and you try to proportion it to the areas where there are the most infections. The success of that, and how much you make this turn into this, is going to give you the amount of time. If we're successful, it'll be less. If we're not successful, it's going to be more. But these kinds of things generally run out in a few months; hopefully, we'll make it several weeks -- eight, nine, whatever weeks. But I can't give you a number because it depends on how successful we are."

So you can learn very -- and I appreciate there was some graphics done by some of the reporting over the last several days. If you align the data from China with the data from South Korea, you can start to see almost a complete overlay of that data. And so that's what we're tracking very closely, as well as Italy. But you have an excellent question. I just want to make one note. In South Korea -- I want to repeat -- only 4 percent of the tests were positive. That means 96 percent of the people had a different respiratory disease because we're in the middle of flu season, cold season, and all of the other respiratory diseases that we get every day. In LabCorp and Quest's early data, they're running about 1 percent to 2 percent positive. That means that we have a lot more other respiratory disease out there besides the coronavirus. And that's why the screening is critical. But even with the screening, we're going to run what we think are very low rates. Needless to say though, we are taking it extraordinarily seriously to plan for what could come -- not what -- what Dr. Fauci talked about blunting the curve, that makes it much less high need at that peak of the curve that we're all planning for. So we're in full inventory of all of our assets, by the president on unlocking and this emergency order, and the Secretary of HHS ability, it unlocks all of those stockpiles, those needs -- what the VA has, what the DOD has, what the National Guard has and what every hospital has. And the Hospital Emergency Preparedness Plan allows them to defer elective issues to keep those hospital beds open for those who might need it. So we're in full planning mode for each of those things."

And that's the reason why, when you talk about even influenza, which we have extraordinary experience with over decades and decades, the people who are very vulnerable are the elderly and those with underlying conditions.

      "utterance": "Well, as the president said and Dr. Fauci has articulated, the nature of our current system where the CDC has samples sent and tests are performed or state labs perform tests or in some cases university and hospital labs perform tests is generally adequate for an infectious disease or for people getting diagnostic work done. But given the sheer scale of this, the president tasked us with bringing together this extraordinary public and private partnership. Today by some estimates when you add all the labs together, and today the president made it possible for every state in the country and their state labs to authorize labs across their state to do coronavirus testing. We're estimating somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 tests a day are able to be performed, but very soon with the program that was announced today, Americans will be able to visit one of the sites closest to them as described on the Web site. If they're symptomatic, if the questionnaire indicates it be able to have a test there, and these incredible companies will process the test and they'll receive that information. But for now, the best advice that we can give for people to speak to their doctor as the president has just said, and if the doctor indicates that physician if it's not a university hospital or an otherwise authorized lab can contact the state lab. And again, every state lab in the country can perform tests today. But what the president charged us with when I was tasked to take over the White House Coronavirus Task Force was open up tests all across the country. The president said a few days ago that we made it clear that any American that wanted to get a test would be able clinically to get a test because I literally heard from the Governor of Washington state who said the doctors in Washington state were saying that if you were only mildly symptomatic they would not order a test, and fortunately the president directed CDC to clarify that. Now, anyone in consultation with their physician regardless of their symptoms can request a test and their doctors will contact those agencies, those labs in their state, but very soon Americans will be able to go into these drive-in sites and be able to obtain and participate in a test. Dr. Birx, is there more to amplify that?"

I think just to review once more time about the testing, with LabCorp and Quest, I think many of you have been to doctor's office and seen the little boxes outside. What they do is they deliver both the specimen collection piece because remember it's a nasal swab. It's not a tube of blood. So they've delivered that to doctor's offices and hospitals, and then they will arrange to pick that up. The important piece in this all is they've gone from a machine that may have a lower throughput to the potential to have automated extraction. I know you don't want all of these details, but it's really key for the laboratory people. It's an automated extraction of the RNA that then runs in an automated way on the machine, with no one touching it, and the result comes out at the other end. So, sample to machine to results. That cuts out a lot of the manual pieces that were happening that were delaying the test results."

We believe, with this test, because of its throughput, that the testing can be from start, remember it has to transport, to the laboratory that will run it and then we're hoping that all can be finished within 24 hours, which is very similar to other tests that you receive today. These are not point of care tests. We are working on point of care tests but we have to realize point of care tests takes six months or more to develop, so we're not waiting for those. We're still diagnosing this on nucleic acid, so it's an antibody, this is actually the antigen that the actual virus in your nose that we're amplifying."

So, today, as you said, biggest point gains ever for the Dow, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq, a massive rally, no other way to say it. You mentioned this, too. Charles, of course, as we got towards the close, we closed at the highs of the session. So, if people are wondering which groups really supported the markets, gave them that juice as we went towards the close, two key groups. You had financials and technology. Now, if you look at the Dow all by itself, Apple, Goldman, Microsoft, American Express, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Visa, they were responsible for half of the Dow's gains. Another indicator that sometimes we focus on just measuring fear, that VIX, that measure of volatility, yesterday, it was above 50. Today, it was halved. You had the biggest drop on the VIX in about three years. So safe to say at least some investors were feeling reassured about what they heard. And, of course, there was this drumbeat run-up to the president's press conference, which was slated to start at 3:00 p.m., started a little bit later, but did seem to reassure a lot of investors, which is why we saw more steam going into the close. I do want to mention, Charles, we are still technically in a bear market, as we know, 20 percent off the recent highs, but a good way towards earning back some of those points today -- Charles, in the meantime, back to you."

It was impressive just to see companies that compete against each other to come out and say, we're doing this for the good of the country. Now, how that rolls out and what it looks like, clearly, the market saw some comfort, as you note, but the timing of getting it around the country will be the next challenge. I also think, Charles, it's really comforting that Dr. Anthony Fauci, Tony Fauci, is very -- he just has this personality that he has now been an authentic arbiter of straight talk when it comes to all of this stuff.

I will give you an example. What's really going to be the most effective thing here are people making individual decisions to do social distancing and keep this virus from overtaking the state of Washington. Small example, if we have to go into meetings, here's a small thing. Let's make sure that we have an empty chair next to us when we go into meetings, so that we got at least six feet apart. That strategy could be as important as any presidential declaration. And I say that really urging people to join this cause. I'm pleased that many are.

Again, that food supply is secure. Our warehouses are ready to go. Most districts are going to create multiple checkpoints in their community where families can come and get breakfast or lunch. Some of them are already working on distribution models, where they're going to deliver and bring that. Our reporting system will be on several factors that the governor has asked us to report on, nutritional services, child care for health care workers and first responders, our seniors and juniors' progress. All of these will go as an expectation that districts write plans about those. And by the end of next week, we will be collecting those plans to know what the game plan is in each of the 295 school districts."

They're already a before- or after-school program provider. And it's a matter of sort of filling in the gaps. We do have districts who don't do any of this stuff right now. And, so for them, it's a harder launch, it's a harder start. And you might see them partnering with the nonprofit community or the private sector, where there are capacity opportunities, and just simply utilizing them in partnership."

We have got American companies jumping on the task, American ingenuity, all of a government approach at the federal and the state level. So, yes, very impressive."

      "speaker": "HOEVEN",
      "utterance": "Right on. I was a governor for 10 years. And that's very helpful, because, again, with the national emergency declaration the president has issued, you now not only have those Stafford funds that he talked to -- about. You also have a lot more flexibility. So, now you have all 50 states setting up emergency centers, then working with the new tests, the new approach to testing, where you have got these stores now, like Walmart and Walgreens and Target, can get people. Not only do you have a faster test, but you have a lot greater throughput. So that's why I say it's not only the federal government response. You're unleashing the power of all the states and private enterprise..."

It appears that Republicans are not going to support this. They have reservations because President Trump is not behind it. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have spoken 11 times today, including a couple of times during the president's remarks. The president was vague as to the reasons he opposes this. He said, we don't think they are giving enough. But we don't really know what the opposition is. Some Republicans said that the opposition -- quote -- \"was technical\" -- Charles."
