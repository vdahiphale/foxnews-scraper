We'll be in Washington, covering it all, but the bickering over how it's all going down has already begun. Mitch McConnell moments ago, has laid out the ground rules that everyone has been waiting for, including 12-hour days for both sides to present their cases. That will get rolling on Wednesday at 1 PM to accommodate the justices, the Chief Justice's schedule. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Chuck Schumer says, well that means the evidence is going to be presented into the wee hours of the night when the American people can't hear it. He says that's exactly what the Republicans want. So, is the Senate majority and minority leaders hammer out these details no matter how you slice it, it's a painful process folks, painful for the White House, people for Democrats who are hoping for a do-over on witnesses, and for the 2020 candidates, they get pulled off the campaign trail during this whole thing just weeks before the Iowa caucuses. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It is also painful for Republicans for many reasons. Some want witnesses. Others just wanted to be over calling for an immediate dismissal. So, tonight, we will talk to Republican Senator Tim Scott about all of those questions. He's going to serve as one of the jurors in this trial. Also, Democrat Debbie Dingell is here to react to what is going on and what we're learning about the rules tonight. Karl Rove and Chris Hahn also here about this New York Times endorsement of Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. Pretty opposite in terms of the way they approach policy, so why did they endorse both of them against President Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also why is Netflix courting Meghan and Harry.

It doesn't say abuse of power in this kind of squishy stuff that we're seeing in the impeachment articles. So, I think they're in a good spot to start off pounding away on kind of a legal defense only, a constitutional offense. Then turning to the practice in terms of how this thing got here and focusing mighty heavily on Adam Schiff and what happened below and then really in last place, but still important would be to talk about the actual facts, but they don't want to start off with the facts, they don't even want to start off with Adam Schiff. They want to start with saying, this is not an impeachable offense and they've got good precedent for saying that.",

I detect something of a kind of an internal battle in the lengthy trial submission, the memo that they filed today, close to 120 pages, it seems to me that the first two-thirds of it does exactly what Jim is talking about which is pounding away at the point that these allegations do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The last third of it gets into the facts of the case which is where I think there's peril for the President, because if you argue too much on the facts that helps the case of the people who want more witnesses and new documents to be called. And I think the division here is that the lawyers see their job, I think quite rightly as they need to prevail on whether the President gets acquitted of these articles of impeachment. The President wants factual vindication. I don't think that's likely or maybe even possible to happen. He's going to have to just consent himself with being acquitted. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

You interview them outside the main trial. I think in the Clinton impeachment, there was one member of the Senate from each party present and then you can argue over what's admissible and what's privileged and all that stuff.

There is some support for that. Once they get to that point, they've heard a lot of the evidence not to have an up or down vote by some senators maybe to exonerate the President, but just cut this off at the pass.

And let history be our guide in 1999 with President Clinton's impeachment trial, there was a motion to dismiss by the legendary West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, the former Senate majority leader. The Senate voted 56, 44 to reject Senator Byrd's motion to dismiss. All Democratic senators voted to dismiss save one that's Russ Feingold who at the time was a Democratic senator from Wisconsin. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, we don't think that they would get to that if that's in play at all until maybe the middle of next week. Now what we have here is a very compressed schedule. Wednesday and Thursday is when the House of Representatives will present its case, 12 hours and then the defense later on. Tomorrow is going to be a lot of wrangling about how they get there including the very high probability of a closed session.

It says, quote, \"Due to the conflict of interest of you being involved in these matters as Attorney General and in an effort to preserve the public trust in a rule of law, we request that you recuse yourself and allow the appointment of a special prosecutor from outside the Department of Justice to handle this case.\" Parnas has had numerous times in interviews, Martha, he is prepared to be called as a witness for the president's Senate trial underway tomorrow.

      "utterance": "So, talking about history, the impeachment trial is now upon us and it starts tomorrow. We'll be in Washington, covering it all, but the bickering over how it's all going down has already begun. Mitch McConnell moments ago, has laid out the ground rules that everyone has been waiting for, including 12-hour days for both sides to present their cases. That will get rolling on Wednesday at 1 PM to accommodate the justices, the Chief Justice's schedule. Chuck Schumer says, well that means the evidence is going to be presented into the wee hours of the night when the American people can't hear it. He says that's exactly what the Republicans want. So, is the Senate majority and minority leaders hammer out these details no matter how you slice it, it's a painful process folks, painful for the White House, people for Democrats who are hoping for a do-over on witnesses, and for the 2020 candidates, they get pulled off the campaign trail during this whole thing just weeks before the Iowa caucuses. It is also painful for Republicans for many reasons. Some want witnesses. Others just wanted to be over calling for an immediate dismissal. So, tonight, we will talk to Republican Senator Tim Scott about all of those questions. He's going to serve as one of the jurors in this trial. Also, Democrat Debbie Dingell is here to react to what is going on and what we're learning about the rules tonight. Karl Rove and Chris Hahn also here about this New York Times endorsement of Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. Pretty opposite in terms of the way they approach policy, so why did they endorse both of them against President Trump. Also why is Netflix courting Meghan and Harry. But first up, Andy McCarthy, former federal prosecutor and Fox News Contributor, and Jim Trusty, former DOJ prosecutor. Great to have both of you with us tonight, gentlemen."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Martha that it's pretty much what we expected in terms of the sequencing. In terms of time, he's clearly putting the pedal to the metal maybe in a way that that is even faster than we all anticipated. But you know, it strikes me that the framers talked about impeachment in terms of how divisive it can be and what social upheaval it can cause in the country. The Democrats at least feigned that they were pained to do this, because of how difficult it is for the country. The Republicans have been adamant that this is terrible for the country. If everybody feels that way, there is a good argument for the sooner we get it over with the better."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, Jim, you've said since the beginning that you think that there aren't any impeachable offenses here because especially with regard to the obstruction of Congress charge. How do you think, and I want to ask Andy this question too, because I know he commented on it? How do you think that the President's team is doing so far on these questions, because a lot of them have been out there for the past 24 hours? Do you think they're doing a good job?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think so. They're hitting the sequence right. I think the starting point here has to be essentially like a motion to dismiss in a civil case. And that doesn't mean tomorrow versus at the end of the arguments. But it's something where you basically say, we don't really care what the exact facts are, because it could never be a crime. It could never be an impeachable offense. And keep in mind, the Republicans have the benefit of looking at the plain language of the Constitution, bribery, treason, high crimes and misdemeanors. It doesn't say abuse of power in this kind of squishy stuff that we're seeing in the impeachment articles. So, I think they're in a good spot to start off pounding away on kind of a legal defense only, a constitutional offense. Then turning to the practice in terms of how this thing got here and focusing mighty heavily on Adam Schiff and what happened below and then really in last place, but still important would be to talk about the actual facts, but they don't want to start off with the facts, they don't even want to start off with Adam Schiff. They want to start with saying, this is not an impeachable offense and they've got good precedent for saying that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, Andy McCarthy, do you agree with that? Because you seem to suggest that you felt like they did get a little bit into sort of arguing the case on its merits rather than that there is no impeachable offense out of the gate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, yes Martha. I think Jim is right. And I think, if you looked only at the very brief submission that the President's lawyers put in over the weekend which was only seven pages and really emphasized a lot on the facts that was what stuck out to me. I detect something of a kind of an internal battle in the lengthy trial submission, the memo that they filed today, close to 120 pages, it seems to me that the first two-thirds of it does exactly what Jim is talking about which is pounding away at the point that these allegations do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses. The last third of it gets into the facts of the case which is where I think there's peril for the President, because if you argue too much on the facts that helps the case of the people who want more witnesses and new documents to be called. And I think the division here is that the lawyers see their job, I think quite rightly as they need to prevail on whether the President gets acquitted of these articles of impeachment. The President wants factual vindication. I don't think that's likely or maybe even possible to happen. He's going to have to just consent himself with being acquitted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean what do you detect in all of that, Jim? Because I think that's pretty interesting. You know, the President likes to counter punch and there's sort of two ways to go at that. And the choosing of these members of the legal team suggests that he really wants to hear from them. He wants a vociferous defense of him by a number of these individuals, it looks like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Right. But you want to get back behind closed doors with the President and say look, you know right now you're in a position where you're going to win, maybe on legal grounds, maybe on a straight vote down the road after testimony. But the only way it gets better for the Democrats and to have any chance of removal is if some Hail Mary comes through by way of witness testimony."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "So, you know as much as the horse trading makes it different than what we're used to in criminal cases or civil cases, we can talk about Hunter Biden, we can talk about John Bolton and whether or not that's going to move the needle in any direction. But at the end of the day, there's some risk there. And so, I think you have to say, Mr. President be satisfied that you'll have a full-throated defense, you will win in terms of this not being an impeachable couple of articles or at least win on the merits. But the longer this thing goes, the more likely the Democrats are going to at least pronounce that they found something exciting and new at his expense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And you know with regard to witnesses Andy, do we ever see John Bolton at that table or is there a possibility that he's interviewed outside of the room and some of that is entered into this case. How do you see it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think Martha that if we get to the trip wire and we get over into witnesses, the best proposal will probably be what they - something like what they had in the Clinton impeachment, which is you won't be able to hold it to Bolton I think and that's even more reason to do this. You interview them outside the main trial. I think in the Clinton impeachment, there was one member of the Senate from each party present and then you can argue over what's admissible and what's privileged and all that stuff. And after they interview them, probably a fairly short subset of snippets would be played on video in the main trial and then they can say, we did witnesses. Now let's move on to a final vote."

Among those guidelines of which there are many so-called kill switch option. That's what people are - look at this whole thing are calling it. It leaves open the possibility for the President's legal team at some point after the arguments to move to dismiss the two articles of impeachment. Fox News Congressional Correspondent, Chad Pergram has all of this for us tonight from Capitol Hill. He's going through it all and tells us what it looks like. Hi, Chad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, good evening, Martha. Well, you know if you get through the guts of the trial. You get through the opening arguments, you get through the presentation that the House managers will make and the defense that the President's attorneys will make up, then they get into this question of witnesses and documents. And around that point is when they could consider as you put it, the kill switch. It says on page three that other motions are in play according to the Senate's impeachment rules. There is some support for that. Once they get to that point, they've heard a lot of the evidence not to have an up or down vote by some senators maybe to exonerate the President, but just cut this off at the pass. What we don't think will happen is that early on in the process meaning tomorrow or Wednesday that there would be any process there. There's nothing in the rules that would provide for that. So that's something that would have to happen after they answer this question about witnesses and documents. And let history be our guide in 1999 with President Clinton's impeachment trial, there was a motion to dismiss by the legendary West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, the former Senate majority leader. The Senate voted 56, 44 to reject Senator Byrd's motion to dismiss. All Democratic senators voted to dismiss save one that's Russ Feingold who at the time was a Democratic senator from Wisconsin. So, we don't think that they would get to that if that's in play at all until maybe the middle of next week. Now what we have here is a very compressed schedule. Wednesday and Thursday is when the House of Representatives will present its case, 12 hours and then the defense later on. Tomorrow is going to be a lot of wrangling about how they get there including the very high probability of a closed session. Tomorrow night, Martha."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think its good news frankly. The President has not had an opportunity to respond publicly to the impeachment process. Remember that the House went through the entire process without allowing the President to position himself from a defensive perspective. That is just kangaroo court if there ever was one. For the first time, the American people have a chance to have the President's team rebut the House's case. That is necessary for everyone to have the type of illumination on what actually happened. I think it's a very important step. 24 hours for the House to present their arguments and then 24 hours for the President's team to pick it apart. I am actually looking forward to hearing that rebuttal."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

When you talk about a kill switch vote Senator Scott and you hear, the look back in history with Chad Pergram that Robert Byrd of West Virginia suggested that at one point and it was - it didn't go over, it was shot down. Are you in favor of a kill switch on this whole thing and not going to witnesses, would you be in favor of that kind of vote?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, I certainly think that the witness conversation won't happen until after the 48 hours and perhaps 16 hours of questions from all 100 of us will have a chance to ask questions and then there will be a chance for a vote. It's hard to determine what will happen in that vote. It's hard for me to tell you what I'll do in that. What I do realize is that the whole conversation about witnesses have nothing to do with impeaching the President. It has everything to do with removing at least four senators from office who are Republicans. The entire process of calling witnesses that were not heard in the House is about getting Cory Gardner to take tough votes, it's about having Susan Collins take tough votes, it's about having Thom Tillis in North Carolina to take tough votes, it's about Martha McSally taking tough votes. The subplot to having witnesses before the Senate has nothing to do with illuminating the case of bringing more information to the surface. It has everything to do with putting those pivotal senators between a rock and a hard place and that has unfortunately nothing to do with impeachment. I do think that we should not hear from witnesses who did not testify in the House. If Speaker Pelosi wants to hear from Mr. Bolton, she can compel him to come before the House and start the process over on a different case."

At the end of the day, he's right. They do have the opportunity to have votes. I look forward to voting no on any witness that was not a witness during the House. It is not our responsibility as senators to help improve or expand the case. The way that we understand the process. The House sends over a completed case and we make a decision based on that completed case. If the House doesn't like the case is sent over, then they need to do something in the House to change that case.

I would say that there are certainly between four and seven Republican senators who may have a strong opinion on having witnesses testify or having an individual witness testify. There was also a case made by some of our colleagues that if we're going to call witnesses, let's make sure that we do it with the concept of reciprocity in the front of our minds. In other words, if we call to a House witnesses, we should make sure that the President has a chance to call two equal witnesses. It does get into a quagmire pit, because each state that I talked about, the politics in each state is very different. I hope we focus on the truth and the truth of the matter is the House put together such a shoddy case, did not allow the President to respond to that case. And in America, you are innocent until proven guilty, not guilty until proven innocent. And there was no criminal intent as a part of the impeachment documents, there's so many challenging aspects of this case that it breaks my heart that we are putting the President of the United States on what is basically a death row trial for the circumstantial evidence that we've heard so much about. It's heartbreaking to watch the Democrats just trash the Constitution in so many ways and to do it with personal venom."

You know I think as a nation, we've gotten to a place where you wonder if there is at least across the board people in whatever form they do this wanting the President to be ultimately successful. And you know when you look at the White House legal brief, I'm just going to show you a bit of this, their fixation meaning Democrats on damaging the President has trivialized the momentous act of impeachment to base the standards of impeachable conduct and perverted the power of impeachment by turning it into a partisan election year political tool. And then the Democrats have said, the President Trump's engaged in a trifecta of constitutional misconduct warranting removal. So, these two sides are pretty dug in, Debbie.

Parnas and an associate were arrested at Dallas airport just outside D.C. on October 9th with one-way tickets to Europe. The two men have ties to Ukraine. Parnas a close associate of the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is accused of funneling money from foreign governments and U.S. candidates hoping to buy political influence. Parnas is also accused of trying to persuade Ukrainian officials to investigate Hunter Biden. Now Parnas and his team want a special prosecutor at the helm, arguing that Attorney General Bill Barr is simply too close to the case. They sent a letter to the attorney general, faxed it to him and his team at the Department of Justice this morning. Technically, Barr oversees U.S. attorneys prosecuting Parnas. While his case is in the Southern District of New York, Barr is at the top of the Department of Justice. Now Parnas and his team they believe that Barr, since they say that he is a part of the president's impeachment probe and matters related to Ukraine, he cannot independently be effective. I want to read part of the letter from Parnas' team to Barr. It says, quote, \"Due to the conflict of interest of you being involved in these matters as Attorney General and in an effort to preserve the public trust in a rule of law, we request that you recuse yourself and allow the appointment of a special prosecutor from outside the Department of Justice to handle this case.\" Parnas has had numerous times in interviews, Martha, he is prepared to be called as a witness for the president's Senate trial underway tomorrow.

Pete Buttigieg who is 38 has an all-star resume, we look forward to him working his way up. Mr. Biden is 77, it's time for him to pass the torch,\" they write, \"to a new generation of political leaders.\" Joining me now, Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff under President George W. Bush and Fox News contributor. And Chris Hahn, former aide to Senate Chuck Schumer and syndicated radio host. Boy, Chris, you know, Joe Biden, all he keeps doing is, you know, landing on top in polls but he can't seem to get any love from a lot of places.

But of course, the endorsement of Amy Klobuchar cuts against him, because they might be competing for the same block of voters. I get what they say. And there is a battle going on in the Democratic Party. between the people who want to turn the whole thing upside down and moderate progressives who want to keep things moving forward but don't want to completely to up turn the system.

And whether the New York Times endorses somebody else or not, then the Biden people don't care.

But these two people have completely divergent views on how they should be handled. You know? I mean, Elizabeth Warren wants to tax everybody, a lot more from corporations to individuals up and down the chain. Also, you know, do Medicare for all, all of that. Amy Klobuchar has a totally different take."

I have said a couple times today, I think this is a bit of a cop- out going both ways because the party is divided. Like I said in my first block here, the party is divided. The party hasn't made up its mind to where it wants to go. Does it want a disrupter or like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders or it just want to go the moderate route? So, we'll see. And the New York Times is trying to have it both ways, a little from column A, a little from column B. And the voters have to make the choice next week, starting next week. And I think it's going to be a very difficult choice. But I do agree what Karl said, he is probably right about Buttigieg being particularly hurt by this."

      "utterance": "Well, the legal team for the White House just got a lot bigger. Adding a number of names to the list. Let's take a look at them. We've got Jim Jordan is on the list and others. Mike -- Doug Collins, Jordan, Debbie Lesko, Mark Meadows. He will be our guest tomorrow night. John Ratcliffe, Elise Stefanik, and Lee Zeldin, all added to the legal team at the White House, so, more to come on that. Also, tonight, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to step back from the royal family, now a sharp severance following an agreement with Buckingham Palace. The couple will no longer use those royal titles. I'm sure you've heard that. They won't represent the queen or profit from their royal duties. Prince Harry also had to give up his military titles after serving in Afghanistan and taking a prestigious title that was handed to him very ceremoniously. All of that, poof, gone. They are going to have to pay back the $3 million they spent on the renovation of their home. Also, pretty sharp rebuke from Queen Elizabeth. She wasn't too happy about all that. Here is the duke of Sussex this weekend speaking out."

      "speaker": "PRINCE HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX",
      "utterance": "The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back is not one I made lightly. It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges. And I know I haven't always got it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option."

      "utterance": "You know, I thought it was interesting, you know, that he said that there was just no other option, and that he made it sound like they had been struggling over this for years. They have only been married for two years, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right. The problem is, Martha, really is simply this. Harry has never been totally comfortable in royal life believe it or not. But I think this is been accelerated since he got married. And what happened really now, particularly in that speech, when you read the full speech, there's a bit of a sideswipe to her majesty, the queen. Because he's basically saying, look, you know, this wasn't really my final decision. We know what your decision was. You wanted it all your own way. And her majesty said, the royal monarch felt, no, you're not. So, I think she's woke up the woke prince. And of course, his wife felt, wow, and they are not happy at all. Let me tell you."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, I thought it was pretty amazing that, you know, Frogmore Cottage will still be in the family but they have to pay back the money that they used to renovate the whole thing. So that was just an obvious I thought, you know, slap on the wrist for all of the money that they spent on that. I also thought it was interesting. He said in here in that same speech on Saturday, he said, but I hope it helps you understand what it had come to, that I would step back from my family from all that I have ever known, he said. You know, but I think a lot of people just still scratch their head, like, you know, what exactly did it come to? What was so horrible? What really did ultimately prompt this do you think behind the scenes?"

    {
      "speaker": "SEAN",
      "utterance": "I think, you know, basically, there's a lot of in fighting. The royal family, you know, whatever we talk about them is a soap opera, Martha. You know, you and me both adore them as you know."

But you can't have them doing all the hard graph and then having, you know, someone from suits popping back and doing a premiere (Inaudible). It just doesn't work like that. There's a hierarchy --"

      "utterance": "Yes."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And they end up sort of tromping around the country and staying in people's fancy houses and being, you know, guests of honor at lots of parties. Is that, you know, is that the kind of future you envision or something different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEAN",
      "utterance": "You know, my take on this is this. I think that there's a great part in this, Martha, where they've had a year to sort of make it work. That's how long Prince Charles is going to fund it. I think it was not working before a year. I think someone would advise him. If not, you know, there he says, one person might be returning back, maybe two, or maybe just one person alone. There's not a lot of faith in the marriage here across the U.K. right now. I think, you know, Meghan has got her challenges with Harry and I think Harry has got his challenges to live beyond the royal bubble, as it were. And it's going to be a very tough time. A lot of similarities as you rightly said. We hope that it's a happier ending than really that particular story because it didn't work out too great."
