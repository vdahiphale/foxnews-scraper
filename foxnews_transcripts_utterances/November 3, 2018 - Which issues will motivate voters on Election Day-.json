It went from 4.2 to 3.5. And they say, you know what, a recession may be around the corner. I do think the president is closing strong on the message of the economy and on immigration.

One, the Democratic Party has given up looking for white working-class voters. Bill Clinton was always great at speaking to those people. They don't really speak to those people as much as they used to, they've reprioritized to more identity politics. And millennials, I mean, they were born in the 90's, they barely remember Bill Clinton. And then you have the Me Too thing, if you bring him in you might catch too much heat.

And all of a sudden, a week before the election, now they're going to get the stomach to say, hey, guys, knock it off. I just don't buy it.

I don't think that's going to wash with a lot of Republican voters. President Trump won that state by 19 points. You look at Jon Tester, I do think that's little bit different in Montana where you have Tester very close to the agriculture community, and they think he's done a good job for them. So he's trying to localize that race as much as possible. Not that Trump hasn't done all he can to help Rosendale and the Republicans still could win there. That was a nail biter. Donnelly, though, he does -- he's one of the only ones that can say he has voted with President Trump and he did so on immigration. So this last bit of President Trump, closing argument on immigration, might not play as much in Indiana because Donnelly, actually, has a voting record that says that. The other thing is each of these three states President Trump's approval rating is above 50 percent. That's a big deal for him because if you think back -- like in 2002, the first Bush mid-term, I think President Bush's approval rating was sky high, we were at war, after 9/11. But in 2006, when he lost the majorities his approval rating was 37 percent. It makes a big difference especially in these tight races.

I do think he's really lowered himself to a place where he shouldn't be as someone that's just left office. I don't think there's ever been a president this early that campaign so partisanly against his successor in that way. But, you know what? He's trying to salvage his legacy because Donald Trump has totally destroyed it. The president got some great news today on the economy, a quarter million jobs created in October despite the hurricane. And when some other bright spots, 3.1 percent wage growth, that is the best wage growth for American workers in a decade. Also, nearly 70,000 jobs created in construction, and mining, and manufacturing. Remember, those jobs were never coming back, according to Barack Obama. Lowest unemployment level since 1969, most Americans with a job in American history, and the media has really downplayed this economy. When there was the 3.5 percent GDP number that just came out the other day, the nightly newscasts, they never even covered it. And then today, Axios said, well, you know, the economy is shrinking. It went from 4.2 to 3.5. And they say, you know what, a recession may be around the corner. I do think the president is closing strong on the message of the economy and on immigration. And this blue wave that everybody says is going to happen, I'm not quite so sure about it right now."

It's something you have to give credit for. So, they'd rather just, you know, do their usual anti-Trump blather, which also happens to gin up their revenues quite well as Jeff Zucker has admitted recently. Either way, the way I look at the midterms, and I pray they're over soon, the Republicans win and the Democrats lose, no matter what. No matter what. And I'll tell you why. Because politics isn't personal to Republicans. So, if you do well, great. But I'm going to have dinner. But if you lose the house, well, that sucks. But I'm going to go have dinner. But now the Democrats -- let's say the Democrats win big, that's not going to be enough because he's still going to be in charge. That evil Trump is going to be there. So they're still going to be really angry. And if they lose, we saw what happened when they lost before, right? It was a countrywide tantrum."

But, you know, to me, it's at a point where in this campaign you look at where the president is going. You look at what he's saying. So, today, West Virginia, also Indiana, he's going into red states and he's trying his best. I don't think he's gonna have any success with -- stopping Joe Manchin getting reelected. But when it comes to Joe Donnelly, the Democrat in a red state like Indiana, I think he may have some success because he can stir up the base. And that's all he's doing.

Clearly, the events, you know, sort of stopped the momentum that they had. But they still sort of seem like, will I vote, will I not vote. What will happen? And we all know in all of these elections depends on who can motivate people to turn out. So, what I'm fascinated by -- I started going through, you know, state by state, we're all looking at the polling. I think it's going to be a really long election night.

The one thing that I would say is to pay attention not just to the house and to the senate but these governor's races, 12 out of 13 Republican governors that are running for re-election are ahead. But 7 -- about 7 to 9 of them that are running in open seats, it's neck and neck. Talk about Georgia. Talk about Florida. I mean, these are the races where it could go into runoffs.

Democrats are going to get them all. They're all within the margin of error. So there's no guarantee that this blue wave is going to happen. You can see a situation where Democrats pick up 20 seats in the house and come up a few seats short. There's no massive Democratic Party registration going on. There's no massive enthusiasm gap going on. There's no recession going on. There's just not a lot of indicators. Look at the generic congressional ballot. That's within single digits.

I mean, if you think back to President Obama's reelection campaign in 2012, and the DNC convention, when Clinton went on stage and gave that speech that many pundits at the time were saying was the speech that revived President Obama's reelection effort. And then, here we are, fast forward, not that long later, people don't want to be seen with him and, quite frankly, I think for good reason. I mean, at a minimum, the guy abused his power with a college intern. At the worst, he's been accused of some of the worst things that men can be accused of. So, I wouldn't want to be seen with him and I don't blame the Democrats. But on Claire McCaskill, the one thing that was interesting to me there is, you know, for all of the mantra of the Democrats about girl power, she was really quick to throw Elizabeth Warren, like, right under the bus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think she feels that Elizabeth Warren was critical of her on some votes, and so that's what she said. So, Jesse, what we see here is, right now, it's 51-49, Republicans in the senate. And you have Heidi Heitkamp trailing in North Dakota, close races in Indiana, Missouri. And then comes two interesting states, Arizona and Nevada. No Trump in either state, even though you would think immigration, which is his key message might play there, apparently, both Republican candidates want no part of Donald Trump."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know if that's true. But you're right, those races are dead even and -- they could go either way. And they're very interesting, two western states, a lot different than a lot of the other states in the country. But, on the Bill Clinton thing, I think there's three reasons for that. One, the Democratic Party has given up looking for white working-class voters. Bill Clinton was always great at speaking to those people. They don't really speak to those people as much as they used to, they've reprioritized to more identity politics. And millennials, I mean, they were born in the 90's, they barely remember Bill Clinton. And then you have the Me Too thing, if you bring him in you might catch too much heat. On the distancing, I think the distancing is disingenuous because the Democratic Party has been crazy for two years. And all of a sudden, a week before the election, now they're going to get the stomach to say, hey, guys, knock it off. I just don't buy it. And it kind of shows me, right now, the Republican Party is more unified than the Democratic Party. Looks like the Democrats are shooting within the tent a little bit, I don't know how that's going to play out, but it's an interesting indicator especially in these red swing states."

Claire McCaskill, 12 years of a very liberal voting record and she's trying to say that, like, she's not crazy and that she's helpful to Trump. I don't think that's going to wash with a lot of Republican voters. President Trump won that state by 19 points. You look at Jon Tester, I do think that's little bit different in Montana where you have Tester very close to the agriculture community, and they think he's done a good job for them. So he's trying to localize that race as much as possible. Not that Trump hasn't done all he can to help Rosendale and the Republicans still could win there. That was a nail biter. Donnelly, though, he does -- he's one of the only ones that can say he has voted with President Trump and he did so on immigration. So this last bit of President Trump, closing argument on immigration, might not play as much in Indiana because Donnelly, actually, has a voting record that says that. The other thing is each of these three states President Trump's approval rating is above 50 percent. That's a big deal for him because if you think back -- like in 2002, the first Bush mid-term, I think President Bush's approval rating was sky high, we were at war, after 9/11. But in 2006, when he lost the majorities his approval rating was 37 percent. It makes a big difference especially in these tight races. So President Trump has done them a favor, by getting his approval rating up to where it is."

I think that Democrats right now are happy to let Avenatti be out in front, right? Let him be taking all those slings and arrows and getting the C-block on The Five.

I disagree with Greg a little bit here. I think this was an effective ad. He has tapped into the rage-a-holic resisters in the Democratic Party. These didn't look like actors. These looked like really angry people. And there's a good section of the Democratic base that really want to humiliate Donald Trump, want to bully him, want to sue him, want to go after his wife and kids and just punish him. And this is the people that he's speaking to. Now, I think he's playing a dangerous Ponzi scheme, politically, because he owes tons of money to everybody. He's getting sued out the pants.

Take a look -- 78-year-old Congressman John Lewis -- Lewis was at a campaign event for Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. As he was waiting for Abrams and Oprah Winfrey, Lewis began dancing to Pharell Williams' song, \"Happy\". The video of the Congressman, a civil rights icon, has gone viral."

And we're going to put it out every other week. It is something you've got to see. It's called selfie Friday. We have the word of the week. We have all sorts of mentoring tips for you there and also some fun articles. You can sign up for the page to receive next week's edition at Facebook.com/DanaPerino. That's Facebook.com/DanaPerino. Join us there, it's fabulous."
