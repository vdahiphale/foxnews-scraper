Is it $600, could it be $300, could they meet in the middle? I think that's what's going to get hashed out in the Senate. I will say just briefly, Bret, the soundbite that you played from Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, was borderline delusional about his recollection of recent history, the dithering from the Republicans. The Republicans led in the Senate on this issue. The Democrats were part of that whole conversation. Then the Democrats themselves decided to slam the brakes on the entire process on the CARES act because Nancy Pelosi thought it wasn't leftwing enough.

So this means in January and February of 2017, as the Trump administration is coming in, the FBI is already aware that the dossier is nonsense, that they have nothing, that the main source acknowledged that it was rumor and speculation that he had passed on. And you have one of the lead investigators in that case acknowledging that fact in a document and also saying that the FBI has no evidence of interaction between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence or officers.

Breaking tonight, it will likely get worse before it gets better, that from President Trump a short time ago in a solo coronavirus press briefing. The president saying wearing a mask is patriotic and he will push harder for people to wear them in close quarters. Its President Trump's coronavirus briefing his first in 85 days, the president says a vaccine, and effective therapeutics will be coming sooner than anyone thought possible. Meantime, on the statistics, Florida has overtaken Texas in average daily deaths from the coronavirus. Florida average 115 deaths per day last week, tapping Texas' figure of 112. Total U.S. deaths are now approaching 150,000. That is the most reported globally with total infections closing in on the four million mark. The CDC says true COVID infection rates were more than 10 times higher than reported cases in most U.S. regions from late March to early May. This occurs as talks between the White House and Congress over the next round of coronavirus aid funding hit a bit of a stumbling block, the administration trying to push that through. The Justice Department meantime is accusing two Chinese hackers of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars of trade secrets from companies around the world, including those working on a vaccine. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts starts us off tonight with the president's latest promise or threat to send federal forces into cities as well to stop street violence but the coronavirus briefing taking the priority. Good evening, John."

The mayor said in part, deployment of federal forces in the streets of our communities has not been requested nor is it acceptable. These are tactics we expect from authoritarian regimes, not our democracy. It is concerning that federal law enforcement is being deployed for political purposes. Politics was front and center in a memo President Trump signed today instructing the Commerce Department to exclude illegal immigrants in the United States from the so-called apportionment base in the 2020 census. The apportionment base is used to determine the number of congressional seats a state is allocated. But a statement the president saying, my administration will not support giving congressional representation to aliens who enter or remain in the country unlawfully, because doing so would create perverse incentives and undermine our system of government. The American Civil Liberties Union, which successfully blocked an attempt by President Trump to add a citizenship question to the census fired back. In a statement saying, we'll see him in court and win again. And as President Trump led his first coronavirus briefing in three months, the Justice Department today announced it was charging two Chinese nationals with among other things, hacking networks in the U.S. and around the world of companies developing coronavirus vaccines, testing technology, and treatments probing for weaknesses."

We have not seen evidence of any individuals affiliated with the Trump team in contact with IOs, IOs meaning Russian intelligence officers, wrote to an FBI agent Peter Strzok, according to newly declassified documents released on Friday. That sentence infuriates allies of the president who have long insisted collusion with Russia is political folklore. Former assistant U.S. attorney and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy in an op-ed yesterday wrote how much wasted time on pointless investigations could have been prevented had Peter Strzok said this publicly one month into President Trump's term. Strzok wrote that comment next to a February 2017 New York Times article, alleging contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham released the documents to the public. In a statement to Fox News, Strzok's attorney wrote in part, Senator Graham's statement represents another attempt by President Trump's congressional lackeys to use Pete's work product to paint the Russia investigation as a political witch hunt. It was no such thing, and Pete's comments on inaccuracies in the NYT article were nothing more than a dedicated counterintelligence professional diligently vetting public reports of intelligence information.

There are some Conservatives who believe that Cheney has been too deferential toward Dr. Anthony Fauci. They also don't like her opposition to President Trump's plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and Germany. Now, Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida, he escalated the feud. He tweeted, quote that Cheney worked against the president and should step down as the number three Republican in the House. Donald Trump Jr. then-tweeted, \"We already have one Mitt Romney, we don't need another.\" Cheney brushed off criticism from the president's son."

Part of that calculus is that Cheney could emerge down the line as Republican leader or speaker. Now, there are only 13 House Republicans and women. Cheney is the only one with a major leadership position. Some Republicans will tell you privately that they think that Cheney could defeat Kevin McCarthy or Steve Scalise in a leadership race. Bret?"

The fact that he did it at all I think sends an important message because he had pretty much moved on. The economy was reopening, he wanted schools to reopen, he wasn't really talking about the virus much. But there he was all by himself in the briefing room for only 35 minutes, I think."

And so I think it's worthwhile to have been doing this, frankly. So they brought it back. I'm glad that it was so succinct, to use your word, 30 minutes or so. He was roughly on time as well. I think that's probably a smart way to play it. I personally would have liked to have seen at least one medical expert there with him to field technical questions about various issues. And I know there weren't that many questions that were fielded by the president, but I'm sort of surprised that none of them tried to drill down on what he meant exactly by it's going to get worse before it gets better. That's a striking comment from the president given that the death numbers really have come down overall. What does he mean by that? Maybe we'll get an answer tomorrow."

I think a lot of people in the White House understand that there is an immense bully pulpit here for the president, one in which he could not only impart really useful, as you noted, information to the people, but also just to project an image from a political perspective, look as though he is in charge, look as though he's doing what's necessary, a strong leader. Those past, prior events and briefings tended to spiral out of control at some point, so the fact that it was brief, that it was focused, suggested there's been a rethink about how they might use the briefing to the president and the nation's benefit."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yet Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says we're going to spend what we need to spend. The president says we're going to do what we need to do. What do you think this is, Mara?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO",
      "utterance": "I think, first, Republicans have to get their ducks in order. Do they want a payroll tax cut in there? How much money, do they want any money for cities and states? How much money do they want to put in for testing? There was a lot of back-and-forth about whether the White House didn't want initial money. They felt there was some unspent funds on testing. Today the president seemed open to it. So once the Republicans figure out what they want, then they can go to conference with the House, which has a much, much more expensive bill. But the point is that we are running out of time. At the end of this month is when those supplemental unemployment benefits run out. There are people in states all over the country where the eviction bans are going to end soon, and the economy is not getting better right now, and Congress really needs to act, and they need to act fast."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And Guy, the unemployment benefits are a real question, too. A little disparity inside the administration whether to continue this $600 plus in addition to what you would be getting over and above. The president address that, saying maybe it would be a percentage, scale it back, but it seems like there is some negotiation ongoing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, because there is a very real concern that there are a lot of members of the workforce that are getting paid more not to work, so there's not an incentive to go back to work, which is obviously perverse. That's not the way it should work. But there are people who do need additional help. So the president dodged the question, what would he accept. Is it $600, could it be $300, could they meet in the middle? I think that's what's going to get hashed out in the Senate. I will say just briefly, Bret, the soundbite that you played from Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, was borderline delusional about his recollection of recent history, the dithering from the Republicans. The Republicans led in the Senate on this issue. The Democrats were part of that whole conversation. Then the Democrats themselves decided to slam the brakes on the entire process on the CARES act because Nancy Pelosi thought it wasn't leftwing enough. And they delayed that whole process twice by a span of days. So I know Schumer might be trying to rewrite recent history, but it's very recent, and I think a lot of people, at least who pay attention, should be able to remember."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's a good point. Kimberley, that really is potentially the sticking point as you get one of these massive bills, that other things that are not related to coronavirus end of being attached like Christmas ornaments."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, and that's the argument that you're seeing play out behind the scenes with Republicans, between those who really want a bill that's very laser-like focused on how do you reopen the economy, how do you aid in that, how to get people back to work, how do you help schools get back functioning, how do you make sure people have personal protective equipment, et cetera, and those who see this bill is an opportunity to get some credit in an election season to look like generous in the handouts and to all the special interests. And so that's the dynamic you're going to see playing out in this bill. It's no question the Republican bill is going to be much smaller in the price tag of what comes out of the House. The question is how much extra is larded in there that not only doesn't really help the economy but potentially even makes things worse."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "James Comey, former head of the FBI back in April of 2018 talking about Peter Strzok. Now just piece this together. \"The New York Times\" writes an article headline that says \"Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence.\" On that same day, February 14th, 2017, Peter Strzok's notes just released, \"We have not seen any evidence of any individuals affiliated with the Trump team in contact with IOs,\" intelligence officers. \"Again, we are on unaware of any Trump advisors engaging in conversations with Russian intelligence officers.\" He goes on to say \"Recent interviews and investigation reveal Steele,\" Christopher Steele, \"may not be in a position to judge the reliability of his subsource network.\" That is from the dossier that became the focus, really, of a lot of this, including a FISA request. We're back with the panel. Kimberley, try to put this in perspective for people who maybe don't understand what the significance of all this is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "So look at the timeframe here, that \"New York Times\" story and those Peter Strzok notes come about in February. The note that he mentioned about Christopher Steele may not having a reliable network comes from a month before in which the FBI had interviewed the main person Christopher Steele got all of his information from that were the basis of the allegations in the dossier. So this means in January and February of 2017, as the Trump administration is coming in, the FBI is already aware that the dossier is nonsense, that they have nothing, that the main source acknowledged that it was rumor and speculation that he had passed on. And you have one of the lead investigators in that case acknowledging that fact in a document and also saying that the FBI has no evidence of interaction between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence or officers. So the question becomes, why did this continue? How did it go to the degree you ended up having Bob Mueller appointed as Special Counsel? And how on earth could the FBI justify continued surveillance of Carter Page, which continued to be based on the dossier they knew to be untrue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Andy McCarthy puts it this way in \"The New York Post,\" \"How much wasted time on pointless investigations could've been prevented had Peter Strzok said this publicly one month into President Trump's term? The narrative of Trump collusion with Russian was pure fiction. The public officials who peddled it to a voracious anti-Trump press had to know it was bunk. Yet they fed the beast anyway. It is a shocking black eye for American law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\" Mara, does this factor in if we don't get this completed Durham report pretty soon?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "I think we will get a Durham report, and this is probably something that he's going to make part of his report. But the question is, if you believe that the Mueller investigation was based solely on Peter Strzok's work and on the dossier, this is very damning. Now, the Mueller report still concluded that it could not find evidence of criminal wrongdoing in terms of conspiracy with Russia, but it found Russia did interfere, that Donald Trump welcomed the help, and took various measures to try to cover up his campaign's contacts with Russians, maybe not Russian intelligence officials. So those findings are still true. Whether the Senate investigation can continue to come up with things that undermine the basic premise that lead to a conclusion that the investigation, Mueller's investigations should never have been begun, that remains to be seen."

Here's the question for me. Did the intel analyst who wrote the memo tell anybody up the chain, oh, by the way, our case just fell apart.
