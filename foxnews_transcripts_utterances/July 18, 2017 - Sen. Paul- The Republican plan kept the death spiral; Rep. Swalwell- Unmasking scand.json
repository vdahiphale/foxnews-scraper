I think the problem is that people are now looking through this glass darkly. Whenever they see any type of new meeting, they see evidence of collusion or they see what they want to see. Prosecutions require something more. I mean, you need to, first of all, define a crime --collusion not a crime under the code. When you talk about things like Donald Trump Jr., people are so eager to say, well, now we have a crime here, that they fail to actually define it. And people, I don't think, want to be in a world where a meeting like that could be treason. People have said this is prima facie evidence of treason. Would you want to be in a country where treason was broadly defined in that way? The framers defined treason very narrowly because they lived in a country where people were accused of being traitors, because they were unpopular, they were political opponents.

They tried to malign this organization, this member driven organization, 16 ways to Sunday, they have unreliable sources, unbalanced reporting, the lists goes on. So I've always been highly critical of entities like the Washington Post, with the exception of a couple of very good people there. And I do appreciate that on occasion they reach out, they try to get some of the other sides on board. But for the most part, I can't say that about the majority of their content.

At this hour last night, when I was reporting from you from the White House, the president was in the residence behind me having dinner with several Republican senators. His advisers told me today the whole reason, the president was stepping that czar offensive was because he believed they were close to a health care deal. And they're not denying that at that same dinner, the president quipped that Republicans would look like \"dopes,\" if they did nothing after seven years of promises. All of that means now a lot more pressure on Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, especially after the president made that comment that he doesn't own this. What a difference five years can make. As a private citizen, Donald Trump tweeted on September 26th, 2012: \"Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are B.S. since he had full control for two years. He can never take responsibility.\" Well, since Republicans now run both chambers, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, says the strategy is clear: get something small done on health care and quickly move to taxes."

Schumer, in private, I'm told, has been telling his friends that he will deal with the president but not in the short term on health care and taxes. He's waiting until October, November, why? He thinks, and it could be wrong, but he thinks Chuck Schumer, I'm told in private, that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell would reach a point in the fall where they break away from the president, and say, he's not helping us getting anything done, the Russia investigation, all these problems, let's go our own way and cut a deal. And then, Schumer will have the Republicans getting $0.50 on the dollar on taxes and health care. What's interesting with what Newt Gingrich's is saying is maybe it's flipping around, and maybe the president will break away from Ryan and McConnell and go to the people, and say, look, these guys promised it before I was in office. So, the point is, is there kind of a civil fight here brewing among Republicans about who's to blame?"

We won elections because of that. So, it disappoints me that when we finally get to repealing ObamaCare, it turned into an insurance bail out super fund.

But I will say this, if the mindset of the group of people who opposed bringing up the repeal and replace legislation remains that of Senator Paul, then this is going to be the car crash. Think about what he just said. He said I don't care whether this gets rid of the employer mandate and the individual mandate. I don't care if it kills all of the taxes under the Affordable Care Act. I don't care if it phases out the expansion of Medicaid and gives us the first significant entitlement reform in some 30 some odd years. I don't care.

So, your choice are either one or two things: either pay the insurance companies for the next couple years in order to cover up the problems in the Affordable Care Act or let those problems result in huge premiums for everybody who's in those exchanges. That's your choice. And the Republicans said, rather than make the people on the exchanges pay for the mistakes of the people who passed the bill in the first place -- President Obama and the Democrats -- we will, in essence, pay the insurance companies for the faults that Dr. Paul, Senator Paul, identified in the legislation that it disincentivize these younger people to pay into the insurance pool because they have to subsidize older, wealthier beneficiaries."

There's been no evidence put forward that any wrongdoing was done by any Obama administration official. And until that is shown, which the White House actually, they hold all the evidence, they could show the world if there was wrongdoing. They haven't done that. I think it's just a distraction."

We also know that General Flynn, Michael Flynn, was unmasked, his name was unmasked and it was revealed to the newspapers. Now, if that was done for political reasons, or if it was leaked to the media, all of that falls into the illegality venue including a possibility of a felony if it was done for political reasons.

If there's a piece of evidence that they have, that somebody did something wrong, they don't need Congress to tell the world that happened. They actually can tell the world that that happened.

That is a, you know, a story that is well trodden, and we continue to do that every night. But in terms of the other side of this that the Obama administration wanted to unmask the names of Trump administration officials, I don't understand -- what questions do you have for these people when they get before your committee?

You know, intelligence officials in their job, if it's relevant to understanding a risk to the National Security of our country will have to look at who a U.S. person is, but there's no evidence that anyone did anything wrong.

Because a few moments ago, a story was crossing that said that there was a second undisclosed meeting that President Trump had during the G20 summit in Germany with Vladimir Putin. The original story that it was behind closed doors and only had one translator, the Russian translator. Now, the White House, just moments ago, is saying that is incorrect, and that the second previously undisclosed meeting was at the dinner where Melania was seated next to President Putin and President Trump got up from his chair and his translator, went over to where they were standing and spoke with them for some period of time. I don't know the length of that time as of yet. Is there any issue with that legally? Politically, it's another story."

This story broke, and all of the sudden there's questions of well, there are more undisclosed meetings. These are two world leaders at the G20 meeting. It was meeting of world leaders. The fact that they had these types of meetings, whether they were public or not, is not surprising, it certainly not evidence of any crime. I think the problem is that people are now looking through this glass darkly. Whenever they see any type of new meeting, they see evidence of collusion or they see what they want to see. Prosecutions require something more. I mean, you need to, first of all, define a crime --collusion not a crime under the code. When you talk about things like Donald Trump Jr., people are so eager to say, well, now we have a crime here, that they fail to actually define it. And people, I don't think, want to be in a world where a meeting like that could be treason. People have said this is prima facie evidence of treason. Would you want to be in a country where treason was broadly defined in that way? The framers defined treason very narrowly because they lived in a country where people were accused of being traitors, because they were unpopular, they were political opponents. There are serious things to investigate here. But you don't help that by concluding that there's a strong evidence of a crime without a defined crime."

They've been looking for it in a number of places, but this is where they think that they may have found it. And you have treason, which you just mentioned, which has also been brought up by even Tim Caine, Senator from Virginia. Can this process proceed in a legal way and find a true answer that you think will be satisfying in this environment?"

But by saying \"I love it,\" when people say, a bunch of Russian government lawyers want to give you information, that sounds like a willingness to collude. But that doesn't happen to be a crime under the criminal code. Now, if people refer to collusion as conspiracy, that's a crime. But it's conspiracy to do what? And people are saying, well, they were trying to conspire to defraud the government? We've never seen cases where it was extended that broadly. I have an article out in the Hill today where I say, look, each of these claims that the people are making on the evidence as it exists now would grotesquely extend the criminal code, and that's a dangerous thing.

The editorial board writing this today, on the story of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, Mr. Trump and his family are repeating the mistakes that doomed Mrs. Clinton. But despite the firestorm, brand new poll shows that Hillary Clinton is still more unpopular than President Trump. Those are the numbers, neither looks so hot. Joining me now, Bryan Lanza, is a former Trump transition team communications director, and Adrienne Elrod, former communication director for the Hillary Clinton campaign. So Adrian, let me start with you, apt comparison?"

But, look, I do agree with the fact that Donald Trump in the -- need to be more transparent about what happened. We just learned today that there was an 8th person in this meeting that Don Trump Jr. had last year with the Russian. Why not just come forward and make all of this clear on the front end because what you're seeing now is a drip, drip, drip. You know, we're constantly learning now information. It only adds to the narrative that there was potential collusion or even collusions with the Russians."

      "speaker": "BRYAN LANZA, FORMER TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR",

They saw they missed a couple things, and they updated the forms, and that's how this process came about. So it's not a lack of transparency. There's an issue of, you know, are we releasing all the information publicly? I think we're certainly cooperating with the investigators. And I think that's criteria we're looking at. The investigators asking for information, we're sharing that. We're going through all of our old emails and sharing it with the committee and sharing it with the investigators. So it's not a lack of transparency. It's a little different than what the Clintons did where they just shut down and did nothing, and filed lawsuits, and they ignored foyers. We're actually sharing the information. It's just being leaked in a very damaging way that makes it looks like."

But the revolving disclosure it's hurting the administration. They're seeing that now, they're trying to be as transparent. They released the emails. The only reason these emails are forwards is because we went back through our databases and shared them with investigate. And Jared updated his forms. It's not like we've kept it secret and them somebody find it and released it to the press. This is our process and we're going to be."

And they will keep hammering this story even if there appears to be no obstruction, no treason which some people talked about. If they can't find evidence of collusion, you know, is it for the good of the country, for the American people to have that kind of approach to this whole thing?"

I think his advisors are telling him, at least at this stage, without laying more groundwork. It may antagonize allies that we need in other operations that may -- what we're trying to do in Syria. But the fact is, Iran is getting away with murder, and it was a terrible deal to begin with. And it is tough to get out of it because Iran has gotten -- we've given them all the money. They've gotten the money upfront. But they are, I mean, violating U.N. resolutions on the ICBM's, it appears that they're going over the limit on uranium. They're trying to get technical operations to get more plutonium. So this is a -- but again, I understand the predicament that the president is in. But I think sooner or later you may end up seeing him, actually, taking us out of this."

So it's pretty tough to imagine why Iran would think they need to change really any of their behavior at all. But these sanctions are going to go against 18 entities and restrict them in what way?"

      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "Basically these are entities, some are Chinese, others are companies that's doing business for instance with different entities in Iran, those who are really engaged in terrorist activities. I mean, right now there's thousands of missiles Hezbollah has that has gotten from Iran. There's again dealings with Iran, it's having with Chinese entities for instance. So we're going after them. I think there're 16 of them that we're going after. But, again, it's a signal. We can increase this, especially countries like China who are doing business. I think we should also -- American companies like Boeing that are doing business with Iran."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "I think he can. But, I mean, it's going to be -- he's going to really lay the groundwork because, again, it's complicated. We're dealing with other countries, with allies."

I agreed with him pulling out of the Paris Accord, but to do that also with Iran would be like a double shot. And right now the immediate benefit would not be that great, the damage could be there. But again, I think it's something we're going to have to do ultimately. I don't know for certain, but I believe that's what the president wants to do, he has to find a way to get it done."

      "speaker": "DANA LOESCH, NRA SPOKESPERSON",
      "utterance": "Well, Martha, thank you for having me. It seems as though the Washington Post is upset when the NRA talks about guns, and then the Washington Post gets upset when the NRA doesn't talk about guns. So it looks like the Washington Post just gets mad anytime the NRA talks about anything because the NRA and its millions of members carry a lot of influence, and that makes the Washington Post mad. They tried to malign this organization, this member driven organization, 16 ways to Sunday, they have unreliable sources, unbalanced reporting, the lists goes on. So I've always been highly critical of entities like the Washington Post, with the exception of a couple of very good people there. And I do appreciate that on occasion they reach out, they try to get some of the other sides on board. But for the most part, I can't say that about the majority of their content. And so, when the NRA calls that out the Washington Post decides to get mad about any member or the NRA itself. I guess, just getting off of what its assignment is supposed to be. The Second Amendment protects all the other rights."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Let's just put up, as I ask Matt Bennett this question, the original video that the article was written about. And the article was critical of the fact that this NRA video doesn't show a gun until the very end. That it talks about public safety and American values. So what's wrong with that, Matt?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATT BENNETT, AMERICANS FOR GUN SAFETY",

It says the clenched fist of freedom will be the response to what they're claiming to be anarchy in the streets that the left is bringing about. This really isn't about the Washington Post. The post can say or write really whatever it wants. The article that Dana is talking about was totally balanced. It says at the very end that they tried to reach the NRA for a comment and the NRA declined."
