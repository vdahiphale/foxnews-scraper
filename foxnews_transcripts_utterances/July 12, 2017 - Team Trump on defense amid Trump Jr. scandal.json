It's a very murky and gray industry, and most people in politics operate in that grey area.

      "utterance": "I think I'm the only one who doesn't live in Washington, D.C. here, and people don't care about this. There's such a difference between listening and acting. I think Donald Trump, Jr. listened to something that was brought to him. He didn't act on it. He didn't remember, and nobody in the meeting remembered because literally it was nothing. It was a crazy person coming up with some idea that when they heard it, they were, ah, we're not doing anything with this. Jared Kushner left the meeting early. I've been on a lot of campaigns, and when you are on campaigns, you do a lot of listening. You only act on information that's relevant, that's going to help you, that's substantive. Clearly they just dismissed this, and I was glad to see Donald Trump, Jr. give us the emails, show us exactly what was said so we didn't have to hear the interpretation from the media. I don't think people care about this at all."

      "utterance": "But to Susan's point, you do have a \"Wall Street Journal\" headline tomorrow that will say \"Russian officials overheard discussing Trump associates before campaign began.\" U.S. intelligence starting in the spring of 2015 detected conversations in which Russia government officials discussed meetings with Trump associates. Again, these leaks seem to be coming out drip by drip, and this may be another one that catches everybody's attention tomorrow. LISA BOOTHE, COLUMNIST, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Right. And this is certainly not going away. I do think that the collusion narrative was drying up, and then all of a sudden you have the story. So clearly people are not going to ignore it and we're going to continue to see a daily dose of headlines basically until Robert Mueller reaches some sort of conclusion. But I also think there is a lot of self-righteous indignation for people that shouldn't be self-righteous. Politics is not a white and black industry. It's a very murky and gray industry, and most people in politics operate in that grey area. And particularly listening to people like Robby Mook when, as Guy mentioned, you do have this story about the Ukrainian government trying to work with team Hillary Clinton to undermine the Trump administration and hurt them."

      "utterance": "Yes. There was a Hillary Clinton donor behind the dossier that surfaced. This is also a woman who set up her own private server and deleted tens of thousands of emails with the intent of running for president of the United States. You also look at the Obama administration used the IRS to target conservatives and was potentially using government resources to keep tabs on the Trump team. And then you also look at \"The New York Times\" whose executive editor said that he would be willing to break the law to release the Trump tax returns. So I think there is a lot of grey area here. Unfortunately everybody is operating in it. So if you are a voter at home I think your biggest takeaway is that I can't really trust anyone anymore."

      "utterance": "I don't see any crime at this point. At the moment, I see no legal jeopardy for Trump, Jr. But of course we have to know more facts. Simply using the material that you know is obtained illegally is not at the moment regarded as a crime. And I think it would be wrong to prosecute somebody for that non-crime."

      "utterance": "Correct. Alan Dershowitz and Jonathan Turley have been voices of sanity and reason on the left throughout all of this. They were saying let's hold on the whole obstruction of justice issue as well. I think if you are a conservative, or if you're anyone in the country, we should be drawing distinctions. You might be doing things that are bad, that are unethical, that are sleazy, that are not illegal or crimes or impeachable offenses. And I think the fact that you have members of Congress on the Democratic side filing an article of impeachment, or trying to, the fact that you have a senior senator who was Hillary Clinton's running mate using the word \"treason,\" that is reckless, that's irresponsible, and that is classic overreach. And frankly, I think it emboldens Trump and rallies has party around him when the other side takes what is a bad story for the Trump administration and runs with it in the other direction way too fast. People say, all right, this is getting ridiculous, and that helps Trump."

      "utterance": "Right, although it's been totally overwhelmed by the latest disclosures on Russia. And I agree with you, Ric, I don't think a lot of Americans think Russia is top of mind. It's not their number one concern. It does seemed to shake the about 40 percent of Americans who support Donald Trump. But this is not at its heart a public relations battle or a political battle, even. This is going to be a legal battle over what Robert Mueller finds and whether he finds that the law was broken and where his investigation takes him. We are now at the end of this investigation. We're at the beginning of this investigation. We can't predict where it's going to go and what the legal consequences might be, and that is the pea inside the shell, not watch the shell game, watch what it's going to actually matter at the end of the day."

We have got serious policy stuff going on. You can do both. We can walk and chew gum here. We've got to be able to tout some foreign policy. Look at what's going on between Qatar and ally Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This is a big, serious problem. That should be on the front page as well.
