And tomorrow we will travel to Helsinki, Finland, where President Trump will soon meet one-on-one with the man, Vladimir Putin. Now, this comes on the heels of the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein so-called big announcement today. Twelve Russian intelligence agents have been indicted on hacking charges.

We will going to show you what I experienced. That's coming up. One little spoiler alert, they all knew me and they didn't seem to like me very much.

And tomorrow we will travel to Helsinki, Finland, where President Trump will soon meet one-on-one with the man, Vladimir Putin. Now, this comes on the heels of the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein so-called big announcement today. Twelve Russian intelligence agents have been indicted on hacking charges. We'll weigh in a way it on a couple of things, the odd timing of these charges. We will discuss the extreme measures that Robert Mueller's witch hunt will take in order to keep the spotlight on Russia, Russia, Russia. Who hacked Hillary's e-mails? Now also tonight we'll have more on President Trump's trip to the United Kingdom. And today he traveled from England to Scotland, and not before hordes of angry freeloading Londoners actually took to the street to protest his visit. By the way, against the advice of everyone that's with me and all my producers, I went down to the demonstrations right in the middle of it to see what they were all about. We will going to show you what I experienced. That's coming up. One little spoiler alert, they all knew me and they didn't seem to like me very much. Also we had fallout from Peter Strozk's explosive hearing from yesterday. New information surrounding today's closed door hearings with Lisa Page, Catherine Herridge and Sara Carter will join us with full reports. And let's put it this way, Rod Rosenstein seems like he has some explaining to do. Plus, we're getting reports tonight. The Democrats are trying to withhold very key information, again, from the House Intelligence Committee. So, stay tuned. It's time for tonight's very important breaking news from London opening monologue. I took today the President wrapped up his trip to England. He held a joint press conference with the British Prime Minister Theresa May. Now the president discussed America's special relationship with the United Kingdom and so much more. Let's take a look."

The traditions of freedom, sovereignty and the true rule of law were our shared gift to the world. They are now the priceless inheritance to a civilization. We must never cease to be united in the defense and in their renewal. I would say I give our relationship in terms of a grade, the highest level of special. So we start off with special. I would give our relationship with the U.K. and now especially after these two days with your Prime Minister, I would say the highest level of special."

And meanwhile, if you thought that the blind hatred for President Trump was kind of unique to the far left, coastal elite in the U.S., well think again. Today, President Trump's visit right here to the U.K. was accompanied by waves and waves of angry protesters. By the way, as I predicted, wherever America shows strength, we see this like with Ronald Reagan. And while President Trump was holding important meetings with the Prime Minister, thousands took to the streets yelling and chanting and holding up signs and marching around and complaining about pretty much everything from capitalism to everything Trump. But in order to get a more accurate picture of this protest, I actually went down to the protests right in the middle of it interviewed, well, some of these Trump-hating Europeans face to face.

Now stay tuned. We have the full highlights of my time in the middle of anti-Trump protest, that's coming up later in the show. But first, we have new developments from Robert Mueller's witch hunt, earlier today the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. He announced the indictments of 12 Russians who are accused of hacking in to former Clinton campaign Chair John Podesta's e-mails and then leaking them on the internet. By the way, the 12 Russians charged. They are all GRU agents. That's the Russian version of the CIA. By the way, they'll never come here for trial, so it's interesting and we have to ask questions about that. And no Americans, Rod Rosenstein, said are suspected now of playing any role in his election crimes, let me repeat, he said, \"No American's were involved.\" None. Now despite this, there you go where the fake news conspiracy TV, MSNBC and there is Andrea Mitchell thinking this actually proves a nexus between Trump and Russia. Two years in and they're still believing in their own lies. Watch this example of fake news."

CHUCKY TODD, MSNBC \"MEET THE PRESS DAILY\" HOST: It's stunning to me that there isn't a larger course here to at least postpone it, right. Why would you -- if you recall President Trump canceled the North Korean summit for a day technically based on what he thought was, you know, nasty words that were said about Vice President Pence. So, he threatened to cancel a summit essentially for much less. Then obviously, Vladimir Putin would clear now, at least if you believe the United States Justice Department, they have confirmed that Vladimir Putin has lied to the president, into his face."

Now, remember when Trump raised concerns about rigging the election in 2016, remember then-President Obama, October 2016, he just laughed it off, told Trump stop whining."

And then there this all this hesitation about warning the American people for fear of looking partisan. In retrospect, doesn't it seem to you that perhaps the Obama Administration was at least two a degree asleep at the switch?"

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

Let's go back to 2014. The House Intel Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes. He warned us about all of these in the lead up to the 2016 election. Again, years before it happened Obama was President. There were countless more warnings about this from intel officials and many others. And excuse me, how many countries hacked Hillary Clinton's e-mail server? Was is it China, Russia, was it the Iranians, the North Koreans? And despite the known risk, Hillary Clinton, well, she decided to conduct official top secret government business on that private server to the illegal, which we know was hacked by at least five foreign powers. And then we also know the former Clinton campaign chairman and the DNC, they were easily hacked. Today, Podesta called in to CNN to celebrate Mueller indictments. We will tell you how stupid he is, after you watch this."

      "speaker": "JOHN PODESTA, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF",
      "utterance": "I think from the beginning at the heart on this matter were crimes that were committed against the individual citizens including myself, but what's more important, crimes are committed against the American democracy. The president likes to describe Mueller's operation as a witch hunt while they have caught the witches here and I hope that at some point that they will actually be brought to justice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "We all know Podesta is nothing but a political hack, and we have known about Russia interference that attempts to create chaos and discarded (ph) America at least since Devin Nunes says 2014 warning when Obama was the president. And by the way, Mr. Podesta, the witch one is not whether or not foreign powers find that influence and hack into our elections. Everyone knows that has been taking place for years, election after election. We know Obama tried to influence the Israeli election to prevent the prime minister, our closest ally in the Middle East, Netanyahu -- Prime Minister Netanyahu from being re-elected. So, the witch hunt is about the phony bias political investigation into whether or not Trump and the Trump campaign concocted some grand conspiracy with Vladimir Putin to defeat your precious Hillary Clinton, nice diversion. We know in reality, we all know Trump went to Wisconsin, Hillary did not. We all know Americans were connecting with the Donald Trump just look at the crowd size. And by the way, not with the very unlikable Hillary Clinton with no vision and how many reports do we need to now show that no votes were impacted? And I could go on and on. But tonight we're asking the question, why announce these indictments today on the eve of this meeting between the president and Vladimir Putin? To me the timing is suspect. We all agree that Putin is a hostile actor. We all agree Russia is a hostile regime that needs to be held accountable. Early days away from the President's long scheduled meeting with Vladimir Putin, so what is this announcement today accomplish other than keeping Russia, Russia, Russia in the headlines ahead of the president's trip? And today the president previewed how this would play out in this upcoming meeting. Let's take a look."

I don't think you will have any, gee, I did it, I did it, you got me. There won't be a Perry Mason, I don't think but you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask question. And hopefully we'll have a good relationship with Russia."

Now, let's turn our attention back to the deep state after first defying a subpoena, Trump-hating, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, finally did appear before a closed door hearing on Capitol Hill today. This comes after her trump hating former colleague boyfriend Peter Strzok testified explosive public hearing in the House yesterday. Last night we showed you the countless instances where the corrupt biased FBI investigator played your verbal gymnastics, flat out lied during what was contentious questioning. And as you might imagine your friends in the left wing destroyed Trump, mainstream media were cheering him on every step of the way. Remember, this is a disgraced high ranking government employee who said, \"He can smell Trump supporters at a Southern Virginia Walmart,\" Irredeemable deplorables, people that cling to their god, their guns, their bibles and their religion.

Whatever you are going to do is OK with us. Just make sure we can trade together. That's all that matters. The United States looks forward to finalizing a great bilateral trade agreement with the United Kingdom. This is an incredible opportunity for our two countries and we will seize it fully. We support the decision of the British people to realize full self- government and we will see how that goes. It's very complicated negotiation and not an easy negotiation. That's for sure."
