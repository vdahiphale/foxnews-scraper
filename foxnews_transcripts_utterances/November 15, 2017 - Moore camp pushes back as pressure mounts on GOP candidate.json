      "speaker": "PHILLIP L. JAUREGUI, ATTORNEY FOR ROY MOORE",
      "sentences": "Thank you, Bill. Appreciate you all being here today. This is very important. First, there have been some serious, serious allegations and we really appreciate the media and what you guys do to help get the word out and spread the truth. This as an aside, I have known Judge Moore for 24 years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } When these allegations came out in the last week, it was incredibly, incredibly painful for him, for his wife, his mom, his daughter, grandchildren. You know, in these types of cases, there's always someone who is alleging and the other person. And in those cases, when it is true, it's horrible for the person making the allegations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But when the allegations are made and it's not true, it's also horrible for the person who those allegations are directed against. Back in 2000, Judge Moore asked me to be his campaign manager, campaign chairman. And it was one of the greatest honors and remains today and always will be one of the greatest honors of my life. During that time and afterwards, he asked me to be his attorney and I was one of the attorneys that represented him in the Ten Commandments case. And as you know, there've been some other cases over the last 20 years. And I have traveled with Judge Moore all over the state, different states across the nation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I've been with him in probably over 100 different meetings and have been around probably in excess of 10,000 different ladies. In Judge Moore's presence and not once -- not one time have I ever seen him act even remotely inappropriate against any woman -- toward any woman. Not when they were walking away, not when he and I were in private afterwards. That's the man I know that I've known for the last 24 years. The allegations that have come out, I hope you understand it takes time to work through this. We don't have a $20 million budget as a campaign. It takes time and we want to be correct. Want to make sure that when we say something, it is proper, OK? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So we are still working through some things but there are some things that you need to know that we want to make you aware of. During the press conference with Ms. Nelson and Gloria Allred had on Monday, they both said that Ms. Nelson, after the allegations, had never seen nor had any contact with Judge Moore. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As it turns out, in 1999, Ms. Nelson filed a divorce action against her then husband, Mr. Harris. Guess who that case was before? It was filed in Etowah County and the judge assigned was Roy S. Moore, Circuit Judge of Etowah County. There was contact. Judge Moore signed an order in that case as well and we will talk about that any minute. We've also had a handwriting expert looking at the evidence that was submitted. You may remember on Monday Ms. Nelson and Ms. Allred in support, really the only piece of evidence they had in addition to the allegations was a yearbook, where they claimed that it had been signed and they said very specifically. Look back at what they said. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Everything on that page, they said was written by Judge Moore. Judge Moore not only has denied everything she has said before but has flatly denied that and he said it's not true. We have a handwriting expert, pardon me, that's looking at those. Here is the problem. A handwriting expert can't look at a copy on the internet, right? They have to look at an original. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So right now, Trent Garmon, our attorney has sent a letter or is sending a letter to Gloria Allred demanding that the yearbook be released. We will send it to a neutral custodian who will keep chain of custody and our professional expert will examine it and find out, is it genuine or is it a fraud? There are a couple things also that you need to know. I'm not going to go into everything that's on that paper because again, we need to have our handwriting expert draw some conclusions. I am not going to draw them today and I'm not going to make any allegations that we can't support with an expert. There are couple things you need to look at. Look at the 1977 after Merry Christmas, look at those sevens and then look below at the '77. And I want to ask you, do you think it was written by the same person? I want you to look at it all the Hickory House, which they say Judge Moore wrote. Judge Moore says there's no way in the world that's his handwriting and I want you to look at it, we've got some other writing of his and make your own determination. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's what our export will be doing but for now I'm asking you all to take a look and use your judgment. And then finally, after Judge Moore's signatures, it has the initials capital D. A. Remember I told you about that '99 divorce action. Judge Moore looked at the D. A. after his signature, which they allege it was because he was the district attorney. Well, he wasn't. He was the assistant district attorney. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But Judge Moore says he can't ever remember ever signing his name with D. A. after it. But he had seen it before. Do you know where he had seen it? When he was on the bench, his assistant, whose initials are D. A., Delbra Adams would stamp his signature on documents and then put capital D., capital A. That is exactly how the signature appears on the divorce decree that Judge Moore singed dismissing the divorce action with Ms. Nelson. Knowing these things, I've got a question, Gloria Allred and Ms. Nelson. Do you still hold that everything written in the yearbook was written by Judge Moore or was it written by somebody else? That's not an allegation. It's a question. And finally, we demand that you immediately release the yearbook to a neutral custodian so that our expert. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You can send your expert as well if you like to, so that our expert can look at it. Not a copy on the internet, the actual document, so that we can see the lettering. We can see the ink on the page. We can see the indentations and we can see how old is the ink. Is it 4 years old or is it a week-old? Release the yearbook so that we can determine, is it genuine or is it a fraud. Thank you very much.",

And maybe this raises more questions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Did Gloria Allred help her forge the thing?

So that's kind of weird, but nothing that you would say, that's convincing or evidence or proof, Kimberly. So I think the difference here is that all of a sudden with calls to specific women, some of whom were Trump voters and loyal Republicans, some of the women decided, OK, I will, you know, put my name to this charge. That's the big difference. That's what made this so explosive at this moment. The second part of it is that even while Sean Hannity says that Roy Moore has 24 hours to put forward some evidence that would vindicate him, you have Steve Bannon out there on the other side who has not withdrawn his support for Roy Moore. And you apparently have according to the polls, you know, a very close race in which evangelicals and the state really like Roy Moore and the fact that he puts God above all, including above our constitution, which rankles me.

They are thinking about asking the Governor Kay Ivey to delay the December 12 election. She says no so far.

And Japan also announced $8 billion in investments in the United States. South Korea said they'd pony up more money and announced $17 billion of investments in the United States. China, while he was there, announced $250 billion of investments in the United States, creating thousands of jobs. And China is going to strengthen the sanctions on North Korea and, for the first time in two years, is sending a ministerial level envoy to North Korea, which I think is a good sign, because hopefully, it would encourage more formalized talks between China and North Korea, and we all know it can only be solved diplomatically.",

Gutierrez, Cohen, Green, Espaillat -- the four crybabies of the apocalypse -- they want Trump gone, but they can't exactly say on what grounds. Can you impeach based on hurt feelings? Poor guys. They need help. Here's a solution: A new anti-Trump hotel is opening in D.C. It's called Eaton Workshop. Sounds depressing, like a prison yoga class. The place is built around liberal activism and civic engagement. It's supposed to foster a culture of inclusion, of course without the right. How diverse. There will be fireside chats, lectures, organic mattresses and something called sound baths. I don't know, maybe a real bath might be better. Look, I don't know if the world's first politically-motivated hotel is a good idea. I'd put bars on the windows on the higher floors, because I'd jump. Seriously, feeding more leftist identity politics to people already full of such division can't be good. Unless of course, you're not staying at that hotel but somewhere else, like here.",

Moments ago, the president was also asked whether he thinks Moore should drop out. He did not answer those questions.

First, there have been some serious, serious allegations and we really appreciate the media and what you guys do to help get the word out and spread the truth. This as an aside, I have known Judge Moore for 24 years. When these allegations came out in the last week, it was incredibly, incredibly painful for him, for his wife, his mom, his daughter, grandchildren. You know, in these types of cases, there's always someone who is alleging and the other person. And in those cases, when it is true, it's horrible for the person making the allegations. But when the allegations are made and it's not true, it's also horrible for the person who those allegations are directed against. Back in 2000, Judge Moore asked me to be his campaign manager, campaign chairman. And it was one of the greatest honors and remains today and always will be one of the greatest honors of my life. During that time and afterwards, he asked me to be his attorney and I was one of the attorneys that represented him in the Ten Commandments case. And as you know, there've been some other cases over the last 20 years. And I have traveled with Judge Moore all over the state, different states across the nation. I've been with him in probably over 100 different meetings and have been around probably in excess of 10,000 different ladies. In Judge Moore's presence and not once -- not one time have I ever seen him act even remotely inappropriate against any woman -- toward any woman. Not when they were walking away, not when he and I were in private afterwards. That's the man I know that I've known for the last 24 years. The allegations that have come out, I hope you understand it takes time to work through this. We don't have a $20 million budget as a campaign. It takes time and we want to be correct. Want to make sure that when we say something, it is proper, OK? So we are still working through some things but there are some things that you need to know that we want to make you aware of. During the press conference with Ms. Nelson and Gloria Allred had on Monday, they both said that Ms. Nelson, after the allegations, had never seen nor had any contact with Judge Moore. As it turns out, in 1999, Ms. Nelson filed a divorce action against her then husband, Mr. Harris. Guess who that case was before? It was filed in Etowah County and the judge assigned was Roy S. Moore, Circuit Judge of Etowah County. There was contact. Judge Moore signed an order in that case as well and we will talk about that any minute. We've also had a handwriting expert looking at the evidence that was submitted. You may remember on Monday Ms. Nelson and Ms. Allred in support, really the only piece of evidence they had in addition to the allegations was a yearbook, where they claimed that it had been signed and they said very specifically. Look back at what they said. Everything on that page, they said was written by Judge Moore. Judge Moore not only has denied everything she has said before but has flatly denied that and he said it's not true. We have a handwriting expert, pardon me, that's looking at those. Here is the problem. A handwriting expert can't look at a copy on the internet, right? They have to look at an original. So right now, Trent Garmon, our attorney has sent a letter or is sending a letter to Gloria Allred demanding that the yearbook be released. We will send it to a neutral custodian who will keep chain of custody and our professional expert will examine it and find out, is it genuine or is it a fraud? There are a couple things also that you need to know. I'm not going to go into everything that's on that paper because again, we need to have our handwriting expert draw some conclusions. I am not going to draw them today and I'm not going to make any allegations that we can't support with an expert. There are couple things you need to look at. Look at the 1977 after Merry Christmas, look at those sevens and then look below at the '77. And I want to ask you, do you think it was written by the same person? I want you to look at it all the Hickory House, which they say Judge Moore wrote. Judge Moore says there's no way in the world that's his handwriting and I want you to look at it, we've got some other writing of his and make your own determination. That's what our export will be doing but for now I'm asking you all to take a look and use your judgment. And then finally, after Judge Moore's signatures, it has the initials capital D. A. Remember I told you about that '99 divorce action. Judge Moore looked at the D. A. after his signature, which they allege it was because he was the district attorney. Well, he wasn't. He was the assistant district attorney. But Judge Moore says he can't ever remember ever signing his name with D. A. after it. But he had seen it before. Do you know where he had seen it? When he was on the bench, his assistant, whose initials are D. A., Delbra Adams would stamp his signature on documents and then put capital D., capital A. That is exactly how the signature appears on the divorce decree that Judge Moore singed dismissing the divorce action with Ms. Nelson. Knowing these things, I've got a question, Gloria Allred and Ms. Nelson. Do you still hold that everything written in the yearbook was written by Judge Moore or was it written by somebody else? That's not an allegation. It's a question. And finally, we demand that you immediately release the yearbook to a neutral custodian so that our expert. You can send your expert as well if you like to, so that our expert can look at it. Not a copy on the internet, the actual document, so that we can see the lettering. We can see the ink on the page. We can see the indentations and we can see how old is the ink. Is it 4 years old or is it a week-old? Release the yearbook so that we can determine, is it genuine or is it a fraud. Thank you very much."

Quite an interesting press conference there, Gillian, because they tried to get into a few little specifics, factual issues that perhaps they thought would be immediately persuasive to their case. And perhaps it might be biased with one of the complaining witnesses that it had a case that was in front of Judge Moore. Cited that name in that particular individual who had already previously said there was no, you know, contacts beyond that point. But then nevertheless, the divorce proceeding was in front of him. But overall, what did you make of the tone in center?"

You don't call a press conference to essentially announce that you're going to hire a handwriting expert which, as far as I can tell, is what this press conference achieved. So I really don't understand the point of it. It weakens the case. And a yearbook request which you could do via an email, a letter, a fax. You don't have to get, you know, the masses involved in that. I think the problem with this press conference is that, you know, the handwriting is to a certain extent on the wall already. We don't know whether Judge Moore is guilty or innocent of the claims for which he's been accused. But either way, I think this bodes poorly for the party that he elected to serve. I think that this creates major problems for the GOP going forward for the rest of this year, legislating and then going into next year, winning new seats. Because he has embroiled the party in this debate over sexual assault of minors, what constitutes it, if it's OK sometimes. And the whole thing that I think renders the party incapable of governing right now. And this is something that he has brought single-handedly. And I don't know that this press conference goes any great distance to try and make things better for him or for the Republican Party."

I don't know if everybody knows this but Sean gave Roy Moore 24 hours to come up with any convincing evidence to justify why you are staying in the race and why you are not guilty of any of these accusations.

Gloria Allred's credibility in Alabama is pure -- naturally it's here. But they are trying to persecute Gloria Allred. And that's their strategy. I don't know if that's an effective strategy. We're going to find out but to say that she had no contact with Roy Moore and then maybe he presided over a divorce seems a little thick attack but technically accurate and then the yearbook thing. You know, I have been seeing the whole thing over the internet and I kind of blew it off. And maybe this raises more questions. Did Gloria Allred help her forge the thing? I don't know. But this -- again, this is a small part of the larger picture of women coming forward, teenagers and other people on the record saying that Roy Moore was inappropriate many, many times and many years ago. So you are knocking down may be one allegation but there's a whole host of other allegations and they didn't address any of them and didn't even take any questions. Which I thought was the wrong move here was."

But you know, Juan, what I think that kind of doing -- working on so many campaigns is not only do you do opposition research, you know, on your opponent. You do it on yourself and you see what else is out there and you hire the best to be able to do that. To make sure that you were properly vetted. So things like this don't happen.

      "utterance": "Well, from what we can see from the reporting, there were lots of rumors but nobody had come out and stated that in fact this had happened to them. I mean the rumors were swirling. According to the latest reporting, it's not only that he was seen in malls talking to young women but even in local schools and gym classes talking to young women. So that's kind of weird, but nothing that you would say, that's convincing or evidence or proof, Kimberly. So I think the difference here is that all of a sudden with calls to specific women, some of whom were Trump voters and loyal Republicans, some of the women decided, OK, I will, you know, put my name to this charge. That's the big difference. That's what made this so explosive at this moment. The second part of it is that even while Sean Hannity says that Roy Moore has 24 hours to put forward some evidence that would vindicate him, you have Steve Bannon out there on the other side who has not withdrawn his support for Roy Moore. And you apparently have according to the polls, you know, a very close race in which evangelicals and the state really like Roy Moore and the fact that he puts God above all, including above our constitution, which rankles me. But I understand that's what apparently a large number of people in Alabama respect and why they want Roy Moore in the Senate. So this is -- you have then really one person left to speak, the guy we thought we would hear from today, President Trump. Does he say, well, I don't know. Or does he say, Like Mitch McConnell, I believe the women. And then what is that mean? They are thinking about asking the Governor Kay Ivey to delay the December 12 election. She says no so far. And then Mitch McConnell says if he is elected, well, maybe we will expel him on an ethics charge. Boy, this is getting nasty."

I don't feel bad for Moore. I feel bad for the Alabama voters who are having a hard time with this because we put this whole issue, this whole scandal. It's the prison of two ideas. He's either a pervert or she's a liar. The fact is, you know, there are other options involved here. And one of them was z hit piece and it's true. The bottom line is, a voter can think this news dropping 40 days or whatnot before an election is no coincidence. They can think that and still think he's guilty. But their anger -- their anger over being screwed by the party or the media is enough to make them think well, screw that. I don't care. So I have -- you know, the allegations are serious. I think the proposed article -- I mean there are names there. There are sources there. This isn't some kind of anonymous thing. But I understand when voters look at this and they go like, why now?

So, Greg, what you were saying before about voters in Alabama being able to hold two ideas in their head. Maybe one of those ideas, yes, Roy Moore may have done inappropriate things with young girls 40 years ago.

And Japan also announced $8 billion in investments in the United States. South Korea said they'd pony up more money and announced $17 billion of investments in the United States. China, while he was there, announced $250 billion of investments in the United States, creating thousands of jobs. And China is going to strengthen the sanctions on North Korea and, for the first time in two years, is sending a ministerial level envoy to North Korea, which I think is a good sign, because hopefully, it would encourage more formalized talks between China and North Korea, and we all know it can only be solved diplomatically."

It's like - - it's like dialogue -- it's dialogue instead of intimidation and anger, and it's really, really important. He's made more progress with Kim Jong-un than speakers do on campus with left-wing students. It's a big deal. I have very high hopes, and I think they're going to come away with something very interesting, and it will be a first time. And it's going to be really hard for the liberals to deal with this, because you know what it is? The old line, like, speak softly and carry a big stick.

He highlighted that over and over and over again. And I think that his ability to come in here and secure their release gave him another platform, another opportunity to showcase that. He's right in this case. He is right that the strength of his relationship with President Xi is something that contributes in a major way to the overall bilateral relationship between the two countries, between the United States and China.
