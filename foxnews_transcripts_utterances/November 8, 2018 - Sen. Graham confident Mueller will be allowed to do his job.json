What this means is that President Trump is invoking emergency national powers just like he did for the travel ban back in 2017 to limit the number of asylum claims.  The way will now work on the ground is that migrants including those in the caravan who crossed the border illegally would be banned from applying for asylum. The only asylum claims accepted in processed would be those filed at legal ports of entry. That's a significant change from U.S. and international rules stemming from the 1951 Refugee Convention that allows foreign nationals to surrender themselves and apply for asylum anywhere in the U.S. Those asylum seekers would then have to prove they are subject to violence and persecution in their home countries because of race, religion, political opinion, or social grouping. The problem with this new enforcement measure is that potentially thousands of migrants could be stuck at ports of entry waiting for their claims to be heard and the administration does not have an answer on where they plan to house those people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On top of that U.S. immigration detention centers are already maxed out.  And it's not like this new policy means we're starting from square one.  Over the past five years, the U.S. has seen a 2000 percent increase in aliens claiming asylum. As of six days ago, more than 200,000 asylum cases were pending. That's a backlog of several months and those delays greatly increased the odds that Caravan members will try to cross into the U.S. illegally. Many illegal immigration activists have already come out opposing the administration's announcement and as soon as the President signs the proclamation, we can expect legal challenges to quickly follow.  Martha?",

And only a psychiatrist or a peace officer can place a 5150 hold on somebody. And it's essentially an involuntary commitment for a 72-hour psychiatric evaluation. And the person has to be either a danger to themselves, a danger to others, or gravely disabled. So, if they don't meet that criteria, we can't take them 5150. And so --"

And those are mental health professionals.  They determined he didn't meet the criteria under 5150. And to give you an idea -- I mean, we deal with a lot of homeless people out here in California and a large percentage of the homeless population are mentally ill, as well. And being mentally ill, and maybe displaying bizarre behavior doesn't qualify under 5150. They have to be, at that time, a danger to themselves either by behavior or expression."

And there's a number I heard earlier tonight that one- tenth of the number of people who have mental health issues who -- you know, in the 1950s were hospitalized, only one-tenth of that population is now. And there's a lot of good reasons for that in many ways, and there's been a big effort to allow people to be at home and to be mainstream. But I think, when we watch these things play out, there's a lot of reevaluation that needs to be done about all of this and questions that need to be answered perhaps to allow your folks to, you know, be able to take more action in some of these cases. It certainly wasn't -- you know, I'm not putting the blame on anyone. I'm just saying it's time to rethink perhaps, and I am so sorry for the loss in your force, and we thank you so much for being with us tonight, sir. Many thanks."

Martha McSally, tweeting earlier today that it was like, like the last visit she took to the dentist's chair where she want to race by, I think, about 196 votes in Arizona. So, she has been down this road before, and we will be following all of these tallies as they come in tonight.

      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. The administration announced the new asylum measures today. But the presidential proclamation won't be signed until tomorrow. What this means is that President Trump is invoking emergency national powers just like he did for the travel ban back in 2017 to limit the number of asylum claims.  The way will now work on the ground is that migrants including those in the caravan who crossed the border illegally would be banned from applying for asylum. The only asylum claims accepted in processed would be those filed at legal ports of entry. That's a significant change from U.S. and international rules stemming from the 1951 Refugee Convention that allows foreign nationals to surrender themselves and apply for asylum anywhere in the U.S. Those asylum seekers would then have to prove they are subject to violence and persecution in their home countries because of race, religion, political opinion, or social grouping. The problem with this new enforcement measure is that potentially thousands of migrants could be stuck at ports of entry waiting for their claims to be heard and the administration does not have an answer on where they plan to house those people. On top of that U.S. immigration detention centers are already maxed out.  And it's not like this new policy means we're starting from square one.  Over the past five years, the U.S. has seen a 2000 percent increase in aliens claiming asylum. As of six days ago, more than 200,000 asylum cases were pending. That's a backlog of several months and those delays greatly increased the odds that Caravan members will try to cross into the U.S. illegally. Many illegal immigration activists have already come out opposing the administration's announcement and as soon as the President signs the proclamation, we can expect legal challenges to quickly follow.  Martha?"

And the fact is he wanted to have this confrontation because then we're all talking about what -- how brave Jim Acosta is for challenging the evil Trump Administration and how mean they're being to him.

The Democrats are going to be filling their oats a little bit, but it's really time for we, the American people, maybe not from of these districts that have elected members of the house who have a very, shall I say, super progressive agenda, including tear this house down and why don't we just make life miserable for people as opposed to, what do we do to make the country better? What do we do to pursue our policy initiatives? Let's have disagreements with the Trump administration on the merits. But here's the thing, the Constitution is so well-crafted in this respect, the people's house can do what the people's house choose to do by a simple majority, right? Now 31 Democrats did support the impeachment of President Clinton, as I described in my recently published book, but now we move over to the Senate in the Clinton years and what happens. At that point, there is the sober second look, and even though there was no doubt that President Clinton had committed cries, serious crimes, perjury and the obstruction of justice, still the American people as a whole said, let's have elections in this country, let's don't overturn elections. We just had an election, we'll have another election now in less than two years, let's rely on the electoral process.

And we've had discussions about that in the past and you've talked about that in the past. Do you think that Whitaker is right?

I don't know the facts, but what I do know is that Rod Rosenstein has authorized this investigation. And so, I think that now that he has taken the serious responsibility of being the attorney general of the United States, the acting attorney general, he's going to take that sober, careful look. He was a very good lawyer, he was chief of staff to the attorney general of the United States, and so he will be, I think thoughtful and careful. I think too much is being made of what he said as a commentator. So, let's wait and see but I do think that the calls with respect to should he recuse himself and so forth failed to take into account that there is a very elaborate and careful process in the Justice Department whereby, career civil servants who are experts in all matters pertaining to professional ethics will be guiding the attorney general."

It's clear to me it's not working, was not working between Attorney General Sessions and President Trump.

We are going to have to increase majority in the United States Senate. I don't expect many Democrats to help. You know, everybody who is talking about Jeff Sessions now on the Democratic side all voted against him, so this is just politics. Joe Manchin to his credit voted for Jeff Sessions. So there are a lot of names, and you mentioned three. There's a lot more than that. May be Mr. Whitaker makes his way on the list, I don't know. But I do know this. I voted for Holder and I voted for Lynch because I think every president deserves the ability to make qualified appointments including Donald Trump. Brett Kavanaugh was qualified by any measure.

      "utterance": "The Michelle Obama is a very talented person. I'm sure she would be a formidable candidate. It's going to be hard to beat Trump. One of the reasons President Trump is doing so well is because of people like Michael Moore who remind us at every turn what would happen if you put the Democrats in charge. People like Michael Moore would have a bigger say in your life. Not many people are jumping up and down at the idea that Michael Moore will be a frequent guest to the White House."

Name one time that has happened, maybe once in the last 100 years. And the losses in the house were a lot less than historical. So, I'm ready to govern, and I'm ready for 2020, I'm all in for Trump. And here's my advice for the Democratic Party, keep listening to Michael Moore, he will steer you in the right direction."

David Cameron is the godfather to one of my children. So, you know, our families spent a lot of time together. But then, we, and I was very much with him as he rose and became a leader of the party, but then we -- the Brexit vote happened, and we took a different side, and that was the end of that. We hadn't spoken since then. That was two years ago."

And so, I think he took it as a message that I would put this ideological position over the E.U. ahead of our friendship, but I didn't see it as that. I didn't see why we couldn't be friends and disagree but he said no, I thought if we lose this than I am out of a job and you helped make that happen."

      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's really weird. The British press, they got fixated on a bunch of things that I thought were just completely normal but they thought we're like just very odd. One of them was I rode my bike in London. You know the traffic is terrible and I rode my bike every day into 10 Downing Street."

Maybe I had a different t-shirt on, but it's the same picture. The other thing was the, the inside of 10 Downing Street, if anyone has been there, they will notice it's like a, it's actually literally an old aristocratic house. The downstairs, the cabinet room, the prime minister's office, that's where my office was. You got this plush carpet, and soft, it's very homely actually because it used to be a home. So, I just felt at home. And you would walk around, I would take my shoes off just like you do at home. I never have thought this was really weird. They were reporting on so much that when people came in for meetings, business groups, or outside or other civil servants, or whatever it may be. They would literally I could say they were looking to see if it's true."

No. In fact, when I was there, President Obama was in the White House and they all came over for a state visit and I don't think it was the president, but someone, maybe it was David of someone, they saw me wandering around and it was reported back to me that the president said, who is that beach bum?"

I came here. I couldn't find that exact make. So, I just bumbled around and tried various things and then I just got fed up with it. And I realized after a week of not having a phone, not by planning it, I just -- it happened to be a week, I thought, that was actually really great. Give me time to think. And then I gave it up for a few months and then it became a conscious decision. You know, I still use e-mail. I have a laptop. But the point about that, is you can connect when you want to. You can decide."

No iPad, no -- I mean, we watch -- we watch things consciously as the years have gone on, I kind of feel like I do want to actively campaign for it. As I see what it's doing to society and parents and the relationship with their kids and so on, I've got more militant about it. So, I think I might start pushing in that direction."
