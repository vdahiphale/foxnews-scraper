Beto had a microphone. He was speaking to a group of students seated in a small amphitheater, and for a moment, if closed one eye, it looked convincingly like a campaign event. There were volunteers in matching t-shirts fussing over logistics. O'Rourke himself wore a slightly dopey UVA basketball cap as he spoke because wearing other people's hats is what you're supposed to do when you run for President. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And to be clear, running for President is what Beto O'Rourke says he is doing. It's all a little sad when you think about it. O'Rourke is not going to be the President, at least of this country. His campaign is dead, totally dead. They went toes up last week from a fatal overdose of Buttigieg. Not everyone has heard the news, the morning hasn't yet started but Beto for President is done, it's over.

You get these long seemingly coherent sentences that when you read them don't actually mean anything. Beto was big on those. Here's Beto doing that on the Green New Deal.",

I don't think that it's going anywhere and so he can just steer that way and he could win Iowa, he could win New Hampshire. He could do well in California and New York. There's a reason that Democrats are running scared of Bernie and what is puzzling to me is that they are so interested in what the journalists on Twitter say, this kind of echo chamber in the media say that they won't just go to where the mainstream of their own party is, which is the moderate area, right?

He is smart and he cares and he has a pretty deep understanding of the problems the country faces and so he may be the one person running this year who is pitching a series of reforms that might actually help the country, particularly the middle class. One of his proposals is worth telling you about. It's about the salary of top government officials. So currently, the President of the United States makes four hundred grand a year. The position of course is far more lucrative than that for most Presidents. A former President can give speeches for hundreds of thousands per -- and they do -- they can serve on corporate boards, the can and in effect, really, spend the rest of their lives cashing in on the position they held as President -- and they have. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Bill Clinton has made more than a hundred million dollars from being a former President since he left office in 2000. Former Cabinet members and top regulators get rich the same way on a smaller scale, but still. And it's not hard to see what this does to the country. Our leaders have a big incentive to defend the winners of our current system because they're paid by those winners. Bank regulators go to work at banks if they make bankers happy. Tech regulators join up with Google or Facebook. Their only incentive to promote the public good is the kindness of their hearts. Up against that is all the accrued wealth of global capitalism, so it's not really a fair fight. I am not attacking anyone, it's just the way it works. The system itself is inherently corrupt and in abets corruption and it acts inherently against your interests. And Yang has a solution for this, and it's not stupid. It's this. Increase the pay of our top officials by a lot. Take the President's pay up to four million bucks a year. Pay top regulators a million dollars a year. Here's the catch. Presidents would be banned from joining corporate boards or giving speeches for money. Regulators would be banned from cashing in on the private side of the fields they regulated. They'll make a lot more money while they do their job, but their only incentive will be promoting the good of the country, not enriching themselves afterward. If Yang's idea has a flaw, it's only that it does not go far enough. Why wouldn't we apply these same rules to Members of Congress? Hike their pay, but bar them from cashing in as lobbyists are joining corporate boards the moment they leave. We should do that immediately because public service should be service. It's not a way to enrich yourself for life. If we did that, the rest of us could stop being as cynical as we justifiably are about their behavior on Capitol Hill. Well, speaking of being cynical about people's motives, Bernie Sanders is the most high-profile socialist in the world, but he doesn't live like one. He has become very rich by the way, ironically, promoting a book about socialism and how great it is. Sanders is a capitalist success story. We may in fact say that he embodies the American Dream, but on this channel two nights ago, he insisted that's not the case at all.

It's unclear if Loughlin's oldest daughter, Isabella, also got a letter but experts say prosecutors are making it clear they believe the kids knew about the cheating scandal and were willing participants and it's hard to imagine the daughters didn't think something was up when they got recruited to be on the University of Southern California crew team knowing that neither one of them had ever rowed. They also sent pictures on their applications of them in rowing attire on rowing machines. That's tough to explain away. IT'S unclear if Olivia Jade has her own lawyer. This is also an indication that the cheating probe isn't wrapping up, instead it's expanding. Meantime, Lorie Loughlin is reportedly concerned that if she and her husband, the fashion designer Massimo Guinnulli go to trial that her daughters will have to testify. Many the analysts say that Loughlin and Giannulli are in desperate need of a plea deal and a source now tells \"People Magazine\" the couple resents how the case is playing out in public quoting here, \"This is putting unspeakable stress on her and her family. They're having to play this out all publicly and they're fair game for jokes and memes, but also outraged by people who are saying that they are cheaters.\" Of course if they accept a plea deal or get convicted, they are cheaters, Tucker.",

Kelly as the pedophile and Jussie Smollett as a washed-up celeb who lied to cops. The text also reveals Chicago's top cop, Eddie Johnson called the morning the charges were suddenly dropped. Foxx texted in part quote, \"He was told we were just dropping the case. He seemed satisfied with the explanation.\" Johnson was apparently not satisfied hours after that text. He said justice was not served. Foxx has responded to some of these texts she sent to her first Assistant State's Attorney Joe Magats, writing in part, quote, \"After the indictment became public, I reached out to Joe to discuss reviewing office policies to assure consistencies in our charging and our use of appropriate charging authority.\" Cook County Inspector General is reviewing Kim Foxx's decision.

He wasn't simply charged with soliciting a prostitute, prosecutors also suggested he was somehow involved with human trafficking. He is in his mid-70s. That's a far more serious offense, but having damaged Kraft's reputation, prosecutors now admit that it wasn't true. They have no evidence he did anything to do with human trafficking, but they're still intent on humiliating him, so they're trying to release a recording of Kraft allegedly meeting with women to receive sexual services. So if the video really does show that, it's by definition pornography, why would we want to see that? How does it advance the cause of justice? It doesn't. It doesn't help the public in any way. It only hurts Robert Kraft. This is about the state and the press colluding as they so often do to humiliate people they don't like and keep in mind, if they can do it to Bob Kraft, they can do it to you -- for real. Well, in a blitzkrieg campaign last year, liberals across America got plastic straws banned in many cities and restricted it in entire states. Life got a little bit worse for normal people, but not bad enough. So now liberals in California have a new target. No, it's not actually something there's too much of like heroin or human feces on the sidewalk. Those are everywhere, but that's totally cool, human expression. Instead they're going after hotel shampoo bottles, a problem you didn't know existed. A group of lawmakers in this state want to ban those completely.

Beto had a microphone. He was speaking to a group of students seated in a small amphitheater, and for a moment, if closed one eye, it looked convincingly like a campaign event. There were volunteers in matching t-shirts fussing over logistics. O'Rourke himself wore a slightly dopey UVA basketball cap as he spoke because wearing other people's hats is what you're supposed to do when you run for President. And to be clear, running for President is what Beto O'Rourke says he is doing. It's all a little sad when you think about it. O'Rourke is not going to be the President, at least of this country. His campaign is dead, totally dead. They went toes up last week from a fatal overdose of Buttigieg. Not everyone has heard the news, the morning hasn't yet started but Beto for President is done, it's over. He is Jeb Bush now. Future generations will remember Beto O'Rourke -- if they recall him at all -- really as a media story.

Bitter in our mouths like a peyote button or psilocybin tea. One day the music died. Bye-bye Miss American Pie. Bye-bye weirdly youthful middle-aged white guy with fake Hispanic nickname.

This candidate could have been created at a lab at CNN and might have been. There's no stopping a man like this -- at least until Election Day. On some level, Beto must know it's over. He is no genius, but he can smell it. More than six months before the first votes are cast in Iowa, he is done. Sure, he may keep raising money, he probably will. It's his one real skill, but his political career is done. Cue the sad Nirvana playlist. So what are the lessons of the sinking of the SS Beto? Well, here's one. Maybe he should have run on something. It's pretty hard to win on charisma alone as Hillary Clinton recently discovered. So why don't be the one person in the race with real ideas? They don't have to be big ideas -- how about any idea? Beto could have tried that. It never seemed to occur to him. Instead, he just strung together cliches. It was like one of those word games. Remember, Mad Libs - the one you used to play with your brother on the road trips. You get these long seemingly coherent sentences that when you read them don't actually mean anything.

That is a unique contribution to American political life. Beto has just made the case that his entire life -- Beto's entire life -- is a kind of charitable donation. All of us get the gift of Beto just because he is here. Every time Beto speaks, it's like endowing a library in Burma or curing shingles in Malawi or battling childhood obesity in Appalachia or sending mosquito nets to the Congo, by the millions. Every time he talks, when he tweets it's an act of charity. It's something that makes this world wiser and kinder and more decent and better smelling.

Buttigieg came along and drank his milkshake and he had some intersectional credibility. The problem for Beto is that he happened to be straight and also white, just like Bobby Kennedy was. Buttigieg is gay, so therefore, he takes precedence. And also, he speaks more languages like Norwegian, which is a language that is very much in vogue with the media these days he doesn't just play a guitar, he also plays piano and he does it with Ben Folds Five and the whole deal.

Bernie Sanders has occupied that entire lane and you talk about ideas and candidates. The one candidate who keeps shouting ideas from the rooftops is of course our Native American candidate, Elizabeth Warren who keeps spouting ideas every five minutes. There's a new policy prescription. Why isn't anyone paying attention to me? And the answer is because you are in Bernie Sanders' lane. He is the thought leader in this lane. Well, in the moderate lane, there are no thought leaders. There are just a bunch of people with platitudes. Biden is presumably the thought leader, but Joe Biden doesn't have enough thoughts to be a thought leader and so who exactly is going to come along and occupy that lane while still being able to win over \"the woke\" intersectional base of the Democratic Party? Whoever does that has a possibility at the nomination. Right now, Buttigieg can do that only in so far as he can speak the platitudes that sound moderate, but when he's actually pegged down as you've noted, he's just as far left as Bernie Sanders."

Footnote: we don't really want Medicare-for- All, we want sort of a gradualistic plan that may achieve Medicare-for-all sometime in the future. But everybody is trying to imitate Bernie. Bernie is the guy who is really running this race. Bernie is almost in a position right now that Trump was in in 2016 where everybody in the Democratic Party who is running is afraid to take him off because they hope that eventually, he'll collapse and they'll get his support. But he is riding at 25 percent to 30 percent in virtually all of the polls that support is extraordinarily durable. I don't think that it's going anywhere and so he can just steer that way and he could win Iowa, he could win New Hampshire. He could do well in California and New York. There's a reason that Democrats are running scared of Bernie and what is puzzling to me is that they are so interested in what the journalists on Twitter say, this kind of echo chamber in the media say that they won't just go to where the mainstream of their own party is, which is the moderate area, right? Joe Biden is a terrible candidate. He is actually leading in most of these polls because he is perceived as a moderate."

He is smart and he cares and he has a pretty deep understanding of the problems the country faces and so he may be the one person running this year who is pitching a series of reforms that might actually help the country, particularly the middle class. One of his proposals is worth telling you about. It's about the salary of top government officials. So currently, the President of the United States makes four hundred grand a year. The position of course is far more lucrative than that for most Presidents. A former President can give speeches for hundreds of thousands per -- and they do -- they can serve on corporate boards, the can and in effect, really, spend the rest of their lives cashing in on the position they held as President -- and they have. Bill Clinton has made more than a hundred million dollars from being a former President since he left office in 2000. Former Cabinet members and top regulators get rich the same way on a smaller scale, but still. And it's not hard to see what this does to the country. Our leaders have a big incentive to defend the winners of our current system because they're paid by those winners. Bank regulators go to work at banks if they make bankers happy. Tech regulators join up with Google or Facebook. Their only incentive to promote the public good is the kindness of their hearts. Up against that is all the accrued wealth of global capitalism, so it's not really a fair fight. I am not attacking anyone, it's just the way it works. The system itself is inherently corrupt and in abets corruption and it acts inherently against your interests. And Yang has a solution for this, and it's not stupid. It's this. Increase the pay of our top officials by a lot. Take the President's pay up to four million bucks a year. Pay top regulators a million dollars a year. Here's the catch. Presidents would be banned from joining corporate boards or giving speeches for money. Regulators would be banned from cashing in on the private side of the fields they regulated. They'll make a lot more money while they do their job, but their only incentive will be promoting the good of the country, not enriching themselves afterward. If Yang's idea has a flaw, it's only that it does not go far enough. Why wouldn't we apply these same rules to Members of Congress? Hike their pay, but bar them from cashing in as lobbyists are joining corporate boards the moment they leave. We should do that immediately because public service should be service. It's not a way to enrich yourself for life. If we did that, the rest of us could stop being as cynical as we justifiably are about their behavior on Capitol Hill. Well, speaking of being cynical about people's motives, Bernie Sanders is the most high-profile socialist in the world, but he doesn't live like one. He has become very rich by the way, ironically, promoting a book about socialism and how great it is. Sanders is a capitalist success story. We may in fact say that he embodies the American Dream, but on this channel two nights ago, he insisted that's not the case at all. Watch."

It's unclear if Loughlin's oldest daughter, Isabella, also got a letter but experts say prosecutors are making it clear they believe the kids knew about the cheating scandal and were willing participants and it's hard to imagine the daughters didn't think something was up when they got recruited to be on the University of Southern California crew team knowing that neither one of them had ever rowed. They also sent pictures on their applications of them in rowing attire on rowing machines. That's tough to explain away. IT'S unclear if Olivia Jade has her own lawyer. This is also an indication that the cheating probe isn't wrapping up, instead it's expanding. Meantime, Lorie Loughlin is reportedly concerned that if she and her husband, the fashion designer Massimo Guinnulli go to trial that her daughters will have to testify. Many the analysts say that Loughlin and Giannulli are in desperate need of a plea deal and a source now tells \"People Magazine\" the couple resents how the case is playing out in public quoting here, \"This is putting unspeakable stress on her and her family.

Newly released text messages revealed that Foxx was pressured or she pressured rather an underling to go easy on Smollett.

      "utterance": "Tucker, these new text messages indicate that Kim Foxx continued to discuss the Smollett case with some of her staff even after she publicly claims she recused herself and we now know that she did not legally recuse herself from this case. On March 8th, the day that Smollett's 16 felony counts became public, Foxx texted her first assistant State's Attorney, Joseph Magats in part quote, \"So I'm recused, but when people accuse us of overcharging cases, 16 counts on a Class 4 felony, it becomes Exhibit A.\" Foxx continued, \"Pedophile with four victims, 10 counts. Washed up celeb who lied to cops, 16. Just because we can charge something doesn't mean we have to.\" It appears there, Foxx was referring to singer R. Kelly as the pedophile and Jussie Smollett as a washed-up celeb who lied to cops. The text also reveals Chicago's top cop, Eddie Johnson called the morning the charges were suddenly dropped. Foxx texted in part quote, \"He was told we were just dropping the case. He seemed satisfied with the explanation.\" Johnson was apparently not satisfied hours after that text. He said justice was not served. Foxx has responded to some of these texts she sent to her first Assistant State's Attorney Joe Magats, writing in part, quote, \"After the indictment became public, I reached out to Joe to discuss reviewing office policies to assure consistencies in our charging and our use of appropriate charging authority.\" Cook County Inspector General is reviewing Kim Foxx's decision. The National District Attorneys Association and the Illinois Prosecutors Bar both rebuked Kim Foxx for not recusing her entire office from this case -- Tucker."

Up ahead, Breitbart and a number of other news outlets on the right are being suppressed by powerful tech companies because they aren't reliable. Interesting.

Fake news -- in the interest of the public, we need to get fake news off our screens. You know what that really means and now it's clear what it really means. Enforcing an official narrative and stamping out all dissent. CNN and MSNBC for example spent two full years perpetuating the Russia hoax. \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" did the same and won a Pulitzer Prize for it. The whole story was a complete sham, but they were not held to account. They're still considered reliable news by the big tech companies. Meanwhile, \"The Federalist,\" a pretty small website got the Russia story right from day one and yet \"USA Today\" recently blacklisted \"The Federalist\" as an unreliable source because they don't like \"The Federalist\" politics, their views on abortion for example. Last year, meanwhile, Wikipedia's editors banned the use of Breitbart as a source because it was deemed quote \"not reliable,\" meaning they hadn't helped stoke baseless fears about Vladimir Putin, apparently. Alex Marlow is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart and we're happy to have him on our set tonight. Alex, thanks a lot for coming on."

They've missed these seminal stories of our time starting with I think the immigration crisis which really we started reporting on in conservative media particularly Breitbart 2014-2015, they missed the Brexit narrative. They missed the narrative that the establishment in our media and political classes and our coastal elite losing touch with the working men and women in flyover country. They missed that.

That we got these key stories right and we'll probably get the next key stories right and they're doing it in a methodical way that started with Google kind of toying with their searches which you've been very good at reporting on with Dr. Robert Epstein. Twitter with the shadow banning which we broke at Breitbart, it was called a hoax at the time. It turned out it wasn't. Facebook had to change their algorithm because places like Breitbart were dominating and it goes on. Wikipedia kicking us out. Our Wikipedia, it shows up every time you use Google and Facebook, they rely on Wikipedia. This is methodical and they'll continue to expand this. Microsoft is now in the blacklisting game. They teamed with this group called News Guard which is of course, they sanction all the places that got the Russia hoax wrong and they treat places like Breitbart and even the Drudge Report as fake news. It's ridiculous and they'll continue. Next is going to be de-banking. They're going to decapitalize people, not just with right-of-center world views. They're doing this with people who even want to have a pipeline, who want to work in the energy sector and our woke fascists who want the Green New Deal. It's insane."

Now, the Democratic Party will tell you forever that it loves African-Americans, but why is it pushing abortion on them? And by the way why is it continuing to import low-wage labor to dilute the political power of people whose families have been in this country for 400 years? No one ever ask those questions.

If you educate young black women, if you educate them on what getting pregnant does to your body and by the way educate young black men they play a role in this and what it does to your education, to your earnings capability to getting ahead in life -- and by the way, it keeps you in poverty. That rate of abortions in young black women correlates to single-parent birth and by the way, not just young black women, but single-parent birth and poverty in this country in medical terms that's an epidemic."

He wasn't simply charged with soliciting a prostitute, prosecutors also suggested he was somehow involved with human trafficking. He is in his mid-70s. That's a far more serious offense, but having damaged Kraft's reputation, prosecutors now admit that it wasn't true. They have no evidence he did anything to do with human trafficking, but they're still intent on humiliating him, so they're trying to release a recording of Kraft allegedly meeting with women to receive sexual services. So if the video really does show that, it's by definition pornography, why would we want to see that? How does it advance the cause of justice? It doesn't. It doesn't help the public in any way. It only hurts Robert Kraft. This is about the state and the press colluding as they so often do to humiliate people they don't like and keep in mind, if they can do it to Bob Kraft, they can do it to you -- for real. Well, in a blitzkrieg campaign last year, liberals across America got plastic straws banned in many cities and restricted it in entire states. Life got a little bit worse for normal people, but not bad enough. So now liberals in California have a new target. No, it's not actually something there's too much of like heroin or human feces on the sidewalk. Those are everywhere, but that's totally cool, human expression. Instead they're going after hotel shampoo bottles, a problem you didn't know existed. A group of lawmakers in this state want to ban those completely. Anyone who breaks the law could be fined 500 bucks for every offense.

A headline in \"Forbes\" last year, five Asian countries dumped more plastic into oceans than everybody else combined -- China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. The United States is not the problem. Californians strangely enough are not the problem and yet they banned the straws, they're banning the plastic bags and now, it's the little tiny shampoo bottles that you can't have them in hotels or in any kind of rental or in the resorts because we're going to save the oceans. The problem with this of course is that people think they're doing something to help the problem and they're not, but as you've mentioned, in California, you can relieve yourself on the street. You can smoke marijuana to your heart's content, but God help you, should you have one of those Lilliputian bottles of Listerine that now is the problem.
