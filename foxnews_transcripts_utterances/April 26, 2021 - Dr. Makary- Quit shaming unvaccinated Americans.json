It is the up to the sheriff to make sure that all of the information, the documents, the -- anything, the memo pads, the recordings, the -- anything that was recorded with respect to the incident, is absolutely kept in a way that it doesn't compromise any -- the evidence in any way, because you have to show chain of custody.

They didn't need to do it in 12 days. They could have done it in one day and issued an advisory. And that's what many of us were urging them to do. Look, if they want to get serious about addressing hesitancy, pivot quickly all those vaccine sites to walk-ins. Not everybody's going to make an appointment online. And you reduce a barrier. Stop shaming people who choose not to get the vaccine. We need to respect them. Some are not getting it because they have the infection. That's a medically reasonable idea. And we need to give something to people to look forward to. Look, if you get a vaccine, you need to be able to have privileges once you're a month out. And, finally, we need to stop talking about boosters. It's not clear that we need it. There's no evidence to suggest that we need it.

These kids are just crammed in there. And if they're concerned about COVID, why aren't they concerned about these kids that are jammed into these facilities because there's nowhere to put them?

Now, we were waiting all day for the family and their attorneys to view the bodycam footage, because, under North Carolina, privately, anyone with a direct connection to the video can view it, although the public release is subject to a court order. So the public has not seen it. Now, when the attorneys came out, after several hours in a delay to tell us what they saw on that video, they were very upset, very disappointed, because they'd only seen 20 seconds of one bodycam video. One of the attorneys, Bakari Sellers, came out to the microphones. Here's just a little bit of what he had to say. Listen. BAKARI SELLERS, ATTORNEY FOR FAMILY OF ANDREW BROWN JR. Let's focus on the disrespect shown to this family, one bodycam, 20 seconds, an execution."

And here it is, we still have a sheriff, we still have a district attorney that continues to not allow the video to proceed, that still shows no transparency. That has nothing to do with trust.

And we just want everybody to hug each other and remember that this is not about us. This is about the Brown family. And we're going to get justice. It may not come as swift or as soon as we want it, but we're going to get justice.

Now, to get the public release of that video, again, for our viewers to understand, in North Carolina, it will take the sheriff, Tommy Wooten, here to seek a court order and a judge to sign off before it can be released publicly.

      "speaker": "BAKER",

Mercedes, as you just heard there, we have got different -- obviously, different states have different rules about the availability of bodycam footage. Last week, we had that incident in Columbus, Ohio, where the police immediately released the bodycam footage in a way that seemed to exonerate, in most people's minds anyway, the officer involved. North Carolina obviously has different rules. But, obviously, it's been a week, it's been nearly a week now since this incident there. What's the likelihood that we will, the public will get to see this footage anytime soon?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MERCEDES COLWIN, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, the public's a little different than the private showing. The fact that the private show was only given access for 20 seconds doesn't speak volumes about whether or not the public will actually get to see it. It's been reported that the sheriff is concerned that the investigation would somehow be implicated if this is shown publicly. So, it may be weeks to get to that point. But, at a minimum, the Brown family could have gotten much more than the 20 seconds. I'm not sure what could have happened in that regard, why the sheriff decided to only give access for that minimum period of time. But I will say this, though, Gerry. It is the up to the sheriff to make sure that all of the information, the documents, the -- anything, the memo pads, the recordings, the -- anything that was recorded with respect to the incident, is absolutely kept in a way that it doesn't compromise any -- the evidence in any way, because you have to show chain of custody. So, if you have evidence about this, obviously, these tragic events, we will have to see how it plays out. But there has to be a chain of custody. So, all of the evidence, including the bodycam recordings, have to be kept in a way that there isn't any issue in the future, when that can be made available to the public in litigation, which, of course, is -- I'm sure that's where this is headed."

      "speaker": "COLWIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Gerry, honestly, the cops and the law enforcement officials that do abide by the rules of the law and not -- and their internal rules and policies and procedures welcome this type of investigation, because, in their minds, those who are rogue should be brought to justice. You saw that during the Chauvin trial, where all of these law enforcement officials testified on behalf of the prosecutors. But, in terms of whether there are going to be targeted investigation throughout the country, if there's evidence of problems or issues, where these violations occur, certainly, those precincts and these law enforcement should be held to accountability and have that level of investigation. I can't imagine that there's going to be a national investigation, but targeted ones where there's issues or problems, I think it's going to be welcomed--"

And we saw this throughout actually the primary, when Congresswoman Ocasio- Cortez actually endorsed Joe Biden soon after Bernie Sanders dropping out, and everyone was here on saying, oh, my God, what does this mean? It means that Democrats have the same priorities. And if you look at Joe Biden's platform, what he campaigned on and what he's done, he's been consistent. You don't see the Green New Deal in there. You don't see Medicare for all. You say -- you see someone who wants to protect the American economy, the American worker, and the American family. And I think it's a great thing. And I think that the media just kind of gets their panties in a bunch about these types of things and wants to make a headline out of it, like we're turning over to the party of AOC.

You have already had several moderate Democrats raise concerns about Biden's proposed capital gains tax hike. And, quite frankly, congressional pushback from Democrats is likely going to get worse, because a lot of these taxes are actually going to affect Democratic constituents and Democratic donors the most. Recent IRS data actually shows that the Democratic Party represents 65 percent of the Americans making more than $500,000 per year. That is who is going to be affected.

It's not a free lunch, is it?"

But if we look back through history, we have seen much higher corporate tax rates and still booming economies. Like, I imagine everybody enjoyed the Clinton years. That was a higher corporate tax rate. And to Kaylee's point, she's absolutely right about moderate Democrats. Joe Biden proposed a 28 percent corporate tax rate. Joe Manchin came back and said 25 percent. We're only at 21 percent. That's a win for Biden, and it's going to be a win for Joe Manchin, when we end up somewhere in the middle, he's willing to compromise. And that's what makes him really unique in this incredibly polarized time. And I think that it will be a much healthier economy for this. And I hadn't been called a troglodyte on air before, so big thank you for that."

They're better than President Trump's were after his first 100 days. So, actually, people -- do people -- I mean, surprise, people like getting free money. But that poses a bit of a challenge for Republicans, doesn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGHEE WHITE",
      "utterance": "It does, but you have to keep in mind that a lot of the approval right now is because this is Biden's first 100 days, and people are finally getting the swing of things. They're getting back to their normal routine that they had before COVID. And they're still benefiting from the stimulus that Democrats recently passed in Congress. Those things are eventually going to wear off, and the economy is still recovering. So, the fact is that if you hike taxes right now, people who are still suffering, people who are still jobless, people who are still searching for jobs that aren't even available are going to be affected. Whether they apply to corporations or wealthy Americans or whatnot, the entire economy is going to be affected by this."

Earlier, don't know if you heard it, we heard from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, saying that this Biden administration is turning out to be even more progressive than she'd hoped. Even -- even the far left are very, very happy with this Biden administration. Now, a lot of it is because it involves a lot of spending money. They are spend -- they have spent $1.9 trillion already. He's going to announce big, big, more spending plans this week. People kind of like having money thrown at them, don't they? Isn't that a bit of a challenge for Republicans? How are you going to challenge that?"

And that's part of our challenge, is to communicate that and what all this means to the American people. I will tell you this, Gerry. We're here with all the Republicans here in Orlando for the issues conference. There's a great sense of esprit de corps, of really, I think, enthusiasm about the future. While we're deeply concerned about this far left shift of the Biden administration and the Democrats that run Congress right now, we know that the American people are going to turn against this agenda when they understand what it means to them. We're excited about the next round, the 2022 election cycle. We're convinced we're going to take the majority, at least in the House, and I think the Senate may be in play. And we're looking forward to good days ahead. We're bullish on the future of America."

As you just said, you're already very close in the House, just a handful of seats in the House. The Senate is tied. So, all looks set there for significant Republican gains in 2022. What's -- how do you -- how can you achieve that? I will put it another way. What could go wrong?"
    },

Of course, redistricting, the -- everyone says, the analysts say this will favor the Republican Party in a number of states, so we will add seats there as well. And, most importantly, in addition to all that, the far left surge of the Democrat Party is alarming to most Americans, many Americans, more, millions and millions more. The polling is indicating that they're turning away from that. So they're going to be looking for the alternative. Our challenge, as Republicans, is to be able to be ready to present that. And we have all kinds of policy solutions. We have answers to all the greatest challenges facing the country. We have to get that out now and message it to our constituents and let them know exactly what we will do to fulfill those promises when we get the gavel back and get back to our governing moment in 2022."
    },

      "speaker": "BAKER",

We're going to get first-quarter GDP figures on Thursday. Looks -- people are talking about 6, 7 percent growth this year. There's going to be a pretty strong feel-good factor in the country, isn't there, towards the end of this year and through 2022? Isn't that what the Biden administration are banking on to get them through those midterm elections? And, again, how do you counter that, at a time when the economy could be -- unemployment could be back down to 3.5 percent, the economy could be booming again?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, we all pray that that happens, of course. And when it does, if and when it does, it'll be because of the infrastructure -- I mean, the metaphorical infrastructure that was put in place by the previous administration. It was the Trump administration that put the policies in place to build for that kind of economic growth and that kind of recovery. I mean, the reason that, of course, COVID-19 and the vaccines and all of that have been so successful is because of operation Warp Speed. The reason the economy is positioned to take a big recovery is because of what the Trump administration did. I mean, if you rewind to February of last year, we all know, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. And so that basic infrastructure is still in place. And, thankfully, because of that, we're going to be able to bounce back. But what the Biden administration is doing, not just proposing, but doing by executive order, what they're trying to push through the Congress is this massive far left agenda that is big spending, big government, big control of everyone's lives, higher taxes, more regulation, the expansion of radical leftist ideas."

So, that means 20,000 new jobs across multiple states and a brand-new $1 billion North Carolina campus right near Raleigh. And this will come with 3,000 high-paying jobs in high technology and contribute more than $1.5 billion to the state annually.

That's roughly $20 million a year, but only kicks in once Apple hires 3,000. Besides North Carolina, Apple is also hiring in Texas, Iowa, Colorado, Massachusetts, and other states. And Apple is one of the few companies on the planet that can afford to invest hundreds of billions of dollars, bringing back a lot of their cash from overseas back in 2018, during the Trump era, when companies like Apple were given a lower tax rate to bring the cash home. The tech giant also contends that they are America's largest corporate taxpayer, paying the Treasury $45 billion over the past five years. But if the corporate tax rate goes up to 28 percent from 21 percent under President Biden, you can imagine that those spending plans might get a second look, though -- Gerry."

It's kind of -- it's those forces, Gerry, that we have been talking about. And they're coming together at a -- in a way that I'm not sure that I have ever seen before in an economy or in a market, huge pent-up demand, consumers who have basically put spending on hold for the last year. Some of that spending is likely to be relief spending as well, people who may not have spent as much in the past just happy to be vaccinated and be out in the economy again. The economy is going to be coming off of a low base from a year ago. And then you have the steroid shots. You have the steroid shots of coronavirus relief spending that is still coming into the market and into the economy and this infrastructure bill, which may not be entirely what Biden wants to get, but it's likely to be hundreds of billions. So the expectation is you're going to see this robust economy in the second half of the year. And that's going to lift all boats, everything -- and you're seeing the prices go up now, everything from materials, to stocks, to housing being on a tear. You haven't seen housing like this since 2006, and then those other investments, like Bitcoin and a little bit more exotica out there as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "Yes. John, you mentioned the stimulus. And, of course, you can answer that, the Federal Reserve, which is continuing to pump money into the economy. We have this -- and, as you said, we have this unusual situation right now. Normally, when you get massive stimulus from fiscal and monetary forces, that come -- that takes place at a time when the economy is very weak, often in recession, it's needed to get the economy out of recession. Yet all the indications are that we're going to have a bumpy -- we may have the strongest rate of growth this year that we have had since the 1980s. People are talking about 6 or 7 percent. Surely, that's a kind of a mismatch, isn't it?"

    {
      "speaker": "BUSSEY",

The concern with the Fed -- and the Fed has gone even further. In addition to the buying program that you described, Gerry, they're saying interest rates are going to stay low into 2023. They're trying to signal to the market and to business rates are going to be low, you can invest. You can borrow and then you can invest. I think their concern is, they do not want to have happened what happened in 2008 and '9, where they felt now, in retrospect, they didn't -- there wasn't enough stimulus spending. And it took the recovery to last that much -- it took that much longer. It took years for the recovery to happen. This time, they want to avoid that and they want to prime the pump up early. And they're hoping that the economy does what we expect it to do in the second half of the year. We will have to see. If the coronavirus doesn't recede as fast as people think, it could be a problem."

She said those are hurricanes, drought, and COVID- 19, but that there are also broader issues that have been around for forever that are much more difficult to deal with. She says those are a lack of economic opportunity, corruption, poverty and violence against women. The upshot, though, as they look for solutions of how to stop this problem, how to stop the flow of migrants into this country over the rest of the summer, has a lot more to do with addressing issues there than anything here."

This, by the way, as we're hearing that masks may be coming off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Well, we need to move activities outdoors. And what the CDC doesn't realize is that there's an alternative to restrictions outdoors, and that is people sit around indoors, where there's a greater risk of not only getting COVID, but also of sedentary lifestyle and other health problems."

They're pushing this guidance out three weeks before summer camps start. What were they waiting for? The evidence is overwhelming, Gerry. Studies out of Ireland and out of Asia now -- these are not new studies -- show that one in 1,000 infections come from the outdoor settings. So we don't need the CDC to take three weeks to read 10 studies to adjudicate what we can do."

That guidance came out two weeks after the vaccines were distributed. And we saw it late with what you can do once you're vaccinated. Look, I just don't think there's a sense of urgency and moving fast. And I think they have a process, and it's a bureaucratic process."

    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "I mean, Doctor, if the risk is minuscule, and we have known that for a long time, again, why have they been saying for months and months, oh, no, you have got to -- even if you have been vaccinated, you have got to keep the masks on, you have got to keep social distancing, don't go out? Why -- these messages are very, very confused, aren't they?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Look, I think they're afraid of being wrong. And I think there's a lot of groupthink, to be very frank. I think we should have told people early on. When we told them to stay at home, we should have told them to get outside. The number one risk factor for being hospitalized is being overweight. And when people stay indoors, guess what? They gained 15 pounds, on average. So this is just late. And he's talking in general terms. We needed this about a year and two months ago."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "The other thing we're seeing right now, it seems to be, is vaccine hesitancy. You have been saying for some time that we are pretty close to herd immunity, as it's called, sort of with two-thirds of the population or more having the antibodies. The real thing now that maybe seems to be stopping the spread, if you like, of that immunity is a real resistance to vaccines. And you do wonder. When you have instances like we had a couple of weeks ago with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and the government actually basically pausing that for a while, that is bound to increase vaccine uncertainty, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Yes, that was a mistake. And that hurt the vaccine rollout, and it hurts the -- dealing with efficacy, and the pause affected the hesitancy problem. They didn't need to do it in 12 days. They could have done it in one day and issued an advisory. And that's what many of us were urging them to do. Look, if they want to get serious about addressing hesitancy, pivot quickly all those vaccine sites to walk-ins. Not everybody's going to make an appointment online. And you reduce a barrier. Stop shaming people who choose not to get the vaccine. We need to respect them. Some are not getting it because they have the infection. That's a medically reasonable idea. And we need to give something to people to look forward to. Look, if you get a vaccine, you need to be able to have privileges once you're a month out. And, finally, we need to stop talking about boosters. It's not clear that we need it. There's no evidence to suggest that we need it. So, telling people you're going to need a vaccine every six months is not helping right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "And we don't -- to be clear, Doctor, we don't necessarily need everybody to get the vaccine, right? I mean, we can get to a very good level of immunity with, what, two-thirds of people maybe getting a vaccine? What's your estimate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Well, if you look at the U.K. and Israel, once 50 percent of adults get the vaccine, and you give it about two-and-a-half weeks for that vaccine to kick in, you start seeing massive suppression of the infection. In the U.K. and Israel, we're seeing it again. And we hit that milestone last week. So, in about a week-and-a-half, I think we're going to continue to see great numbers. Michigan, in their outbreak, they're down 30 percent in the last 11 days. San Francisco had 30 cases yesterday, most asymptomatic. So we're seeing some really good news right now. And I think it's OK to talk about good news."

      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "I do. And I -- unless people have a sense of fear that affects what they're willing to do, we're going to do really well. Right now, we're doing better than a mild flu season in terms of daily cases and hospitalizations."
