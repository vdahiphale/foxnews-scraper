But since we're dealing with visuals, let's really deal with visuals. Beyond the charming smile of a 70-year-old man, the great thing about the internet is the awful thing about the internet. If you've never done a Google image search of Nicole Brown Simpson murder scene, it will quickly erase that kindly old man you just saw. Maybe you should, I'll wait. So you see, evil isn't just an idea, it's a real thing and that real thing is free: Free to enjoy a margarita on a beach, free to enjoy TV offers from drooling producers, free to take pictures with ignorant Millennials unencumbered by his past. Maybe he'll get one or two of them back to his place and wake up the neighbors yet again. As for the rest of the world, our ability to forgive is really more about forgetting. Forgetting is easier than remembering that he butchered two people. But hey, he was a model inmate because his options were limited. He met the criteria of release. Will our treatment of him now fulfill the criteria of shame? Dana, the irony of all of this is, or the catch 22, is the only way for him to pay the family of the victims is for us to pay O.J. for work. So, we're going to have to feed his fame in order for them to get their money. So, he's going to be around, we're going to see him all over the place.",

He did not respond to a request for comments as to why. So there's a lot of movement of foot there. There's a new team led by Ty Cobb. The one thing I think it's curious about this, I don't understand how this is President Trump red line to make, the justice department's May 17th order that instructs Mueller to investigate any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign, as well as any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation. That is a relatively broad mandate, but it is the mandate that he was given. And all investigation has to do with me money. Remember when Mueller was first putting together his team. There was a lot of consternation by the Trump team saying these are all financial investigators. This is not appropriate, but that was about three months ago. So there must be something happening, something afoot to the lawyers are being contacted or being asked questions that make them think this is the direction that they're headed. And the Manafort piece I think is really interesting and probably the clue. Remember, President Trump said, if it was one of my satellites, that's fine, you go after him, but it wasn't me.

And here's Adam Jay, he says I use it every day, I'm a janitor in a community college, you want roundtables for a 115 people to table, so hold six chairs, how many tables? He's exactly right.

Russian interference by the way in the last presidential election was also a major topic. We'll get into that because Rick Pompeo, the CIA director also got frustrated by a series of questions from reporters and panelists about that. But what he was particularly angry about the President's CIA director is the fact that The New York Times back in early June published an account of the new chief of Iran operations at the Central Intelligence Agency. And they basically named this official even though he's a clandestine official. And his identity is supposed to be secret. The CIA director teed off on The New York Times for publishing his name."

The New York Times by the way in their June account justified publishing the name by saying, number one, his identity had been previously named in other news accounts and they also fell back on the notion that since he is running Iran operations for President Trump who is pushing a more muscular approach towards Tehran, it justified The New York Times publishing at least in their eyes the name of this clandestine official because they wanted to tell the public about the Trump administration's approach to Iran and how it was going to be more aggressive than the Obama administration and potentially even include attempts to overthrow the Iranian government.

Because they explained in the story. As I just quoted from it, The New York Times had to lay out why they felt justified. And again, they fell back on the notion that another unnamed news organization had named the CIA official, so they felt it was okay. And number two, they justified it, the New York Times by saying, well, President Trump is leading a more muscular approach to Iran so we need tell the public who is this person leading the policy.

To do this, it gives no confidence I believe to the men and women that serve, if you're going to have a paper do this, I mean, what do you think are going to be the next step as it relates to Pompeo to try to assure his individuals, the people working for him that this type of thing is not going to be repeated?"

As I mentioned, we are not naming the official because even the Times acknowledged in naming him that he is still working at this moment as a clandestine officer. Obviously, since it was published in \"The New York Times,\" the Iranians and others know who this person is but you would assume but behind the scenes steps are being taken to try to keep him safe and his family obviously. But this is worrisome for the administration, especially at a time when they are trying to step it up and deal with Iran in a more muscular way as you say. They just were embarrassed the administration because they recertified the Iran nuclear deal, they are under great pressure as you know, from conservatives to say, wait a second, President Trump during the campaign said he was going to rip up the Iran deal. But I think what the administration is saying, they need a little bit more time to figure out, okay, if you rip up the Iran nuclear deal, what comes next. Obviously, it's a kind of a reminder, a little bit similar to the ObamaCare debate, you can repeal it, what are you going to replace it with?"

President Trump has taken a very aggressive stance towards the media, the attacks on Twitter and elsewhere particularly against \"The New York Times,\" in attacking some of their reports as fake news. So, it's happening in that context of a very divisive time and there's nothing to answer your question directly that specifically the administration can do to stop the publication of this kind of a story. But you're right, there's a push and a pole, this is a traditional fight. There is that broader context where we as journalists want to publish as much information as we think the public has a right to know about and certainly the Times tried to make that case in their June report. And I suspect now they're going to have to respond to the CIA director's very critical comments to again justify why they published it and they're going to try to lay out their case. But you're right. This is happening at a time, very dangerous times all around the world in this administration. Part of the frustration you can see from the CIA director is there's not a whole lot he can do about the fact that this clandestine official's name is just out there for all the world to see."

President Trump has said, you know, he doesn't necessarily agree that Russia interfered, maybe it was China, maybe it was a fat guy on his couch in the basement, he doesn't agree with their conclusion that in fact Russians were giving him preference, they wanted him to win the elections. So, he has been challenging our intelligence officials in a very aggressive manner. Now Pompeo comes back and he is striking at the Times for something that happened some time ago. So, the question becomes, is this just about politics?"

So, the administration is now going to blame The New York Times in this particular case but there are certainly other cases where it's been the White House, the administration that has been taking actions that has frustrated the Intelligence Community, so that's out there as well. But I want to make an important point that you alluded to which is that Rick Pompeo, the CIA director also got very frustrated at this Aspen Security Forum when he was asked repeatedly on a panel discussion about did the Russians interfere in the election or not? And he kept saying, yes, I believe that they did, but to take a look at our actions moving forward. More important than that is what is the administration doing from a policy standpoint? Are we being tough with Russia on issues like Syria or not? And he was asked again and he was finally again flashed anger and said, for the 19th or 20th time, I will tell you, Rich Pompeo (ph) said, yes, I believe Russia interfered - I'm sorry, I said Rich, Mike Pompeo that, you know, that they did interfere in the election. They tried to anyway according to the CIA director. However, look at what we're doing moving forward from the policy standpoint, and you can bet, that's going to be one of the big questions moving forward. How tough or not is President Trump with Vladimir Putin in the Russians?"

His hair went gray and so did justice as well as our grasp on morality. Now when most people think of O.J., it's a myth linked to Emmy winning dramas. And now he's free -- unlike his victims -- to live out the rest of his life with fans, groupies and selfie seekers. I get it, he's famous and sympathetically a widower. But since we're dealing with visuals, let's really deal with visuals. Beyond the charming smile of a 70-year-old man, the great thing about the internet is the awful thing about the internet.

Forgetting is easier than remembering that he butchered two people. But hey, he was a model inmate because his options were limited. He met the criteria of release. Will our treatment of him now fulfill the criteria of shame? Dana, the irony of all of this is, or the catch 22, is the only way for him to pay the family of the victims is for us to pay O.J. for work. So, we're going to have to feed his fame in order for them to get their money. So, he's going to be around, we're going to see him all over the place."

And also it's interesting to me how parole works differently in different states. Had this crime actually happened somewhere else? He might not have been eligible for parole today. And it is very hard for those of us who watched this story develop over the past 20 years. It is difficult to separate what happened in Los Angeles with what happened in Nevada, and I understand that this parole board, they only were responsible for looking at this particular crime and the rules are what they are.

So, if you look at it in those terms, the upside here would have been if he had not been granted parole, because by all the criteria on the book, he is qualified. And then it comes down to something else that you're talking about, Greg, which is, okay, so now he goes out and he begins this next chapter of his life at age 70.

But nevertheless based on the criteria and the checklist, they would have been treating different than anyone else if they did not release him and they made this based on, you know, specifics and criteria, like his age, so he starts to show remorse, and that bring religion. And when you have the Christian groups lobby on your behalf essentially, and started, okay, this is a person who helps bring in, the Baptist church and services there, he counseled the minister, keep checking the list."

Also, the other thing that happened is -- great guy, Mark Corralo, who was a spokesperson and longtime Washington aid, who is probably one of the best legal P.R. people that you can have on your site, he's resigned today. He did not respond to a request for comments as to why. So there's a lot of movement of foot there. There's a new team led by Ty Cobb. The one thing I think it's curious about this, I don't understand how this is President Trump red line to make, the justice department's May 17th order that instructs Mueller to investigate any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign, as well as any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation. That is a relatively broad mandate, but it is the mandate that he was given. And all investigation has to do with me money. Remember when Mueller was first putting together his team. There was a lot of consternation by the Trump team saying these are all financial investigators. This is not appropriate, but that was about three months ago. So there must be something happening, something afoot to the lawyers are being contacted or being asked questions that make them think this is the direction that they're headed. And the Manafort piece I think is really interesting and probably the clue. Remember, President Trump said, if it was one of my satellites, that's fine, you go after him, but it wasn't me.

He said Rosenstein is from Baltimore, where the Democrats -- only democrats. He's putting -- it's like he has no regard for law and order in the process, and he thinks he can talk his way out of this."

It's the way it is right now. It's going to take a couple of decades, and perhaps longer before it's not a lawless place. I mean, it's deadwood meets west world, anything could happen, you could die there in a business transaction. So when you go to work in Russia you've got to deal with certain things. The same way, Hillary, when she took money, she took money from places that are, you know, their prime turf is human rights abuses. So she took money from places that abuse people. In Russia, they're dealing like the old west. The thing that also gets me mad is how the media reports and the stuff about Trump. It's like, Trump rages, Trump fumes, Trump slams Sessions. They all share the same word a day calendar. But then, whenever a liberal goes off whether it's Schumer, or Maxine Waters, or Tim Perez, they never say they're raging. They're always saying they're destroying. They're crushing it. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy. So to you, America, could decide who the liars really are, will be right back."

And it's about saving lives, when you reduce human trafficking, you save lives. The question is if he is indeed the wall, as Dana had said, how permanent can this effect be because, you know, when he leaves office, then the wall leaves. So he has to create permanent ideas, he has to create a structure, he has to create a new policy, new procedures that reflect the new reality, so when he leaves these things are in place."

And just to understand the impact -- and also, I think the turning effect in terms of the other gangs that have tried to make gang territory and access and moved into that space, understand what the repercussions are going to be. And he said that he was going to do this, he acted very quickly and decisively, it really takes a big chunk out of crime, violent crime in this country, and on children that are taking into these gangs, and jump in, and co-opted, and taught a life of violence by kind of replacing the father figures. This is so important and such a big piece, and that's why I think we talk about it so much on the show. And in addition to the fact that President Trump -- yeah, he's got to build his structure, but he is also, literally himself, operating as the deterrent for people to try to come in because they don't want to mess around with him. Why is this a bad thing? We don't want people coming in and putting their families in jeopardy, and rewarding the coyotes and the people that are taking the money, make a big mess for us.

There he is, 9-year-old, Ethan Crannigan, he has a rare clot disorder caused by a genetic mutation, it only affects one in ten million people, and one of the effects and, unfortunately, leaves him visually impaired.

Because algebra is the most failed course in community colleges nationwide, 60 percent of students enrolled in American community colleges are required to take one math course, and about 80 percent never finish their requirements. So I asked on twitter, what do you think about this? And I thought this was really smart because I believe you use algebra every day, for logic and reasoning. And here's Adam Jay, he says I use it every day, I'm a janitor in a community college, you want roundtables for a 115 people to table, so hold six chairs, how many tables? He's exactly right. And, you know, some people think that algebra is terrible, but it's actually has worked. Let's keep it. Set your DVRs and never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" And \"Hannity\" is up next.
