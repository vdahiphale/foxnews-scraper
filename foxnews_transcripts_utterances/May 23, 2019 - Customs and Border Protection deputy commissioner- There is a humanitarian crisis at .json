But, again, this $16 billion committed up front follows $12 billion last year, you might recall, for farmers. They say that dwarfs the amount of money they have lost as a result of losing China as a customer, particularly for buying things like soybeans and wheat.

It's believed that Nancy Pelosi will, at some point, put it on the schedule, and will try to pass it with as little fanfare as possible, so not to appear as though she's giving the president a win. But then the president also talked about that meeting yesterday that he attended for about 120 seconds, again, calling her crazy Nancy, saying she's lost it, referred again to crying Chuck, and they went on at length about the Democrats wanting to go down the road of impeachment and maybe not actually do it, but certainly keep up the investigations, saying that that's the only way that they're going to win in 2020 is by doing everything they can. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He said -- he called it 1,000 stabs to try to keep the president off balance.

We have just returned from a Justice Department briefing with reporters, where we got more detail that is now in this superseding indictment. The allegation comes down to this, that Julian Assange worked directly and encouraged Chelsea Manning to steal national defense information, much of which was at the top-secret level, including information that documented the names of confidential human sources working for the U.S. military and the State Department in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the release of that information put the individuals in exceptionally grave danger. What we learned at the briefing is that the pivotal month here is March of 2010. And, in that period, it's alleged that Chelsea Manning provided the first set of records to Julian Assange, what's called Guantanamo Docket. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These are the assessments of the Guantanamo detainees, including the 9/11 suspects. And then, after that, it's alleged Julian Assange said to Chelsea Manning, basically, I think you can get more, and Chelsea Manning went back and got these intelligence assessments, rules of engagement in Iraq, Afghanistan, and then the State Department cables. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Really, what's going on here, for some context, is that Julian Assange has now been arrested in Great Britain. And the question is whether he will be extradited to the U.S. for prosecution. This indictment uses elements of the Espionage Act. So that gives you a sense of how serious that is. What we were told today is that, ultimately, it will be up to a British judge. But this superseding indictment with 18 counts, many of which are under the Espionage Act, is kind of the strongest hand the U.S. can play to try and bring Assange back to the United States to face trial -- Neil. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And this is \"Your World.\" Explaining how he's going to try to help farmers in the middle of this back-and-forth trade battle with China, to the tune of $16 billion in relief that he says he's getting from the billions of dollars coming in on those tariffs on China. Now, he referred to hundreds of billions of dollars. He's talking about the potential, I assume, from tariffs that kick in on $200 billion worth of additional Chinese goods on the 1st of June. And that could be pushed back even further. But he made some news as far as negotiating here, when he discussed the possibility that Huawei, the Chinese telecom concern that has been accused of spying and snooping on customers and American telecom giants, could be part of a trade deal here. But, again, this $16 billion committed up front follows $12 billion last year, you might recall, for farmers. They say that dwarfs the amount of money they have lost as a result of losing China as a customer, particularly for buying things like soybeans and wheat. That market has deteriorated, as China has found other venues to get that, notably from Brazil, Argentina, that sort of thing. But it was a newsmaking conference, to put it mildly. John Roberts now on how this changes the equation or whether we're still looking at a big impasse that could go on a while -- John."

He said, I think she wants to approve it, but she doesn't get it. It's believed that Nancy Pelosi will, at some point, put it on the schedule, and will try to pass it with as little fanfare as possible, so not to appear as though she's giving the president a win. But then the president also talked about that meeting yesterday that he attended for about 120 seconds, again, calling her crazy Nancy, saying she's lost it, referred again to crying Chuck, and they went on at length about the Democrats wanting to go down the road of impeachment and maybe not actually do it, but certainly keep up the investigations, saying that that's the only way that they're going to win in 2020 is by doing everything they can. He said -- he called it 1,000 stabs to try to keep the president off balance. The feud is definitely continuing, because, earlier today, Nancy Pelosi doubled down on her comments yesterday about the president engaging in a cover-up and obstructing justice, and that that whole thing taken together might be impeachable.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders eliciting some laughter when she said, I have seen both, and this one was definitely calm. Some other news that the president made too, that -- on the release of John Walker Lindh, that he had federal attorneys looking at it to see if there was anything that could be done to stop it, says he was told by the attorneys that there was nothing he could do to stop it. He said, \"If I could have done something, I would have done it in a heartbeat.\" The president, also asked about Iran, he says he doesn't think that he will need the troops, Neil, but if they were necessary, he would definitely go with whatever the Pentagon recommended.

      "utterance": "Well, thanks, Neil. And good afternoon. A short time ago, this 18-count superseding indictment was unsealed against the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. We have just returned from a Justice Department briefing with reporters, where we got more detail that is now in this superseding indictment. The allegation comes down to this, that Julian Assange worked directly and encouraged Chelsea Manning to steal national defense information, much of which was at the top-secret level, including information that documented the names of confidential human sources working for the U.S. military and the State Department in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the release of that information put the individuals in exceptionally grave danger. What we learned at the briefing is that the pivotal month here is March of 2010. And, in that period, it's alleged that Chelsea Manning provided the first set of records to Julian Assange, what's called Guantanamo Docket. These are the assessments of the Guantanamo detainees, including the 9/11 suspects. And then, after that, it's alleged Julian Assange said to Chelsea Manning, basically, I think you can get more, and Chelsea Manning went back and got these intelligence assessments, rules of engagement in Iraq, Afghanistan, and then the State Department cables. Really, what's going on here, for some context, is that Julian Assange has now been arrested in Great Britain. And the question is whether he will be extradited to the U.S. for prosecution. This indictment uses elements of the Espionage Act. So that gives you a sense of how serious that is. What we were told today is that, ultimately, it will be up to a British judge. But this superseding indictment with 18 counts, many of which are under the Espionage Act, is kind of the strongest hand the U.S. can play to try and bring Assange back to the United States to face trial -- Neil."

But this is the president in this bailout to farmers, $16 billion, that is really significant. It's now up to $28 billion over the last two of these bailouts. You know that it's not exactly Republican ideology to be for this kind of thing, but the farmers are hurting, big time, as a result of the China tariffs. Now, in this news conference, the president said that China is paying for the $16 billion. Well, that's kind of like Mexico is paying for the wall, because it's tangential. It's -- importers take it on the chin with increased tariffs on various Chinese products. And one specific industry is getting this bailout. I'm going to have the secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, on the show tonight, and ask him about this, because there are some concerns, even Chuck Grassley from Iowa, that this is misplaced, and may affect the market in the wrong way."

The businesses and all can try to prevent passing along the entire 25 percent price tag on this latest wave. They're not going into effect yet. But I did notice that the president referred to hundreds of billions of dollars that's coming in from China. To my math, I think it's between $35 billion and $39 billion on the 10 percent that was in effect on other goods before these new ones kick in. Do you know where, or is he factoring out into the future the $200 billion worth of additional goods that are up for tariffs or maybe the 300-plus- billion that could be coming? Where's he getting that figure?"

This firm, of course, has been caught dead center spying on American firms and snooping on top telecom concerns. They have been sort of singled out to not do business with. And all of a sudden now, he threw them into the mix as part of a deal, hinting that they may be being forgiven for that and continue to do business with U.S. entities. What was your read on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "I thought that was fascinating. That was another very newsy part. I mean, if you have your secretary of state going out saying that Huawei is a threat to the national security, and that any Western country that uses it potentially could be -- could be spied on by China and give all of this information through its 5G system, if you have the secretary of state out there saying that, you obviously have come to the conclusion, as the administration, that this is a threat. But the way he talked about it, as you rightly point out, was that it could possibly be thrown into some kind of deal. We don't know what all the details are of that."

You're a young guy, obviously, but I -- the ill will and the tension between the two sides, with the nicknames and the disparaging comments on both sides -- apparently, Chuck Schumer has just said some zingers in response to the president's crying Chuck comments, I guess. But it's particularly nasty. And I'm wondering. It's one thing to talk about, we can still do business or whatever, but, in this environment, and approaching an election year, I would wonder if anything can get done."

But the things that potentially could be bipartisan wins, like infrastructure, it's hard to see you get from point A to point B in this environment. And the president made clear that he made an outreach with this infrastructure. Nancy Pelosi really cannot have it both ways. The House speaker wants to not have impeachment, but have impeachment, judging by her press conference earlier today. And I think that there's some pressure inside that caucus to go forward with, as the president says, the I-word."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

About an hour-and-a-half from now, he's going to have the agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, on these developments and this help for farmers. But a lot of those same farmers, to Bret's point, are still underwater on a lot of this stuff. And they would much prefer just having trade with China than the deal with getting credits or special allowances or breaks. And it's also opened up the possibility that other groups, manufacturers, auto concerns and the rest, will say, hey, what you did for them, you got to do for us. So it could problematic, but it's still early on here. We shall see. In the meantime, the read on this from market watchers Rebecca Walser, and we have got Scott Shellady over at the CME. You know, as bad as it looks, guys, when we look at a 286-point hit on the Dow, it had been well over 400 points. So, we pared a lot of those losses. I'm wondering, though, how this carries on here, when it looks like both sides, certainly in the China situation, are getting increasingly stiff in their positions? Rebecca, I'm reminded that the Chinese today said they don't like the American attitude, the bullying attitude, we can endure this, we will deal with it. The Chinese government talking about a two-year reprieve in taxes for some of their big software companies to absorb the pain they're going to feel from these tariffs. I mean, they're preparing for an outright trade war."

We don't like to pick winners and losers on the U.S. side. But that's exactly what China does, exactly what you just said. They're willing to invest a lot in private investment on issues that they want to -- like the semiconductor industry, that they obviously unfairly compete with. So we have to be in it for the long game too. This is not a short game. This is a long game, and we can't make immediate decisions off of one market day down."

      "utterance": "I think the market is telling us something we should all listen to. And that's this. Yes, we have got a trade war with China, but here's the problem, Neil. The longer this goes on, the more it hurts, because anybody that's involved -- obviously, farmers are a big part of this, but anybody that's got -- affected by trade with China, your biggest customer or a big customer of yours is now going to your competitors. And every day that they're going to your competitors, I don't care if we throw the \"Yes, we're open\" sign up tomorrow, you're not going to get 100 percent of those Chinese customers back. They're going to make new relationships, maybe better relationships, maybe cheaper relationships. You're not going to get them all back. And that's what the market is waking up to. We are losing the soybean market to South America. And anybody else in business that has China as a big customer knows that, as long as that customer is shopping elsewhere, every day that goes by, you're losing more and more your customer base that just won't come back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, to follow up on that point, I will go back to you, Rebecca.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHELLADY",
      "utterance": "I don't think so. I mean, obviously, he's subsidizing the soybean -- or mostly soybean farmers. And the farmers are going to get subsidies. But that can't go on forever. And Mother Nature has been complying for the last three or four years, Neil. I mean, we have got a lot of soybeans anyway."

      "utterance": "So it's going to continue to hurt. Just Mother Nature's hurt us, because the farmer is so efficient. But, on top of that, you throw the China thing in there, and the biggest deal is this. Every day that goes by, we're not being able to sell to our biggest customer, and they might make better, cheaper relationships elsewhere, and they won't come back even when we have some sort agreement. That's the biggest problem. And that's what the market is waking up to. After May the 10th, that was the watershed moment, the markets thinking, hey, this could be a long time, and we might lose these customers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "They flip it around, Rebecca, and say, well, China's in trouble too, because a lot of U.S. businesses are shifting operations to other points in Southeast Asia, I think, in GoPro's case, all the way to Guadalajara, Mexico, to make a lot of their stuff. So I'm wondering if you get a sense that both sides are bracing themselves for life after not getting a deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALSER",
      "utterance": "You know, Neil, I agree with Scott. But here's the point I think that is really important. China doesn't want to be China to us anymore. China's got their own strategic long-term plan that says, we don't want to be in the low-cost manufacturing and part supplying business in the long term. We want to be basically America. We want to go to the high-tech engineering, to all these things. So, although the trade war is making all this happen kind of preemptively, ahead of schedule, this is really where China wants to be anyways. They don't want to be the low-cost buyer and this low-cost supplier of all these things to America. So if we have to make new relationships and expand America beyond just China supplying all these things, that's what we have to do long term, because that's what China's on the track to do anyways."

Those are the things that he doesn't care about. And let's face it. In the ugliest of times, they will sacrifice 30 million people to get their point across. We can't do that either. So, yes, it hurts them a lot. But they don't care. They can suffer through it, because they will suffer through it. And I think that, ultimately, at the end of the day, this thing will end, Neil, when we finally have those -- those supply lines changed from out of China to other nations that trade with us."

People are -- generally go there for a flight to quality if you're nervous. And interest rates are now at better than one-year lows. In fact, that is supposed to be a boost for those either refinancing to buy a home, to refinance a home they're in. But, bottom line, that was the one half-full-glass version of this. In that flight to quality, interest rates went down, and that could provide a floor for stocks. We will see. Meanwhile, another development here on the fact that you can still get stuff done in Washington, but, right now, how far this goes, anyone's guests -- the Senate approving a supplemental $19.1 billion disaster aid package to cover the cost of things like hurricane and Midwest flooding. Now, the vote was 85-8. The package is going to go to the House, no slam- dunk there.

Look, I will just tell you, just this week, as you know, and most people have heard, we had an absolute tragedy, the loss of a young Guatemalan teenager in our custody by name of Carlos, 16 years old, who passed away earlier this week Our hearts go out to their family, certainly to our front-line men and women too, who did everything they could to care for him.

That is something we have been talking about for years. I know the acting secretary emphasized in his testimony last -- this week, as I did in my testimony up on the Hill last week."

We're seeing an unprecedented amount of families and unaccompanied children -- 66 percent last month of the over 100,000 people we apprehended and/or encountered were families and unaccompanied children. This young Guatemalan boy actually arrived with his sister, but, nevertheless, again, unaccompanied, as a child. And so, over the course of the time with us, was fallen with the flu, and, unfortunately, this tragedy before us. Look, the fact is, is that when they come to CBP, our intake, if you will, is meant to be and designed for short term, not for anything like what it is we're dealing with by sheer volume and numbers and, again, this very vulnerable population, Neil. It's absolutely tragic. One life is too many. Our hearts go out to him and to their -- his family. But we need Congress to help us, alongside everything that we have been doing, unprecedented degree of physicians and medical support on the field with our officers, our agents, over 1,000 deployed to the southern border to help surge and deal with this crisis. We're doing all we can. We're going to continue to do it. We need Congress to do their part."

How do you feel about that?"

      "utterance": "OK, Speaker Nancy Pelosi now wants an intervention for the president, after he canceled an infrastructure meeting with top Democrats, when Pelosi said he was involved in a cover-up. The president, you have heard from the White House, couldn't go forward with negotiations, if that's the atmosphere going into it. We have got Republican strategist Amy Tarkanian on this, The Wall Street Journal's Jillian Melchior, and Democratic strategist Sarah Riggs Amico. Sarah, obviously, there are conflicting reports on the president's tone and tenor at this meeting, short as it was. From a lot of people around him, he wasn't showing his temper. He was just dismissing it early and, goodbye, have a nice day. What do you think?"
    },

      "speaker": "SARAH RIGGS AMICO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I think it's incredibly frustrating for the American people to watch an issue that, in theory, shouldn't be partisan, like infrastructure, be destroyed by an atmosphere in Washington that's utterly divided. And I think what you're hearing from the speaker and from voters around this country is an expression of that frustration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, do you think that setting the stage it that morning to say that the president is guilty of a cover-up, that that doesn't necessarily plant the seed for a constructive dialogue on pretty much anything, does it?"

      "speaker": "RIGGS AMICO",
      "utterance": "Look, I think he's the president of the United States. If he can't walk into a room after somebody said something that he doesn't like, and still get to work on behalf of the American people, then I think he's going to face a very long shot at reelection in November 2020."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, you might be right about that. But, Jillian, that charge alone would be tantamount to a high crime and misdemeanor, an impeachable offense. And I'm just wondering, that does change a tenor going into a discussion, doesn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JILLIAN MELCHIOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, I think Nancy Pelosi is rather interesting to watch right now, because she keeps talking about self-impeaching, he's self-impeaching, he needs an intervention, making the case on why Trump is unfit to be president. It's within her power to launch impeachment proceedings. But I think, if she's being honest, she doesn't want to. She knows that it's a political risk. She knows that half of America will feel disenfranchised. But it's really dishonest to be engaging in this kind of really extreme rhetoric about why the president needs to be impeached, when you hold the power to do it. If she really thinks that's how things are, she put her money where their mouth is."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I don't know where this is going. Amy, you're closer to this than I am. But one of the things that comes up is that, at the very least -- and maybe it goes back to what Sarah rightly said was an environment where it's going to get -- be tough to get anything done, no matter who you blame. And I'm wondering if that goes all the way through the summer to when we have a debt ceiling issue, government potentially running out of money, could be a shutdown, that this has poisoned the well for even addressing that. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "AMY TARKANIAN, GOP STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I think it's incredibly embarrassing. I was just speaking with some friends about this right before we came on, on the fact that we do have social media. The world is watching. And they're watching now our two top leaders -- or two of the top leaders basically go at -- go at each other via the jugular over Twitter. You now have Nancy Pelosi, who responded to the president calling her a mess, basically saying that he's the extremely stable genius. You know, this is not helpful for anybody. This doesn't help our nation at all. And I don't know what she was thinking before she went into that meeting with the president by basically lodging those verbal -- verbal bombs on his lap. If she wanted that to be a success at all, there was no way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

We're not talking to the Chinese. The Chinese won't talk to us. We're just going to ignore you. No progress or any kumbaya on dealing with infrastructure, which you could argue the two parties have some common themes and ties. That's not happening. It's like I want to separate my teenage sons, right? I mean, and they're not listening. Where does this go? Play out the summer."

He is perfectly capable of holding his tongue and his pride and getting to work, and remembering that being president is a job, and voters expect him to deliver."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Jillian, what do you make of that, that no matter who you want to cast aspersions, nothing gets done, and maybe Wall Street's reaction is the first proof of how people are getting kind of rattled?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I do think that we're living in an era of uncertainty. And some of the stuff that's happening, for instance, with the trade war, it's contributing to economic uncertainty, in the same way that over- regulation has during Democratic years. But, again, I would say politics is in everything. I think your point about people not talking to those they disagree with is a good one. If our political leaders don't do it, we should get out there and have good-faith conversations with people we disagree with."
