Tonight, we start with very special welcome back to Joe Biden who landed just in time to see Republicans pull off what is nothing short of a clean sweep in the Commonwealth of Virginia -- a political tsunami, earthquake, whatever analogy you prefer, winning the race for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general. Republicans also flipped the Virginia house of delegates. Meanwhile, in the deep, deep blue state of New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli, well, he came within less than a point about 20,000 votes of getting incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy out of office. This is New Jersey. And by the way, the New Jersey Senate president a Democrat is losing to this Republican truck driver who spent a whopping 150 bucks on his campaign in Long Island, New York, not exactly known as conservative territory. Just outside of New York, Republicans, they swept all three major races, including two elections for district attorney. Tonight, I have to give credit to Vice President Kamala Harris, while campaigning in Virginia for Terry McAuliffe she actually got something very profound and very right. Give her credit.",

      "sentences": "For once, I actually agree with the vice president. She's right. This will and should and needs to have a huge impact on 2022, that's one year from now, and 2024 and beyond. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, what happened in Virginia, I want to do a deep dive tonight and around the country, it is only a first step. We cannot forget the radical new green deal socialists, they're still in charge and they've not given up their radical ideology. And by the way, tonight, they are desperate. Going forward, Republicans all over the country they need to first fight back against the New Green Deal socialism that will destroy this great republic, but they also they've got to focus now on being a party that is responding to the needs of working men and women. Remember 2016 about forgotten men and the forgotten women of this country, and offering solutions and ideas that are in keeping with liberty, freedom, capitalism and our constitution. These ideas should be rooted in conservative principles. Now, why? Because conservatives and conservatism and those principles, they work. If we are to save this great republic, Republicans have got to loudly and proudly articulate advocate fight for freedom, liberty, limited government, capitalism, our great Constitution, and yes, that would include our Bill of Rights. Republicans have got to be the party of lower taxes, limited government, less government bureaucracy. We see what happens, once we got energy independence -- well, now, we're paying about more a gallon by giving it up. They've got to be the party of energy independence. They've got to be -- we learn this in Virginia -- the party that offers parents choices to failing public schools. That means school choice. They've got to explain how free market solutions to health care that protect the poor and the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions, work far better than any top-down government program. The Republicans, they've got to be the party of law and order. If you want to pursue happiness, you have to be safe and secure. They should be the party of law and order. They should be the party of secure borders, not lawlessness like we're seeing now. They should be the party of America first principles. Yes, it's okay. Every other country, they put their countries ahead of every other country and we ought to do it here. This America last policy practices of Joe Biden is not particularly working out well. Republicans need to be the party that fights for free and fair trade and, of course, in a very dangerous world, with hostile regimes like China, North Korea, Iran and Russia, we've got to believe and practice and put our money where our mouth is and that means peace through strength. If Republicans and conservatives, if they unite behind these simple fundamental principles, which pretty much happened in Virginia, and if they were to take it a step further, if they would have signed a pledge, put their -- put their signature on a piece of paper and tell the voters, if you elect us, we will do these things then they make that pledge, call it a Modern Day Contract with America, Promises to America, I don't care what you call it. Then Republicans now, they've won phase one. They stopped the radical socialists. They won the state of Virginia. They've shown that Democratic policies are hurting the American people. But if they can win one year from now, and then two years after that, Republicans would have a chance to take back the House, take back the Senate, and yes, in 2024, the White House. And then we can get the country back on track again. Right now, the Democratic radical socialist platform, it is deeply unpopular. Americans have had -- they're full of high inflation, high taxes, supply shortages, Joe Biden's negligence in Afghanistan, Americans, by the way, now trapped 81 days. Americans are not happy nor should they be. Today, Joe Biden telling reporters that last night's election was the result of Americans being confused -- oh we're confused? Oh we just made a mistake last night. The people in Virginia, New Jersey just made a mistake, you were all confused. You had no idea what you were doing. Anyway, he's claiming that you're confused about what's really good for you. Time to eat your spinach I guess and lower your thermostat and put on your sweater. Take a look.",

Make no mistake, this is going to be a tough couple of years, but if Republicans now build off yesterday's momentum, one year from now, the Biden agenda can be stopped dead in its tracks completely. And if Republicans get focused, if they run on solid conservative ideas if they keep their promises, if they sign a pledge, the success in Virginia, it can be replicated all over the country. Here with reaction, \"FOX & Friends\" weekend co-host Pete Hegseth and the host of \"Justice\", Judge Jeanine Pirro. Judge, I'll start with you and I'm happy with the results. I'm not surprised about Virginia. I was surprised it got that close to New Jersey. I mean both at 49 percent, less than 20,000 votes the last time I looked. But that's only phase one. Next year, this time, the morning after election day 2022, that will tell this country whether or not this crazy agenda stops or not. JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST, \"JUSTICE\": Well, you know what, last night, people across America, although they were voting on their local issues or local legislators, governors, they were sending a national message. And the message to America was, we've had enough of this woke nonsense, we've had enough of you separating parents from their children, we want to deal with the economy. We're tired of inflation, $175 a month for every American family for an extra nothing, and we're tired about this woke-ism agenda. And so, what we've got going forward is an administration that is tone deaf to America. They are tone deaf to the fact that we don't want immigrants coming in, and you know, Joe Biden being toned up and apparently not tuned in to the fact that they're offering $450 or proposing $450,000 to illegals coming across the across the border. There is so much with the supply chain and with COVID and with education, that now, the Democrats are dug in. As you say, they're doubling down. They're not going to learn from this. This is going to continue until they're out of office. But for me, waking up today was a feeling that America is back, that America is winning, that people are tired of hearing that they're racist, they're tired of hearing that we are to be determined by the color of our skin and we're going to indoctrinate our children to racist, socialist, Marxist agenda.

None of that's being reported. These people are nuts. They spend all day on television and after they're off the air talking to everybody and they all agree with each other because they all live in one or two cities and they literally are completely out of touch with the fact that 97 percent of the American population lives completely different lives, has completely different views.

It doesn't matter if it's $1.75 trillion or $3.5 trillion, they want to take control of pre-K, of child care -- the only two elements of education they don't control now. They want to take control of that. They want to hire 80,000 IRS agents. So the pushback is only going to grow and this administration by the way has been disastrous on everything -- whether it's Afghanistan, now, it's Russia threatening to invade Ukraine, Taiwan, supply chains. I mean, they can't name you a single thing that Joe Biden has managed correctly in his first nine or ten months as president. They can't name you one.",

Tonight, we start with very special welcome back to Joe Biden who landed just in time to see Republicans pull off what is nothing short of a clean sweep in the Commonwealth of Virginia -- a political tsunami, earthquake, whatever analogy you prefer, winning the race for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general. Republicans also flipped the Virginia house of delegates. Meanwhile, in the deep, deep blue state of New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli, well, he came within less than a point about 20,000 votes of getting incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy out of office. This is New Jersey. And by the way, the New Jersey Senate president a Democrat is losing to this Republican truck driver who spent a whopping 150 bucks on his campaign in Long Island, New York, not exactly known as conservative territory. Just outside of New York, Republicans, they swept all three major races, including two elections for district attorney. Tonight, I have to give credit to Vice President Kamala Harris, while campaigning in Virginia for Terry McAuliffe she actually got something very profound and very right. Give her credit."

      "utterance": "For once, I actually agree with the vice president. She's right. This will and should and needs to have a huge impact on 2022, that's one year from now, and 2024 and beyond. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, what happened in Virginia, I want to do a deep dive tonight and around the country, it is only a first step. We cannot forget the radical new green deal socialists, they're still in charge and they've not given up their radical ideology. And by the way, tonight, they are desperate. Going forward, Republicans all over the country they need to first fight back against the New Green Deal socialism that will destroy this great republic, but they also they've got to focus now on being a party that is responding to the needs of working men and women. Remember 2016 about forgotten men and the forgotten women of this country, and offering solutions and ideas that are in keeping with liberty, freedom, capitalism and our constitution. These ideas should be rooted in conservative principles. Now, why? Because conservatives and conservatism and those principles, they work. If we are to save this great republic, Republicans have got to loudly and proudly articulate advocate fight for freedom, liberty, limited government, capitalism, our great Constitution, and yes, that would include our Bill of Rights. Republicans have got to be the party of lower taxes, limited government, less government bureaucracy. We see what happens, once we got energy independence -- well, now, we're paying about more a gallon by giving it up. They've got to be the party of energy independence. They've got to be -- we learn this in Virginia -- the party that offers parents choices to failing public schools. That means school choice. They've got to explain how free market solutions to health care that protect the poor and the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions, work far better than any top-down government program. The Republicans, they've got to be the party of law and order. If you want to pursue happiness, you have to be safe and secure. They should be the party of law and order. They should be the party of secure borders, not lawlessness like we're seeing now. They should be the party of America first principles. Yes, it's okay. Every other country, they put their countries ahead of every other country and we ought to do it here. This America last policy practices of Joe Biden is not particularly working out well. Republicans need to be the party that fights for free and fair trade and, of course, in a very dangerous world, with hostile regimes like China, North Korea, Iran and Russia, we've got to believe and practice and put our money where our mouth is and that means peace through strength. If Republicans and conservatives, if they unite behind these simple fundamental principles, which pretty much happened in Virginia, and if they were to take it a step further, if they would have signed a pledge, put their -- put their signature on a piece of paper and tell the voters, if you elect us, we will do these things then they make that pledge, call it a Modern Day Contract with America, Promises to America, I don't care what you call it. Then Republicans now, they've won phase one. They stopped the radical socialists. They won the state of Virginia. They've shown that Democratic policies are hurting the American people. But if they can win one year from now, and then two years after that, Republicans would have a chance to take back the House, take back the Senate, and yes, in 2024, the White House. And then we can get the country back on track again. Right now, the Democratic radical socialist platform, it is deeply unpopular. Americans have had -- they're full of high inflation, high taxes, supply shortages, Joe Biden's negligence in Afghanistan, Americans, by the way, now trapped 81 days. Americans are not happy nor should they be. Today, Joe Biden telling reporters that last night's election was the result of Americans being confused -- oh we're confused? Oh we just made a mistake last night. The people in Virginia, New Jersey just made a mistake, you were all confused. You had no idea what you were doing. Anyway, he's claiming that you're confused about what's really good for you. Time to eat your spinach I guess and lower your thermostat and put on your sweater. Take a look."

We just need more of it. That's insanity. You know, how do you define insanity? Do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result.

Make no mistake, this is going to be a tough couple of years, but if Republicans now build off yesterday's momentum, one year from now, the Biden agenda can be stopped dead in its tracks completely. And if Republicans get focused, if they run on solid conservative ideas if they keep their promises, if they sign a pledge, the success in Virginia, it can be replicated all over the country. Here with reaction, \"FOX & Friends\" weekend co-host Pete Hegseth and the host of \"Justice\", Judge Jeanine Pirro. Judge, I'll start with you and I'm happy with the results. I'm not surprised about Virginia. I was surprised it got that close to New Jersey. I mean both at 49 percent, less than 20,000 votes the last time I looked. But that's only phase one. Next year, this time, the morning after election day 2022, that will tell this country whether or not this crazy agenda stops or not. JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST, \"JUSTICE\": Well, you know what, last night, people across America, although they were voting on their local issues or local legislators, governors, they were sending a national message. And the message to America was, we've had enough of this woke nonsense, we've had enough of you separating parents from their children, we want to deal with the economy. We're tired of inflation, $175 a month for every American family for an extra nothing, and we're tired about this woke-ism agenda. And so, what we've got going forward is an administration that is tone deaf to America. They are tone deaf to the fact that we don't want immigrants coming in, and you know, Joe Biden being toned up and apparently not tuned in to the fact that they're offering $450 or proposing $450,000 to illegals coming across the across the border. There is so much with the supply chain and with COVID and with education, that now, the Democrats are dug in. As you say, they're doubling down. They're not going to learn from this. This is going to continue until they're out of office. But for me, waking up today was a feeling that America is back, that America is winning, that people are tired of hearing that they're racist, they're tired of hearing that we are to be determined by the color of our skin and we're going to indoctrinate our children to racist, socialist, Marxist agenda. Nonsense. America is back."

So all the hyperbole on MSNBC and CNN, it's all garbage. They know it. But they, but - - or maybe they don't know it but they but they can't hide it. Last night was the tale of three states, three states we did not expect and it's a pathway for conservatives and patriots and Republicans. It's New Jersey where the COVID mandates and lockdowns of Phil Murphy were universally rejected. I don't care if he wins or not, the people spoke and said your authoritarianism will not stand. We won't put up for it. We're going to send a truck driver -- God bless truck drivers, by the way, that's a real job -- to replace the president of the Senate in New Jersey. Right, it is.

And then in Minneapolis, overwhelmingly Democrat city, 70-30 at best, voted 56 to 43 to not defund the police, because it turns out law and order matters, people respect and love the police and what they do. So between crime and education and COVID, it lays the groundwork for exactly what Republicans to stand for. Ultimately, Sean, it comes out to America first.

And parents who over the during the pandemic for the first time got to see what their kids were learning because they were learning from home and they're like you're learning what? They're teaching you what? And then when they spoke up, now, they're domestic terrorists. And look, I watched with great interest all this coverage about white supremacists -- in Virginia last night, as you pointed out, a Jamaican immigrant, African-American woman was elected to the lieutenant governor of the state, a Cuban-American, Jason Miyares, was elected attorney general of the state -- of the commonwealth of Virginia. None of that's being reported. These people are nuts. They spend all day on television and after they're off the air talking to everybody and they all agree with each other because they all live in one or two cities and they literally are completely out of touch with the fact that 97 percent of the American population lives completely different lives, has completely different views. And then when they when Election Day comes, they can't explain it. So they chalk it up to they cheated or white supremacist or whatever. They make something up because they can't comprehend it. Last night was the beginning of that pushback and I think it's going to continue. And you ask about the agenda here it's the craziest thing I've ever seen. It's -- these people are governing like they have a mandate to radically remake the country. It's build back socialism. It doesn't matter if it's $1.75 trillion or $3.5 trillion, they want to take control of pre-K, of child care -- the only two elements of education they don't control now. They want to take control of that. They want to hire 80,000 IRS agents. So the pushback is only going to grow and this administration by the way has been disastrous on everything -- whether it's Afghanistan, now, it's Russia threatening to invade Ukraine, Taiwan, supply chains.

They have this deranged obsession against putting the wall up.

They want dirty air and water, want to kill grandma and grandpa. I'm sick of it. I was raised by parents that grew up very poor, that were good Christian parents, and that believed as -- as I believe that were all created by the same God.

And for the white child does it say you can vote any way that you want, any choice that you want, always and forever? I mean, who made up those rules for us, you know? And so, the Democrats, they really don't have the solutions. And so when you look at the Democrat-run cities, the Democrat-run counties, states, they're losing. The neighborhoods are the worst, the schools are the worst, everything, it's the worst. And so, they move from Democrat-led states come to Republican-led states and they ruin it, forgetting when you came here, it was fine and now it's changed because you brought the same policies with you that ruined the state you just left. So, you know, what I want for us as Black people, just leave us alone. If you want to vote Democrat, then do so. If you want to vote libertarian, do so. Whatever you want to be, be it. This is America. This is freedom. Who died and left you in charge of all of us as black people so that we could be corralled into doing what you want us to do? I thought you said that you are the tolerant folks. If you're tolerant, that means you allow other ideas to percolate. You don't want just ideas that you agree with because then you see we wouldn't be living in America, we would be living in a totally different country. Nobody wants that."

Low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, and African-American youth unemployment. Conservative policies work. I feel that this process happens every two and four years and the Democrats, they go to the same playbook, and then I look at Democratic cities run by Democrats for decades, states run by Democrats for decades and there is violence in the streets there's no law and order. There's no safety and security. The school systems have been destroyed in many cities. I'd like to see the Republican Party reach out deep and wide into every city, every town, every ethnic group, every American, fellow American, and offer another way. And maybe Republicans have failed in that front."

All this time, it appears that Nixon was a homeboy. What we're going to do is we need someone who has sensible ideas, sensible solutions, because you know the message is important but the messenger is equally important. And what I want to say to Black people, Asian people, whatever, minorities, Latinos, whatever, don't allow political parties to divide us. Don't allow political parties to use whatever grievances that have been historically against you to force you to look at them as the savior so that they can swoop in and think they're saving you when all they're doing is pitting one race against the other, one race against the other. You'll notice for example that what was happening with Asian, it was young black men and they were attacking Asians. But nobody wanted to say anything about it. If you can't identify the problem, then how can you come up with a solution? So we've got to stop this divisiveness. There's a Psalm that I live by. I used it in my campaign and it's Psalm 33, how good and pleasant it is my brothers and sisters, live together in peace and harmony. That's what we want."

And these are -- I look at the solutions, it's not that complicated. I mean, school choice would be a pretty easy thing to accomplish. If we really want to -- if we really want to create an environment where people can pursue happiness, law and order is really not that difficult. Rudy Giuliani, for example, turned New York City around at a time where they were experiencing almost 3,000 murders a year. They brought it down to 300. So there are answers. I believe conservatism is a better philosophy to get us there. What are your plans uh now that you're going to be taking on this new position?"

You're not a member of the Senate but you do bring them to order you're the parliamentarian. And here in Virginia, the current lieutenant governor who is a Democrat has broken I believe different tie votes. And so, that's something else that I'm looking forward to. Twenty years ago, 20 years ago to the day last night, I was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates. And now I'm here going to be a part of the Senate, and that's just so amazing to me that I as the little girl 6 six years old came off that Boeing 737 Pan Am, landed at JFK and lived in the Bronx and here I am now. The immigrant -- I'm not even first generation American, I'm the immigrant, and I get this opportunity. And I worked for it. I worked hard for it. I sure didn't do anything special but I did stay in school and study and that's what I did, and you have to prepare for the path that you want. I prepared. I went to college. I went to college the hard way. I had three children by the time I went to college and they were all under five because I wanted to go to law school. And so, you have to do what you have to do, and America will allow you to do that. I'm not saying America doesn't have problems, heaven knows there are no countries where there aren't problems. If it's not racism, it's colorism, it's classism, it's sexism, we find ways to divide ourselves. But you see the people at the border are dying to get in because they know if they could just get their foot on American soil, the trajectory of their lives will change. That's what America can do."

You got to remember one thing -- I mean, they brought in Obama, they brought in Biden to Virginia, they brought in Harris to Virginia, they literally took the entire Democratic line up, their all-star lineup, they brought them all in. They out-raised the Democrats so many times they had a guy who was a former governor of the state who was effectively the Clinton poster boy, right, could do no wrong in Washington, D.C. -- they did all of that and they used Trump's name over and over and over again, and you had the greatest turnout in the history of the Republican Party for any you know for any governor in the state history. I mean, it's just -- it's so funny. Again, they bring in their whole lineup, they raise more money and they use Trump, and guess what happens? Republicans turn out in record number to support Youngkin and we just have an unbelievable night, not just with governor, not just with lieutenant governor, you know not with just with attorney general, but also if you look at the House in Virginia, they picked up seven seats. So, now, you know the GOP controls the House. What a great night this was for the U.S. and what a great night it was for frankly Trump."

Here with reaction, author of this brand new book, it's a really worthwhile read and it's called \"Black in Blue\", former Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best. Chief, welcome back. It's great to have you. I remember watching you with great interest and sorrow because I remember as they took over a city block, including a police precinct, and then this young man Horace Lorenzo Anderson Jr. died, I interviewed his father, you stepped aside because of the lack of respect for officers in Seattle and that the policies that they were putting on the department were destined to fail.

Many people really want to have efficient public safety and are pro-police in that regard. It doesn't mean that they don't want fair and justice -- just policing, but they do want officers to be able to respond to calls for service and do the time -- excuse me, the type of work that's needed to provide public safety in our communities.

And clearly, it was so predictable under these circumstances in my view that we were going to have increased crime, increased violence, increased shots fired that happened not only in Seattle and other places.
