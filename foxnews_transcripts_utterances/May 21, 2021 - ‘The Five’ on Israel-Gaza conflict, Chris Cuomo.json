Because if this were the other way around, and Trump said something, and someone did something like this, they would probably draw up an impeachment article. But I mean, I'm looking at this on the screen, Juan. Is this the Mideast or is this midtown? This is just right across the street from Fox. This is in the Diamond district. I got my engagement ring right there. I hope my jeweler is OK. But I hope everyone is OK. This is -- this did not look, to me -- they are calling it a firework. That looked like a commercial grade. That was not a little MAD right there. And it was premeditated. These aren't people getting carried away at a bar. This is a textbook hate crime. This was people getting into a truck and driving to the Diamond district with the intention of causing violence. And if you adjust for population, anti-Semitism in America is the biggest hate crime. Jews make up just a smidgen of the U.S. population, yet they are more targeted for hate crimes than any other group, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians. And the media doesn't talk about it. The media looks at video of Black Americans attacking Asian-Americans. They don't talk about that either, but if you are going to cover crimes, you have to treat them fairly. You don't have to wait and see the race or ethnicity of the perp or the victim. You just have to call balls and strikes. And it makes people very angry that hate crimes in this country are suppressed in order to protect a political group. And that's what's happening here. I think everybody needs to chill. We don't want this country to look like Gaza. We don't want factions attacking each other in the streets. I can't even believe I'm seeing this. And this is right outside of where we are broadcasting right now. It makes me sick.",

And that's obviously what we want to see. We want de-escalation, you know, we want a ceasefire, we want people to be safe. We want them to thrive. And Hamas is not the Palestinian people. We have two separate events. Jewish people in America, you are right, Juan. They are not the Israeli government. There is no rationality for this type of violence. And you are seeing it in New York, where there is a concentration of Jewish offenders on 47th street, and the Diamond district. And they were a magnet yesterday for violence. One man said that he was standing there, speaking in Hebrew, and a man came up, was listening to them, ran up into the crowd, came back, with 10 guys that surrounded them, and attacked them. You know, one guy has the flag of Israel torn out of his hands. He turned around to grab it back from the guy, he got punched in the stomach. twenty- six people were arrested yesterday. We were in the studio right upstairs where I broadcast my Fox Business show. And as we were getting ready for the show, we could see people running around. People were terrified. Because you don't know if that's an MAD, you don't know if it's an explosive. You don't know if it's a gun. And it's -- you don't know how much more it's going to escalate. We cannot live like this.

It's more virulent than ever before inside the United States, and it's spreading like wildfire. There was this Pew survey, they do these periodically, it came out a few days ago -- that found three quarters of American Jews think there's more anti-Semitism in the United States today than five years ago, and more than half of American Jews, 53 percent, say that as a Jewish person in the United States, they feel personally less safe now than they did five years ago. This speaks to the timeline here. This is not a new problem. This is the first time we are maybe seeing anti-Semitic violence erupted in broad daylight in the middle of Times Square for a long time, but this problem has been bubbling and simmering and now exploding. It's taken a long time to get here. I also want to say that I think doling out blame to one or the other political parties in this country does a disservice to the underlying issue, which is anti-Semitism. I don't think you can pin this squarely on the squad, though their rhetoric isn't helpful. This started a long time before Ilhan Omar or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were in Congress. It's going to continue on. It's a stain on the country frankly.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, I'll get to that in just the second. First, I want to say, you know, we've heard that this, that the Jewish Americans are not responsible for what is going on in Israel, and that is true. But because the Palestinians both in Israel and Palestinian Americans here believe that if Jews fight back and defend themselves, that they will not be held accountable for attacking them, but rather, the Jews will be threatened and said that you need to ceasefire, you need to make sure that you act with restraint. They think now that they are going to be able to get away with this kind of violent activity, whether it's in L.A., in New York, in Florida, because there's no accountability for these violent attacks on Jews. The issue is anti-Semitism, the issue is not Israel, Israelis, or American Jews. It's anti-Semitism in general. As far as what's going to happen in the Middle East, I talked to someone who has watched the Middle East, lived there, worked there for many years, and they believe that a third intifada is coming this summer. And the reason is, if you look at the so-called ceasefire, which really is just -- was really the Israelis defending themselves against a terrorist organization in preventing civilian casualties. There are thousands of people on the Temple Mount today at Al-Aqsa Mosque and they are unfurling posters of Iranian leaders and Hamas flags on the Temple Mount. That does not bode well for the future of what's going to happen there, in terms of any time kind of peace agreement, especially when you have the Biden administration negotiating in Vienna to infuse and take off sanctions on Iran, which means they will just have more money for weapons. The Palestinians and the Hamas factions in the Middle East, and other factions as well, quite frankly, have no interest in peace for Israel. And one last thing. There is a civil war brewing in the West Bank between the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas. Hamas is upset. The elections were cancelled for President Mahmoud Abbas. They wanted to win those elections to take over the West Bank. So, Israel will then be used as a scapegoat in the middle for those two factions of terrorism to fight each other for credibility and power in the Middle East. So, I don't see this going anywhere soon in terms of the Middle East. And also, what's happening and in the United States, and Jewish Americans being attacked by Palestinian protesters.",

It's five o'clock in New York City, and this is The Five. The fighting has paused in the Middle East, but things are getting pretty heated here at home. A disturbing wave of hate aimed at Jewish-Americans like this next scene in New York City where pro-Palestinian protesters clashed with pro-Israeli activists. And in Los Angeles, an SUV with a Palestinian flag was caught on camera chasing down a Jewish man. The victim says he thought he was going to die and the perpetrators were yelling Allahu Akbar.

Because if this were the other way around, and Trump said something, and someone did something like this, they would probably draw up an impeachment article. But I mean, I'm looking at this on the screen, Juan. Is this the Mideast or is this midtown? This is just right across the street from Fox. This is in the Diamond district. I got my engagement ring right there. I hope my jeweler is OK. But I hope everyone is OK. This is -- this did not look, to me -- they are calling it a firework. That looked like a commercial grade. That was not a little MAD right there. And it was premeditated. These aren't people getting carried away at a bar. This is a textbook hate crime. This was people getting into a truck and driving to the Diamond district with the intention of causing violence. And if you adjust for population, anti-Semitism in America is the biggest hate crime. Jews make up just a smidgen of the U.S. population, yet they are more targeted for hate crimes than any other group, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians. And the media doesn't talk about it. The media looks at video of Black Americans attacking Asian-Americans. They don't talk about that either, but if you are going to cover crimes, you have to treat them fairly. You don't have to wait and see the race or ethnicity of the perp or the victim. You just have to call balls and strikes. And it makes people very angry that hate crimes in this country are suppressed in order to protect a political group. And that's what's happening here. I think everybody needs to chill. We don't want this country to look like Gaza. We don't want factions attacking each other in the streets. I can't even believe I'm seeing this. And this is right outside of where we are broadcasting right now. It makes me sick."

I thought the Abraham Accords were really, really good place to start, and any time your focal point is economic prosperity and cooperation, you are going to end in a much better place. And that's obviously what we want to see. We want de-escalation, you know, we want a ceasefire, we want people to be safe. We want them to thrive. And Hamas is not the Palestinian people. We have two separate events. Jewish people in America, you are right, Juan. They are not the Israeli government. There is no rationality for this type of violence. And you are seeing it in New York, where there is a concentration of Jewish offenders on 47th street, and the Diamond district. And they were a magnet yesterday for violence. One man said that he was standing there, speaking in Hebrew, and a man came up, was listening to them, ran up into the crowd, came back, with 10 guys that surrounded them, and attacked them. You know, one guy has the flag of Israel torn out of his hands. He turned around to grab it back from the guy, he got punched in the stomach. twenty- six people were arrested yesterday. We were in the studio right upstairs where I broadcast my Fox Business show. And as we were getting ready for the show, we could see people running around. People were terrified. Because you don't know if that's an MAD, you don't know if it's an explosive. You don't know if it's a gun. And it's -- you don't know how much more it's going to escalate. We cannot live like this. It has to get better. And yes, some of those anti-Semitic lawmakers they really have to tone it down."

It's more virulent than ever before inside the United States, and it's spreading like wildfire. There was this Pew survey, they do these periodically, it came out a few days ago -- that found three quarters of American Jews think there's more anti-Semitism in the United States today than five years ago, and more than half of American Jews, 53 percent, say that as a Jewish person in the United States, they feel personally less safe now than they did five years ago. This speaks to the timeline here. This is not a new problem. This is the first time we are maybe seeing anti-Semitic violence erupted in broad daylight in the middle of Times Square for a long time, but this problem has been bubbling and simmering and now exploding. It's taken a long time to get here. I also want to say that I think doling out blame to one or the other political parties in this country does a disservice to the underlying issue, which is anti-Semitism. I don't think you can pin this squarely on the squad, though their rhetoric isn't helpful. This started a long time before Ilhan Omar or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were in Congress. It's going to continue on. It's a stain on the country frankly."

      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, I'll get to that in just the second. First, I want to say, you know, we've heard that this, that the Jewish Americans are not responsible for what is going on in Israel, and that is true. But because the Palestinians both in Israel and Palestinian Americans here believe that if Jews fight back and defend themselves, that they will not be held accountable for attacking them, but rather, the Jews will be threatened and said that you need to ceasefire, you need to make sure that you act with restraint. They think now that they are going to be able to get away with this kind of violent activity, whether it's in L.A., in New York, in Florida, because there's no accountability for these violent attacks on Jews. The issue is anti-Semitism, the issue is not Israel, Israelis, or American Jews. It's anti-Semitism in general. As far as what's going to happen in the Middle East, I talked to someone who has watched the Middle East, lived there, worked there for many years, and they believe that a third intifada is coming this summer. And the reason is, if you look at the so-called ceasefire, which really is just -- was really the Israelis defending themselves against a terrorist organization in preventing civilian casualties. There are thousands of people on the Temple Mount today at Al-Aqsa Mosque and they are unfurling posters of Iranian leaders and Hamas flags on the Temple Mount. That does not bode well for the future of what's going to happen there, in terms of any time kind of peace agreement, especially when you have the Biden administration negotiating in Vienna to infuse and take off sanctions on Iran, which means they will just have more money for weapons. The Palestinians and the Hamas factions in the Middle East, and other factions as well, quite frankly, have no interest in peace for Israel. And one last thing. There is a civil war brewing in the West Bank between the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas. Hamas is upset. The elections were cancelled for President Mahmoud Abbas. They wanted to win those elections to take over the West Bank. So, Israel will then be used as a scapegoat in the middle for those two factions of terrorism to fight each other for credibility and power in the Middle East. So, I don't see this going anywhere soon in terms of the Middle East. And also, what's happening and in the United States, and Jewish Americans being attacked by Palestinian protesters."

I would say conservatively, 10 percent have natural immunity after having contracted the virus. So they are well above herd immunity in the House, so either she doesn't understand science, she doesn't understand math, she know something about the vaccine she's not telling people, she doesn't trust the vaccine, or she just is so petty and hates Republicans so much that she'll do whatever she can to engage in these childish games. You know what, how about fix immigration? How about do something so kids don't end up in DHS facilities unaccompanied?

Now let me say, I am not going to be hypocritical about this. I think that all cable networks, all newspapers, all radio stations, web sites, they should have a bright line right at the door that says if you are hosting a show, you shouldn't be advising politicians. You shouldn't be on stage at a rally with a politician. You shouldn't be in advertisements for politicians. You know, these are things that erode public trust in us as people in the media, left-wing or right-wing. So, it's got to be said.

Would that as a female producer or executive, would that make you feel uncomfortable if you saw Chris Cuomo in the hallway?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MONTGOMERY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I'd be uncomfortable if I saw him. I would be uncomfortable if I work on his team. And apparently, within CNN, there is a lot of displeasure with Chris Cuomo right now, because if he was part of that strategy, if he was in any way the author of that strategy, that strategy was horrendous. It was insensitive, and incredibly misogynistic. And that's why, you know, some feminist groups like Ultraviolet have taken issue with the governor's response to some of his sexual harassment victims. His response has been so egregious and outdated. It's awful. So, if Chris Cuomo was a part of that, he's got very, very deep problems. And women at CNN should absolutely be concerned about that."

They could make a phone call to each other and talk about all of his problems directly together. He's clearly on these phone calls to advise his brother about the media strategy surrounding how he's going to handle these sexual harassment allegations. And Kennedy is right. I mean, the way that they handled these things, they essentially said that he kisses people all the time, that the women making these allegations are crazy, that he wasn't going to resign. And so, unless Chris Cuomo has some other skill set in terms of knowing how to manage allegations of sexual harassment or other scandals or putting people into nursing homes, and leading them to their deaths, the only clear answer here is that he was there specifically to help manage the media fall out. And for him to say that he's never influenced CNN's coverage, the fact that they don't talk about the scandals on his show is influencing their coverage of the scandals."
