We have a can't miss debate in moments. Also, last night, we brought you an investigation into over counting of those positive COVID tests in Florida. Tonight, we show you this failure isn't contained to just the sunshine state. And Raymond Arroyo will tell us what CNN's Biden versus Trump coverage yesterday actually revealed. And why Burger King is targeting cow flatulence, Seen and Unseen has answers. But first, what they're not telling you. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Last night, we exposed the lies and the fear mongering used to justify closing schools across America. We showed the best science out there on why all schools, all schools should reopen to their students preferably five days a week. The response I have to say was huge and it was bipartisan. Children must be taught in-person. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Nevertheless, Louisville, Kentucky just announced that all fall classes will be online, same with San Francisco schools. Now forget that extensive new German study showing that kids can't readily spread the virus or that schools across Europe have not seen any major spreads, those schools have been open can't let the facts get in the way of spreading panic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As far as the media's hyperventilation about rising hospital numbers. Remember, this is chiefly tied to what's happening in four states, Florida, California, Texas, and Arizona where numbers did increase after a perfect storm of reopening protests, riots, and travel from south of the border. Now by the way even in Arizona, the rolling number of confirmed cases is already lower compared to one week ago. That's good news. We hope it continues.

Now, we've heard for months that wearing face coverings even homemade ones, cloth ones is a selfless thing to do and it's even a patriotic duty, which I have to say sounds pretty cool and it even sounds like a unifying thing. The emotional argument is really wonderful. But again, what about the actual data. Now consider the following from the very medical journals and organizations that were led to believe are infallible. A 2015 study recruited health care workers from hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam and examined the benefits of cloth masks used in the health care setting and then measured flu and flu like virus transmission. Well, the results may surprise you. The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97 percent.

The results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety.

Well, what about the World Health Organization. I'm sure they recommend masks. Well, just go to the W.H.O website where they say, there is limited evidence than wearing a medical mask by healthy individuals and households, in particular, those who share a house with a sick person or among attendees of mass gatherings may be beneficial as a measure of preventing transmission. At present, there is no direct evidence on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Now, Fauci recently explained his mask flip. He's now in favor of them, saying those comments initially were motivated by his concern for saving masks for health care workers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Facebook, by the way, I found this out today now flags the old interview with Fauci as false information, but he sure seemed convincing. But that's not all, an April study published in nature seemed consistent with the old Fauci as well. It measured and compared viral shedding in the coughing of 111 participants, some wearing masks, some not. The results among the samples collected without a face mask, we found that the majority of participants with influenza virus and Coronavirus infection did not shed detectable virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols. For those who did shed virus and respiratory droplets and aerosols, viral load in both tended to be low. Wait, what. The majority of confirmed Coronavirus infections without a face mask didn't shed detectable virus and respiratory droplets or aerosols. And for those who actually did the minority, there was very little virus present. OK, wait, it gets better. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The major limitation of our study was the large proportion of participants with undetectable viral shedding and exhaled breath for each of the viruses studied. We could have increased the sampling duration beyond 30 minutes to increase the viral shedding being captured. But apparently people didn't want to do that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, again, let me just explain this, over the space of 30 minutes, they were unable to capture any viral shedding in a large proportion of participants with confirmed known infections. Again, what? Indeed, they go on to explain that perhaps forced coughing, forced coughing might have helped. Forced coughing? So, the issue, as is explained in this study, is that non-coughing or sneezing people are by and large not shedding virus in their ordinary breath. If they're coughing, well, of course, that's a different story of course, someone who is actively sick as well, they're actively sick, but especially now many Coronavirus infections are not symptomatic for cough. And among those actively sick, but not coughing, they had great difficulty in this study finding virus expelled under lab conditions and lab conditions has extremely sensitive equipment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Again, these are people who are actively sick and had a fever. So, much for the theory of asymptomatic shedding of infectious virus out of one's mouth or nose. By the way, the entire premise on which the mask mandates are predicated. Do you see or smell or hear a problem here? There's conflicting information, scientific findings on mask use and masks on kids? Well, it's hard to see how any of that should be the new normal given reported low levels of infectivity and infectiousness of children. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Again, I'm not discouraging anyone from wearing a mask. But the world is full of experts who got big issues wrong, isn't it? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Before Americans are forced to accept new restrictions on their freedoms or even be shamed or even beaten up for not complying with these mandates, shouldn't state legislators hold hearings and discuss the findings that I just brought you tonight? Then they should pass actual laws about masks, social distancing. All of it that can withstand judicial scrutiny. We must insist on all of this demand to see all of the science behind the lockdown, social distancing, and the masks. Otherwise, don't be surprised, if you lose your pre-COVID way of life for the rest of your life. And that's the Angle. Joining me now is my medicine cabinet, Dr. Scott Jensen, physician and Minnesota state senator and Dr. Ramin Oskoui, Cardiologist and CEO of Foxhall Cardiology. Dr. Oskoui, that same April study I just mentioned showed very little viral shedding in COVID coughs. It did go on somehow to conclude that our results indicated that surgical face mask could prevent transmission of Coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals. So, this can be confusing if you actually don't read the whole science and study. So, what does this actually mean? Are the mask mandates really slowing the spread? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It's simple. Does your chain linked fence stop a mosquito? It doesn't. That's I think the fundamental problem. And there is good randomized controlled data that suggests that the masks outside a strict medical setting simply don't slow transmission for viruses like Coronavirus.",

A lot of the tests, as you alluded to in the open, like Florida, lots of other states are reporting positives only and not negatives. A lot of employment-based testing, they come in, test everyone. The positives have to be reported to the state, the negatives, no one pops negative, they don't report it. So the data is a big mess.

RAHEEM KASSAM, CO-HOST \"WAR ROOM: PANDEMIC\" PODCAST: Look, I think one of the things we have to remember here and dispose of the idea is that George Soros is some philanthropist who just wants to do good in the world. He's not. He's an activist and he doesn't particularly care about minorities or migrants. He showed that in 1992 when he bankrupted minority families and migrant families like my own when he shorted the pound to enrich himself, and he is showing it now again. What he cares about is getting Democrats elected, and he's willing to throw money at whatever causes allow that to happen. And these causes that he's looking at right now are effectively tied to Democrats. They're inextricably linked. You look at who Black Votes Matter, for instance, is one of these groups on the receiving end of all this money. They are intrinsically linked with the Netroots Nation, this hard left, progressive conference that goes on every year to push further and further to the political left. These aren't the kind of arms-length NGOs without partisan agendas that Soros and the mainstream media would have you believe. You have to look beneath the surface. You have to look at their charitable status and what their charity rankings are. And frankly, these are just political organizations we are seeing Soros giving to. Again, they have been there from the beginning, saying for themselves we exist to get rid of President Trump. That is what they're saying in their own words. Now Soros again, arguing under the guise of philanthropy, is trying to get Donald Trump unelected using these groups.",

We have a can't miss debate in moments. Also, last night, we brought you an investigation into over counting of those positive COVID tests in Florida. Tonight, we show you this failure isn't contained to just the sunshine state. And Raymond Arroyo will tell us what CNN's Biden versus Trump coverage yesterday actually revealed. And why Burger King is targeting cow flatulence, Seen and Unseen has answers. But first, what they're not telling you. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Last night, we exposed the lies and the fear mongering used to justify closing schools across America. We showed the best science out there on why all schools, all schools should reopen to their students preferably five days a week. The response I have to say was huge and it was bipartisan. Children must be taught in-person. Nevertheless, Louisville, Kentucky just announced that all fall classes will be online, same with San Francisco schools. Now forget that extensive new German study showing that kids can't readily spread the virus or that schools across Europe have not seen any major spreads, those schools have been open can't let the facts get in the way of spreading panic. As far as the media's hyperventilation about rising hospital numbers. Remember, this is chiefly tied to what's happening in four states, Florida, California, Texas, and Arizona where numbers did increase after a perfect storm of reopening protests, riots, and travel from south of the border. Now by the way even in Arizona, the rolling number of confirmed cases is already lower compared to one week ago. That's good news. We hope it continues.

Now, we've heard for months that wearing face coverings even homemade ones, cloth ones is a selfless thing to do and it's even a patriotic duty, which I have to say sounds pretty cool and it even sounds like a unifying thing. The emotional argument is really wonderful. But again, what about the actual data. Now consider the following from the very medical journals and organizations that were led to believe are infallible. A 2015 study recruited health care workers from hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam and examined the benefits of cloth masks used in the health care setting and then measured flu and flu like virus transmission. Well, the results may surprise you. The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97 percent. And medical masks, 44 percent. Now, this was a randomized controlled trial of more than 1600 health care workers and had this stunning conclusion. The results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. OK. Well, what about the World Health Organization. I'm sure they recommend masks. Well, just go to the W.H.O website where they say, there is limited evidence than wearing a medical mask by healthy individuals and households, in particular, those who share a house with a sick person or among attendees of mass gatherings may be beneficial as a measure of preventing transmission. At present, there is no direct evidence on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19."

      "speaker": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "There's no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you're in the middle of an outbreak wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better. And it might even block a droplet. But it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, Fauci recently explained his mask flip. He's now in favor of them, saying those comments initially were motivated by his concern for saving masks for health care workers. Facebook, by the way, I found this out today now flags the old interview with Fauci as false information, but he sure seemed convincing. But that's not all, an April study published in nature seemed consistent with the old Fauci as well. It measured and compared viral shedding in the coughing of 111 participants, some wearing masks, some not. The results among the samples collected without a face mask, we found that the majority of participants with influenza virus and Coronavirus infection did not shed detectable virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols. For those who did shed virus and respiratory droplets and aerosols, viral load in both tended to be low. Wait, what. The majority of confirmed Coronavirus infections without a face mask didn't shed detectable virus and respiratory droplets or aerosols. And for those who actually did the minority, there was very little virus present. OK, wait, it gets better. The major limitation of our study was the large proportion of participants with undetectable viral shedding and exhaled breath for each of the viruses studied. We could have increased the sampling duration beyond 30 minutes to increase the viral shedding being captured. But apparently people didn't want to do that. So, again, let me just explain this, over the space of 30 minutes, they were unable to capture any viral shedding in a large proportion of participants with confirmed known infections. Again, what? Indeed, they go on to explain that perhaps forced coughing, forced coughing might have helped. Forced coughing? So, the issue, as is explained in this study, is that non-coughing or sneezing people are by and large not shedding virus in their ordinary breath. If they're coughing, well, of course, that's a different story of course, someone who is actively sick as well, they're actively sick, but especially now many Coronavirus infections are not symptomatic for cough. And among those actively sick, but not coughing, they had great difficulty in this study finding virus expelled under lab conditions and lab conditions has extremely sensitive equipment. Again, these are people who are actively sick and had a fever. So, much for the theory of asymptomatic shedding of infectious virus out of one's mouth or nose. By the way, the entire premise on which the mask mandates are predicated. Do you see or smell or hear a problem here? There's conflicting information, scientific findings on mask use and masks on kids? Well, it's hard to see how any of that should be the new normal given reported low levels of infectivity and infectiousness of children. Again, I'm not discouraging anyone from wearing a mask. But the world is full of experts who got big issues wrong, isn't it? Before Americans are forced to accept new restrictions on their freedoms or even be shamed or even beaten up for not complying with these mandates, shouldn't state legislators hold hearings and discuss the findings that I just brought you tonight? Then they should pass actual laws about masks, social distancing. All of it that can withstand judicial scrutiny. We must insist on all of this demand to see all of the science behind the lockdown, social distancing, and the masks. Otherwise, don't be surprised, if you lose your pre-COVID way of life for the rest of your life. And that's the Angle. Joining me now is my medicine cabinet, Dr. Scott Jensen, physician and Minnesota state senator and Dr. Ramin Oskoui, Cardiologist and CEO of Foxhall Cardiology. Dr. Oskoui, that same April study I just mentioned showed very little viral shedding in COVID coughs. It did go on somehow to conclude that our results indicated that surgical face mask could prevent transmission of Coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals. So, this can be confusing if you actually don't read the whole science and study. So, what does this actually mean? Are the mask mandates really slowing the spread?"

      "speaker": "DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CEO, FOXHALL CARDIOLOGY",
      "utterance": "The short answer is no. There's no evidence. There's no evidence that isolation of the virus is really a major transmitter. I think it's very clear, and we've known this since February with the Crown Princess, that's oral fecal spread very much like polio or norovirus. And that's where aggressive handwashing really plays a role. You also didn't mention the CDC guidance from May 20th of this year that quotes other randomized controlled studies, some of which you referenced, that simply show that masks for influenza like illnesses simply aren't effective. It's simple. Does your chain linked fence stop a mosquito? It doesn't. That's I think the fundamental problem. And there is good randomized controlled data that suggests that the masks outside a strict medical setting simply don't slow transmission for viruses like Coronavirus."

He understood why people wanted to wear masks. But then as this went on, it's like the mask becomes a symbol of unity or patriotism, which is nice. I like all of that and maybe it has some minor effect. But what is the truth here?"

      "speaker": "DR. SCOTT JENSEN, PHYSICIAN",
      "utterance": "Honestly, I think Dr. Fauci is conflicted. He used to be quoting data that came from decades of learning and teaching in medical schools. If you mention this study from 2015, that was a study that was done when we didn't have scientists and doctors have such an agenda. Right now, we're getting a lot of garbage and people are absolutely identifying their position before they released the study, before they even do the study. I think, Dr. Fauci used to follow the science and now he's pandering."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, Dr. Oskoui, as you said the CDC's own guidance from May says that although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory confirmed influenza. So, this is influenza. And I believe I also read that the size of the droplets of the Coronavirus can be even smaller than the influenza droplets."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, in reality, Dr. Jensen, that 65 percent increase is really only 0.1 percent when measured against the 8.9 million kids in California. Again, why do you think this perpetual drumbeat of fear and panic is really the hallmark of all reporting? Almost all reporting on this COVID, what's going on here? This is frankly disturbing, beyond disturbing at this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENSEN",
      "utterance": "I think a fair amount of people in public health in this country have actually fractured the trust with the public. The public isn't buying it. This idea of a teacher saying that it's gone up 65 percent, quite frankly, I think Dr. Atlas out of Stanford came out and said, if you're under the age of 70, your case fatality rate is 0.04, which is less than half of a lot of flu epidemics. Quite honestly, we're not getting facts anymore. We are just getting opinions and we need to focus on sustainable measures. We know that if you keep your hands away from your eyes, your nose, your mouth, cover your mouth when you cough. Don't go out if you're sick. Do some physical distancing. But a lot of this stuff is just whack a mole versus actual science. And quite frankly, science has been sacrificed at the altar of panic."

They have to vote by mail, et cetera, et cetera. I want to get to the news on these vaccine trials. The ultimate success is predicated on producing antibodies. But didn't Dr. Fauci and others say that the antibody response may vanish after a few months? So, don't these things seem contradictory? Dr. Oskoui?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OSKOUI",
      "utterance": "They do. One really doesn't know whether these antibodies, how long they will last and whether they're effective. But what concerns me is none of these vaccine makers are looking at in a T-cell immunity, the T-cells very important in this viral response and our response to this virus. And I don't see any metric by which any of these vaccine makers are measuring this. And that's really the important question to ask, how long will this immunity last and what are we showing in terms of T-cell training to fight future viral infections or this viral infection? When the vaccine is given?"

Well, now, instead of being a symbol of progress and reconciliation, the museum has embraced the radical left's language of racial retribution, all to cast America as irredeemably racist and an evil country. And you, the American taxpayer, are funding it. Isn't that neat? Now, the museum now has a website dedicated to explaining the concept of whiteness and why it's the root cause of racism and oppression in America today. According to the website, the normalization of white racial identity throughout America's history has created a culture where non-white persons are seen as inferior or abnormal. And when they see whiteness, they don't just mean skin color, but also people who value things like individualism, a stable nuclear family. The scientific method, rational, linear thinking, hard work, Christianity and being polite. Of course, these are all values that most Americans, especially African Americans see as necessary for success and happiness. So, why the heck is the African American History Museum telling them otherwise? Here to debate it, Horace Cooper, Project 21, co-chair, author of How Trump is Making Black America Great Again. Also, with me is Scotty Smart, activist, and founder of the Smart Foundation. Horace, it strikes me as odd that this African American museum would scandalize things that the data has always shown help Americans, including African Americans, climb up the ladder. HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: So, you have a $500 million that's a half a billion dollars structure edifice that apparently thinks its purpose is to offer advice to cripple black America, to say to black America the very tools that black Americans, like white Americans have used to succeed and become prosperous. Hard work, tenacity, faith, the types of success skills that work to call those somehow a racial category would make David Duke proud. This is really, really sad if that's the direction this museum is trying to go."

It can appear as practices within an institution or accepted social norms, since whiteness works almost invisibly. We may not always be aware of how it manifests in our daily lives. Scotty, isn't that just making people paranoid, that somehow, they're unconsciously using racism when they're just like many people just trying to get through the day? It's pretty tough time for a lot of people right now. So how is this work?"

And I think even to have two black people myself and Horace to be against one another to have a debate on this topic is a whole matter of whiteness in itself, because he's going to sit here and try to contradict what we're talking about. So, I don't want to talk over Horace. I don't want to be disrespectful to Horace. But Horace is that token black friend, only a few white people have as well. And so, we're not here to debate or not to have a dialogue, but we have to have this conversation between - it's an uncomfortable conversation. And most people aren't willing to have and to educate blacks and whites on our different perspectives, different narratives that we have that we grow within.

But if you want some context, if you're going to have this museum, where is the part about slavery? Because today on planet Earth in Africa, dominated by black people, that is the ground zero of where slavery is.

Sadly, this turns out to be a kind of COVID misfire that isn't just confined to the sunshine state, because not long ago, Virginia was also caught double counting the number of COVID positive residents. In May, the state finally had to fess up. \"Joe Macenka, a spokesman for Virginia's COVID-19 Joint Information Command, said that repeat positive cases are counted as separate cases only if the tests occur on different days. If a Virginia resident tested Monday and Tuesday, and both are positive, that's two positives.\" What? My next guest found out something interesting going with the COVID stats in one county in Ohio, and he joins me now. Phil Kerpen has been on this better than almost anyone out there. He's president of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity. Phil, this is ridiculous, counting the same person multiple times if they keep testing positive over a two week or month period. But what is going on with what you're looking at in Ohio?"

I have a parent who they won't let out of the hospital until we get a negative test. And they keep testing and testing and testing, and it's going in the case count every time. And it's been 10 or 15 times. And then another Twitter user name Kyle Lamb who has been a really good researcher on this stuff pulled up the Ohio case file and found the exact person she was talking about who was listed as 15 cases, who was listed as someone of unknown gender in Mahoning County, age 80 plus, symptom onset May 25th, 15 cases. And it was added up into the state count as 15 cases."

But you have actually now have documented it. El Paso County in Texas has seen an explosion of new cases, Phil, and this might be one reason why. DAVID STOUT, EL PASO COUNTY COMMISSIONER FOR PRECINCT 2: It seems there still may be some confusion on the number of people that are tested. There are individuals that are tested multiple times, especially if they get a positive test, from what I understand. You're not counting somebody twice, are you?"

      "speaker": "KERPEN",
      "utterance": "I think that that number might have been small a couple of months ago when we had a severe testing shortage. We now we have a severe testing surplus. They're tests everywhere. We have this huge discontinuity in the data around June 10th where you can just see the number of positives and the number of tests takeoff everywhere in the country. And states were told to do this. The panic purveyors said you have to test everyone, mass testing is the greatest. Then we start seeing these huge numbers of tests, including huge numbers of positives. Then it's oh, my God, panic, shut everything down again based on those numbers. But a lot of the tests are repeat tests. A lot of the tests, as you alluded to in the open, like Florida, lots of other states are reporting positives only and not negatives. A lot of employment-based testing, they come in, test everyone. The positives have to be reported to the state, the negatives, no one pops negative, they don't report it. So the data is a big mess. And it's really unfortunate because we have had a real rise in some places, much more modest than the big peak we saw a couple months ago, but it's very hard to differentiate that and understand how serious it actually is when you have this sea of bad data that we know have as a result of this hyper-testing."

      "utterance": "After getting millions from virtue signaling, corporations and celebs, the Black Lives Matter movement is about to get another massive windfall, this time from liberal megadonor George Soros' foundation Open Societies. It's injecting $220 million into the movement in order to radically change America's criminal justice system, $150 million will be doled out to the so-called racial justice group. Can't wait to see those, including those that want to end policing as we know it. That's the language he used. Joining me now is Raheem Kassam, the \"National Pulse\" editor in chief and cohost of \"The War Room Pandemic\" podcast. Raheem, you looked into these groups. Tell us what you found. RAHEEM KASSAM, CO-HOST \"WAR ROOM: PANDEMIC\" PODCAST: Look, I think one of the things we have to remember here and dispose of the idea is that George Soros is some philanthropist who just wants to do good in the world. He's not. He's an activist and he doesn't particularly care about minorities or migrants. He showed that in 1992 when he bankrupted minority families and migrant families like my own when he shorted the pound to enrich himself, and he is showing it now again. What he cares about is getting Democrats elected, and he's willing to throw money at whatever causes allow that to happen. And these causes that he's looking at right now are effectively tied to Democrats. They're inextricably linked. You look at who Black Votes Matter, for instance, is one of these groups on the receiving end of all this money. They are intrinsically linked with the Netroots Nation, this hard left, progressive conference that goes on every year to push further and further to the political left. These aren't the kind of arms-length NGOs without partisan agendas that Soros and the mainstream media would have you believe. You have to look beneath the surface. You have to look at their charitable status and what their charity rankings are. And frankly, these are just political organizations we are seeing Soros giving to. Again, they have been there from the beginning, saying for themselves we exist to get rid of President Trump. That is what they're saying in their own words. Now Soros again, arguing under the guise of philanthropy, is trying to get Donald Trump unelected using these groups."

We actually went to Soros' hedge fund yesterday and asked them the question, how many ethnic minorities, how many blacks have you had, African-Americans have you had at the top of your organization as managing directors in that Soros hedge fund? The answer is none, of course, we checked it out. But they won't respond to the question. The truth is it's only of use to him to help out with these issues when it helps him push his bargain-basement pseudo Karl Popper philosophy. He doesn't actually care about these issues. As far as I'm concerned, Laura, he's wearing political blackface. But the left loves that. You look at Governor Northam, you look at Justin Trudeau. This is the new Democrat policy, the same as the old."
