The long knives are out, as Brit Hume said. As you take a look at the RCP average of recent polls, nationally in Nevada and South Carolina, the two next contests, you can see Bloomberg climbing up nationally, but not really even in the picture Nevada and South Carolina. He's not in the game there. For ad spending, he is in the game. Almost $320 million spent so far by Michael Bloomberg. Tom Steyer, $137 million. Next, $18.6 million by Bernie Sanders. And you see the rest on campaign spending. Let's bring in our panel, Chris Stirewalt is politics editor here at FOX News, A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" Chris, we knew that Mike Bloomberg was going to have his time in the barrel.

So maybe it's good to inoculate yourself. The big question I have is, does somebody out there have a doggone poll that they are going to put out tomorrow that could get Bloomberg on the stage?
