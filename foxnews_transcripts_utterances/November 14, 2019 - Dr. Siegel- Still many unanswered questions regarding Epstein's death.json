      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” You can see from the screen, the President is about to rally his supporters night in Bossier, Louisiana. That's right across the river from Shreveport. Given what's going on in Washington right now, a city in the grip of slobbering hysteria, it's likely the President will have newsworthy things to say this evening, and of course, we'll be monitoring what he says and we'll go there when he does. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In the meantime, though, the fallout continues from the very first day -- the full day -- of impeachment hearings. What exactly have we learned? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, that really depends on who you are. If you're, for example, mid- level nonprofit executive from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, someone who announces your pronouns to strangers and regularly writes fervid letters to \"The New Yorker,\" your preconceptions likely were confirmed by what you saw. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You hated Donald Trump when you woke up yesterday morning, and you hated him slightly more when you went to bed last night after watching 11 straight hours of CNN. But if you were anyone else in America, a normal person, someone with kids and a job and a marriage you care about, the hearings likely had no effect at all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You keep hearing distant rumblings about Ukraine and ambassadors and transcripts of phone calls, but you're not quite sure what it adds up to, you suspect, it is mostly politics. The people who run things hate Trump obsessively, they always have, you know that, they're not hiding it, and maybe they have good reasons for that. Maybe they don't have good reasons for that. But there's an election just a year from now and you can decide that. For now, you wish the buffoons on television would stop yapping about Trump 24/7 and talk about something that maybe is relevant to your life. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But they won't stop.

Partisans on television like that guy, say things like this not to convince you, that's not going to work. They say things like that to reassure themselves that their ruse is working. And on some level, they know that you don't believe them, which is why they double the volume. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the adults in the conversation and by the way, there are some know the score. According to a CNN report this afternoon, top Democrats secretly admit to one another, this isn't working, they're not going to get Trump through impeachment hearings. They are not convincing voters the President should be removed a year before the election. It has nothing to do with getting that done. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They're impeaching Trump for the benefit of the true believers who watch MSNBC in primetime who think Chuck Todd is like a newsman. This is all a sham. It's a variety show staged for the benefit of the party's donors and its activists. It's not actually going to move votes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And by the way, the sober Democrats -- and there are some -- there's a lot at stake here. Not everyone is a buffoon, there are some smart people in this game, and the smart ones know that. They also know that in the end, impeachment could very well wind up hurting them, hurting the Democratic Party, just like it hurt the Republican Party in 1998 when they impeached Bill Clinton, for much clear reasons than they are impeaching Donald Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So in fact, it likely will hurt the Democrats and that's starting to dawn on them now and that realization is having an interesting effect. It always does. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At the moment you realize you're not convincing anyone, the moment you get that your propaganda is impotent, you change and in this case, the establishment is basically doing less and less to conceal what they're really up to. Here's one example. Early this morning, Bloomberg News, named after the guy who is running for President, by the way, published this tweet summarizing the first day of hearings. Keep in mind, Bloomberg News is a news operation and we're quoting, \"The first public impeachment hearings against Donald Trump laid out how a handful of loyalists led by Rudy Giuliani wrested control of U.S. policy from seasoned diplomats.\" Wrested control of U.S. policy from seasoned diplomats, presumably in whose hands it should remain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Consider that for a minute, by the way, that's the underlying assumption of all the dumb people. Chuck Todd believes that as a matter of faith, but is there a clearer inversion of the Constitution of the United States? Hard to think of one. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Diplomats don't control foreign policy, they carry it out. Who controls foreign policy? Well, voters do. They control their country, in fact, through their elected officials, so it doesn't matter if every single bureaucrat in the State Department disagreed with the President's policy on Ukraine or whatever, Russia or Burkina Faso -- fill in the blank. It doesn't matter. Their job is not to make policy, it is to affect it. It's to carry it out. They work for the President. All presidents -- Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Obama, Trump -- it doesn't matter, whoever is elected next. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } When Chelsea Clinton becomes President, they'll take orders from her. Good. They take orders from the elected person because that person was elected and they weren't. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The President is the only person with power in the Executive Branch - that how democracies work. And that's why in Washington, almost nobody still supports democracy. Buck Sexton is host of \"The Buck Sexton Show,\" and he joins us tonight. What do you make of it? It's like my favorite tweet ever on the internet, says Bloomberg News. The problem here is that Trump and his minions were trying to wrest control of policy from the diplomats. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } BUCK SEXTON, HOST, \"THE BUCK SEXTON SHOW\": Well, I think it shows us what we've known all along, which is that this isn't about getting to facts. This isn't about really even gathering evidence, it's about pushing a narrative and it's a narrative that reminds everybody that the Democratic Party obviously wants to do anything to impeach this President and get rid of Trump. It's a narrative that the crime that he committed or the wrong that he did, if it were serious, Tucker, they wouldn't change what it was every week. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I mean, I don't know, next week, you know, now they're saying bribery, extortion. For a while, it was campaign finance if you were in the very early days. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But if it goes to the Senate, I think Mitch McConnell could wreak a lot of havoc on the Democratic 2020 presidential campaigns. He could make it go as long as he wants to. I don't think there will be a dismissal vote. I talked with Senate offices today, there's not enough of them. There are swing state Republicans up in 2020. They're not going to vote for a quick dismissal, and they're not going to have a two-week trial. So Mitch McConnell might as well stretch it all the way into February 3rd for the Iowa caucuses, get all of the senators off the campaign trail, bring them back to D.C., blow up their campaign schedules, blow up their campaign fundraising, wreak havoc on them.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” You can see from the screen, the President is about to rally his supporters night in Bossier, Louisiana. That's right across the river from Shreveport. Given what's going on in Washington right now, a city in the grip of slobbering hysteria, it's likely the President will have newsworthy things to say this evening, and of course, we'll be monitoring what he says and we'll go there when he does. In the meantime, though, the fallout continues from the very first day -- the full day -- of impeachment hearings. What exactly have we learned? Well, that really depends on who you are. If you're, for example, mid- level nonprofit executive from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, someone who announces your pronouns to strangers and regularly writes fervid letters to \"The New Yorker,\" your preconceptions likely were confirmed by what you saw. You hated Donald Trump when you woke up yesterday morning, and you hated him slightly more when you went to bed last night after watching 11 straight hours of CNN. But if you were anyone else in America, a normal person, someone with kids and a job and a marriage you care about, the hearings likely had no effect at all. You keep hearing distant rumblings about Ukraine and ambassadors and transcripts of phone calls, but you're not quite sure what it adds up to, you suspect, it is mostly politics. The people who run things hate Trump obsessively, they always have, you know that, they're not hiding it, and maybe they have good reasons for that. Maybe they don't have good reasons for that. But there's an election just a year from now and you can decide that. For now, you wish the buffoons on television would stop yapping about Trump 24/7 and talk about something that maybe is relevant to your life. But they won't stop. They're single mindedly focused on despising Trump. It's weird and it's unhealthy."

      "utterance": "Just not accepting facts that are facts. Pretty funny. But it's not actually real. Partisans on television like that guy, say things like this not to convince you, that's not going to work. They say things like that to reassure themselves that their ruse is working. And on some level, they know that you don't believe them, which is why they double the volume. But the adults in the conversation and by the way, there are some know the score. According to a CNN report this afternoon, top Democrats secretly admit to one another, this isn't working, they're not going to get Trump through impeachment hearings. They are not convincing voters the President should be removed a year before the election. It has nothing to do with getting that done. They're impeaching Trump for the benefit of the true believers who watch MSNBC in primetime who think Chuck Todd is like a newsman. This is all a sham. It's a variety show staged for the benefit of the party's donors and its activists. It's not actually going to move votes. And by the way, the sober Democrats -- and there are some -- there's a lot at stake here. Not everyone is a buffoon, there are some smart people in this game, and the smart ones know that. They also know that in the end, impeachment could very well wind up hurting them, hurting the Democratic Party, just like it hurt the Republican Party in 1998 when they impeached Bill Clinton, for much clear reasons than they are impeaching Donald Trump. So in fact, it likely will hurt the Democrats and that's starting to dawn on them now and that realization is having an interesting effect. It always does. At the moment you realize you're not convincing anyone, the moment you get that your propaganda is impotent, you change and in this case, the establishment is basically doing less and less to conceal what they're really up to. Here's one example. Early this morning, Bloomberg News, named after the guy who is running for President, by the way, published this tweet summarizing the first day of hearings. Keep in mind, Bloomberg News is a news operation and we're quoting, \"The first public impeachment hearings against Donald Trump laid out how a handful of loyalists led by Rudy Giuliani wrested control of U.S. policy from seasoned diplomats.\" Wrested control of U.S. policy from seasoned diplomats, presumably in whose hands it should remain. Consider that for a minute, by the way, that's the underlying assumption of all the dumb people. Chuck Todd believes that as a matter of faith, but is there a clearer inversion of the Constitution of the United States? Hard to think of one. Diplomats don't control foreign policy, they carry it out. Who controls foreign policy? Well, voters do. They control their country, in fact, through their elected officials, so it doesn't matter if every single bureaucrat in the State Department disagreed with the President's policy on Ukraine or whatever, Russia or Burkina Faso -- fill in the blank. It doesn't matter. Their job is not to make policy, it is to affect it. It's to carry it out. They work for the President. All presidents -- Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Obama, Trump -- it doesn't matter, whoever is elected next. When Chelsea Clinton becomes President, they'll take orders from her. Good. They take orders from the elected person because that person was elected and they weren't. The President is the only person with power in the Executive Branch - that how democracies work. And that's why in Washington, almost nobody still supports democracy. Buck Sexton is host of \"The Buck Sexton Show,\" and he joins us tonight. What do you make of it? It's like my favorite tweet ever on the internet, says Bloomberg News. The problem here is that Trump and his minions were trying to wrest control of policy from the diplomats. BUCK SEXTON, HOST, \"THE BUCK SEXTON SHOW\": Well, I think it shows us what we've known all along, which is that this isn't about getting to facts. This isn't about really even gathering evidence, it's about pushing a narrative and it's a narrative that reminds everybody that the Democratic Party obviously wants to do anything to impeach this President and get rid of Trump. It's a narrative that the crime that he committed or the wrong that he did, if it were serious, Tucker, they wouldn't change what it was every week. I mean, I don't know, next week, you know, now they're saying bribery, extortion. For a while, it was campaign finance if you were in the very early days."

It's just -- it's utterly absurd, but that's supposed to matter. By the way, one rule, one lesson through all of this has to be anytime the media tells you that a public official is beyond reproach, everyone at home should be very skeptical whether it's Mueller or Weissmann, or Comey or Brennan -- go down the list, these are all the best of the best, the smartest we've ever seen and when they come out, they say insane things on TV.

So if the House impeaches Trump, his trial will be held in the Republican- controlled Senate, and that means Mitch McConnell could reschedule proceedings to cause maximum discomfort to the opposing party and given the schedule of the primaries this winter, it could actually sting and might possibly affect the outcome of those races.

Again, after yesterday's hearing, it was more festivities came early in airing of grievances from those self-important bureaucrats. But if there is an impeachment vote, I'm not convinced of that, Tucker. I'm not sure if there's more of what we saw yesterday that the Democrats will actually have the votes. But if it goes to the Senate, I think Mitch McConnell could wreak a lot of havoc on the Democratic 2020 presidential campaigns. He could make it go as long as he wants to. I don't think there will be a dismissal vote. I talked with Senate offices today, there's not enough of them. There are swing state Republicans up in 2020. They're not going to vote for a quick dismissal, and they're not going to have a two-week trial. So Mitch McConnell might as well stretch it all the way into February 3rd for the Iowa caucuses, get all of the senators off the campaign trail, bring them back to D.C., blow up their campaign schedules, blow up their campaign fundraising, wreak havoc on them. The thing that people have to understand, too, Tucker, the Senate can compel witnesses. I would love to see the Trump defense team if this goes to trial, call everyone -- Brennan, Clapper, Comey, bring in Hillary, ask Hillary about the Steele dossier, call up Schiff, bring in Schiff's witnesses that are -- the witnesses that Schiff blocked in the House, bring all of these people, swear them in, show it on national TV, but most importantly, give a fair trial of Trump and give him the due process that he has been denied for the last several years."

People in power tend to lie not because they want to, but because they can't help themselves. That's human nature. The more power people have, the bigger the temptation to misuse it. The press is supposed to be the watchdog against all of this and it worked fine for a couple of centuries, then the press decided they have more in common with certain politicians than with readers or viewers, and that sort of fell apart.

If it weren't for you, we'd be long gone. Trust me. We want to thank Fox and especially the Murdoch family for their unwavering support of this show day after day. God bless them. When we come back a lot more -- millions of people, including medical experts, and even a Member of Congress doubt the official story of Jeffrey Epstein's death. There are questions. So why is the left calling those people fascists and demanding a cover up? What is that about?

Inspector General would investigate the unusual circumstances. But now three months later, we just contacted the D.O.J. and F.B.I. and there is no investigation update and no comment. But Epstein's brother Mark is speaking out telling the \"Miami Herald\" that his brother was innocent and did not commit suicide quoting here, \"I could see if he got a life sentence, I could then see him taking himself out, but he had a bail hearing coming up.\" Mark Epstein then went on to reinvigorate the suicide-murder debate saying quote, \"Jeffrey knew a lot of stuff about a lot of people.\" The brother also says it was inappropriate for Jeffrey to have sex with 18- year-olds, but not illegal. Apparently, Mark Epstein doesn't remember his brother pleading guilty in 2008 to having sex with a minor. And if you haven't noticed, the Epstein didn't kill himself meme is showing up in unusual places like in the background of college game day at the University of Alabama, a Texas State basketball game and beer cans of a Fresno brewery. And now Arizona GOP Congressman Paul Gosar is getting in on the meme stream. Yesterday, during the live Impeachment Inquiry, Gosar sent out a series of tweets commenting about the hearing, and it wasn't long before the Twitter sphere noticed that the first letter of each tweet spelled Epstein didn't kill himself, adding a bit more fuel to the conspiracy fires, Gosar later sent another round of tweets that spelled out Area 51 -- Tucker."

Why, as Dr. Baden says, are the three fractures that occurred in the neck more much more common in the homicide, rather than a sheet hanging off of a bunk bed where you have to be contorted in a strange angle? What about the hemorrhages that Dr. Baden who observed the autopsy found in his eyes? What about the marks that were found on the neck? What does all that mean? Why did two guards fall asleep simultaneously and he is left unobserved for two hours? We're supposed to believe that. What about the video cameras being turned off miraculously? If -- and one more thing that no one has ever said on the show before, how come the person who did the autopsy and at first did not have a ruling of suicide is not the one who issued the report. Her boss issued the report and called it a suicide a few days later. What changed? What's the information here that we don't know? I want all of this information released.

But first with Joe Biden's presidential campaign appearing to be in a freefall, the superficially moderate wing of the Democratic Party has a new favorite. He is Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The most recent poll of Iowa Democrats shows Buttigieg leading by three percent in the state. So he could be the nominee, at least theoretically. So maybe it's time for us to take Pete Buttigieg seriously. Who is this guy? Well, he's running on his executive experience as the Mayor of South Bend, Indiana. What exactly does that mean? Well, as Buttigieg campaigns, his city is experiencing an epidemic of violent crime. Aggravated assaults have more than tripled compared to when he took office. He seems responsible for that.

Great article from \"Washington Free Beacon\" on this exact subject that if you're going to point to hey, look, I'm the mayor who reduce crime, well, you don't actually have the whole story there on Pete Buttigieg because these other crimes have gone up, and if he wants to take credit for a lower murder rate, it's not the whole story."

The story of Pete Buttigieg and the question you're asking is the right question which is about executive experience. Does Pete Buttigieg -- is he the guy who is a leader? Or is he a manager who took advantage of other situations and other things happening around him? The leadership question came into real question with the shooting of Eric Logan by Sergeant O'Neill who had to resign from the force. The way Pete Buttigieg handled that was abysmal and everybody knows it. Harvey Mills is the Fraternal Order of Police and he said that nobody has faith in Pete Buttigieg. What he has done to the police is horrific.
