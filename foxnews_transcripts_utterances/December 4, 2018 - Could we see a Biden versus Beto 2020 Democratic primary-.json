      "sentences": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" on a very busy news night here in Washington. This show has it all for you. We have politics, culture, startling rejection of history, but first. Breaking news, as I just said in the Mueller probe, as the documents, sentencing documents against former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn just dropped. These are heavily redacted documents revealing among other things that Flynn, a former three-star general, provided substantial assistance and gave 19 interviews, sat 19 times before the special counsel and other DOJ investigations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, as a result of Flynn's cooperation, Mueller and his team are recommending no jail time. It's important to note, the documents presented tonight do not provide specifics about what exactly Mueller has learned from Flynn, only that he provided documents and communications. Now, what issues those communications refer to tonight is anyone's guess. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, this has been a saga that has enveloped the entirety of Donald Trump's presidency, and in the process destroyed, as Sean said, this good man's life. Even if Flynn does serve no prison time, the judge agrees with the prosecutor here, imagine how his life has been thrown into complete turmoil, and for what? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Was this 18-month process good for the country? Are we better off? Did we stave off future Russian involvement in our elections because a former three-star general had to bow to the altar of Bob Mueller and the special counsel, the special counsel helpers? I think we have to go through this methodically tonight, and we are going to do this. Real questions remain and real questions must be answered as this investigation continues to move forward, although it looks like it is wrapping up. Here now, two men who have been studying this report. Former deputy independent counsel and Whitewater investigator Sol Wisenberg and former House Oversight Chair and Fox News contributor, Jason Chaffetz, and Victor Davis Hanson, is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and author of the forthcoming book, \"The Case for Trump,\" and he joins us now. Sol, let's start with you.

Like you say, the key parts of how he assisted have been redacted. What stands out the most is that a lot of people thought Mueller was going to use the sentencing memos to tell the world about his case because he is afraid that his final memo may not be publicized. He didn't do that here. In fact, he showed remarkable professionalism by keeping redacted. He could have said, here is how he helped and it could've been bombshell, and he didn't do that. So I think to me, that is the big take away.

And then more importantly, in that document there is worry that Flynn was working in a way that was unethical with the Turkish government or maybe with the Russian government, but it had no effect because when Donald Trump came in, when you look at Russian sanctions, the oil policy of the U.S., increasing production, arming the Ukraine, attacking Russians in Syria or whether it was ending the Obama romance with Erdogan and Turkey. We were much tougher on Turkey in much tougher on Russia.

      "utterance": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" on a very busy news night here in Washington. This show has it all for you. We have politics, culture, startling rejection of history, but first. Breaking news, as I just said in the Mueller probe, as the documents, sentencing documents against former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn just dropped. These are heavily redacted documents revealing among other things that Flynn, a former three-star general, provided substantial assistance and gave 19 interviews, sat 19 times before the special counsel and other DOJ investigations. Now, as a result of Flynn's cooperation, Mueller and his team are recommending no jail time. It's important to note, the documents presented tonight do not provide specifics about what exactly Mueller has learned from Flynn, only that he provided documents and communications. Now, what issues those communications refer to tonight is anyone's guess. Remember, this has been a saga that has enveloped the entirety of Donald Trump's presidency, and in the process destroyed, as Sean said, this good man's life. Even if Flynn does serve no prison time, the judge agrees with the prosecutor here, imagine how his life has been thrown into complete turmoil, and for what? Was this 18-month process good for the country? Are we better off? Did we stave off future Russian involvement in our elections because a former three-star general had to bow to the altar of Bob Mueller and the special counsel, the special counsel helpers? I think we have to go through this methodically tonight, and we are going to do this. Real questions remain and real questions must be answered as this investigation continues to move forward, although it looks like it is wrapping up. Here now, two men who have been studying this report. Former deputy independent counsel and Whitewater investigator Sol Wisenberg and former House Oversight Chair and Fox News contributor, Jason Chaffetz, and Victor Davis Hanson, is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and author of the forthcoming book, \"The Case for Trump,\" and he joins us now. Sol, let's start with you. Your thoughts after reading these documents?"

      "speaker": "SOL WISENBERG, FORMER INDEPENDENT DEPUTY COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, my thoughts are first of all, the general would have received probation no matter what. Whether he cooperated a little or cooperated a lot. Like you say, the key parts of how he assisted have been redacted. What stands out the most is that a lot of people thought Mueller was going to use the sentencing memos to tell the world about his case because he is afraid that his final memo may not be publicized. He didn't do that here. In fact, he showed remarkable professionalism by keeping redacted. He could have said, here is how he helped and it could've been bombshell, and he didn't do that. So I think to me, that is the big take away. The memo itself is kind of a dud because all the good stuff is redacted."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well Jason, here is part of the memo, ‘Given the defendant's substantial assistance and other considerations set forth below, a sentence at the low end of the guideline range including a sentence that doesn't impose a term of incarceration is appropriate and warranted.’ I guess it is the meaning of ‘substantial assistance.’"

They did not believe -- including Peter Strzok, who did the interview with Flynn. He went back to headquarters and they didn't think he lied. Those were the 1001 violations, lying reportedly about his conversation with the Russian ambassador. Whether that conversation included a conversation about referenced to easing up on the sanctions, or don't go crazy on the sanctions. In other words, we are coming in, we're going to get rid of the sanctions. And apparently, he either misremembered or wasn't forthcoming on that. It didn't go into -- well what happened before this in 2016? Were you setting up some deal to make it easier for Russia to interfere in our elections? Which, again, is what the special counsel was set up to examine, that type of collusion. Even with the redactions, when it comes to Flynn, at least, there wasn't any collusion on his part. The question is whether any of the figures associated with the Trump administration or Trump campaign that could be still as Sol alluded to, caught up in this dragnet."

    {
      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVID HANSON, THE HOOVER INSTITUTION",
      "utterance": "I think just as historian when I look for two things in these Mueller stories. One, does the Logan Act appear and it was referenced in this, and one, does the Foreign Agents Act --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "FARA."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "-- the FARA Act appear. And when that appears and tells me they really don't have anything only because we've only had two people prosecuted on the Logan Act. John Kerry all of August and September met with the Iranian foreign ambassador in Paris and he admitted that he was discussing the Iran deal which is antithetical to the efforts of the present administration. Nobody called that a Logan violation or seriously did. And we have all sorts of the swamp in Washington. Everybody is dealing with foreign agents. I mean, they are representative government so Christopher Steele was not a U.S. citizen. He was a foreign British subject and he was supplying data to the Hillary -- Clinton campaign for money. And he was seeding it throughout the government. Nobody talked about the agents there. And then more importantly, in that document there is worry that Flynn was working in a way that was unethical with the Turkish government or maybe with the Russian government, but it had no effect because when Donald Trump came in, when you look at Russian sanctions, the oil policy of the U.S., increasing production, arming the Ukraine, attacking Russians in Syria or whether it was ending the Obama romance with Erdogan and Turkey. We were much tougher on Turkey in much tougher on Russia. And finally, I mean, if you want to reduce everything, you get down to one point, all of these stories, the surveillance, the entire collusion comes back to the Steele dossier, and that was the source of the FISA warrant that was used in part at least to collate testimony with surveillance. And we know now that although they said it was a bot document, nobody ever told the FISA court judges that it was paid for by Hillary Clinton."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "Nobody ever told them that Christopher Steele, the author of that dossier had been let go as unreliable. Nobody ever told the FISA court judges that the news accounts they presented to those courts were circular and were based on the dossier itself. So that was kind of a poison tree and a lot of these people have said things in numerous testimonies not knowing that that would be collated with a surveillance, and then we get into the unmasking. And then finally -- this is a finally, 25 people in the DOJ or FBI have been reassigned, chose to be retired or were fired in association to this entire mess. Nobody is talking about it. I can't think of any time in U.S. history where the two top intelligence agencies, the head of those agencies, Jim Clapper and John Brennan, not only lied under oath to a congressional committee, admitted they lied under oath, and had entire exemptions. So, I know it's not YouTube all the time, but that is really disturbing that we have this Mueller trap and then we have all of these violations that -- so when Mueller starts to be so sanctimonious and quote the Logan Act and the Foreign Agent Registration Act and government officials got to be above the law. Well, yes, but that is not happening. So we lose public confidence."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

The reference to his military service, his exemplary public record, how common is that in a sentencing document such as this, taking that into account as a mitigating circumstance. I mean, it seems to kind of makes sense, but --"

    {
      "speaker": "WISENBERG",
      "utterance": "It is very common if you are the defense attorney doing this memo and it's common if you are the government and that client has helped you.

      "utterance": "Right. And that is often done by prosecutors and I don't know of anybody who thinks that Flynn would have pled if that wasn't out there. And we just don't know what that is. I do want to say in Mueller's defense, there is a mention of the Logan Act here but Mueller does not say in any way that Flynn violated --"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, but certainly not in there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WISENBERG",
      "utterance": "But the other thing to keep in mind -- the other thing to keep in mind is that Mueller does say -- he does not say what it is, but Mueller does say that Flynn provided important information about connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or attempts to make connections. All I'm saying is, you're right, he doesn't say Flynn did that, but he does say that Flynn provided information. So again, if there is nothing there, that may be one reason Mueller is not talking about it, or it may be that Mueller is a professional and it's just not appropriate to release that information."

We have proven instances of blatant lying to cover up how this whole thing started in the first place. Lying to federal judges -- and I say it's lying. When you don't reveal who actually started this whole ball rolling on the dossier, that is a lie. I still think that FISA judges should be a lot more angry about how this all went on from the beginning. From that spawn this entire investigation.

Bring up the FISA court judges. Have them explain how this process works. I was on the House judiciary and when we were going through hearings, they wouldn't let us even go to attend one of those meetings and they wouldn't let us even talk to those judges. But there was clearly lying, misinformation. I know the inspector general is still doing an investigation of the FISA because it's probably not until mid-next year is best I can tell. It's going to take way too long. But the bottom line here with Mr. Flynn, he didn't have the financial means to fight this."

The defendant made a second series of false statement to the DOJ concerning his contacts with the Republic of Turkey specifically on March 7th, 2017 after he was no longer in the administration. The defendant made materially false statements in multiple documents that he filed pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act pertaining to a project he and his company had performed for a principal benefit of the Republic of Turkey. And apparently the false statement was, well, it was more directed by the government of Turkey then you let on. And he wrote a piece in \"The Hill\" about that minister that the president of Turkey wanted back in Turkey. That came out March! I just find this to be -- like, this is it?

And when Trump came into office, they reversed the so-called special relationship that Obama had developed with Turkey that gave us in part the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and et cetera. So, Trump was harder on the Russians. He is harder on Turks. If you had said, Laura, 18 months ago, $30 million ago, when we were told that there was a new dream team, these were the all-stars, these were Mueller's army. All of these gushing about these wonderful Ivy League lawyers, et cetera.

Well, nationally since 2015, more than 100 confederate monuments and statues have been removed. Students, protesters, and faculty members at UNC want the same fate to befall \"Silent Sam.\" The North Carolina law be damned. Forget about it.

There is a movement particularly among the young to hate the past and eradicate anything they find objectionable or troubling. And look, every country, all history has its bad side and good sides. Good stuff, bad stuff. But this recall is a kind of destructive mind-set of let's say ISIS. Think about ISIS, what they did. They pillaged and they wiped away irreplaceable, historical, and religious monuments. From Palmyra, remember in Syria, simply because they could. It's offensive to them. Now, no matter what one thinks of the way this was all treated after the civil war, where they built these monuments or not. This happened, OK. The confederacy happened, and we owe it to the future to leave history as it existed undisturbed. Continue to debate it, have conversations about it, but why not allow future generations the opportunity to mark this history, process it, and come to their own conclusions. Put up another statue commemorating the slaves who were abused and killed adjacent to ‘Silent Sam.’ But to destroy instead of engage, to defy the law instead of respect it, is no way to honor the past or the future or to highlight all the gains America has made. Now, by committing acts of violence to get your own way, and defying laws to remove figures that you find offensive, you start to look a little bit like the thing you are protesting. Should you succeed, by the way, in the future, some other mob might well tear down your statue because they themselves find what you did offensive. So where does it all end? And you would have, you know, taught them that it's fine to destroy all trace of whatever we find objectionable in the past? Let's hope the board of UNC, North Carolina's Historical Commission has less destructive tendencies. We can hope. And that is \"The Angle.\" Joining me now, two students from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Magdalena Horsempa (ph), who is a student supporter of the \"Silent Sam\" statue on campus, and Alana Edwards, she is the president of the UNC Young Democrats, a group adamantly opposed to the statue's presence anywhere on campus. Now Alana, it seems that the first step for critics of these statues was to move them out of the public square and into historical buildings. OK, so that happened -- or that was happening. But now that's offensive. So where does this ever end? What do you propose it be done with the statue? You can't have it out on the public where it always has been, can't move into the building, so what now?"

And one thing I would like to bring up is when you look at when this monument was elected, it was 1913, the height of the Jim Crow era, and the dedication speeches espoused white supremacy. And personally, I am a proud southerner, and I had ancestors fighting on both sides of the war, and I value the lessons to be learned from the Civil War. But I see this monument as destructive, and a symbol of a different era entirely, and not of the actions of UNC student who served at that time, but when it was dedicated in 1913, the era of white supremacy. And so while there is no clear-cut solution, I do think, and state law is very restrictive, I think that it deserves a place off campus where it can be placed within the proper context of which it was erected."

These are state owned memorials, and it says very clearly, a monument, memorial, or work of art owned by the state may not be removed, relocated, or altered in any way without the approval of the North Carolina Historical Commission. They wanted to basically stop these things from disappearing in the middle of the night as we saw in places like in New Orleans, where statues have been removed never to be seen again.

In my capacity as the chairwoman of the UNC college Republicans, I have said before I do not condone any kind of mob rule or anarchist activity on campus. And for these students to feel that it was OK to take this statue down in the very beginning in August, that's absolutely not OK.

So I don't really agree with the sentiment that this isn't what student want, because I think clearly we see by the numbers gathering, by the student body president, by the 5,000 letters and emails written to the Chancellor Folt when she solicited input from the campus community, I think they are all pretty clear that students don't want Silent Sam on campus."
