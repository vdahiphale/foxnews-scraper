Just within this hour the secretary of state has released a statement saying, in part, \"Global action is required to stop a global threat. Any country that hosts North Korean guest workers, provides any economic or military benefits, or fails to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions, is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime. All nations should publicly demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences to their pursuit of nuclear weapons, and we attempt to bring North Korea's provocative actions before the U.N. Security Council and enact stronger measures to hold the DPRK accountable.\" As you take a look at where this ICBM traveled. It was a splashdown about 480 miles away, but it's believed that this missile, a two-stage missile, could reach Alaska. And that is the big question about whether North Korea has been able to miniaturize its nuclear weapons to put it on the tip of one of these missiles, and this has changed the dynamic because this ICBM could reach the United States. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, just within the past hour, also in this show, the U.S. announced that their joint exercises ongoing with the South Koreans to test what they are calling the army tactical missile system in response to this. This is ongoing. We expect to have video from the military momentarily of this U.S.-South Korean test, their anti-ballistic missile efforts. Kim Jong-un obviously celebrating what he is seeing as a major, major change in the dynamic here.

It is an ICBM that can hit U.S. territory, and that would be absolutely catastrophic. We have completely different understandings of what the threat is. And Tillerson's statement simply says it's not a U.S. problem. It's a global problem. It is not. It's a U.S. problem. The global partners that we talk about are not that interested in solving it. And that's why all the importuning and all the sanctions, all the U.N. Security Council resolutions aren't going to do a thing. This is a threat to the United States, not to Russia, not to China. And therefore, as the president has said himself, we're going to have to solve the problem ourselves if we can.",
