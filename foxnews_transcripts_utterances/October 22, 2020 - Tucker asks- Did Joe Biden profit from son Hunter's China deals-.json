      "sentences": "I want to bring you in on a FOX News Alert. Good evening. Welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Of course, the second of two presidential debates begins less than an hour from now. We thought we knew what to expect and we were wrong. A surprisingly, maybe shocking, maybe history-altering development. Just a few moments ago, we received a statement, we aired a statement from a former Naval officer called Tony Bobulinski. Bobulinski was a business partner of Hunter Biden's. That's probably a name you've never heard before today. You're going to hear a lot about this man in the coming days. So let's get a few things straight. There's no evidence -- we have no evidence as of tonight that Bobulinski is a partisan Republican in fact. In fact, all the evidence suggests otherwise. He is a registered Democrat, all of his political donations had been to Democrats. Tonight, Bobulinski announced that he met directly with Joe Biden and discussed the Biden's family business dealings with the communist government of China. He says he has text messages that corroborate that, and apparently he does.",

I have firsthand knowledge about this because I directly dealt with the Biden family, including Joe Biden. I brought, I guess, for record three phones that spanned the years 2015 through 2018. These phones have never been held by anybody else besides myself. I was introduced to Joe Biden by Jim Biden and Hunter Biden. At approximately -- and at my approximately hour-long meeting with Joe that night, we discussed the Biden's history, the Biden's family business plans with the Chinese, with which he was plainly familiar, at least at a high level. I received an e-mail concerning allocation of equity, which says 10 percent held by H for the big guy. In that e-mail, there is no question that H stands for Hunter, big guy for his father, Joe Biden. I will be providing to the F.B.I. the devices which contain the evidence corroborating what I have said.",

      "sentences": "All coming so fast, an awful lot of detail. In a written statement, Bobulinski added this by the way, \"Hunter Biden,\" he said, \" ... frequently referred to his father as quote, 'my Chairman.'\" Hunter Biden quote, \"Frequently referenced asking his father for his sign off or advice in various potential deals that we were discussing.\" That would be with the communist government of China. As of right now, 8:03 Eastern Time, the Biden campaign has not directly denied this. Now, keep in mind, this topic, amazingly, may not come up in the debate tonight. The final presidential debate traditionally centers on questions for foreign policy, but the rules have been changed. You can guess as to why. And now the announced topics, among others will be coronavirus and climate change. So none of this may be addressed directly tonight. The President, of course, is aware of that, no doubt plans to ask questions directly to the former Vice President on the stage. But the Debate Commission has thought this through and they have announced that if the President speaks out of turn, his microphone will be cut off. He will be standing there gesticulating like a mime in silence. But that won't make the questions themselves go away, and for the next week and a half, you are likely to hear them again and again and the central question in all of this is, did Joe Biden himself profit from these deals? And there's no question at this point that there were deals. Remember last week, \"The New York Post\" published an e-mail dated May 13, 2017. It was retrieved from Hunter Biden's laptop and it was his laptop. In that e-mail, an associate discusses setting aside a quote \"10 percent\" equity stake in a Chinese company. That company CEFC. That money would be reserved for someone referred to as the big guy. Now, that e-mail is real. FOX News has confirmed it is authentic, and again, no one on the Biden campaign has disputed its authenticity. In his statement, Bobulinski didn't just confirm that the May 13, 2017 e- mail is real. He also explained as, you might have already guessed that Joe Biden is in fact the big guy referenced in the document, and he would know. Bobulinski was the CEO of something called Sinohawk Holdings. So it was a partnership between CEFC and the Biden family. From the outset, Bobulinski says he knew it was a corrupt arrangement. As he put it, it was obvious that, quote, \"The Chinese were not really focused on a healthy return on investment. They were looking at this as a political or influence investment. The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities, even though some of them were controlled from Communist China.\" Now, there is more than just this man's word, though apparently he was directly involved. There's also physical evidence. In a text message dated May 20, 2017, obtained by this, Hunter Biden's business partner, James Gilliar had a warning for Bobulinski quote, \"Don't mention Joe being involved. It's only when you are face-to-face. I know you know that, but they are paranoid.\" Only mention Joe Biden when we're face-to-face? Of course, that's a mafia don's talk on the sidewalk outside the social club in Brooklyn. And there's more. Senate Homeland Security investigators are now reviewing a trove of documents Bobulinski has apparently provided. One of them, published today shows that CEFC, that's the Chinese energy company in question provided a $5 million interest free loan to the Bidens. Separately, Gilliar wrote to Hunter Biden to explain that he would receive $850,000.00 as chairman of the partnership with the Chinese company. Hunter Biden apparently didn't think it was enough. So on May 16, 2017, Hunter Biden complained to his business partners about not getting paid more, quote, \"I have to admit, I do expect that if I can't keep my toe and other things, I will need a hell of a lot more than $850,000.00 per year on a monthly basis.\" So there was a lot of money involved. Clearly. That's not really in dispute. The question is, where did the money go? Who got it? And where is it now? And how much of that money did the big guy, the man you will see on stage in less than an hour, keep for himself, if any? We don't know the answers to those questions. And as of right now, almost nobody in the legacy media is asking those questions. But we may learn soon anyway. Yesterday, we learned that the F.B.I. obtained a subpoena for Hunter Biden's laptop and hard drive. They were left famously in that repair shop in Wilmington. They got that subpoena in connection with a money laundering investigation that was underway late last year. We don't know the status of that investigation, but we have confirmed it was underway. Just hours ago, FOX News obtained an e-mail linking the Biden's business interest by the way, because you can't make this up, to Kamala Harris and other top Democrats. Here's the link. The e-mail dated May 15, 2017 was written by Jim Biden. He is, of course, the brother of the former Vice President. The subject line in the e-mail is this. \"Phase One domestic context/projects.\" The e-mail contains a list of what he calls quote, \"Key domestic contacts for Phase One target projects.\" Guess who is on the list? The vice presidential nominee, Kamala Harris. These are big stories, about five or six of them, different threads. This isn't Russian propaganda. This is real. So how is the Biden campaign responding to it? As of right now, they are still dismissing all of it as the work of Vladimir Putin. This was a Biden surrogate on FOX News today. Watch this.",

      "sentences": "Okay, so FOX News is interfering in the election by bringing you the news -- legitimate news, with eyewitnesses, with uncontested documents. The Biden campaign is claiming this is doing the bidding of a hostile foreign government in order to subvert our democracy. That's the actual claim they are making. They are saying it out loud. Now, the gambit, of course, is that through pure aggression, they can make us be quiet and make the story go away and it was working, we'll be honest with you. But it won't work now. It's not enough to kill the story. The story is too serious and now, there is too much detail. Even partisans can no longer ignore it. So what happens next? Again, there are many different parts to the story and not all of them are entirely clear, but we know much more than we did even two hours ago. And so for the latest in this, we go as we have for the last several days to Miranda Devine. She works at \"The New York Post,\" which initially broke the story of Hunter Biden's business dealings with foreign countries and his father's involvement in those. Miranda Devine joins us now. Miranda, thanks so much for coming on. This is -- I can't overstate how surprising this is. I am trying not to use word \"seismic\" but I think it's in that category right before the final debate. What do we know now that we didn't hours ago? MIRANDA DEVINE, COLUMNIST, \"THE NEW YORK POST\":  Well, our story eight days ago has just opened a Pandora's Box and it has prompted people like Tony Bobulinski to come forward and to talk to the Senate homeland Affairs Committee, and to also show the contents of those three phones that he just displayed. And on those phones are so many e-mails, WhatsApp messages, text messages between him and his partners, which were Hunter Biden and another guy called James Gilliar. Now, there is just incontrovertible evidence here that Joe Biden was involved and knew that his brother, James Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden, were operating this cash for influence scheme, with overseas companies, with Chinese companies, with Communist China to leverage millions of dollars on the Biden name. And you've done a very good job of summarizing a lot of that material. We saw Tony Bobulinski shortly, just a few minutes ago, and he is a very credible guy. He is strong. He is honest. He is a former lieutenant in the Navy. He has formerly just donated to Democrat causes. So this is not a partisan person. This is not someone you can dismiss as a Russian agent, like they have with Rudy Giuliani.",

What this shows is that he has been lying about his knowledge of his son's business, at the very least. This is no longer about Hunter Biden. It's about Joe Biden. And the Biden campaign statement that they put out tonight is very curiously paused and that tells you everything. What he says is that there is no indication that he received any money. I mean, that's what it's come down to now. So there is no evidence that we've provided yet of money going to him. But there was money, you know, in all of these documents that we've seen, and what Tony Bobulinski says, is that money was being reserved. We saw that e- mail that 10 percent of a big deal with the Chinese energy company was being reserved by Hunter for the big guy. And Bobulinski has confirmed that the big guy is Joe Biden. So there are so many questions that need to be asked. And, you know, Joe Biden could easily clear it up by coming clean and talking to us.

You know, I guess the question I have about the F.B.I. and it looks like they've had this computer for almost a year now. I would like them to clearly state, if it was acquired almost a year ago, why we just now heard about it. Is it part of an ongoing investigation into foreign business deals and money laundering? Or if they're not going to state that, we might just come to the conclusion that they were trying to memory hole it and maybe put their thumb on the scale for their boy, Joe Biden? I think what we've really come to the conclusion and had enough evidence, though, Tucker in the last few days, Joe Biden was clearly lying to the American people when he said he didn't know anything about Hunter Biden's business dealings. He was intimately acquainted, and according to some sources, actually at meetings. And so I think what we have here is Joe Biden is a corrupt liar who was compromised on China, and I think the American people deserve to know before November 3rd, specifically, how financially tied was Joe Biden or is Joe Biden to the barbaric and genocidal Communist Chinese regime? The American people deserve to know because China is one of the biggest issues here in the 2020 elections.",

Were you telling the truth then? And I don't think he can answer that. I think class is really important very quickly, Tucker, because Donald Trump can say that America -- I lost money to go in government, Joe Biden went into government to make money. And this China and the Ukraine machinations remind us of that. Donald Trump took risks. He is one with a working classes. Hundred million people are making food, fuel and stuff for us. You can't run a presidency or country from your basement anymore. You can't run a candidacy. And finally, I really think he needs to appeal in a bipartisan fashion. He has to say whether you're Republican or Democrat, red or blue, liberal or conservative, you don't have a country if you don't have a police, if you don't have a border, if the people in Washington are going to sell their souls out to foreign countries to destroy your souls. And finally, America, Joe Biden said, was an old idea. Wrong tense. Wrong now. America is a reality. It's a living reality.",

If on the other hand, he follows the advice that they are all giving them, which is let Joe Biden speak, let him get into trouble with some of the things he says and then pick it apart in a very surgical way, then I think we'll have a more interesting debate and a better debate. And conceivably, it'll turn things around. Now, the stakes could not be higher tonight. If we have a repeat of the first debate, I think there's a possibility that Joe Biden could put his race away. On the other hand -- because he is clearly leading at this point.

It will be interesting to see if the President decides that he is going to raise this issue or if the moderator doing what I think an ordinary, you know, news interested moderator would do, raises it herself, which I think would put more pressure on the former Vice President.

President Trump plans to hit the campaign trail as soon as they get done with this debate over the weekend. Whether Joe Biden will do the same, depending on how it goes is a big question. But for President Trump, I think he has to hinge on the idea that this Gallup poll that just recently came out shows that set 57 percent of Americans believe they are better off now than they were four years ago, and the President has to explain why that is and why they feel like they are better off now than they were under an Obama-Biden administration. On the issue of stability, I think it'll be really interesting to watch how Joe Biden handles these new revelations about his connections to these foreign business dealings, his son. He has been asked very few questions about this.

So he may have -- he may be the only person who raise it because he is the only person who was willing to do so, but in doing so, he has got to not do that at the expense of making the case that he didn't really fail on coronavirus. He has a better record than you think. That's a challenge in itself to make that case because so many people think otherwise. But he does have an argument there. He has also got to point to some of the things that Katie suggested resulted in people telling Gallup, the Gallup polling organization, 56 percent of them saying that they were better off than they were four years ago.

We thought we knew what to expect and we were wrong. A surprisingly, maybe shocking, maybe history-altering development. Just a few moments ago, we received a statement, we aired a statement from a former Naval officer called Tony Bobulinski. Bobulinski was a business partner of Hunter Biden's. That's probably a name you've never heard before today. You're going to hear a lot about this man in the coming days. So let's get a few things straight. There's no evidence -- we have no evidence as of tonight that Bobulinski is a partisan Republican in fact. In fact, all the evidence suggests otherwise. He is a registered Democrat, all of his political donations had been to Democrats. Tonight, Bobulinski announced that he met directly with Joe Biden and discussed the Biden's family business dealings with the communist government of China. He says he has text messages that corroborate that, and apparently he does. Here's part of the on camera statement from Tony Bobulinski just a few moments ago."

These phones have never been held by anybody else besides myself. I was introduced to Joe Biden by Jim Biden and Hunter Biden. At approximately -- and at my approximately hour-long meeting with Joe that night, we discussed the Biden's history, the Biden's family business plans with the Chinese, with which he was plainly familiar, at least at a high level. I received an e-mail concerning allocation of equity, which says 10 percent held by H for the big guy. In that e-mail, there is no question that H stands for Hunter, big guy for his father, Joe Biden.

In a written statement, Bobulinski added this by the way, \"Hunter Biden,\" he said, \" ... frequently referred to his father as quote, 'my Chairman.'\" Hunter Biden quote, \"Frequently referenced asking his father for his sign off or advice in various potential deals that we were discussing.\" That would be with the communist government of China. As of right now, 8:03 Eastern Time, the Biden campaign has not directly denied this. Now, keep in mind, this topic, amazingly, may not come up in the debate tonight. The final presidential debate traditionally centers on questions for foreign policy, but the rules have been changed. You can guess as to why. And now the announced topics, among others will be coronavirus and climate change. So none of this may be addressed directly tonight. The President, of course, is aware of that, no doubt plans to ask questions directly to the former Vice President on the stage. But the Debate Commission has thought this through and they have announced that if the President speaks out of turn, his microphone will be cut off. He will be standing there gesticulating like a mime in silence. But that won't make the questions themselves go away, and for the next week and a half, you are likely to hear them again and again and the central question in all of this is, did Joe Biden himself profit from these deals? And there's no question at this point that there were deals. Remember last week, \"The New York Post\" published an e-mail dated May 13, 2017. It was retrieved from Hunter Biden's laptop and it was his laptop. In that e-mail, an associate discusses setting aside a quote \"10 percent\" equity stake in a Chinese company. That company CEFC. That money would be reserved for someone referred to as the big guy. Now, that e-mail is real. FOX News has confirmed it is authentic, and again, no one on the Biden campaign has disputed its authenticity. In his statement, Bobulinski didn't just confirm that the May 13, 2017 e- mail is real. He also explained as, you might have already guessed that Joe Biden is in fact the big guy referenced in the document, and he would know. Bobulinski was the CEO of something called Sinohawk Holdings. So it was a partnership between CEFC and the Biden family. From the outset, Bobulinski says he knew it was a corrupt arrangement. As he put it, it was obvious that, quote, \"The Chinese were not really focused on a healthy return on investment. They were looking at this as a political or influence investment. The Biden family aggressively leveraged the Biden family name to make millions of dollars from foreign entities, even though some of them were controlled from Communist China.\" Now, there is more than just this man's word, though apparently he was directly involved. There's also physical evidence. In a text message dated May 20, 2017, obtained by this, Hunter Biden's business partner, James Gilliar had a warning for Bobulinski quote, \"Don't mention Joe being involved. It's only when you are face-to-face. I know you know that, but they are paranoid.\" Only mention Joe Biden when we're face-to-face? Of course, that's a mafia don's talk on the sidewalk outside the social club in Brooklyn. And there's more. Senate Homeland Security investigators are now reviewing a trove of documents Bobulinski has apparently provided. One of them, published today shows that CEFC, that's the Chinese energy company in question provided a $5 million interest free loan to the Bidens. Separately, Gilliar wrote to Hunter Biden to explain that he would receive $850,000.00 as chairman of the partnership with the Chinese company. Hunter Biden apparently didn't think it was enough. So on May 16, 2017, Hunter Biden complained to his business partners about not getting paid more, quote, \"I have to admit, I do expect that if I can't keep my toe and other things, I will need a hell of a lot more than $850,000.00 per year on a monthly basis.\" So there was a lot of money involved. Clearly. That's not really in dispute. The question is, where did the money go? Who got it? And where is it now? And how much of that money did the big guy, the man you will see on stage in less than an hour, keep for himself, if any? We don't know the answers to those questions. And as of right now, almost nobody in the legacy media is asking those questions. But we may learn soon anyway. Yesterday, we learned that the F.B.I. obtained a subpoena for Hunter Biden's laptop and hard drive. They were left famously in that repair shop in Wilmington. They got that subpoena in connection with a money laundering investigation that was underway late last year. We don't know the status of that investigation, but we have confirmed it was underway. Just hours ago, FOX News obtained an e-mail linking the Biden's business interest by the way, because you can't make this up, to Kamala Harris and other top Democrats. Here's the link. The e-mail dated May 15, 2017 was written by Jim Biden. He is, of course, the brother of the former Vice President. The subject line in the e-mail is this. \"Phase One domestic context/projects.\" The e-mail contains a list of what he calls quote, \"Key domestic contacts for Phase One target projects.\" Guess who is on the list? The vice presidential nominee, Kamala Harris. These are big stories, about five or six of them, different threads. This isn't Russian propaganda. This is real. So how is the Biden campaign responding to it? As of right now, they are still dismissing all of it as the work of Vladimir Putin. This was a Biden surrogate on FOX News today. Watch this."

The Biden campaign is claiming this is doing the bidding of a hostile foreign government in order to subvert our democracy. That's the actual claim they are making. They are saying it out loud. Now, the gambit, of course, is that through pure aggression, they can make us be quiet and make the story go away and it was working, we'll be honest with you. But it won't work now. It's not enough to kill the story. The story is too serious and now, there is too much detail. Even partisans can no longer ignore it. So what happens next? Again, there are many different parts to the story and not all of them are entirely clear, but we know much more than we did even two hours ago. And so for the latest in this, we go as we have for the last several days to Miranda Devine. She works at \"The New York Post,\" which initially broke the story of Hunter Biden's business dealings with foreign countries and his father's involvement in those. Miranda Devine joins us now. Miranda, thanks so much for coming on. This is -- I can't overstate how surprising this is. I am trying not to use word \"seismic\" but I think it's in that category right before the final debate. What do we know now that we didn't hours ago? MIRANDA DEVINE, COLUMNIST, \"THE NEW YORK POST\":  Well, our story eight days ago has just opened a Pandora's Box and it has prompted people like Tony Bobulinski to come forward and to talk to the Senate homeland Affairs Committee, and to also show the contents of those three phones that he just displayed. And on those phones are so many e-mails, WhatsApp messages, text messages between him and his partners, which were Hunter Biden and another guy called James Gilliar. Now, there is just incontrovertible evidence here that Joe Biden was involved and knew that his brother, James Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden, were operating this cash for influence scheme, with overseas companies, with Chinese companies, with Communist China to leverage millions of dollars on the Biden name. And you've done a very good job of summarizing a lot of that material. We saw Tony Bobulinski shortly, just a few minutes ago, and he is a very credible guy. He is strong. He is honest. He is a former lieutenant in the Navy. He has formerly just donated to Democrat causes. So this is not a partisan person. This is not someone you can dismiss as a Russian agent, like they have with Rudy Giuliani."

These people could be in charge of the Federal government very soon. That could happen. What does this tell us about their willingness to stifle the Free Press in order to gain political power?"

What this shows is that he has been lying about his knowledge of his son's business, at the very least. This is no longer about Hunter Biden. It's about Joe Biden. And the Biden campaign statement that they put out tonight is very curiously paused and that tells you everything. What he says is that there is no indication that he received any money. I mean, that's what it's come down to now. So there is no evidence that we've provided yet of money going to him. But there was money, you know, in all of these documents that we've seen, and what Tony Bobulinski says, is that money was being reserved. We saw that e- mail that 10 percent of a big deal with the Chinese energy company was being reserved by Hunter for the big guy. And Bobulinski has confirmed that the big guy is Joe Biden. So there are so many questions that need to be asked. And, you know, Joe Biden could easily clear it up by coming clean and talking to us. It's unbelievable that no one else in the media is covering this."

FOX News is now reporting that the F.B.I. had subpoenaed that famous laptop, the one that wound up in the repair store outside Wilmington and the hard drive as part of a money laundering probe late last year. Is that probe still ongoing? What was it about? So many questions. None of which the media are addressing. NPR, the real estate media publicly funded radio announced and said they are not covering the story. They're just refusing to cover it. They are just going to ignore it because it might hurt their candidate. That's been the position of so many news organizations, but that doesn't mean the story isn't real. And it doesn't mean the story doesn't matter. It is real, it does matter. It's complicated. We're going to try to explain it as clearly as we can. Ned Ryun is the CEO of American Majority.

Joe Biden, the big guy, is that the head of the Biden cartel. This is about Joe Biden. This is the Joe Biden scandal and all roads lead back to him. You know, I guess the question I have about the F.B.I. and it looks like they've had this computer for almost a year now. I would like them to clearly state, if it was acquired almost a year ago, why we just now heard about it. Is it part of an ongoing investigation into foreign business deals and money laundering? Or if they're not going to state that, we might just come to the conclusion that they were trying to memory hole it and maybe put their thumb on the scale for their boy, Joe Biden? I think what we've really come to the conclusion and had enough evidence, though, Tucker in the last few days, Joe Biden was clearly lying to the American people when he said he didn't know anything about Hunter Biden's business dealings. He was intimately acquainted, and according to some sources, actually at meetings. And so I think what we have here is Joe Biden is a corrupt liar who was compromised on China, and I think the American people deserve to know before November 3rd, specifically, how financially tied was Joe Biden or is Joe Biden to the barbaric and genocidal Communist Chinese regime? The American people deserve to know because China is one of the biggest issues here in the 2020 elections."

And I will say this, if there is a President Joe Biden, God forbid that there is, I think he still can compromise that he wouldn't be able to, couldn't actually confront them on any trade issues on any technology issues when he actually put us on a path to being a tributary state to China. And I've thought about this, Tucker. I think that this is the most important election in U.S. history, but even more so, in world history, because if America is imploded internally by a compromised Biden, the world is China's if Joe wins."

The question I have is, how does Biden respond? Does he respond calmly? Does he get angry? Does he dismiss it as if it's nothing? Does he try to blow it off? And does President Trump have the ability to press them? Now, the moderator can't mute them when they are having a discussion back and forth.

I have thought that it was kind of surprising that nobody on the campaign even on background would try to soften up this ground and, you know, bat this away or answer this in any sort of concrete way or substantive way. They're just hoping that it kind of dies on the vine. And look, Tucker, 43 million Americans have already voted in this election. So the people who are left to persuade tonight, there's not many of them, but would it dampen Democratic turnout, especially for Bernie Brothers? Right? That might -- that have never been excited about voting for Joe Biden anyway. Is this a storyline that might make them decide? You know, I'm just not going to go to the polls.

But I will tell you that the Democrats are well poised to pick up a lot of seats in the State Houses, and that's why you'll see it for sure, Tucker, for sure. And that also deals with redistricting. And for this election, there's a lot more than just the presidential office at stake here. You're talking about the United States Senate. It's unlikely that the Republicans would ever be able to win back the House. And in fact, it's likely that they're going to lose more seats in the House. It's those State Representative and State Senates or State Houses and State Senates that you're going to have to really watch because that's where all that work gets done. When it comes to redistricting, and decisions on how you're going to vote in the future. Many states have figured out how to do mail-in voting very well, Florida is one of them. They really figured things out after 2000. You remember all of that. But a state like Pennsylvania that's doing this kind of for the first time and on a grander scale.

That is to say, the wild goose chase after Russia -- Trump-Russia collusion that went on for more than two years. This could be as bad because here we have this story. Yes, I can understand the skepticism about it at the beginning, you know, because of its provenance, you know, you've got Rudy Giuliani, who is, you know, Trump's pal in the middle of it, and you've got all this coming out very late in the campaign. And you know, seasoned journalists should naturally be skeptical of things like that, but too much now has been added to the record on this, including this most recent development tonight Mr. Bobulinski coming out and saying on his own authority about what he personally heard. He is now a live witness. He is going to be called before a congressional committee apparently. He will probably testify under oath.

I mean, the fact that Rudy Giuliani was involved in passing this on at some point, journalists have to say, okay, I'm not crazy about him. I'm not -- I'm suspicious or skeptical of the source of this. But my Lord, here is a bunch of corroborating information and here is a live human being who has come forward now and is apparently prepared to testify under oath that, you know, at risk of being charged with perjury, about what he heard and saw, and it's not just now about Hunter Biden and what Joe Biden -- use of Joe Biden's name, it's about Joe Biden himself identified as having participated in conversations of a nature that he said he'd never had and never knew about and never had anything to do with. So this thing is out there and it's live. And, you know, it will be very interesting to see whether the debate moderator tonight poses the question and mentions the new information, and see if it falls to Trump to do it, it won't be as effective because he is an interested party."

I mean, it's -- you know, I mean, look, the question that arises is, it's this. If there's no improper conduct here and these e-mails and these conversations that we know about don't mean what they appear to mean, Joe Biden should come out and deny it, or someone in real authority in his campaign should come out and deny it on his behalf and say what the real story is. The fact that that doesn't -- hasn't happened, it hasn't even come close to happening. And this Symone Sanders statement emphasizes that further, to make any smart journalist say, wait a minute, if this isn't so, why don't they deny it? Why not? That would be -- that would be the fastest way to get rid of the story, if you have a truthful denial. The fact that that hasn't come is telling."

I mean, you saw a National Public Radio announcer say they're just not going to cover the Ukraine story, because they just don't want to cover it. Has that ever -- I've never heard anybody say that before."

And of course, as the evidence mounts, that becomes an increasingly untenable position. It'll be interesting to see if they move off of it. I suspect, you know, there were a lot of stories done when this story first came out, following up by doing what? By investigating what was going on inside \"The New York Post.\" And there were -- you know, there were reports of anonymous staff members of \"The New York Post\" not wanting their names on the story and all of that. But it seems to me that all falls by the wayside now in light of what's now emerging. I mean, you know, these three phones. Somebody is going to look at those and they're either going to show something or they're not. The laptop either shows something or it doesn't, it appears that it certainly does. So I think this becomes, you know, past the point of these sort of frivolous denials and claims of Russian disinformation. They shouldn't stand in the way -- in the end, they won't stand. And if the media continued to play the way they have, the mainstream media, and make no mistake about it, Tucker, the mainstream media are still dominant. I mean, yes, you know, you've got talk radio out there. It's pretty conservative. You've got the editorial pages of \"The Wall Street Journal\" that are pretty conservative. You've got FOX News with many conservative players on the team here. But we are -- we, conservatives in this country are still way in the minority in the media, and in the mainstream media are dominant and it would make a big difference in how this all develops if the mainstream media were playing it straight.

Just moments ago, a top Biden adviser dismissed Bobulinski's statement and the evidence he provided, saying this quote, \"If the President decides to amplify these latest smears against the Vice President and his only living son. That is Russian disinformation.\" Now, keep in mind that Tony Bobulinski a former Naval officer, who apparently served this country with distinction, a registered Democrat who gave money to Democratic candidates. So they are saying he is part of a Russian disinformation campaign. We've come to a place again, it's going to be hard to pull back from. Where are we exactly? Newt Gingrich has been around politics for a long time. He is the former Speaker of the House, and for perspective, we're happy to have him on tonight. Mr. Speaker, thanks for coming on.

In fact, in the case of Facebook, we've now learned they have 12 Chinese communist specialists in censorship in an office in Seattle working on the algorithms to censor us. So these three scandals, I can't, frankly, Tucker, think of anything comparable to this in terms of the penetration the American system, and let me just give you one fact that people haven't even brought up yet. The Chinese communist gave $70 million to the University of Pennsylvania. Joe Biden, while he was out of office, earned $911,000.00 from the Institute towards the Chinese gave the money. So you have to ask the question -- and it's all secret. They will not reveal any details."

And you see this, as a matter of fact, I just did a podcast we will release tomorrow night, when we go through all the elements of the Biden family corruption, because it's not about Hunter. It's about the family and the way in which Joe Biden lent himself to make millions of dollars, I mean, at least $200 million or $300 million are at stake in the scale of their personal corruption.

It still affects many Americans on many levels, primarily economic, but also others. For example, on Tuesday, a veteran of the Houston Police Department just died. He was shot by an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, another suspect was wounded in that shooting, another officer rather. The suspect has been arrested at least four previous times, dating all the way back 26 years to 1994. So the question is, why are people like that able to stay in this country for 26 years illegally?

And it is at least a part of driving the unemployment down to three and a half percent as he did before COVID hit. All the elements of his policies work together, and when COVID did hit and unemployment spiked, he also in June, as you'll recall, stopped the entry of temporary foreign workers so Americans can get back to work in opening up job slots first."

      "utterance": "Thank you. Well, it's a very different situation it was two weeks ago. He is not that far behind. I think he is actually even. So he needs to smile, have good optics. Let Joe Biden talk for two minutes. I know that wasn't the intent of the Commission to help Trump, but when Joe Biden talks for a minute, he is uninterrupted, he has problems. And if Trump will smile and not roll his eyes or not frown and let Joe Biden do that, in other words, he should approach the debate with a smile, talk softly and carry a big stick and I think Joe Biden will be loud with a twig. On the issues, we know they're going to be biased. They always are. It's going to be climate change, climate change, racism, racism, and COVID, COVID. And all them can be dismissed, I think, to get to the real issues. But I would just say, you know, Mr. Biden, I didn't insult African- Americans and say, you ain't black. I wouldn't think of that, and I don't traffic in fossil fuel companies from abroad like you did with Burisma and your family. And if you look at the data on COVID with European countries where comparable, we had a problem with four blue states: Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York that made some bad decisions, but I don't need lectures from you on that. And I want to ask you a question. Here's what he needs to say. Were you telling the truth when you denied any involvement with foreign agents and lobbyists that were working to gain influence? And when you said you had no knowledge of your son's business, are you telling the truth now when the evidence contradicts everything? Which is it? Are you lying then or are you lying now? Were you telling the truth then? And I don't think he can answer that. I think class is really important very quickly, Tucker, because Donald Trump can say that America -- I lost money to go in government, Joe Biden went into government to make money. And this China and the Ukraine machinations remind us of that. Donald Trump took risks. He is one with a working classes. Hundred million people are making food, fuel and stuff for us. You can't run a presidency or country from your basement anymore. You can't run a candidacy. And finally, I really think he needs to appeal in a bipartisan fashion. He has to say whether you're Republican or Democrat, red or blue, liberal or conservative, you don't have a country if you don't have a police, if you don't have a border, if the people in Washington are going to sell their souls out to foreign countries to destroy your souls.

And if you believe the polls, and also the President's debate advisers, it'll only hurt the President. If on the other hand, he follows the advice that they are all giving them, which is let Joe Biden speak, let him get into trouble with some of the things he says and then pick it apart in a very surgical way, then I think we'll have a more interesting debate and a better debate. And conceivably, it'll turn things around. Now, the stakes could not be higher tonight. If we have a repeat of the first debate, I think there's a possibility that Joe Biden could put his race away. On the other hand -- because he is clearly leading at this point. If the President has a good night in these final 12 days, he has the opportunity to turn it around so the stakes could not be higher."

And it will be very interesting to see how that is raised, if indeed it is. We understand that Mr. Bobulinski will be in the audience tonight, a guest of Mr. Trump. It will be interesting to see if the President decides that he is going to raise this issue or if the moderator doing what I think an ordinary, you know, news interested moderator would do, raises it herself, which I think would put more pressure on the former Vice President.

But this is a historic debate in the sense that we are in a moment of tremendous coronavirus sweeping the country. And you know, even tonight, just to you know, look at the stage to understand the limited size of that audience in the room. You know for us who were here in 2008, for that debate, way back, McCain and Obama, it's a different moment. And right now, there are so many voters who have voted early and there are so few undecided voters. And that, again, is just different than we would expect coming into this moment.

We're talking about half a percentage point in the states where Joe Biden, and Donald Trump are currently battling it out. President Trump plans to hit the campaign trail as soon as they get done with this debate over the weekend. Whether Joe Biden will do the same, depending on how it goes is a big question. But for President Trump, I think he has to hinge on the idea that this Gallup poll that just recently came out shows that set 57 percent of Americans believe they are better off now than they were four years ago, and the President has to explain why that is and why they feel like they are better off now than they were under an Obama-Biden administration. On the issue of stability, I think it'll be really interesting to watch how Joe Biden handles these new revelations about his connections to these foreign business dealings, his son. He has been asked very few questions about this. And when he has been asked on the campaign trail, he gets very defensive in his answers, so we'll see if he can hold it together tonight on that topic."

And the President needs to begin the process tonight of laying out the message, the theme for the last 12 days of the campaign. It's ironic, isn't it? We're going to have -- we've got 47 million people who voted. That's more than a third of who voted four years ago. It's probably about a quarter of the people who are going to vote this year. And yet, even with all those people having voted, the people who are going to decide this election are those that are up for grabs, who are probably going to wait to the end and vote on Election Day. And tonight, the press coverage about tonight and then the statements of the candidates as they go out this Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, and set the tone for the last week.

He could put it in ads or whatever, and stay above it. But he can't count on that. So he may have -- he may be the only person who raise it because he is the only person who was willing to do so, but in doing so, he has got to not do that at the expense of making the case that he didn't really fail on coronavirus. He has a better record than you think. That's a challenge in itself to make that case because so many people think otherwise. But he does have an argument there. He has also got to point to some of the things that Katie suggested resulted in people telling Gallup, the Gallup polling organization, 56 percent of them saying that they were better off than they were four years ago. He needs to remind them of that. And he also needs to do all this without reminding people of the personality qualities and the behavior problems or issues that people say they don't like.

      "utterance": "Well, I was thinking about it. I can't help it. I think every moderator ends up feeling empathy for somebody else who is at that chair. You've done a tremendous amount of work. I saw she had what I had, which is a loose-leaf black notebook and you've got tabs on each section and you've got your questions. You've got your facts to back up the questions. So you come in with a plan, and you're prepared. And frankly right now, you've got to settle your nerves. You've got to take a few breaths and just get yourself ready. Try to have some fun, although right now, you're not thinking about fun, you're thinking about having a good, serious, constructive debate, the debate the American people want to hear."

      "utterance": "Yes, in fact, I mean, I'm not even in the Debate Hall and I can feel the tension, so I think that it must -- I can imagine what it feels like in the hall. I also would just say this, I mean, America does democracy very well. Here we are. We're going to do this debate. We are in the middle of a global pandemic. The economy struggling to fight back but it is fighting back. And we have a decision to make as Americans and I just -- I put my faith in the American people that they will tune in and watch tonight and make good decisions."

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I do. I think from what we read in the papers and what I hear from the sort of Trump world is that even he understands that he was a little too hot and too abrasive in the first one, but we were talking about getting nervous here, Dana mentioned it. I've been at the backstage of six of these things with a presidential candidate and then a President, and let me tell you, this is worse than Election Night because so much hinges on the outcome of these things. And particularly tonight, I think that is going to be especially true because there are not three debates, there are two debates. The first one went badly for both of them, but one guy took a hit in the polls, the other guy didn't. It's tension city."
