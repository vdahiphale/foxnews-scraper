      "sentences": "Companies refusing to cover mental health care, insurance companies refusing to cover maternity camp, no free mammograms, cancer screenings or birth control. Insurance companies reinstating annual and lifetime camps and more than 20 million Americans losing insurance at the worst possible time, again in the midst of a pandemic, including nearly two million Texans, 607,000 North Carolinians, 288,000 South Carolinians, 227,000 Iowans and 4.2 million Californians. And the pain of losing these protections would disproportionately be felt among the 9 million African American, Latino, Asian and Native Americans who gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But this isn't about statistics. This is about millions of real people living real lives who deserve their government and its institutions to see them and to heed their call. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I know a Republican member of this committee said earlier today that the people who will lose health care are somehow not relevant to this hearing. I disagree. Helping these people is supposed to be why we are all here, why we all ran for office in the first place. And I'm here to fight for people like Felicia Perez. And this is her. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Felicia is a writer, a public speaker and former high school teacher from Southern California who now teaches at the University of Nevada, Reno. She has multiple pre-existing conditions including arthritis, asthma and a rare autoimmune disorder that caused tumors that have wrapped around her optic nerve and part of her brain. Her life depends on periodic cancer fighting infusions that cost $160,000 a year. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Felicia is terrified. She knows that without the Affordable Care Act, she could not afford ongoing treatment, the treatment she needs to stay alive. And here's exactly what she said, and I will quote. My life is in the hands of people I do not know, who do not know me, who are essentially telling me I don't matter, that my life doesn't matter, that my health doesn't matter, that the day-to-day quality of my life doesn't matter. And that's really hard. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Tragically, Felicia's story is not unique. Her fears are shared by millions of Americans, the Affordable Care Act and its protections hinge on this Supreme Court and the outcome of this hearing. Before being elected, President Trump promised that every justice he put forward will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on Obamacare. Judge Barrett, 18 months later, you criticized the chief justice for upholding the Affordable Care Act when you concluded, Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } My question is, how many months after you published that article, did President Trump nominate you to be a judge on the Court of Appeals? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Justice Ginsburg, whose seat you are seeking to fill, provided the critical fifth vote in a five-four decision that upheld the Affordable Care Act. So, let's lay this out for everyone who's watching. As I have discussed previously, one, Republicans have spent a decade trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Two, Donald Trump promised to name a Supreme Court justice and Supreme Court justices who would tear down the Affordable Care Act. Three, President Trump is before the Supreme Court right now arguing that it'd be struck in its entirety. Four, the Supreme Court could be just one vote away from overturning the Affordable Care Act and all of its protections, including for everyone who has a pre-existing condition or may have a pre-existing condition. In other words, the Affordable Care Act and all its protections hinge on this seat and the outcome of this hearing, and I believe it's very important that the American people understand the issues at stake and what's at play. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Judge Barrett, the day after President Trump announced your nomination to the Supreme Court. He tweeted, Obamacare will be replaced with a much better and far cheaper alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court.

But the reality is right now he is asking the Supreme Court to take it away. Senator Klobuchar, Judge Barrett asked you earlier today, but did not receive an answer.

And I certainly believe and know that to be true as a personal matter. She was a trailblazer for women's equality and gender equity. As a law student, as a teacher, as a civil rights lawyer, and as a second woman ever to sit on the United States Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg broke many barriers for women across the country. We, I believe, are fondly remember her as a person who had patience. She had the will and the vision to make our country a more equal place and a more just place. And one of the things she fought for was a woman's right to control her own body and to make decisions about her own body and health care and reproductive choices. The Constitution of the United States protects a woman's right to choose whether or when to become a parent. And it protects a woman's right to choose abortion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Women of color, immigrant women, women with low incomes and women in rural areas face significant barriers when attempting to access birth control, cancer screenings and comprehensive reproductive health care. Moreover, anti-choice activists and politicians have been working for decades to pass laws and file lawsuits designed to overturn Roe and the precedents that followed. The threat to choice is real. Just last year, the court heard a case that gave it an opportunity to revisit and overturn its abortion precedent. In a case called June Medical Services. The Supreme Court struck down a medically unnecessary restriction that would have closed all but one abortion clinic in Louisiana. Chief Justice Roberts agreed with the court's four liberal members that the court was bound by its own precedent to strike down the Louisiana law because it was virtually identical to a Texas law that the court ruled unconstitutional in 2016. As a result, women in the state were able to receive the full range of reproductive care. But Chief Justice Roberts wrote his own separate opinion in the case to make clear that in the future he could not be counted on to oppose a woman's right to choose. Justice Ginsburg provided the critical fifth vote to strike down the unconstitutional abortion restriction in June Medical Services. So, we must be honest about the impact of her passing and the impact it will have on the court's decisions in cases regarding women's access to reproductive health care. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, my Republican colleagues have said that there is a minimal chance that the Supreme Court will overturn Roe. But back in January, 39 Republican senators, including 10 members of this very committee, signed their names to a Supreme Court brief that asked the court to take up the issue of whether Roe should be reconsidered and, if appropriate, overruled. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, let's not make any mistake about it, allowing President Trump to determine who fills the seat of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a champion for women's rights and a critical vote in so many decisions that have sustained the right to choose poses a threat to safe and legal abortion in our country. After all, President Trump said that overturning Roe v. Wade will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. Judge Barrett, several times today, you have quoted Justice Ginsburg's testimony about not making predictions in future cases. However, she was far more forthcoming at her confirmation hearing about the essential rights of women. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In 1993, Justice Ginsburg's confirmation hearing shows that she testified that the decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman's life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself when government controls that decision for her. She is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices. Then Judge Ginsburg went on to say, it is essential to women's equality with man that she be the decision maker, that her choice be controlled. If you impose restraints that impede her choice, you are disadvantaging her because of her sex. Now, Justice Ginsburg did not tell the committee how she would vote in any particular case, but she did freely discuss how she viewed a woman's right to choose. But Judge Barrett, your record clearly shows you hold a different view. In 2006, you signed her name to an advertisement published in the South Bend Tribune. It described Roe v. Wade as an exercise of raw judicial power and called for putting an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade. You signed a similar ad in 2013 that described Roe as infamous and expressed opposition to abortion. Also in 2013, you wrote an article about Supreme Court precedent in which you excluded Roe from a list of well settled cases that you said, no justice would overrule, even if she disagrees, suggesting of course that you believe Roe is susceptible to being overturned. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On the 40th anniversary of Roe, you delivered a speech in which you said that the court's recognition of the right to choose was created through judicial fiat, rather than grounded in the Constitution. And during your tenure on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, you have been willing to reconsider abortion restrictions that other Republican appointed judges found unconstitutional. As the Senate considers filling the seat of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was straightforward enough in her confirmation hearing to say that the right to choose is essential to woman's equality. I would suggest that we not pretend that we don't know how this nominee views a woman's right to choose to make her own health care decisions. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the following three documents be entered into the record. A letter opposing Judge Barrett's nomination from the NAACP, a statement opposing Judge Barrett's nomination from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and a report opposing Judge Barrett's nomination from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.",

The federal prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William Barr to look into this probe has reportedly closed up shop. He is no longer working on the investigation. What he had been looking at was the Obama administration's intelligence committee and what is known as the process of unmasking. Now, Attorney John Bash departed the Justice Department last and with him goes the prospect of any type of explosive report or criminal prosecution of Obama-era officials. Senior Trump officials including the president himself have claimed that the Obama team mismanaged the process of unmasking also known as requesting the identities of individuals whose names and identities are redacted in intelligence documents. Now I'm going to read you the list of officials who made these requests. They include Vice President Joe Biden, FBI director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, CIA director John Brennan, DNI James Clapper, Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Now, unmasking itself fairly standard operating procedure. Top national security officials who look at intelligence documents as part of their job are allowed to request that individuals become unmasked if they think that that individual poses a direct threat to national security. Now, also breaking tonight, Martha, there are new developments in a separate DOJ investigation, a probe led by U.S. attorney John Durham. Fox News has obtained a 94-page document used by the FBI to keep track of information provided by Christopher Steele at the start of the 2016 Russia probe. Among the revelations, as we continue to comb through this document, the FBI believed Russians were trying to exploit Trump as quote, \"personal obsessions by gathering compromising material on him.\" Listen to the president.",

      "utterance": "Companies refusing to cover mental health care, insurance companies refusing to cover maternity camp, no free mammograms, cancer screenings or birth control. Insurance companies reinstating annual and lifetime camps and more than 20 million Americans losing insurance at the worst possible time, again in the midst of a pandemic, including nearly two million Texans, 607,000 North Carolinians, 288,000 South Carolinians, 227,000 Iowans and 4.2 million Californians. And the pain of losing these protections would disproportionately be felt among the 9 million African American, Latino, Asian and Native Americans who gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But this isn't about statistics. This is about millions of real people living real lives who deserve their government and its institutions to see them and to heed their call. And I know a Republican member of this committee said earlier today that the people who will lose health care are somehow not relevant to this hearing. I disagree. Helping these people is supposed to be why we are all here, why we all ran for office in the first place. And I'm here to fight for people like Felicia Perez. And this is her. Felicia is a writer, a public speaker and former high school teacher from Southern California who now teaches at the University of Nevada, Reno. She has multiple pre-existing conditions including arthritis, asthma and a rare autoimmune disorder that caused tumors that have wrapped around her optic nerve and part of her brain. Her life depends on periodic cancer fighting infusions that cost $160,000 a year. Felicia is terrified. She knows that without the Affordable Care Act, she could not afford ongoing treatment, the treatment she needs to stay alive. And here's exactly what she said, and I will quote. My life is in the hands of people I do not know, who do not know me, who are essentially telling me I don't matter, that my life doesn't matter, that my health doesn't matter, that the day-to-day quality of my life doesn't matter. And that's really hard. Tragically, Felicia's story is not unique. Her fears are shared by millions of Americans, the Affordable Care Act and its protections hinge on this Supreme Court and the outcome of this hearing. Before being elected, President Trump promised that every justice he put forward will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on Obamacare. Judge Barrett, 18 months later, you criticized the chief justice for upholding the Affordable Care Act when you concluded, Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. My question is, how many months after you published that article, did President Trump nominate you to be a judge on the Court of Appeals?"

Justice Ginsburg, whose seat you are seeking to fill, provided the critical fifth vote in a five-four decision that upheld the Affordable Care Act. So, let's lay this out for everyone who's watching. As I have discussed previously, one, Republicans have spent a decade trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Two, Donald Trump promised to name a Supreme Court justice and Supreme Court justices who would tear down the Affordable Care Act. Three, President Trump is before the Supreme Court right now arguing that it'd be struck in its entirety. Four, the Supreme Court could be just one vote away from overturning the Affordable Care Act and all of its protections, including for everyone who has a pre-existing condition or may have a pre-existing condition. In other words, the Affordable Care Act and all its protections hinge on this seat and the outcome of this hearing, and I believe it's very important that the American people understand the issues at stake and what's at play. Judge Barrett, the day after President Trump announced your nomination to the Supreme Court. He tweeted, Obamacare will be replaced with a much better and far cheaper alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court. But in reality, there is no alternative that protects the millions of Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act every day. The horrifying truth is that President Trump and the Republicans and Congress are fighting to take health care away from the American people in the middle of a pandemic, as I have said, President Trump has said that he wants to protect the American people's health care. But the reality is right now he is asking the Supreme Court to take it away. Senator Klobuchar, Judge Barrett asked you earlier today, but did not receive an answer. Prior to your nomination, were you aware of President Trump's statements committing to nominate judges who will strike down the Affordable Care Act? And I appreciate a yes or no answer, please."

      "utterance": "Right. And what I've asked you is that is it not correct that that is the process, but ultimately it would be you and you alone that would make the decision about whether you would be recused. You've already opined on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. And that position satisfied the president's promise to only nominate judges who would tear down the Affordable Care Act and that position satisfied the president's promise to only nominate judges who would tear down the Affordable Care Act. And Senate Republicans rushed this process so that you could rule on this very case. The reasonable question about your impartiality will undoubtedly hang over this court's ultimate decision in the Affordable Care Act case if you refuse to recuse yourself. I strongly believe that. Supreme Court justices routinely consider the consequences of their decisions on people's lives. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled against President Trump in his effort to repeal DACA protections for Dreamers. Children, of course, who have arrived in the United States many before they could talk or walk. Chief Justice Roberts wrote the opinion for five-four majority that included the crucial vote of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The court rejected the Trump administration's attempt to end protections for Dreamers. Chief Justice Roberts said the administration had not taken into consideration the fact that many Dreamers rely on those protections when they started their careers and businesses, when they served in the military of the United States, when they bought homes and when they started families. Senator Hirono asked you whether it is appropriate for a Supreme Court justice to consider real world impacts, but you're a sitting judge now. So, my question is in deciding whether to uphold government action, do you currently consider the consequences of your rulings on people's lives?"

      "utterance": "So, if the Affordable Care Act is struck down, more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions like heart disease, diabetes and cancer would pay more for insurance or be denied coverage entirely. More than 20 million Americans could lose their health coverage entirely, including nearly 3 million black Americans. And over 5 million Latino Americans received access to health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. Insurers will once again be able to discriminate against that more than 50 percent of African Americans and nearly 40 percent of Latinos with pre- existing conditions. Insurers will be able to deny coverage to more than one quarter of Native Americans with conditions like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. All of this in the midst of a pandemic that is not going away any time soon. A pandemic that when age is taken into account, has been three times as deadly for black, Latino, Pacific Islander and Native Americans. A pandemic that has killed approximately one in 1000 black Americans, one in 1200 Native Americans and one in 1500 Latino Americans. Judge Barrett, would you consider the 135 million people who gained protections under the Affordable Care Act when deciding a case that challenges that law?"

And as I said earlier, earlier during this hearing, the question would be figuring out whether Congress, assuming that the mandate is unconstitutional now, whether that consistent with your intent, this is Congress's law, would permit this act to stand or whether the flawed portion of it could just be excised out. And that is a question not of what judges want. It's not a question of the Supreme Court. It's a question of what Congress wanted in the statute.

So, the law often takes into account reliance interests. I can't really say sitting here how they would play in a way in this case, because that's part of the legal calculus of the case. So, I can't really give you the kind of commitment or pre-commitment that you're asking for me of how I would weigh factors or how I would structure my decision-making process."

      "utterance": "I would ask you to consider, if you are confirmed on the court, incredible benefit of the Affordable Care Act and that a destruction of its protections will have a devastating impact on millions, hundreds of millions of Americans. Judge Barrett, you testified yesterday that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg opened the door for many women in law. And I certainly believe and know that to be true as a personal matter. She was a trailblazer for women's equality and gender equity. As a law student, as a teacher, as a civil rights lawyer, and as a second woman ever to sit on the United States Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg broke many barriers for women across the country. We, I believe, are fondly remember her as a person who had patience. She had the will and the vision to make our country a more equal place and a more just place. And one of the things she fought for was a woman's right to control her own body and to make decisions about her own body and health care and reproductive choices. The Constitution of the United States protects a woman's right to choose whether or when to become a parent. And it protects a woman's right to choose abortion. Women of color, immigrant women, women with low incomes and women in rural areas face significant barriers when attempting to access birth control, cancer screenings and comprehensive reproductive health care. Moreover, anti-choice activists and politicians have been working for decades to pass laws and file lawsuits designed to overturn Roe and the precedents that followed. The threat to choice is real. Just last year, the court heard a case that gave it an opportunity to revisit and overturn its abortion precedent. In a case called June Medical Services. The Supreme Court struck down a medically unnecessary restriction that would have closed all but one abortion clinic in Louisiana. Chief Justice Roberts agreed with the court's four liberal members that the court was bound by its own precedent to strike down the Louisiana law because it was virtually identical to a Texas law that the court ruled unconstitutional in 2016. As a result, women in the state were able to receive the full range of reproductive care. But Chief Justice Roberts wrote his own separate opinion in the case to make clear that in the future he could not be counted on to oppose a woman's right to choose. Justice Ginsburg provided the critical fifth vote to strike down the unconstitutional abortion restriction in June Medical Services. So, we must be honest about the impact of her passing and the impact it will have on the court's decisions in cases regarding women's access to reproductive health care. Now, my Republican colleagues have said that there is a minimal chance that the Supreme Court will overturn Roe. But back in January, 39 Republican senators, including 10 members of this very committee, signed their names to a Supreme Court brief that asked the court to take up the issue of whether Roe should be reconsidered and, if appropriate, overruled. So, let's not make any mistake about it, allowing President Trump to determine who fills the seat of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a champion for women's rights and a critical vote in so many decisions that have sustained the right to choose poses a threat to safe and legal abortion in our country. After all, President Trump said that overturning Roe v. Wade will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. Judge Barrett, several times today, you have quoted Justice Ginsburg's testimony about not making predictions in future cases. However, she was far more forthcoming at her confirmation hearing about the essential rights of women. In 1993, Justice Ginsburg's confirmation hearing shows that she testified that the decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman's life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself when government controls that decision for her. She is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices. Then Judge Ginsburg went on to say, it is essential to women's equality with man that she be the decision maker, that her choice be controlled. If you impose restraints that impede her choice, you are disadvantaging her because of her sex. Now, Justice Ginsburg did not tell the committee how she would vote in any particular case, but she did freely discuss how she viewed a woman's right to choose. But Judge Barrett, your record clearly shows you hold a different view. In 2006, you signed her name to an advertisement published in the South Bend Tribune. It described Roe v. Wade as an exercise of raw judicial power and called for putting an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade. You signed a similar ad in 2013 that described Roe as infamous and expressed opposition to abortion. Also in 2013, you wrote an article about Supreme Court precedent in which you excluded Roe from a list of well settled cases that you said, no justice would overrule, even if she disagrees, suggesting of course that you believe Roe is susceptible to being overturned. On the 40th anniversary of Roe, you delivered a speech in which you said that the court's recognition of the right to choose was created through judicial fiat, rather than grounded in the Constitution. And during your tenure on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, you have been willing to reconsider abortion restrictions that other Republican appointed judges found unconstitutional. As the Senate considers filling the seat of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was straightforward enough in her confirmation hearing to say that the right to choose is essential to woman's equality. I would suggest that we not pretend that we don't know how this nominee views a woman's right to choose to make her own health care decisions. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the following three documents be entered into the record. A letter opposing Judge Barrett's nomination from the NAACP, a statement opposing Judge Barrett's nomination from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund, and a report opposing Judge Barrett's nomination from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund."

They know that going after her religion, the way they went after Brett Kavanaugh for with false charges of sexual assault would backfire. They could cost them their chances for the Senate in 2018. So, they're trying to make this about health care and they're trying to make this about all these rulings and alleging that she's going to overturn all these laws. And the reality is they have no idea what she's going to do because they're exposing their flawed judicial philosophy. What Democrats do, they appoint activist judges who start with their predetermined result that they want to have and then find a legal reasoning to justify it and legislate from the bench. Conservatives don't do that much to the conservative movement's frustration. Conservative judges apply the law even when it doesn't result in their preferred outcome. And if you want proof of that, the judge who cast - the justice who cast the deciding vote to uphold Obamacare was John Roberts, which is a Republican nominee. So, we have no idea how Amy Coney Barrett is going to vote on any on Roe v. Wade, on Obamacare or on any of these cases. And so, this assault is just nothing but political theater."

And there's no doubt, she's very likely to be confirmed. She's an impressive, smart, capable candidate. But I would add so was Merrick Garland. And it's almost as if as you watch these things, watch this hearing that some of my Republican friends in the Senate who I served with in the Congress believe that maybe President Trump won't be re-elected and they've got to rush this thing through. I think Democrats will continue to question her very directly. She is answering questions. I'm impressed with the way she's answering the fact that she has no notes and seems to be taking no notes on one level is highly remarkably impressive. But I think all of the questioning is fair. I thought Cory Booker this evening did an exceptional job of walking through with Judge Barrett, some of her thinking around what deserves consideration by the full court, what her thinking was around, some employment and racial law matters. And I thought that the vice-presidential nominee for the Democrats did a good job there. I thought during the day, during the early part of the day, Chris Coons and Dick Durbin, I thought were probably two of the more effective Democrats to lay out some of the questioning. But I would agree with Marc largely, this is probably - Judge Barrett will probably make it through, but not before, fairly, and rightly, a tough set of questioning for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States."

We do have several I think it's eight members of this committee, Marc, who are up for re-election. It felt a little like a campaign speech at the beginning of Kamala Harris' statement here, she talked quite a bit about COVID. The same could be said of Lindsey Graham, who definitely got in some of the points that he wanted to make.

And they're - I just look at this and you just compare how dignified this day has been, even with the tough questioning to the fiasco that was the Kavanaugh hearing. And it's so much more pleasant and much more of a credit to our democracy. Yes, she's going to have to take tough questions and she should. And she's answering them very well. But one point, one-point Martha, on the Obamacare point, what people are forgetting, this whole idea that she was put on, she's been nominated in order to just arrive in time to strike down Obamacare. The lower court ruling strikes down Obamacare. And so, if there's a split court, four-four, the lower court ruling stands. So, her presence on the court could possibly not make any difference, even if she did vote against Obamacare. And we don't know that she would because the severability thing is not an ideological breakdown. It's a legal rationale. And some conservatives would probably say that it's severable."

So, we used platform technologies that we knew could be fast, could be safe, could be manufactured at scale, at investors scale, and that was one reason we went very fast. The second reason is we did things in parallel. We prepared, we took financial risk, we didn't take any safety risk and we were able to prepare for phase one trial, phase three two trial, phase three trial, even before being into large animals. We were manufacturing the vaccines even before starting the phase three trials, so we got all of the blanks, if you will, and less than 10 months after discovering this virus, we have six programs in the clinics, of which four are in phase three trials."

He had no idea what the hell he was doing, folks. He has no clue. And he's not a nice guy just so you understand. Not a nice guy. If he was a nice guy, I wouldn't hit him like this. But he's not a nice guy. He's a bad guy. He's always been a dummy. He's always been -- he's never been -- no, no. In his best of years, he was considered a dumb guy. When asked about fracking, Biden said he would sure, absolutely make it, we will eliminate it. That's what he said, those are the exact words and then he said it 19 different times. Then one day he said, I never said that. It's incredible. And they don't question him. I couldn't get away with it for a minute. Not a minute. Did you see the town hall he had with NBC? That was a town hall for a child, a young child. Barron Trump -- actually, Barron is far too advanced for that town hall. That was a town hall --"

She is further left. She is considered further left than Bernie. This is -- and you know, they're looking. When Nancy Pelosi does the 25th Amendment she's doing it for Biden, you do know that, right? Because they want to get Biden out and that won't be hard but at this very moment, Biden's web site includes a pledge to mandate net zero carbon emissions which fossil fuels, coal, everything is gone and it's gone soon.

I went to school here, probably spent more time here than sleepy Joe in all fairness. I went to school here. But we're putting our great coal miners back to work. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, you see that happening. And we've got -- did you see in the debate the other night? I said to him, name one law enforcement agency. Just one in the whole country that supports you. He couldn't do it. Then Chris Wallace bailed him out. Then I say, how come you got the $3.5 million from Russia? And they bailed him out again. He was joking like a dog. They bailed him out.

Barr had appointed a federal prosecutor to review whether Obama era officials improperly requested the identities of people whose names were redacted in the intelligence documents but the prosecutor found no substantive wrongdoing. Correspondent Gillian Turner has this breaking story for us tonight. Gillian, good evening."

    {
      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Martha, good evening to you, too. The story is still developing as we speak at this moment. The federal prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William Barr to look into this probe has reportedly closed up shop. He is no longer working on the investigation. What he had been looking at was the Obama administration's intelligence committee and what is known as the process of unmasking. Now, Attorney John Bash departed the Justice Department last and with him goes the prospect of any type of explosive report or criminal prosecution of Obama-era officials. Senior Trump officials including the president himself have claimed that the Obama team mismanaged the process of unmasking also known as requesting the identities of individuals whose names and identities are redacted in intelligence documents. Now I'm going to read you the list of officials who made these requests. They include Vice President Joe Biden, FBI director James Comey, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, CIA director John Brennan, DNI James Clapper, Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power. Now, unmasking itself fairly standard operating procedure. Top national security officials who look at intelligence documents as part of their job are allowed to request that individuals become unmasked if they think that that individual poses a direct threat to national security. Now, also breaking tonight, Martha, there are new developments in a separate DOJ investigation, a probe led by U.S. attorney John Durham. Fox News has obtained a 94-page document used by the FBI to keep track of information provided by Christopher Steele at the start of the 2016 Russia probe. Among the revelations, as we continue to comb through this document, the FBI believed Russians were trying to exploit Trump as quote, \"personal obsessions by gathering compromising material on him.\" Listen to the president."

We're also learning it's looking less and less likely he's going to produce any kind of a report coming out of this. We'll keep you updated."
