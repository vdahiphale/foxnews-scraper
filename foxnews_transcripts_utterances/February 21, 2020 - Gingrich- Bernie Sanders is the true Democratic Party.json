According to the latest data, the DNC is less than $10 million cash on hand. In contrast, the RNC has nearly $80 million. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Meanwhile, the 2020 candidates aren't faring much better. While President Trump builds a massive war chest, his potential opponents are hemorrhaging money on the campaign trail. Of course, none of this matters to billionaire Mike Bloomberg who is literally trying to buy the race. Bloomberg has so much money. He's actually paying ordinary Americans to say nice things about him online. But that's not all. His latest spending spree involves a series of weird billboards, including one that attacks the president for how his steaks are prepared, and another one that reads, quote, Donald Trump cheats at golf. Mike Bloomberg doesn't. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's real.

Apparently, it can't even buy good debate prep. And after Bloomberg's pathetic performance at this week's debate, Bernie Sanders is piling on.

And I think those of us who watch in amazement as Donald Trump wiped out 16 competitors before taking on Clinton and beating her, I don't want to be presumptive. So I would say that Sanders has a very distance possibility of winning. But it's a much greater likelihood of taking the entire Democratic ticket down, ending Pelosi's speakership. He's the greatest gift to Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House, you could possibly hope for, because Sanders really is the true Democratic Party. He represents all of the big government ideas, all the radicalism, all of the weird foreign policy that is just at the heart of the Democratic Party.

You know, if you didn't hear from Walter Cronkite or David Brinkley, it didn't happen. Now, we have this alternate media environment where facts actually matter. I just can't envision a candidacy like Sanders, if he were to getting the nod, surviving, given the fact, Mr. Speaker, that it's going to get out there, that his name is on a bill that would quite literally cancel people's insurance plan. I mean, as we saw with the Culinary Union fight in Nevada, this isn't even popular with union Democrats who can't stand Bernie Sanders' ideas.

It is a \"gosh, I love a nice future where I didn't have to pay back my student loans, where all -- everything was free, where somebody took care of me.

But if you look -- I'm working on a new book for this summer, laying out the choice on this campaign. And I'm devoting an entire chapter to what I'm calling the radical 200 in the House, because if you're start going down the list, you know, this isn't five or 10 or 15 people. This isn't AOC and \"The Squad\". The entire Democratic Party is marching off of a left wing cliff and doing so with bills -- there's a bill, for example, that would raise the FICA tax and your Social Security tax by 19 percent, and it has 206 Democrats signed on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I mean, something is going on in our party where they've all touched with reality.",

Buttigieg needs a comeback and Senator Amy Klobuchar needs to make her mark. Now, of course, anxiety looms over technology the state party plans to use to administer the caucuses and factor in early votes which is a first for this state. Today, the Nevada Democrats sent a memo to the campaign saying they're going to scrap a Google form they plan to use to report the results and instead use a phone-based system sparking concern among some of the campaigns.

They loved what happened in 2000 when we had to go to the Supreme Court, to resolve the election, anything that sows discord among Americans is good for the Russians. But the idea that an American president is a Russian agent or that the Russians really have a preference for who gets elected president and that that preference is actually reflected in the result really does sound more like science fiction or perhaps CNN reporting. I have to tell you about CNN -- CNN actually doctored a recording of my answer to a question in the United States Senate. They doctored a recording. They left out the critical statement before. They left out critical statement after. They doctored it, so much for CNN. And you see, you just can't trust anything that's on that station.

And I believe for the purposes of this segment, the two key takeaways, a lot of them, the two key takeaways are this case was always the dossier. The Papadopoulos story is a complete look squirrel moment. They opened up a case and spied on a presidential candidate because of a fake paid for a political document and they invented a cover story. And I want to just hit two key dates with you. July 5th, they said they didn't open the case until July 31st, but on July 5th, their meeting with Steele, the FBI in London and conveniently right before they open up the case, Christopher Steele's meeting with Nellie Ohr and Bruce Ohr from Fusion GPS, and on the Justice Department.

They're going to go wherever that takes them, but a quick point and I agree with Alan Dershowitz on this -- Russia wants to sow chaos, right? And think about this -- they don't even need to worry about the Kremlin, the GRU or their agents. They have their agents right here in the United States that are buying their chaos hook, line and sinker. They just put something out there, and then we see the Democrats, we see the anti-Trump media, and everybody just on board dishing out disinformation coming straight from Russia.

Twenty-nine percent say yes, 70 percent say no, you should not ban handguns or take away people's guns in a capacity. It is a losing issue. As for another clip that you played from \"The View\" with Michael Eric Dyson, where he says, that, OK, gone with the wind. You know, when the president evokes that, that's racist. There was a time last year, MSNBC, CNN used the word racist or racism 4,100 times, not in a year, not in a month, in one week July 14th through the 21st. So, when we hear this whole thing that, yes, the president's saying because it's a dog whistle because it's racist, I think it's lost its impact at this point and it's why many odds makers right now have him as a prohibitive favorite to win reelection because Democrats don't have a bumper sticker message of optimism, what are you going to do to make people's lives better?

So, it was a long time held Republicans seat here in Illinois 14, the northern part of the state here, and it was flipped by a Democrat socialist Lauren Underwood, who's an honorary Squad member now. She campaigned as a moderate, as a lot of these people did back in 2018, but quickly, we realized that they are socialist. And so, what they're doing is they're trying to infiltrate all these districts, especially long- held Republican seats. And so, it has energized, especially, but -- especially by somebody like myself who works for President Trump. You know, the \"America First\" agenda is so important and we need to bring it back to these long-held Republican seats, to ensure that we are fighting on the side of freedom. But it's also more important that the GOP has new faces and new perspective now to carry that torch, to really counter-attack these far left, especially women, on the other side of the aisle.

According to the latest data, the DNC is less than $10 million cash on hand. In contrast, the RNC has nearly $80 million. Meanwhile, the 2020 candidates aren't faring much better. While President Trump builds a massive war chest, his potential opponents are hemorrhaging money on the campaign trail. Of course, none of this matters to billionaire Mike Bloomberg who is literally trying to buy the race. Bloomberg has so much money. He's actually paying ordinary Americans to say nice things about him online. But that's not all. His latest spending spree involves a series of weird billboards, including one that attacks the president for how his steaks are prepared, and another one that reads, quote, Donald Trump cheats at golf. Mike Bloomberg doesn't. It's real. We're not messing with you. As you can see, money can buy a lot of things but it can't buy a sense of humor or charisma. Apparently, it can't even buy good debate prep. And after Bloomberg's pathetic performance at this week's debate, Bernie Sanders is piling on. Check this out."

Joining us now with more is FOX News contributor and former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, thanks a lot for joining us tonight. The Democrats have tried this before. You've seen the McGovern candidacy, the Dukakis candidacy, the Mondale candidacy. And, Mr. Speaker, they all have one thing in common, going down in flames with this radical agreement that they had. Has the country changed that much that Bernie Sanders can actually have a shot at being president of the United States?"

We elected a guy from Arkansas who had no particular claim to be ready to be president. So, you know, a wide range of people have won the presidency. And I think those of us who watch in amazement as Donald Trump wiped out 16 competitors before taking on Clinton and beating her, I don't want to be presumptive. So I would say that Sanders has a very distance possibility of winning. But it's a much greater likelihood of taking the entire Democratic ticket down, ending Pelosi's speakership. He's the greatest gift to Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the House, you could possibly hope for, because Sanders really is the true Democratic Party. He represents all of the big government ideas, all the radicalism, all of the weird foreign policy that is just at the heart of the Democratic Party. And I think that the contrast between President Trump and his record, particularly on the economy, but just in general. I mean, think about the Trump judges and then ask, you know, can Sanders give us a list of people he would nominate to the Supreme Court? They would all be radicals. So, it could end up being one of the great historic campaigns in American history."

You know, if you didn't hear from Walter Cronkite or David Brinkley, it didn't happen. Now, we have this alternate media environment where facts actually matter. I just can't envision a candidacy like Sanders, if he were to getting the nod, surviving, given the fact, Mr. Speaker, that it's going to get out there, that his name is on a bill that would quite literally cancel people's insurance plan. I mean, as we saw with the Culinary Union fight in Nevada, this isn't even popular with union Democrats who can't stand Bernie Sanders' ideas.

Bernie Sanders essentially is a bumper sticker. It is a \"gosh, I love a nice future where I didn't have to pay back my student loans, where all -- everything was free, where somebody took care of me. And Sanders represents in that sense a sort of a myth. And it's very hard to fight a myth with facts. Now, everybody who is open to facts will peel away, ultimately, and a campaign which laid out what Sanders really would mean I think would be devastating. But if you look -- I'm working on a new book for this summer, laying out the choice on this campaign. And I'm devoting an entire chapter to what I'm calling the radical 200 in the House, because if you're start going down the list, you know, this isn't five or 10 or 15 people. This isn't AOC and \"The Squad\". The entire Democratic Party is marching off of a left wing cliff and doing so with bills -- there's a bill, for example, that would raise the FICA tax and your Social Security tax by 19 percent, and it has 206 Democrats signed on. I mean, something is going on in our party where they've all touched with reality."

There's no such thing. And he keeps citing examples, Mr. Speaker, that don't exist. He keeps saying, in other words, he keeps citing Denmark and Scandinavian countries. We need to be more socialist like the Danes. Well, when you actually ask people in Denmark, like the one of the foreign leaders, Lars Rasmussen, who was actually offended by the characterization of Denmark. They're a market economy. It doesn't work, and he's making this up. He's a genuine radical but he's using non-radical examples like Denmark and Scandinavia to sell ideas. I believe he really believes it, hard socialism, not just Democratic socialism nonsense he keeps talking about it"

He's somewhere between a genuine communist and a very, very hard core socialist. But, he's also been around for a long time. He's learned the game. He's pretty good at shading things. The problem he's going to have, as any Democrat will have, is when you run into Donald Trump, you run into somebody who is willing to go head on, who uses the power of the enormous his Twitter following, which is larger than the three networks combined, and I think that ultimately, as I said a while ago, Bernie Sanders literally could be exactly the choice the country should face because then we have the real debate. I mean, do you want to go down the road of Zimbabwe and Venezuela and every -- Cuba, every failed centralized state in the world? Or do you want to continue creating jobs, have the best economy we've ever had, lowest unemployment rate for African-Americans and Latinos? You know, that's a pretty clear choice.

And tomorrow is really critical especially for the candidates who underperformed in Iowa and New Hampshire, especially former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. Neither of them clear the threshold of delegates there. Biden's been relying on a firewall of support from black voters in South Carolina to resuscitate his campaign, but if he doesn't do well here in Nevada, he could shake that support, and Warren needs to capitalize on a record of fund-raising after a very strong debate performance on Wednesday where she sparred with a former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, taking him to task over sexism allegation. Today, he agreed to release three women from nondisclosure agreements following a few days of criticism. Meantime the caucuses could provide a bigger edge for Senator Bernie Sanders who has the biggest donor base of any campaign, and he's neck and neck with former Mayor Pete Buttigieg in terms of delegates after Iowa and New Hampshire. Buttigieg needs a comeback and Senator Amy Klobuchar needs to make her mark. Now, of course, anxiety looms over technology the state party plans to use to administer the caucuses and factor in early votes which is a first for this state. Today, the Nevada Democrats sent a memo to the campaign saying they're going to scrap a Google form they plan to use to report the results and instead use a phone-based system sparking concern among some of the campaigns. And it is, by the way, the second time they shifted gears after the Iowa caucus results imploded when their app melted down -- Dan."

Well, there's a small problem with that, there's no evidence this ever happened. In fact, one former congressman who traveled with Biden to South Africa told, \"The Times\", quote, no, I was never arrested and I don't think he was either. The Biden campaign continues to implode right before our eyes.

And, conveniently, when he used to rail against millionaires and billionaires, he's now sliced the millionaire part out, and he's focusing solely on billionaires. This is an obvious -- almost Alinsky-ite tactic.

Now, I think the sad thing is people are talking about whether or not he's at risk because of his record or because of his wealth, the Bloomberg campaign is instead going to hinge on whether or not he seeks to define himself away from the rest of this field, and in particular Bernie Sanders.

But, Ari, is there space anymore in this modern Democrat Party for that? I mean, people forget, it was Bill Clinton who gave the State of the Union speech and said the era of big government is over.

And that used to be a word that Democrats ran for them because they knew they couldn't get elected. Now, you can't get nominated if you don't consider yourself a liberal -- to the point now where Bernie, the socialist, actually is in the lead and likely is going to win the nomination.

And \"The New York Times\" and almost nothing that you read in \"New York Times\" isn't slanted by bias that's liberal an anti-Trump narrative got it wrong fundamentally. They misreported that the Russians prefer Trump. That's not what the intelligence said. But they borrowed it almost word-for-word directly from the intelligence community assessment report on the 2016 election. I was cited in my book, I regretted today, it's almost word-for-word, the same thing.

They loved what happened in 2000 when we had to go to the Supreme Court, to resolve the election, anything that sows discord among Americans is good for the Russians. But the idea that an American president is a Russian agent or that the Russians really have a preference for who gets elected president and that that preference is actually reflected in the result really does sound more like science fiction or perhaps CNN reporting. I have to tell you about CNN -- CNN actually doctored a recording of my answer to a question in the United States Senate. They doctored a recording. They left out the critical statement before. They left out critical statement after. They doctored it, so much for CNN. And you see, you just can't trust anything that's on that station.

And I believe for the purposes of this segment, the two key takeaways, a lot of them, the two key takeaways are this case was always the dossier. The Papadopoulos story is a complete look squirrel moment. They opened up a case and spied on a presidential candidate because of a fake paid for a political document and they invented a cover story. And I want to just hit two key dates with you. July 5th, they said they didn't open the case until July 31st, but on July 5th, their meeting with Steele, the FBI in London and conveniently right before they open up the case, Christopher Steele's meeting with Nellie Ohr and Bruce Ohr from Fusion GPS, and on the Justice Department.

They're going to go wherever that takes them, but a quick point and I agree with Alan Dershowitz on this -- Russia wants to sow chaos, right? And think about this -- they don't even need to worry about the Kremlin, the GRU or their agents. They have their agents right here in the United States that are buying their chaos hook, line and sinker. They just put something out there, and then we see the Democrats, we see the anti-Trump media, and everybody just on board dishing out disinformation coming straight from Russia. That includes Hillary Clinton, John Brennan, Eric Holder and everybody else in the media, Chris O'Donnell, that wants to dish out rush disinformation.

And then you have social media and the Paul Reveres that are on there as well. For Joe Biden, to start saying that he's going to be going after guns, let me just read you one Gallup poll question on the matter that just came out recently, do you think there should or should not be a law that would ban the possession of handguns especially by police -- except by police, excuse me -- and other authorized persons. Twenty-nine percent say yes, 70 percent say no, you should not ban handguns or take away people's guns in a capacity. It is a losing issue. As for another clip that you played from \"The View\" with Michael Eric Dyson, where he says, that, OK, gone with the wind. You know, when the president evokes that, that's racist. There was a time last year, MSNBC, CNN used the word racist or racism 4,100 times, not in a year, not in a month, in one week July 14th through the 21st. So, when we hear this whole thing that, yes, the president's saying because it's a dog whistle because it's racist, I think it's lost its impact at this point and it's why many odds makers right now have him as a prohibitive favorite to win reelection because Democrats don't have a bumper sticker message of optimism, what are you going to do to make people's lives better?

So, you know, this is -- this is sort of driving a reaction here, just like impeachment did, and I think that's probably a good thing."

But I know this is an interest -- this is an area of interest that's central to your campaign, this socialism bent we've taken with candidates like AOC and the Squad. What are you going to do though to get the message out about how devastating these ideas are?"

      "speaker": "LAUF",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, let's not sugarcoat the fact that socialism is just one step away from communism. And, you know, look, I'm running in a district that President Trump won in 2016. So, it was a long time held Republicans seat here in Illinois 14, the northern part of the state here, and it was flipped by a Democrat socialist Lauren Underwood, who's an honorary Squad member now. She campaigned as a moderate, as a lot of these people did back in 2018, but quickly, we realized that they are socialist. And so, what they're doing is they're trying to infiltrate all these districts, especially long- held Republican seats. And so, it has energized, especially, but -- especially by somebody like myself who works for President Trump. You know, the \"America First\" agenda is so important and we need to bring it back to these long-held Republican seats, to ensure that we are fighting on the side of freedom. But it's also more important that the GOP has new faces and new perspective now to carry that torch, to really counter-attack these far left, especially women, on the other side of the aisle. So, head to CatalinaforCongress.com to join our movement, and we hope to have success here in 2020."

      "utterance": "Congressman Biggs, just a quick answer for you. Do you think this Bernie Sanders socialism bent, do you think they have a shot of pulling this out? Does Sanders have a shot at becoming the nominee or will the establishmentarian shut him down? I think he's going to be their nominee and then you're going to have a potential Nixon-McGovern type ‘72 election outcome. That'd be great, wouldn't it?"
