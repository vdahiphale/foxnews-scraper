And that's why the biggest problem in black America today isn't between whites and blacks, it is internal. And Elizabeth Warren and people who continue to emphasize the external enemy are preaching a false solution. Black America's destiny has never been determined by what white people do or do not do. But yet -- but that's what we are left with, and so what I think that it deflects attention away from the real problems, and that is the people who are supposed to be serving those communities, racism is not the most formidable problem -- it is a problem. The real problem is the kind of betrayal by the leaders of these cities in the last 50 years. The urban communities where you have the highest crime, the most drug infested have been run by liberal black Democrats for 50 years. And the question is -- and we've spent $22 trillion in these places -- and yet, the problems are getting worse. In Forsyth County, Tucker, in 1914, the Klan drove a thousand blacks out. In Washington, D.C., 20,000 blacks in the last 20 years have been driven out by gentrification.

Unfortunately, they're getting crushed. Watch, for example, what happened when Congressman Tim Ryan tried to remind his fellow Democrats that most Americans don't actually support open borders, much less giving free taxpayer funded healthcare to foreign nationals who break our laws.

I quite frankly, don't think that that is an agenda that we can move forward on and win.

It goes without saying that they must be racist, every single one of them. Tim Ryan is probably racist for thinking about them. The modern Democratic Party has zero use for these kinds of people. They've been excluded from the emerging Al Sharpton private equity coalition that defines the Democratic Party. So apparently, is anyone who cares about what voters think. Several times last night, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders personally attacked any candidate who dared point out, there might be a limit to how many unpopular ideas you can impose on a nation that is supposed to be a democracy. The very idea that you'd have to win popular support for your policies seem to enrage them. Warren, especially.

There are a lot of weak men in the Democratic Party, not just on last night's debate stage. It's one of the party's biggest problems actually. A normal candidate would have roasted her. Laws matter? Please. Elizabeth Warren's entire immigration position is built on the premise that laws don't matter at all. That's the whole point of it. If laws mattered, we wouldn't have 22 million illegal aliens living inside our borders. Democrats wouldn't be working really 24/7 to give amnesty to every single one of them, which they are. If laws mattered, we wouldn't have sanctuary cities. If laws matter Democrats wouldn't be sharing Spanish language guides, telling the illegals how to evade immigration enforcement. If laws mattered, Kate Steinle and Mollie Tibbetts would still be alive. In a night of absurd declarations, Elizabeth Warren claiming the mantle of the law was the most incredible, but there was nobody there to call her on it. The moderates had all been gilded and silenced. Dana Perino hosts \"The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino\" and she joins us tonight. Dana, thanks a lot for coming on. You watch this and probably had the same reaction. It really seemed like orthodoxy enforcement. That was the task that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to some extent set out for themselves to make sure that nobody else in the party could get to the moderate end of their positions. Do you think they succeeded?"

But now it has shifted so far to the left that they're considered -- we're calling them moderates or conservative Democrats, that's not how they describe themselves. But because Warren and Sanders decided to keep their alliance for now, that won't always last. We can talk about that in a moment. But they decided to link arms, it was like \"Red Rover, Red Rover, send Delaney right over,\" and he got bounced back and the audience couldn't even -- they couldn't even give him a courtesy clap. And what was interesting to me is I feel like even Barack Obama would have had a hard time in that crowd. He would have been in the group that was trying to be intellectually honest.

They've been sounding the alarm bell saying, \"Whoa, Nelly, Democrats tap the brakes.\" Tom Friedman, I think has the headline of his column that week was \"The revolution is not going to happen in 2020.\" They are desperately trying to get them to realize that if you actually want to win a general election, in your fantasies, the Electoral College doesn't exist. In reality, the Electoral College exists, and it probably will for our lifetime, Tucker. But I worry about it. We've talked about it. Remember, a year and a half ago, I said watch the Democrats.

That's what the polling -- the internal polling for the Democrats is telling them forget what I think, like they're begging them not to do this.

Let's just improve upon Obamacare. We tried so hard to get there.\" That's not where the party is. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last night, one of the things she tweeted was \"Single payer is actually Medicare-for-All,\" and a lot of conservatives, \"Yes. Thank you. That's what we have been trying to explain to you all along.\" I don't know if Biden will be able to thread that needle. However, you know, we've long been saying, well, Biden doesn't seem like he's got it all there. He has like really faltered in the debate. He is not doing that well. But Tucker, Democrats seem to like him and his poll numbers have not gone down. We'll see how he does this week.

Everything that we're talking about here tonight is what's wrong with American politics. And the Democratic Party needs to understand that we should be the party that talks not just about symptoms, but also about causes. If you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark Psychic Force of the collectivized hatred that this President is bringing up in this country, then I'm afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days."

And I think part of the reason why she is getting so much attention is all the Democrats are basically saying similar things to each other, and she is really the only one that's, you know, standing there speaking differently.

So he says that, \"People are going to think that I'm trolling, but compared to what else is up on the stage, I think Marianne Williamson is actually winning this thing. This is amazing. No question she seems to be doing the biggest applause of the night.\" And he is right, because if you watched last night, I mean, she really did seem to draw the biggest applause lines of the night. And I also thought another tweet was interesting as well from \"National Journal's\" Josh Kraushaar and he tweeted this. He said, \"I bet Williamson hits five percent in post-debate polls,\" because right now, Tucker, she has really just been polling at one percent, and for the next set of debates in September, the stakes rise, you've got to hit two percent, I think in four polls. And then I believe it's 130,000 unique donors. And there's a different variation of that from you know, I think 400 from 20 different states, so the stakes do get higher. So, she is certainly going to have to reach those goals if she wants to be in the next set of debates."

      "speaker": "WOODSON",
      "utterance": "I have no idea. But as a veteran of the Civil Rights Movement, I find her comments insulting, condescending and patronizing. It also acts as a barrier for the exploration of real solutions that exists for places like Baltimore and low income blacks. And I think that her continuing to harp on it is really harmful to any kind of discussion. But it also conceals the kind of real problems that exist. As a veteran of the movement, I remember back in the 60s, I left that movement, because many of the blacks who suffered and sacrificed most did not benefit from the change. Dr. King said, \"What good does it do to have the right to eat in a restaurant if you don't have the means to exercise it.\" But middle income blacks used the demographics and the behavior of low income blacks as the bait and switch came when the money arrived. And that's why the biggest problem in black America today isn't between whites and blacks, it is internal. And Elizabeth Warren and people who continue to emphasize the external enemy are preaching a false solution. Black America's destiny has never been determined by what white people do or do not do. But yet -- but that's what we are left with, and so what I think that it deflects attention away from the real problems, and that is the people who are supposed to be serving those communities, racism is not the most formidable problem -- it is a problem. The real problem is the kind of betrayal by the leaders of these cities in the last 50 years. The urban communities where you have the highest crime, the most drug infested have been run by liberal black Democrats for 50 years. And the question is -- and we've spent $22 trillion in these places -- and yet, the problems are getting worse. In Forsyth County, Tucker, in 1914, the Klan drove a thousand blacks out. In Washington, D.C., 20,000 blacks in the last 20 years have been driven out by gentrification. But you don't see these leaders addressing issues -- economic issues like that -- and it is because they can dodge, they can avoid confronting those issues because they use race as a shield."

There are three zip codes in Prince George's County where the median income for black families is $170,000.00. They are three times richer than most whites. If racism was a pervasive problem, then why are not all black suffering equally? And so I think it's time to stop this preoccupation with race and recalibrate and come together to address the problems of low income people of all races, and because answers exist. Jack Kemp is your perfect example."

It's pure virtue signaling. It's what all these people are doing.

I think of like the bans on plastic straws now that have appeared in many cities in America. Actually, plastic straws are like 0.001 percent of the plastic in the ocean. Most plastic in the ocean is commercial fishing equipment that's been left behind. This isn't doing a thing to help the environment.

      "speaker": "BIRO",
      "utterance": "Well, that's -- I can answer that quite easily because Obama's former DHS Secretary, Jeh Johnson said that this would be a catastrophic problem that it would create an overburden on our system of government here. So, I take him at his word. Obama knew what he was doing when he put him in that position. That's why I was his Campaign Director. He knew what he was doing. He was once labeled the deporter in chief, and we caught a lot of flack for that, but he was upholding the laws of our country. I think right now, you know, honestly, in my party, there are members who are -- they're missing an opportunity here because every credible poll shows that immigration is in the top three concerns for most American citizens in our country. And we're just not doing -- the best I heard last night was a casual mention that we're all for secure borders. I'd like to know how. Talk about that. What worked on Obama's plan and how you can make it better?"

Twenty two million people and anyone else who comes. How are going for that, would you say?"

And there, there were some moderate Democrats last night, who were being just that and Senator Klobuchar, very -- she was very intellectually honest. And she said, \"Hey, some of these sound like great ideas, but they'll never pass Congress.\" They just won't work, and we need to be honest. You know, I have all respect for everybody that was up on that stage last night. But honestly, some of their proposals sound to me like they were written for press releases, rather than for policies that may actually stand the chance of passing."

Can you win a general election promising free healthcare to the world?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIRO",
      "utterance": "You know, that comes back to election politics. We're talking about winning the Democratic nomination, so that they're talking about the primary. So, I understand that the pivot to the left to capture the hearts of our voters. But we'd also need to look past that at the general. You'd have -- you can't just completely change your position come the general election. There can be some nuance changes, but you can't just all of a sudden on a dime, change your position to try and be more electable to the general public."

      "utterance": "Well, CNN spent more than two years, two of the longest years of most of our lifetimes obsessed with Russia. And yet last night, there was not a single question about Russia. Weird, since the President is a Russian plant. Amnesia has set in. We will tell you why, next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, between 2016 and about 20 minutes ago, the cable news network had a single obsessive focus, Russia. For two and a half years, every day at CNN revolved around finding the proof that Donald Trump, Carter Page and Roger Stone teamed up with Vladimir Putin to make America a Russian fiefdom. And then last night happened, suddenly the country that supposedly hacked our democracy -- hacked our democracy -- didn't exist anymore. Russia barely came up at all last night in the debate. CNN did not ask a single question about Robert Mueller's two-year investigation. Just because Russia was gone doesn't mean that CNN is now a serious news network again. Far from it. Instead, CNN's Don Lemon ask candidates what they plan to do to stop President Trump's racism."

How do you convince primary voters that you'd be the best nominee to take on President Trump and heal the racial divide in America? Senator Klobuchar, what do you say to those Trump voters who prioritize the economy over the President's bigotry?"

So Chris, I realized watching those clips of Don Lemon that basically racism it's just the -- it's just the new \"R\" word after Russia. It's the same storyline. They have given up on Russia, now the just moved to race. Right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRIS PLANTE, RADIO SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Right, exactly right. I mean, you know, the Russia bone had to be pried from their cold dead hands, but after two and a half years, as you said, every hour, every block, every panel, every anchor, every furrowed brow, Magilla Gorilla, you know, Chris Cuomo late at night rubbing his chin and the latest conspiracy theory and all of it turned out to be false. All of it turned out to go up and smoke. They put all of their eggs in this basket, the Russian collusion and then the Mueller investigation, the Mueller report, then the Mueller testimony, and all of it has blown up in their faces. And now they kind of act like -- it's like Emily Litella -- never mind -- and they just moved on. And now the new conspiracy theory is racism. If you're talking about crime and Baltimore, it's racist. Rats in Baltimore, it's racist. Poverty in Baltimore, it's racist. And it is just the new \"R\" word. And as you said, they didn't even bring it up. How can you spend -- if you were a viewer watching CNN and trusting them and believing them for the last two or three years, and you were watching last night, didn't you stop and say, \"Well, what about what you've been telling us for the last two years?\""

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, that is such a good point. I mean, if you took CNN at face value, literally, then we had a Russian operation that had hacked our democracy, the highest level of government in this country was controlled by the Kremlin. How can they not be interested in that? How can they not follow up on a story that momentous? I'm confused."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PLANTE",
      "utterance": "It's extraordinary. They -- well, look, I mean, it does -- they have egg all over their faces if they stopped to think about it. There's not a lot of self-analysis going on there. But they've been humiliated by their own fraudulent reporting for a couple of years. And maybe they just don't want to draw attention to it in the meeting beforehand, \"Maybe we just don't want to bring that up, because it kind of makes us look bad.\" And certainly, the candidates don't want to talk about Russian collusion. They don't want to talk about Mueller's testimony. They don't want to talk about any of this stuff, because they'd look stupid. And CNN would of course, look stupid, too. They don't want that, which is why they brought Don Lemon out."

They have some magic trick for making more money with lower ratings. I don't know how that works. But then with the anchors like Don Lemon, the organization is a complete embarrassment. I was -- I was wondering whether we might be able to sue them for sort of ex-post facto defamation of character or something. Because it's a disgrace to have to admit that I worked there for 17 years and I was in the news business and look at the place now, it's a disgrace. And Don Lemon, I think is their finest journalist. He's the Walter Cronkite of his generation in CNN."
