They could have asked Kavanaugh about it at any time during his hearings; he was sitting right in front of them. And that's of course what you would do if you cared about the answer to the question. But they didn't. Instead they waited and the point of course was to derail his nomination. The timing was entirely political, anyone who says otherwise is not telling the truth. But what about the core story itself, what happened in the early '80s in suburban Maryland Well, come to your own conclusions, people will come to their own conclusions. But for this show, we are not dismissing Christine Ford as a liar. Doesn't seem like she is, it seems like she sincerely believes everything she is saying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But that does not mean that she is right. Human memory is notoriously unreliable, especially over time. What were you doing one drunk night in the spring of 1982 Don't remember clearly Of course you don't. It's been 36 years. Past a certain point, the past is unknowable and that's why we have statutes of limitation for crimes. Not because our desire for justice dims, but because the chance of achieving it does. Everybody knows this, the Left included. This story doesn't have anything to do with justice actually or even with what Brett Kavanaugh may have done in high school. Underneath it all, anyone who lives in Washington can tell you, it's about abortion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Does anyone really believe the story would have surfaced if Brett Kavanaugh had pledged allegiance to Roe v. Wade of course, it wouldn't have. Some of the very same people suggesting that Kavanaugh is a sex criminal once defended Bill Clinton when he was credibly accused of rape. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The same group practically beatified Ted Kennedy. Kennedy, you'll remember, once killed a woman. Not metaphorically killed her, but literally killed her. And yet Clinton and Kennedy supported abortion in all cases and therefore the Left treated them as heroes, and swept speaking of under the rug their crimes into the dustbin of memory. Kavanaugh, though, may not support Roe v. Wade, we don't really know. Therefore, he must be destroyed. It's pretty straightforward. Whatever the story is, it's not about protecting women, don't buy that spin. The larger lesson though of this moment in actually over the past two years is that the Left will not abide losing power, even temporarily. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For liberals, political power is personal power. And without it, they are exposed and terrified. Some become vicious. If you've lost friends, since Trump got elected or been yelled at over dinner or on an airplane, you know exactly what we're talking about. Liberals believe they were meant to run this country, our government and our culture. They have no intention of sharing control with you. If they're not in charge, they'll burn it down, which is what they're doing now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The question, the political question, for right now is will the Republican Party let them do this If Republicans allow Kavanaugh's nomination to be derailed over an unprovable allegation you can't rebut, it's over, they'll never put a justice on the court again. It'll be too easy to stop them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A single charge from 35 years ago will be enough, that's the precedent they would set. And let us pause parenthetically and say we may learn more in the coming week. Who knows, and the calculation may change. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But as of today, there is no way to prove either way what happened 35 years ago in Bethesda, Maryland. It's an unsolvable mystery, again, unless something else comes up. So to just derail a nomination on the basis of it would be a brand new thing. Republican voters put up with a lot already, including a party leadership that does not share their values or even like them very much; it doesn't hide it well.

They suggested there was a dangerous person afoot and that's why they had to make everyone evacuate. They still won't say what the crime was or why a mandatory mass evacuation of people was necessary; someone had to leave their homes. Meanwhile the local sheriff told reporters he does not know of any criminal investigation at all. We of course called the FBI, which continues to tell us that they cannot confirm or deny any investigation. Maybe it's nothing, maybe it's not, but we're going to stay on it and continue our own independent investigation.

According to a White House statement released late today, the records also include FBI interviews with senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr all matters to the Russia case because of his connection to the Trump dossier. After the former British spy behind the dossier was fired by the FBI in November 2016, documents show that the spy, Christopher Steele, maintained contact with the FBI and other government officials by using Bruce Ohr as a back-channel. The declassification also calls for the unprecedented release of text messages related to Russia, clean copies without sections blacked out, from former FBI Director James Comey, his deputy Andrew McCabe, Ohr, as well as former FBI agent Peter Strzok, the former FBI lawyer Lisa Paige. Until now, some texts were available, but with significant redactions. A source familiar with the records requested by House Republicans told Fox they expect to see exculpatory evidence about Trump campaign aides Carter Page as well as George Papadopoulos who recently played guilty to lying to federal investigators and got 14 days in jail. In the last few minutes, a Justice Department spokesperson told Fox they're already working on the request, but emphasized it is a process. The House Intelligence Committee's Ranking Democrat Adam Schiff called the President's move, \"An abuse of power, not about transparency.\" Tucker."

But they didn't. Instead they waited and the point of course was to derail his nomination. The timing was entirely political, anyone who says otherwise is not telling the truth. But what about the core story itself, what happened in the early '80s in suburban Maryland Well, come to your own conclusions, people will come to their own conclusions. But for this show, we are not dismissing Christine Ford as a liar. Doesn't seem like she is, it seems like she sincerely believes everything she is saying. But that does not mean that she is right. Human memory is notoriously unreliable, especially over time. What were you doing one drunk night in the spring of 1982 Don't remember clearly Of course you don't. It's been 36 years. Past a certain point, the past is unknowable and that's why we have statutes of limitation for crimes. Not because our desire for justice dims, but because the chance of achieving it does. Everybody knows this, the Left included. This story doesn't have anything to do with justice actually or even with what Brett Kavanaugh may have done in high school. Underneath it all, anyone who lives in Washington can tell you, it's about abortion. Does anyone really believe the story would have surfaced if Brett Kavanaugh had pledged allegiance to Roe v. Wade of course, it wouldn't have. Some of the very same people suggesting that Kavanaugh is a sex criminal once defended Bill Clinton when he was credibly accused of rape. The same group practically beatified Ted Kennedy. Kennedy, you'll remember, once killed a woman. Not metaphorically killed her, but literally killed her. And yet Clinton and Kennedy supported abortion in all cases and therefore the Left treated them as heroes, and swept speaking of under the rug their crimes into the dustbin of memory. Kavanaugh, though, may not support Roe v. Wade, we don't really know. Therefore, he must be destroyed. It's pretty straightforward. Whatever the story is, it's not about protecting women, don't buy that spin. The larger lesson though of this moment in actually over the past two years is that the Left will not abide losing power, even temporarily. For liberals, political power is personal power. And without it, they are exposed and terrified. Some become vicious. If you've lost friends, since Trump got elected or been yelled at over dinner or on an airplane, you know exactly what we're talking about. Liberals believe they were meant to run this country, our government and our culture. They have no intention of sharing control with you. If they're not in charge, they'll burn it down, which is what they're doing now. The question, the political question, for right now is will the Republican Party let them do this If Republicans allow Kavanaugh's nomination to be derailed over an unprovable allegation you can't rebut, it's over, they'll never put a justice on the court again. It'll be too easy to stop them. A single charge from 35 years ago will be enough, that's the precedent they would set. And let us pause parenthetically and say we may learn more in the coming week. Who knows, and the calculation may change. But as of today, there is no way to prove either way what happened 35 years ago in Bethesda, Maryland. It's an unsolvable mystery, again, unless something else comes up. So to just derail a nomination on the basis of it would be a brand new thing. Republican voters put up with a lot already, including a party leadership that does not share their values or even like them very much; it doesn't hide it well. They vote Republican anyway in part because they would like to see judges who care about the Constitution sitting on the Supreme Court. Once that's gone, what's the point of voting Republican.

But it's also Orwellian in that its basic claims are the very opposite of the truth. Because of course Trump is not evidence of democracy is dying, he is the product of self-government, like it or not. Almost nobody in power in this country on either side wanted him to become President. They outspent him two-to-one, they attacked his voters as immoral, they got the intel agencies to spy on his campaign, and he won anyway, because lots of people voted for him. That is the textbook definition of democracy; he won the Electoral College. But it's not the Left's definition of democracy. Hillary Clinton didn't like the outcome of the election. So now she demands that we change the Constitution and write new rules that would insure more Democrats would win. Out with the Electoral College, in with California and New York choosing the President, along of course with the tiny group of Left-wing billionaire tech oligarchs, who control our access to all news and information. That's the Hillary version of democracy, fewer people making decisions. Other leading Democrats seem to agree with this all of a sudden.

They suggested there was a dangerous person afoot and that's why they had to make everyone evacuate. They still won't say what the crime was or why a mandatory mass evacuation of people was necessary; someone had to leave their homes. Meanwhile the local sheriff told reporters he does not know of any criminal investigation at all. We of course called the FBI, which continues to tell us that they cannot confirm or deny any investigation. Maybe it's nothing, maybe it's not, but we're going to stay on it and continue our own independent investigation. State of California was for many years a paradise for the middle class in this country. People moved there from everywhere. But increasingly it's becoming an unlivable dystopia for normal people.

What they do is they come from out of town, because they know they're not going to be prosecuted, and then they also target areas such as the Painted Ladies here and other areas like North Beach and Pier 39, where they hit tourists, because tourists won't stick around for the prosecution.

We shouldn't be having people taking law enforcement into their own hands. What this lady did was extremely dangerous. And in the circumstance of the individuals that broke into her car--"

And the problem is, in the instance -- let me give you an example, the instance where the individuals broke into her car and they jumped into another car, there are rules that the police Commission here in San Francisco have set, where the police department cannot chase once they get into a car. So, you could break into a place in San Francisco, and as soon as you get into a vehicle, if it's a property crime, the police department is ordered not to chase you."

    {
      "speaker": "VERONESE",
      "utterance": "Well that particular law was written to prevent high-speed chases in high urban areas. But really what we should be doing in San Francisco is taking a look at laws that were well intended and changing them to make sure that they are effective. And the problem in San Francisco, and this is true throughout the country, is that when you attack a progressive law, you're attacking with - it's seen as attacking progressive, as opposed to being a leader and taking a leadership position. And that's the real problem, is that when we see faults in our ideal -- our progressive ideals, we should be correcting them, we should be going back and saying this isn't making sense, it's not working, put some metrics behind it, trying to find out what the success metrics are.

And we're building these large institutions that aren't really based on any kind of success metrics. We should not be stepping over those individuals in BART stations.

The FISA applications, if you look at what's redacted, everyone thinks there's all kinds of interesting stuff in there. Most of it is actually just the boilerplate form you have to fill in to get the application. It's just box checking, which is a lot of what this stupid paperwork is. And then when you actually look at the main section of probable cause that Carter Page is a Russian spy, they explain that Russia is a sovereign state, its capital city is Moscow, they've been spying on Americans since the end of the Second World War, blah blah blah. If you actually take the justification they have for spying on an American citizen, it's absolutely minimal.

Ben Sasse, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake One of you soft pieces of bleep should grab this once in a career opportunity.\" I could go on -- actually I can't do it, it's too annoying.

It's ruthless forensic logic, it's utterly persuasive, it's right up there with calling your political opponent's supporters the dregs of society, and that's the way these guys are doing it. This guy, Rob Delaney, it's interesting to me by the way how I am a drag of society. I don't know whether you can be a singular dreg, but I am. And I'm interested -- always interested to know how high up the dregs go to the Hollywood guys. One of these people who's mad about it, Jeffrey Wright who played Felix Leiter in a couple of Bond movies a few years back, Jeffrey Wright says Christine Ford will now face barbaric Republican wrath and also lifelong ostracizing by Kavanaugh's insular suburban Maryland seersucker and dock siders country club set. You're wearing dock siders tonight, Tucker. You're probably wearing seersucker suit under that phony suit you've got on top of it. So the dregs of society includes people in seersucker suits. Hollywood elite, it would be much easier for Joe Biden and Eric Holder and the Hollywood crowd to make a list of people who are qualified to opine and discourse and participate in the public life of the nation, because it doesn't seem to be a very long list in a nation of 300 million."
