Now, the 2020 hopefuls -- they have been put on notice. Everyone in the Democratic Party, you better fall in line or, A, you might be called a racist, or B, they are keeping the squad, the equivalent of an enemies list of fellow Democrats that oppose them, I guess, so that they can campaign against them. It's getting that ugly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the squad has already lobbed racism charges against both President Trump and even their own speaker, Nancy Pelosi. And while Nancy Pelosi is totally powerless, as we've been telling you, to defend herself, the president is firing back in a big way. Just moments ago, the president wrapped up what was a massive rally in Greenville, in North Carolina, where he had a very special message for the new radical leaders of this Democratic extreme socialist party.

Cortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be. Can you believe that? That's what she's saying?

Few politicians have had the courage to call out the radical base of the Democratic Party, but that's why you, we, the American people elected Donald Trump in spite of what New York, California, Washington, and other liberal states wanted. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And while the media mob, the Democrats attacked the president, they do compulsively, obsessively, well, the approval rating among Republicans keeps going way up. And today, new poll show the president's numbers actually increased by five points. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to another poll, 49 percent of likely voters, certainly a plurality believe the accusation of racism against President Trump are nothing more than a political ploy. That is up six percentage points over the last poll conducted. And here's why: let me help educate the radical masses. While you may not like it, the term love it, love America, leave America, there's nothing to do with race. And, by the way, it is hardly a new characteristic or concept to the loudest critics of the -- what we call dell blame America first crowd. Was it racist for Senator Kamala Harris to tell President Trump that he needs to \"go back from where he came from\"? She did that today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And get this -- in 2016, scores of celebrities, other media elites, remember they all vowed to leave the United States if President Trump was elected. Oh, yes, there are their names. Well, there is nothing racist about that. They didn't like him. The only problem, none of them actually left. Even offered a plane with caviar and champagne, but they had to promise to never come back. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And tonight, when the media mob and the Democrats focused their daily attacks on the president every second, minute, hour, of every 24-hour day, it's just one pathetic last ditch effort to take the president down. They still have not accepted the 2016 election results of we, the people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A nine-month FBI investigation, we'll use the words of Lisa Page, nothing. They found nothing. Peter Strzok, no \"there\" there as it relates to a conclusion, conspiracy to conspire with Russia. The bipartisan Senate investigation -- same result, nothing. The House investigation, nothing. Mueller concluded, no conspiracy at all with Russia, no collusion. And, of course, no obstruction as per the attorney, deputy attorney general and office the legal counsel. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, their phantom charges of obstruction and collusion all fell short. And the likelihood is that one week from tonight, I am looking forward to this, when Mueller testifies before Congress, and I would even argue at this moment, if he is silly enough to testify before Congress, because he'll have to answer real questions from real Republicans, I would say the odds are very high that it will be another boomerang against the Democrats. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Even if Devin Nunes is right, they are likely coordinating what they are going to say and how he's going to respond -- why do I suspect that they would do something like that? Now, what do Democrats have left in their playbook? All right, Russia, Russia, Russia. That is a dud. Obstruction, obstruction, a dud. OK, we'll try racism, racism. That will be a dud too. Let's use the playbook the Democrats use in every election season, although it's not every two and four years anymore. As I've always laid out and to show you ad after ad after ad that they aired and the history of. No, it's like every day now. You have hysteria boiling over. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Democratic Congressman Al Green, he actually launched what was the first of probably many pathetic attempts to impeach the president resoundly defeated in the House of Representatives. This is a national embarrassment.

Omar now plans to introduce the resolution declaring her support for the anti- Semitic BDS movement which is a boycott all things Israel. And Omar and other members of her squad are now the perfect representation of today's two-faced Democratic Party, built on selective and phony and feigned moral outrage. Each week, they call Trump, other Republicans racist, sexist, you know the routine. Yet no outrage over Omar's virulent anti-Semitism, no concern over Tlaib's work in Farrakhan's paper. Meanwhile, Democrat Ralph Northam, you know, the governor of the commonwealth of Virginia, apparently sleeping peacefully in the governor 's mansion after his fellow Democrats didn't really seem to care that he dressed up either in blackface or in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. I wonder if Donald Trump did that how they would react. 2020 Democrats are kissing the ring of Reverend Al Sharpton, who became well known for anti-Semitic bigoted language. We played a lot of it last night. Hillary Clinton's mentor, she said her mentor, Robert Byrd, used to be in the Ku Klux Klan.

We don't even have time to list all of the creepy, crazy, sleepy Uncle Joe's racist remarks and policies over the years. And let's talk about charges of sexual misconduct, again, selective, feigned moral outrage. Only when it's a Republican or Donald Trump or Donald Trump supporter or Donald Trump appointee. Remember that the I-believers in the Kavanaugh hearings? Well, they're nowhere to be found when a Democrat is accused of wrongdoing. Case in point, the lieutenant governor of Virginia who Gayle King interviewed, two women, one accused of a rape, another said violent sexual assault both telling people at the time he's still in office and I haven't heard a word from one of the I-believers. You got Keith Ellison. He got a promotion. Bill Clinton served two terms as president. What about the issue of Russia collusion? What, two and a half years of conspiracy theories, lies and a hoax, Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier put together by a foreign spy with funneled money filled with Russian lies as John Solomon will join us in a minute points out. Even the FBI knew 90-plus percent of it was a lie. And now, we also know that it was unverifiable, because, of course, Christopher Steele never stood behind his own dossier. I have no idea if it was true what he said under oath. And don't forget, the media just spent months hyping phantom claims of obstruction against Trump. Did any of them ever talk about Hillary's subpoenaed emails that she deleted and then the Bleach Bit to the hard drive, and acid washed the 33,000 emails, and then, of course, beating up the devices with hammers, removing SIM cards, and by the way, other evidence, all of that happening. So when you turn on conspiracy theory, Democrat state TV, either MSDNC or fake news CNN, and you hear the echo chamber and their fully typical daily freak out mode, just know that it's more selective moral outrage. They don't really care about these issues, they only care about them if they can use them to bludgeon a Republican, a conservative, or Trump or anybody that likes Trump, and nobody calls their bluff better than President Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Senator Lindsey Graham will join us in a moment with reaction. First, we turn to a very important story that we told you about last night. It's from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, investigative reporter. Last night, he presented an incredible new piece of evidence proving the FBI knew Christopher Steele's dirty Russian dossier that Hillary paid for was untrue, was unverifiable trash before it was used to acquire a FISA warrant against Trump campaign associate Carter Page to spy on then campaign Donald Trump, then transition team Trump and then President Trump. And according to Solomon, the FBI actually constructed a spreadsheet showing the validity of each of the dossier's lies, 90-plus percent garbage. They knew that it was garbage. They were warned before they even signed the FISA warrant it was garbage. And it is important to remember what Rod Rosenstein said about FISA warrants in May of 2018. Take a look.",

Understand this -- when James Comey said it was salacious and unverified, it turns out that was an understatement. It was complete garbage. Yet they took it to the court and but for that dossier, Andy McCabe told us this in his deposition, they don't get the warrant. Final point on this is, when Jim Baker, the Chief Counsel of the FBI and we deposed him, Sean, we asked him why - he told us he reviewed this FISA, normally he didn't review FISA. This is one of the very few he reviewed. We asked him why. He said, because I knew I'd be sitting in a committee room like this someday. They knew from the start this thing was a problem and they did it anyway. And as the President said, if they can do it to a President of the United States in his campaign, imagine what they can do to you and me.

The feds say the way MS-13 gang members rise in the ranks is by committing murders. And they are now accused of systematically and viciously killing at least seven people, using medieval style killing techniques that law enforcement authorities have not seen in two decades. One victim was killed for crossing out MS-13 graffiti. Another was a homeless man who made the fatal mistake of falling asleep in a park that MS-13 considers its turf.

Also, we begin tonight to the members of the, quote, squad ramping up their attacks on anyone and everyone who dares to disagree with their extreme, radical, socialist ideas. Now, the 2020 hopefuls -- they have been put on notice. Everyone in the Democratic Party, you better fall in line or, A, you might be called a racist, or B, they are keeping the squad, the equivalent of an enemies list of fellow Democrats that oppose them, I guess, so that they can campaign against them. It's getting that ugly. Now, the squad has already lobbed racism charges against both President Trump and even their own speaker, Nancy Pelosi. And while Nancy Pelosi is totally powerless, as we've been telling you, to defend herself, the president is firing back in a big way. Just moments ago, the president wrapped up what was a massive rally in Greenville, in North Carolina, where he had a very special message for the new radical leaders of this Democratic extreme socialist party.

And while the media mob, the Democrats attacked the president, they do compulsively, obsessively, well, the approval rating among Republicans keeps going way up. And today, new poll show the president's numbers actually increased by five points. According to another poll, 49 percent of likely voters, certainly a plurality believe the accusation of racism against President Trump are nothing more than a political ploy. That is up six percentage points over the last poll conducted."

And, by the way, it is hardly a new characteristic or concept to the loudest critics of the -- what we call dell blame America first crowd. Was it racist for Senator Kamala Harris to tell President Trump that he needs to \"go back from where he came from\"? She did that today. And get this -- in 2016, scores of celebrities, other media elites, remember they all vowed to leave the United States if President Trump was elected. Oh, yes, there are their names. Well, there is nothing racist about that. They didn't like him. The only problem, none of them actually left. Even offered a plane with caviar and champagne, but they had to promise to never come back. And tonight, when the media mob and the Democrats focused their daily attacks on the president every second, minute, hour, of every 24-hour day, it's just one pathetic last ditch effort to take the president down. They still have not accepted the 2016 election results of we, the people. A nine-month FBI investigation, we'll use the words of Lisa Page, nothing. They found nothing. Peter Strzok, no \"there\" there as it relates to a conclusion, conspiracy to conspire with Russia. The bipartisan Senate investigation -- same result, nothing. The House investigation, nothing. Mueller concluded, no conspiracy at all with Russia, no collusion. And, of course, no obstruction as per the attorney, deputy attorney general and office the legal counsel. So, their phantom charges of obstruction and collusion all fell short. And the likelihood is that one week from tonight, I am looking forward to this, when Mueller testifies before Congress, and I would even argue at this moment, if he is silly enough to testify before Congress, because he'll have to answer real questions from real Republicans, I would say the odds are very high that it will be another boomerang against the Democrats. Even if Devin Nunes is right, they are likely coordinating what they are going to say and how he's going to respond -- why do I suspect that they would do something like that? Now, what do Democrats have left in their playbook? All right, Russia, Russia, Russia. That is a dud. Obstruction, obstruction, a dud. OK, we'll try racism, racism. That will be a dud too. Let's use the playbook the Democrats use in every election season, although it's not every two and four years anymore. As I've always laid out and to show you ad after ad after ad that they aired and the history of. No, it's like every day now. You have hysteria boiling over. The Democratic Congressman Al Green, he actually launched what was the first of probably many pathetic attempts to impeach the president resoundly defeated in the House of Representatives. This is a national embarrassment. Will somebody please get these radical Democrats a Constitution and tell them to read it? If not, maybe we can have somebody read it for them.

No laughing matter, neither is al Qaeda or the way Americans talk about those that killed 3,000 of our Americans on 9/11, or the terrorist group Hezbollah. Yet Congresswoman Omar finds apparently all that to be somewhat humorous and funny as we previously have played on this program. Now, her behavior, obvious beliefs are pretty vile, pretty sickening. Omar now plans to introduce the resolution declaring her support for the anti- Semitic BDS movement which is a boycott all things Israel. And Omar and other members of her squad are now the perfect representation of today's two-faced Democratic Party, built on selective and phony and feigned moral outrage. Each week, they call Trump, other Republicans racist, sexist, you know the routine. Yet no outrage over Omar's virulent anti-Semitism, no concern over Tlaib's work in Farrakhan's paper. Meanwhile, Democrat Ralph Northam, you know, the governor of the commonwealth of Virginia, apparently sleeping peacefully in the governor 's mansion after his fellow Democrats didn't really seem to care that he dressed up either in blackface or in a Ku Klux Klan outfit. I wonder if Donald Trump did that how they would react. 2020 Democrats are kissing the ring of Reverend Al Sharpton, who became well known for anti-Semitic bigoted language. We played a lot of it last night. Hillary Clinton's mentor, she said her mentor, Robert Byrd, used to be in the Ku Klux Klan. Al Gore's father tried to block the 1964 Civil Rights Act, that historic legislation. Lyndon Johnson relied on Republican support to get it passed. The Democrats went forward with a filibuster. The list goes on. We don't even have time to list all of the creepy, crazy, sleepy Uncle Joe's racist remarks and policies over the years. And let's talk about charges of sexual misconduct, again, selective, feigned moral outrage. Only when it's a Republican or Donald Trump or Donald Trump supporter or Donald Trump appointee. Remember that the I-believers in the Kavanaugh hearings? Well, they're nowhere to be found when a Democrat is accused of wrongdoing. Case in point, the lieutenant governor of Virginia who Gayle King interviewed, two women, one accused of a rape, another said violent sexual assault both telling people at the time he's still in office and I haven't heard a word from one of the I-believers. You got Keith Ellison. He got a promotion. Bill Clinton served two terms as president. What about the issue of Russia collusion? What, two and a half years of conspiracy theories, lies and a hoax, Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier put together by a foreign spy with funneled money filled with Russian lies as John Solomon will join us in a minute points out. Even the FBI knew 90-plus percent of it was a lie. And now, we also know that it was unverifiable, because, of course, Christopher Steele never stood behind his own dossier. I have no idea if it was true what he said under oath. And don't forget, the media just spent months hyping phantom claims of obstruction against Trump. Did any of them ever talk about Hillary's subpoenaed emails that she deleted and then the Bleach Bit to the hard drive, and acid washed the 33,000 emails, and then, of course, beating up the devices with hammers, removing SIM cards, and by the way, other evidence, all of that happening. So when you turn on conspiracy theory, Democrat state TV, either MSDNC or fake news CNN, and you hear the echo chamber and their fully typical daily freak out mode, just know that it's more selective moral outrage. They don't really care about these issues, they only care about them if they can use them to bludgeon a Republican, a conservative, or Trump or anybody that likes Trump, and nobody calls their bluff better than President Trump. Senator Lindsey Graham will join us in a moment with reaction. First, we turn to a very important story that we told you about last night. It's from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, investigative reporter. Last night, he presented an incredible new piece of evidence proving the FBI knew Christopher Steele's dirty Russian dossier that Hillary paid for was untrue, was unverifiable trash before it was used to acquire a FISA warrant against Trump campaign associate Carter Page to spy on then campaign Donald Trump, then transition team Trump and then President Trump. And according to Solomon, the FBI actually constructed a spreadsheet showing the validity of each of the dossier's lies, 90-plus percent garbage. They knew that it was garbage. They were warned before they even signed the FISA warrant it was garbage. And it is important to remember what Rod Rosenstein said about FISA warrants in May of 2018. Take a look."

A FISA application is actually a warrant, just like a search warrant. In order to get a FISA search warrant, you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information in the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. And that's the way that we operate. And if it's wrong, sometimes it is, if you find out that there is anything incorrect in there, that person is going to face consequences."

And specifically the key claim they made in all four FISA warrants that Carter Page had met with these two Russians, Igor Diveykin, and Igor Sechin. By that point, the FBI was acutely aware that those meetings likely did not happen and could not be corroborated. There is no evidence that they corrected that information before the court. So as the deputy general said there should be consequences for not disclosing that information. And I think he is accurately telling the truth."

Understand this -- when James Comey said it was salacious and unverified, it turns out that was an understatement. It was complete garbage. Yet they took it to the court and but for that dossier, Andy McCabe told us this in his deposition, they don't get the warrant.

That is not a defense to defrauding the court because he fixes his name for a reason. He is swearing under oath that the information he is providing is authentic, it is true, and it is verified.

They are setting the agenda. And by the way, want to talk about a dumpster fire, a far-Left radical socialism which fails every single time, it is tried. By the way, my invitation to Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman continues. I'd like her to spend an hour right here on this set. We'll talk about every issue. We'll take our time or offer three hours on 618 of the best radio stations if she'll come. Here's just a small sample of what we have seen from the real speaker so far. Take a look."

How many years until the world ends again? We have 12 years left to cut emissions by at least 50 percent, if not more. Medicare for All would save the American people, a very large amount of money. Maybe we shouldn't be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner. You mean more than 10 million in one year? Your 10 millionth and one dollar gets taxed at 70 percent. Capitalism has not always existed in the world, and it will not always exist in the world. Should - is it OK to still have children?

I'd like to represent the constituents in Queens, and the Bronx. And we see AOC from the time she's been elected. She put out policy like the job killing, Green New Deal. She then went on to kill the Amazon deal in New York, which would have put some 25,000 jobs in Queens. And so, these are some of the reasons along with kitchen table issues that I do believe that AOC has neglected in her limelight bid to focus on in the congressional district."

And I think it's unfair to give benefits to one company and not another company. But that's a different story. But saying, do we have to question having kids? They did say the Green New Deal, whether you're willing or unwilling to work. Basically, everything is for free. No more oil or gas in 10 years. I don't understand it. If we only have 12 years left and we have to do this all in 10 years, why don't we just party the next 12 years and it's over anyway?"

We have infrastructure that is important to the constituents. Our subway system is crumbling. Our roads are in desperate need of repair. Also, Sean, our education, we need to really tackle our education system. The diversity here in New York, the education system, we really need to start talking about policy that's going to connect with the everyday Americans. She mentions no children, right. Or kids.

Federal investigators say, 19 of them are in the country illegally and all 19 came within the last few years that of course mirrors the timeline that California has been fighting to support sanctuary cities and fighting against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The feds say the way MS-13 gang members rise in the ranks is by committing murders. And they are now accused of systematically and viciously killing at least seven people, using medieval style killing techniques that law enforcement authorities have not seen in two decades. One victim was killed for crossing out MS-13 graffiti. Another was a homeless man who made the fatal mistake of falling asleep in a park that MS-13 considers its turf. The 22 gang members arrested are also thought to be responsible for hundreds of other crimes in several other states. But they are all based here in Los Angeles. Sean."
