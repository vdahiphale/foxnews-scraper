Then another text tells the severity of the situation, quote, like what did most of the damage? Response, he fell down a flight of stairs because he was too drunk.

The Senate Intelligence Committee asked Flynn in late April to cooperate and to provide records that were relevant to their investigation, but he declined on the advice of counsel. So this issuing of subpoenas represents a major escalation in the case as Vice President Mike Pence told reporters today that the decision to fire the FBI Director was based on the recommendation of the deputy Attorney General, a career prosecutor, and had nothing to do with Russia."

And my dominant issue with him is many Americans will say they understand, Comey has been a very controversial figure for a while. The big issue Americans are looking for is why right now? It made sense in January, it doesn't make as much sense now. And his answer was very clear, it's what the vice president has said before. He -- when Comey's boss is now in place, he's only been there a couple weeks, Mr. Rosenstein, when he came on board, met with Comey, he and Comey did not connect, had some issues there, and he made the recommendation to the president, \"This is not going to work long-term, that we've got to have somebody in there that'll have the trust of the American people.\" And he made the recommendation and the president made the decision and say, \"All right.

I think he's done what he could do. He's been in a very difficult position that quite frankly, the Clinton campaign put him into once Hillary Clinton was taking private information home, and put him in a very difficult situation there. I think he made the best of a bad situation but he was second-guessed all over and he was damaged."

    },

      "speaker": "LANKFORD",

We have - we have the responsibility of oversight of the entire process, what's happening now with the FBI, what's happening in the intelligence committee, the documents that have been gather, how they were gathered, and all the information that's there. FBI obviously has all of their investigation to do, so we work with the FBI all along. They have a separate track which we're providing oversight for. The FBI will continue on that same track. There are career prosecutors that are there. James Comey is not conducting the day-to-day investigation list. He does the final signoff on things but it's the career folks that have been there that are very solid in that investigation, they will continue on that investigation, and they will quickly have someone to be able to make that final call in the interim time period until we get a new director. So our process are going to remain the same, but we will still have very similar questions for James Comey."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANKFORD",
      "utterance": "I don't think that's necessary. Let the FBI finish their work and the career folks that are there at FBI. If there's a dissatisfaction at the end of it or what they found, then we'll get a chance to address something from there. But, nothing goes faster with a special counselor coming out. Remember, it was six years for the Iran counter investigation. It was three years in the Watergate, it was a full year just for Waco and that investigation, and that was a pretty straightforward investigation with no classified documents. It doesn't go faster with an independent council. Let them finish their work. We -- let us finish our work in the committee and oversight as well. We've already been on this five months. Let us continue that out, and then we'll see where it goes from there."

No one has yet to explain to me what the core crime that would be investigated with regard to Russian influence. The crimes that have been mentioned are things like failure to disclose items with General Flynn, and that's hardly something that a major crime justifying a special council. I think that the way that the White House fired Comey and the when more importantly does give greater justification for the appointment of a special council. There's a lot of people who are not convinced by what the deputy Attorney General said were the reason for Comey's termination. I criticize many of those folks that are saying, \"This had to be because the investigation is closing in on Trump.\" I don't see the crime, so I don't see how it's closing in on Trump.

The president has been criticizing the Russian investigation for weeks. He's been making it known that he's not happy with it. It's a lob off the head of the FBI director after that long of criticism creates a real appearance problem, and appearance matters in a political system.

Our government is a serial violator of that rule. We have tried to influence elections around the world. We've even overthrown governments. So from outside the country, our objections and shocks seemed a bit forced. But the question comes back to what's the crime? Are we going to try to indict Vladimir Putin? Because that's not going to go very well."

JUAN WILLIAMS, \"THE FIVE\" COHOST AND POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, the fact is, you could say over the skis because where is the evidence? You would think at this point there would be some leaks, there would be some indication that would prove ties between people in the Trump campaign or potentially even the president himself and some of these Russians who we know interfered in the 2016 election. The thing about it, though, is the timing. The timing is just so suspicious. The argument being put forth by Rod Rosenstein, the new Deputy Attorney General is that this is all tied in to what Jim Comey, now the former FBI director did back in July of last year, Martha, and then subsequently in October, 11 days before the election."

The White House perhaps taking some lessons out of the last 24 hours, perhaps. Whatever the mindset inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, one media giant level their warning this way. Matt Drudge tweeting this, \"Trump advisers leaking to media are now deliberately sabotaging presidency. Major house cleaning needed for survival.\" So, here with analysis, Chris Stirewalt, Fox News Digital Politics Editor, Julie Roginsky, a Democratic strategist, and Mercedes Schlapp, Republican strategist, both are Fox News contributors.

      "utterance": "In an organization, any organization, but especially one as important as the White House, loyalty is a two-way street. Donald Trump expects the people who work for him rightly to be loyal to him. They should have the same expectation of the president that he's going to help them do their jobs well, facilitate situations where they can succeed. And when things go poorly, see his own part of fault in this and not just say, you're out, you're out. It's your fault, now I'm going to go be mad."

You know, Mercedes, we've seen the way that the president does things and he's been praised for this in some respects, you know, the missile launch, the extreme vetting, which did not go over as well. This move last night, he is decisive. No matter what you say about him, when he makes a decision, he wants to implement it right away like a CEO. Is it the wrong way in the White House?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MERCEDES SCHLAPP, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "No. Because with his bold decisions, though, there is a shock value to it in the system, and what happens, it creates almost like a crater, where then you have the sort of vacuum. And that's the moment when for example the Democrats were able to come back and have a very cohesive response on going forward on a special prosecutor. I just can't even believe that the Democrats are basically being helpful to Comey when just weeks before that, and months before that, they were being very critical of Comey. I think for the president, it's how he functions in terms of saying I'm going to make this very bold decision. I think that there is this loyalty coming from his team. I disagree with Matt Drudge that the Trump advisors are trying to sabotage his presidency. But I do believe that for the presidents important to understand that that calm part of the White House is so important, so critical for him to deliver his message effectively, get surrogates out who are able to explain what the president has done. But, you know, he just functions in a little bit of a different way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I think, in part, where the Drudge thought came from was a story like this one which was out this morning, the firing was done in such haste that his own contract couldn't catch up. The vast majority of the White House staff learned about it on TV when the news broke. It quoted someone within the White House as saying this is insane. Julie, your thoughts?"

    {
      "speaker": "JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, taking my partisan hat off and putting on my staffer hat on mercy, I think you'll agree with me on this because we've both worked for our share of politicians. No politician is an island onto him or herself. So when you make a decision like this, it's probably a good idea to lineup the surrogates that you need both internally and externally to carry your message for you. Otherwise you have the disaster that you have over the last 24 hours, which is a completely convoluted message. And on top of that, it looks like your own staff leaking and leaking and leaking like a sieve in order to save themselves and to make themselves look good. That does not serve them. It doesn't serve their principal at all. But as Chris very aptly points it out, the principal doesn't let the staff do its job, it is virtually impossible for the staff to do its job. And then you get to the Washington habit of covering, you know, CYA, that's a big problem."

He's got to get the good stuff on this because if he doesn't, he's going to end up with a special prosecutor, and that special prosecutor will end up doing to him what the special prosecutor did to Bill Clinton, and that is not what Donald Trump wants.

It was total professionalism as American people, have every right to be proud of them and have confidence in them. Informally, they've lost confidence in their director. The public utterings, largely surrounds how the Clinton case was handled and widely known that most of the investigators in that case are recommending, certainly, that charges be found against her. And then, essentially, dismiss those charges. And also took it upon himself to make that decision when it was the attorney general's responsibility. So, I think over time, they just lost that.

In terms of the timing today of this meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak, and the fact that White House photographers were not included in that moment of these photographs.

I solely understand the Russians being in there. Normally we don't do that. You have to electronically sweep that place. I certainly don't want to leave any eavesdropping stuff there. But, no, it doesn't make any sense to me."

      "utterance": "Well, listen, President Trump and Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Mattis have changed the relationship with Russia. That's a fact. Under Obama, he was willing to engage using diplomacy primarily, very rarely willing to confront. But President Trump, he's willing to not only engage, but he's willing to confront. He sanctioned North Korea, he sanctioned the Iranians. He's called out the Russians. He called them out for enabling Assad who kills his own people using sarin gas. He's called out the Russian for not abiding by the Minsk Accord, and withdrawing their separatist forces and their military capabilities out of Ukraine. He's also called them out for this great controversy dealing with the meddling in our elections. He is going to confront them until their behavior changes. All that said there are ways that we should cooperate, where we have mutual interest. A mutual interest is ISIS, radical Islam. The common order up in the Artic that has unbelievable natural resources is something that we have mutual interest in. So we have found when we have bad relationships with the Soviet Union, we found opportunities at times to work together. But, as long as this Russian behavior continues where there aggressively asserting and trampling our interests and our allies national interest, I think this president is going to stay right on top of these guys."

For example, after Piazza had been taken to the hospital, but before he was pronounced dead, there were a series of text messages with one fraternity brother writing, quote, make sure the pledges clean the basement and get rid of any evidence of alcohol, a pledge respond, they're taking care of the basement. Then another text tells the severity of the situation, quote, like what did most of the damage? Response, he fell down a flight of stairs because he was too drunk. You can't blame yourself, said the pledge, how could I not? I don't think you fully comprehend the situation. He looked effing bed. And then, after Piazza dies, there is this text, quoting, if need be, just tell them what I told you guys, found him behind the way bar the next morning around 10:00 AM, and he was freezing cold but we decided to call 911 instantly because the kid health was paramount. The grand jury noted the Greek life system at Penn State is a danger to human life, Martha."

That video footage was not uncovered because that camera wasn't working, but the camera has footage of him walking towards the basement. (INAUDIBLE) several times throughout the night, and people slapping him, punching him in the stomach where there was an issue with his spleen, putting backpacks and where they're putting textbooks on him in case he rolls over, many of them just kind of disregarding any of the pain that he was in.

I think everybody who goes to a university or college especially where there are fraternities, they know that this is what happens in those houses behind closed doors where no one is there to monitor what the boys do and what's being done.

Let's put up a few more of these text messages and it is shocking because in a way, and I know all these kids have been told if you text something, it doesn't disappear, and now they've learned that lesson the hard way. In that group it said, so there's no evidence on Tim's phone, because they had group messages, so they were trying to cover their tracks. That's obviously tampering with evidence. Here's one more. What you think they would sue for? That he passed away or how we handled it? I mean, it is so callous, Sam. It is unbelievable. Quick last thought."
