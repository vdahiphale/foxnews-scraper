The Alabama seat has been Republican, last four decades, but this could throw that into question. The evangelical conservative firebrand, now the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Alabama is the subject tonight of an explosive new report that he says is a hit job. It was just released by The Washington Post. The report says this: \"Nearly 40 years ago, the then 32-year-old made unwanted sexual contact with a 14- year-old girl.\" The Post says, \"Three other women, who say that Moore also pursued them as young girls.\" Moore, who became famous for his fight to keep the 10 Commandments on this play in his court house, called the whole thing a baseless political attack by The Washington Post. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's a statement from his campaign: \"Moore has endured the most outlandish attacks on any in the modern political arena, but this story takes the cake. This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation.\" Still, a bipartisan course on Capitol Hill is calling for him to step down from his nomination.\" Chief national correspondent, Ed Henry, joins us live with the late-breaking details tonight on this from Capitol Hill.

      "sentences": "Martha, great to see you. Brand-new this hour: Roy Moore has just gone on a tweet storm charging that this is what he calls the \"Obama-Clinton machine\" coming after him in Alabama. He is vowing he will never give up the fight so he is pushing back hard, and caught in the middle is the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell who has been warning Steve Bannon and others to be careful with these antiestablishment Republican candidates who can win GOP Primaries, but might lose in the general election. And then put President Trump's agenda in further peril. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } McConnell, though, can't celebrate tonight for being right about that because he has to do deal with the practical reality that Moore is now facing a December 12th special election that Republicans must win in order to protect the president's agenda. Moore insisting tonight as I noted that this is fake news, a report by The Washington Post that a woman, Leigh Corfman, claims that when she was 14-years-old Moore was 32 at the time, he took her to his home and took off her outer garments and touched her bra and panties. Plus, guided her hand over his pants. As you noted, Moore's campaign put out a statement: \"National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate, Doug Jones, is in a death spiral and this is their last-ditch Hail Mary. The Washington Post has already endorsed the judge's opponent, and for months, they have engaged in a systematic campaign to distort the truth about the judge's record and career and derail his campaign.\" The Washington Post insists that the woman did not come to them looking for publicity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The newspaper says they found her after hearing rumors about his behavior decades ago, and that they found three other women who accused Moore of pursuing when they were between the ages of 16-18. That led several Republicans today to say if the allegations are true, Moore should step aside. Susan Collins, John McCain, and others are saying it doesn't matter, they don't even want an investigation. McCain saying, \"the allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying. He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of.\" Here's the thing, if Moore ends up quitting, his name would probably still stay on the ballot for the early December a special election to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions' old seat because Alabama law holds that new ballot can't be reprinted within 76 days of a special election. Some Republicans are already talking about the possibility of recruiting Luther Strange, the former Senator, who are backed by the president and McConnel that lost to Moore on the primary with the backing of Steve Bannon, who just yesterday told Fox that it's McConnell who should step aside. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But Senate Republicans led by Finance Chairman, Orrin Hatch, unveiled their version of the package that sent some mixed signals. On one hand, the Senate bill would delay the slashing of corporate taxes that the president has been touting so much and that could turn off conservatives, but the package also offers some improved benefits to the middle-class that could help bring along wavering Republicans and maybe even some moderate Democrats in the senate.

But that happened before the Chinese Communist Party Congress in which Xi basically consolidated his power. So we're now in a new chapter in his life, and as a result a new chapter in our relationship with China. Does he think he needs to do two things, one is does he think he needs to follow through on the commitment that they made, and the international agreements have been made through the United Nations sanctions on tightening the screws in North Korea. And second of all, are there other steps that he is willing to take to remove the idea of a North Korea armed with nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles? The United States has given a very important, if you will, commitment to the Chinese, which is we're not in favor of a united Korean Peninsula under a Democratic regime like we have in the south.

And, you know, Secretary Mattis, the secretary of the Air Force, and the entire system need to get to the bottom of it because there is an entire separate military judicial system where you have criminals, you have Leavenworth, you have prisons, and if that's not being communicated to the FBI, and these guys are kicked out of the military and then are free to go buy assault rifles, that is a huge problem.",

Brand-new this hour: Roy Moore has just gone on a tweet storm charging that this is what he calls the \"Obama-Clinton machine\" coming after him in Alabama. He is vowing he will never give up the fight so he is pushing back hard, and caught in the middle is the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell who has been warning Steve Bannon and others to be careful with these antiestablishment Republican candidates who can win GOP Primaries, but might lose in the general election. And then put President Trump's agenda in further peril. McConnell, though, can't celebrate tonight for being right about that because he has to do deal with the practical reality that Moore is now facing a December 12th special election that Republicans must win in order to protect the president's agenda. Moore insisting tonight as I noted that this is fake news, a report by The Washington Post that a woman, Leigh Corfman, claims that when she was 14-years-old Moore was 32 at the time, he took her to his home and took off her outer garments and touched her bra and panties. Plus, guided her hand over his pants."

The Washington Post has already endorsed the judge's opponent, and for months, they have engaged in a systematic campaign to distort the truth about the judge's record and career and derail his campaign.\" The Washington Post insists that the woman did not come to them looking for publicity. The newspaper says they found her after hearing rumors about his behavior decades ago, and that they found three other women who accused Moore of pursuing when they were between the ages of 16-18. That led several Republicans today to say if the allegations are true, Moore should step aside. Susan Collins, John McCain, and others are saying it doesn't matter, they don't even want an investigation. McCain saying, \"the allegations against Roy Moore are deeply disturbing and disqualifying. He should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of.\" Here's the thing, if Moore ends up quitting, his name would probably still stay on the ballot for the early December a special election to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions' old seat because Alabama law holds that new ballot can't be reprinted within 76 days of a special election. Some Republicans are already talking about the possibility of recruiting Luther Strange, the former Senator, who are backed by the president and McConnel that lost to Moore on the primary with the backing of Steve Bannon, who just yesterday told Fox that it's McConnell who should step aside."

So, they'll say that -- you see the Senators in Washington saying the Senate is no place for someone like this. He should step down; his candidacy is not sustainable if these allegations are true. We have no way of knowing how to prove that true. And then, you have Alabama Republicans defending him, and you have his campaign basically saying, it's all, you know, a plot from Jeff Bezos, The Washington Post, and the Democrats. Of course, Steve Bannon will blame Mitch McConnell. All of this coming out, and as Ed pointed out, under -- within the 76-day mark, so he's really protected legally and he obviously is to fight; he's not going to step down. This is not a situation that Republicans are going to be able to get out of.

And it's more likely that Moore's supporters are going to be energized, just like Mr. Trump were under these allegations -- when allegations like this are made that appear to be political -- a political witch hunt.

And I can tell you that what's happening here on the Hill is being watched very closely all the way in Asia by President Trump. His spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, a few moment ago putting out a statement saying that this was a huge step forward today on taxes towards getting the president, perhaps, his biggest legislative victory of his first year in office. Sanders saying, that this will be massive, historic tax relief for our viewers. Here's what happened, the House Ways and Means Committee approved their measure 24-16, that moves the tax package to the House floor, as you noted, after Republican Chairman, Kevin Brady, offered 29- page amendment to fine-tune the plan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But Senate Republicans led by Finance Chairman, Orrin Hatch, unveiled their version of the package that sent some mixed signals. On one hand, the Senate bill would delay the slashing of corporate taxes that the president has been touting so much and that could turn off conservatives, but the package also offers some improved benefits to the middle-class that could help bring along wavering Republicans and maybe even some moderate Democrats in the senate. Here's what it has, the Senate plan",
      "utterance": "\"Both the house and Senate would reduce the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35, but the Senate would do that after a one-year delay.\" That's aimed at satisfying deficit hawks who want to keep costs down, but delaying implementation will slow the impact on the economy. The House wants to cap mortgage interest deduction to $500,000. The Senate would permit deductions up to a million dollars. Another flashpoint is the House would partially repeal state and local deductions, still allowing up to $10,000 for property taxes; the Senate would totally scrap those deductions. Democrats say that's a huge problem in high tax states like New York and California, and it will put the Republican majorities in jeopardy in the midterms, but GOP leaders insist they'll be fine because they are delivering on a promise to the American people."

Gary, good evening. Good to have you back. Obviously, a big day for the tax bill that you have worked very hard on.

In terms of what happened on the Hill today, obviously the market backed off a bit because the market has had a huge run, largely on the notion that corporations are going to get a nice big tax cut to 20 percent. Can you -- how do you feel about the fact that they may now not get it for another year?"

I think the market's been going up because American businesses have been doing better and better as the economy continues to grow. Our tax plan is aimed to make sure that the economy does continue to grow, and we help American businesses compete in a very competitive global environment. Our plan is to aim to make sure that we lower the business tax rate and our U.S. businesses can compete in a very competitive environment. So, we are very excited about what happened today. As you mentioned, we did get the House plan out of the Ways and Means Committee, and the Senate did introduce their plan today which will go into committee next week."

We're on the schedule that we've said we would be on.

He said some very interesting things while he was in China and we're going to talk about it with Karl Rove. But first, Donna Brazile is making her -- doing her best to take down an already splintered Democratic Party with some very fiery new allegations tonight.

Donna Brazile is still determined to set the record straight on how the Clinton hijacked the nomination process, and she is upping the ante again as she takes on the Clinton establishment. Brazile on Tucker Carlson's show last night admitted that she gave not Hillary -- not just Hillary Clinton to bake questions, but she gave them to Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley as well, she said. She claims she wanted all the candidates to see the moderator's questions. That is not how it's supposed to work, folks."

You know, Donna Brazile leaked that debate question to the Clinton in March of 2016 -- one day before CNN was airing a Democratic primary debate in Flint, Michigan, a city that was in the middle of a lead-contaminated drinking water scandal. Brazile sent an email to Clinton campaign chair, John Podesta, and communications director, Jim Palmeiras saying, \"One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is a woman with a rash. Her family was lead poisoned and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the people of Flint.\" And now listen to one of the questions at the debate."

You know, she said you don't know what it is that I gave them, I thought that was very vague. And it's really unfortunate to see that how the DNC or Democrats have crucified Donna Brazile for speaking the truth, and she is clearly now trying to go and make amends and pretty much walk back some of her comments. She also said on Tucker last night that she didn't mean to say, you know, to hell with them, or they could go to hell. She said, she should've went low, and shouldn't went high instead of going low. And it's really unfortunate because this is clearly her motivation, it's because of the backlash that she received from Democrats. And now, Hillary Clinton pretending as if she's completely delusional and doesn't remember the actual agreement and she signed, and it's really sad and unfortunate."

That Senator Clinton, Secretary Clinton had a sign agreement to raise money for the national party, that's a pretty common practice. Bernie Sanders had one as well. He didn't raise money into the DNC, Clinton did, so she had input on how that money was spent. I'm sure if Sanders had raised that money to the DNC, he would have input on how that money was spent as well."

There was an agreement that she had outside of just raising the money that said if I give you the money, I will control the strategy, I will control how the staffing is done, I will control how all of everything takes place before she was even the nominee. What Donna Brazile said was she said she found the cancer. And I lost my mother to cancer last year, who only survive 6 months after being diagnose. So I know pretty well how cancer can be deadly. And the bottom line is the DNC is full of cancer that's been going on for 20-30 years, and they have yet to find a cure. And the more we continue to back this up, walk this up, change it and be anything different than what it is which is a cancer that is not only corrupting those of the top, but corrupting those of the bottom. If we continue to act like everything is all and well and say, oh, as long as we won in Virginia, all is well, then we'll continue to be hurting people, and this is flat wrong. To walk this back is wrong. I understand Donna Brazile's position as the first African-American female to run a presidential campaign, I respect her."

It was trying to help the Hillary Clinton campaign, and they've very much against Bernie Sanders. Whatever your definition of rigged is, the fact is the former DNC chairwoman stepped aside over this very issue. And also, with regards to the questions that were leaked, Donna Brazile also had to step aside and resigned from CNN for leaking those emails to Hillary Clinton, so those two things are fact that took place. And for the Democratic Party right now, 2016 election was a really embarrassing chapter for them, so this is clearly reopening that. And it's also reopening the very deep rift in the Democratic Party as you just saw with the two other Democrats on the panel going at it over this very issue."

She won the election by 3 million votes, but unfortunately lost the White House because of Electoral College. I think there's a unity reform committee right now that's working on some ideas like getting rid of super delegates, and changing up the system to modernize it and update it, and we're going to see the results of that in January. And I hope that everybody will come together. We saw when Democrats work together and we get our message out, we win. That's what happened Tuesday night. I hope to see more of that from our party."

Let's first start by apologizing to those you have hurt. And the bottomline is the more we keep ignoring this and acting like this didn't happen, that people were not hurt, and disenfranchise, the worse it's going to be. I'm here to tell you that nobody's just going to get over this and move on. You have a lot more stakes to win beside Virginia.

I think it would have been better if he had said what he said during the campaign which is, you, China, are not living up to the international standards that you have agreed to. You're engaging in unfair trading practices."

He's just simply say we want to be treated fairly. If we treat you fairly, you've got to treat us fairly, and you're not treating us fairly. But again, here's the big thing, let's not get stuck up in the language. These things are events, but they're part of a bigger and broader process. They announced today some trade deals, but even the administration admits that these deals are no substitute for changes in fundamental policy. This was an attempt to further the dialogue about policy changes if the Chinese to stop stealing our intellectual property, get the Chinese to lower the obstacles that they place in the sale of American goods and services inside their country and so forth. This was an event, a visit, that would allow the administration another opportunity to advance its causes, but we won't see the outcomes for days, if not weeks to come."

As you said, they got $250 billion they're saying in trade, in built with technology, aviation, energy, but, obviously, the big issue here is North Korea. Does he come home from that trip, Karl, having made any progress in his private discussions with President Xi that will force their stronger hand with North Korea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, again, we won't know for some period of time because there was no announce but a forward action today. I think he did his cause a great deal of good by that speech that he gave in Seoul because it was strong, it was forceful, and it was clear. But we're dealing with a very interesting situation here. We've got some movements. The administration got some really good movement by getting the Chinese Central Bank to begin to draw, in essence, bank accounts from people doing business in North Korea. But that happened before the Chinese Communist Party Congress in which Xi basically consolidated his power. So we're now in a new chapter in his life, and as a result a new chapter in our relationship with China. Does he think he needs to do two things, one is does he think he needs to follow through on the commitment that they made, and the international agreements have been made through the United Nations sanctions on tightening the screws in North Korea. And second of all, are there other steps that he is willing to take to remove the idea of a North Korea armed with nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles? The United States has given a very important, if you will, commitment to the Chinese, which is we're not in favor of a united Korean Peninsula under a Democratic regime like we have in the south. We accept that China wants to have a communist buffer state on its border. But the question is how much more are we going to get from the Chinese. And, again, this was an event, it's a process, we've got to watch what comes out of the process."

This is a man who pointed a loaded weapon at his wife, throttled her and the baby, a little boy, and he admitted that the force with which he came at that child could have killed him. So this is a man who the military justice system gave one year in confinement, then they released him, and in error, didn't even let the NCIS know that he was out there, and that he definitely should not be someone who should be permitted to have a gun.

Look, I work, as you would talk about, before I work with local law enforcement in Virginia. I've worked with something called a HIDTA, high intensity drug trafficking area. And they're using an amazing software called Tetra, which actually is a middleware that helps in aggravate and alginate data in real-time from different databases.

Tony, I'm sure you know as well, when you're discharged from the military and your entire career of medical issues from combat overseas, that database doesn't talk to the Veterans Affairs database. So, you know, it's a broader systemic problem. I doubt that this was just a one off on this particular airman. And, you know, Secretary Mattis, the secretary of the Air Force, and the entire system need to get to the bottom of it because there is an entire separate military judicial system where you have criminals, you have Leavenworth, you have prisons, and if that's not being communicated to the FBI, and these guys are kicked out of the military and then are free to go buy assault rifles, that is a huge problem."

      "utterance": "No, I disagree. Look, the military has to be held to account here. You can't have a separate disciplinary process outside the military chain of command. Those men under those commanders have to be held accountable based on the fact that they, as you point out, Martha, they do things that are extraordinary. And if they cannot perform adequately in their home life, that needs to be part of the equation looking at them for their suitability and service. I think Michael would agree with me on that."

We all know. What the outcome would have been if not for the heroism and the bravery of the men and women on this stage."
