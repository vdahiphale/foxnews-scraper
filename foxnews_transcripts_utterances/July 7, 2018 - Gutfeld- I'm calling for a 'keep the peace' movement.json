In all honesty, I asked for it. I mean, seriously, I asked them to do it. It's true, I am actually on vacation right now. We taped this show last Friday. Now something could happen between then and now that changes everything, which is why I picked stories for this show with no inherent news value. I'm being honest, except for this one. Today, I found out that they've stopped the \"Jerry Springer Show\" and it made me think, Jerry Springer is still on? But also why stop his show now? Well, you might say who needs it right now? After all, with the nation's political tension, every day is \"The Jerry Springer Show.\" Full of hair pulling, chair throwing, name calling all because we have opposing views. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the media blames, of course, the guy in the White House who I call the Orange Gandhi, which is BS. Politics always causes friction. We just have more places to see it - 24-hour cable news, social media, Lou Dobbs' hot tub. We get it, the country is divided, but that's actually good. It's better to have two sides than one, and I wish we had more sides, actually. Plus we just celebrated our 242nd birthday.

Twelve boys ages 11 to 16 and their coach have been in that cave for more than two weeks now. Massive flooding hindered their escape and kept rescuers from locating them for nearly ten days. Now oxygen is running out, and authorities want to get everyone out before the heavy monsoon rains start again. Meanwhile, the boys and their coach wrote letters which were delivered by divers making an 11-hour back and forth journey to act as postmen. The coach apologizes to the boys' families and promises to take care of them, and despite the dangers, the boys seem to be in good spirits. One reminded his family not to forget to plan his birthday party. Another says, \"When I come out, we will go eat fried chicken.\" I'm Marianne Rafferty, now back to \"The Greg Gutfeld Show.\"",

A new survey shows three in ten people between the ages of 24 to 31, that's a lot of numbers, prefer to drink at home because they say, and this is straight from the survey, it takes too much effort to go out. I'd like to say something to those three people who stay at home on their couch drinking, thank you for watching my show. You're so much better than those other seven at the bar. They suck. Overall, more than half of American consumers prefer drinking at home. Reasons range from it being more relaxing to cheaper to personal, whatever that means. The good news is if more are drinking at home, that probably means fewer drunks on the road and fewer drunks passed out at the bar like this sad sack. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

To our Japanese friends, the American people stand with you as you recover from this tragedy. As we build on the momentum of President Trump And Chairman Kim Jong-un's historic summit, the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan continue to strengthen our trilateral cooperation to achieve the goals set out in Singapore. To that very end, today's meeting was a top priority after my talks in North Korea these past days. Over two days, my team and I met with the Vice Minister Chairman Kim Yong-chol and his colleagues. We had good faith, productive conversations which will continue in the days and weeks ahead. In the meantime, sanctions remain in place and we will continue to enforce them with great vigor. During the visit we intended to build upon the agreements made by President Trump and Chairman Kim, and we made progress. But first, let me make clear, North Korea reaffirmed its commitment to complete denuclearization. We had detailed and substantive discussions about the next steps towards a fully verified and complete denuclearization. In addition, North Korea agreed to meet in mid-July in Panmunjom to discuss the repatriation of remains of our American service members. North Korea also reaffirmed its earlier commitment to destroy its missile engine test site which will make the region and the world safer. We also established a working level team that will carry out the day-to-day work of our two sides. Yes, the road ahead will be difficult and challenging, and we know critics will try to minimize the work that we've achieved. But our allies like the Republic of Korea and Japan, President Trump and I believe that peace is worth the effort and that's something that we all want. As allies, we share and are committed to the same goal, the fully verified, final denuclearization of North Korea as agreed to by Chairman Kim Jong-un. As President Trump has said, there is no limit to what North Korea can achieve if it gives up its nuclear weapons, should the DPRK follow through on its commitments, we look forward to eventually helping North Korea obtain prosperity and earn the respect of the world. However, North Korea will first have to fulfill its commitments to denuclearize. Sanctions will remain in place until final fully-verified denuclearization as agreed to by Chairman Kim occurs. Multiple UN Security Council resolutions unanimously passed require all nations to fully enforce those sanctions. Our three countries will continue to be vocal in reminding each country of its obligations to do so. And so while we are encouraged by the progress of these talks, progress alone does not justify the relaxation of the existing sanctions regime. There is also no change to our ironclad commitment to the defense of our allies, the Republic of Korea and Japan. The security of our allies is integral to our American security. The United States looks forward to continuing our close coordination with Japan and South Korea as we achieve the successful implementation of the agreement that was achieved at the Singapore Summit.

It is indeed a distinct honor for me to be here with Secretary of State, Mr. Mike Pompeo, and my Japanese counterpart, the Foreign Minister Taro Kono here in Tokyo so soon after Secretary Pompeo's third visit to Pyongyang. But first of all, let me also reiterate the sentiment expressed by Secretary Pompeo about the terrible losses caused by the torrential rain and flooding in Western Japan. Our thoughts are very much with the families and communities affected by this climactic event, and we wish them, the government swift recovery and our greatest sympathies to the families affected. Secretary Pompeo's visit to the Pyongyang, his third one, this visit having taken place in follow-up to the historic US/North Korea summit has been a productive starting point for implementing the agreements reached between President Trump and Chairman Kim in Singapore. Today's meeting among the three of us underscores the unwavering commitment on the part of our three countries to achieve the shared goal of complete denuclearization and the establishment of lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude and admiration to Secretary Pompeo for his tireless efforts to advance the dialogue with North Korea with a great deal of patience and deep commitment to turning this historic opportunity into reality of a nuclear-free, peaceful Korean peninsula. At today's meeting, Secretary Pompeo explained to us in detail the results of his visit to North Korea and gave us a good sense of the work going forward including the meeting scheduled at Panmunjom on July 12th regarding the return of the POW/MIA remains, but further consultations to be had with North Korea going forward. In the two rounds of the inter-Korean summits and last month's US/North Korea summit, the three leaders clearly set the direction towards our shared goal and Secretary Pompeo's visit to Pyongyang this time has taken the first steps in that direction, and we expect these to be followed up by further constructive and productive negotiations between the US and North Korea and the Republic of Korea stands ready to provide whatever assistance is needed to move the dialogue along. The Security Council sanctions, as we have agreed in our trilateral meeting, will remain in place and faithfully implemented until we are assured of complete denuclearization by North Korea. North Korea's denuclearization and provision of security guarantees and economic development that it desires must move together in our joint efforts to chart a brighter future towards lasting peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula and, indeed beyond in this region. This was the blueprint set forth in President Moon's speech in Berlin a year ago as well as the vision that President Trump and Chairman Kim agreed to in Singapore, and, therefore, it is thus in the interest of all that we move forward expeditiously in this endeavor. We have also confirmed once again that the ROK/US alliance is firm and strong and will remain so during this process of North Korea's denuclearization. We have made it clear that.

      "utterance": "Hi. It's me, Greg. I'm on vacation this week. This is me surfing and here I am scuba diving. And this is me in a local jail. Tight before they strip searched me. In all honesty, I asked for it. I mean, seriously, I asked them to do it. It's true, I am actually on vacation right now. We taped this show last Friday. Now something could happen between then and now that changes everything, which is why I picked stories for this show with no inherent news value. I'm being honest, except for this one. Today, I found out that they've stopped the \"Jerry Springer Show\" and it made me think, Jerry Springer is still on? But also why stop his show now? Well, you might say who needs it right now? After all, with the nation's political tension, every day is \"The Jerry Springer Show.\" Full of hair pulling, chair throwing, name calling all because we have opposing views. And the media blames, of course, the guy in the White House who I call the Orange Gandhi, which is BS. Politics always causes friction. We just have more places to see it - 24-hour cable news, social media, Lou Dobbs' hot tub. We get it, the country is divided, but that's actually good. It's better to have two sides than one, and I wish we had more sides, actually. Plus we just celebrated our 242nd birthday. We've been through way worse than this. And by the way, we look pretty awesome for our age. Take a look at this map. We haven't gained a pound in 60 years. Idaho has abs. But there's always room for improvement. The good news is, most of America isn't what's on TV. The shouting on camera is what attracts the camera in the first place, so that's why you see more of it. However, it may not be a bad idea to lighten up a little, which is why I'm still calling for a \"Keep the peace\" movement. To start, we've got to admit that everyone who annoys you thinks that they're right, but so do you and that annoys them. So the solution is that we should admit that we see things through different filters. Like this week. A neighbor posted something about Trump. I didn't agree with it and I replied. The next thick you know, thing you know, things got really, really personal. Now, I'm not proud of what I did on his porch. It wasn't supposed to be that messy. I do eat a lot of fiber. And now I'm worried he might have a surveillance camera. But worse, I'll bet I didn't convince him and he didn't convince me, and that's fine. We're both good people who see things differently, but if birds and cats can get along, why can't we? We cut off that tape before the ugliness, but that's why I'm for a peace movement, a conservative peace movement. Like hippies that smell good. The next time you're in a debate, I ask you, stay polite, compromise and forgive when a line is crossed. You may not get anything in return. Still, all you can do is take the high ground and see if they follow. If that doesn't work, date one of their relatives. It drives them nuts. Look at that. Let's welcome tonight's guests. Aside from Betty Crocker, he's my former baker, former CIA operative, diligence president all around, handsome dude, Mike Baker. Well, he could turn the world on with his smile and turn it off with his odor. Sorry, Fox News radio host Tom Shillue. Her favorite food is corn on the McCobb, that is a great into, \"National Review\" reporter Kat Timpf, and he jumps rope with a telephone line, former WWE superstar and my massive sidekick, Tyrus.

Parties, women, more parties. He cavorted with only A-listers, moustaches that ignored him before, now took him under their hairy wing. Steve Harvey, Tom Selleck and John Stossel, life couldn't be better for Justin Trudeau's left eyebrow, until it got to be too much. Justin Trudeau's left eyebrow began to wilt under the heat and pressure of the spotlight. He turned to drugs and just for men hair color. His mood grew dark. He lost his famous friends. Tom Selleck's moustache would no longer return his calls. Justin Trudeau's left eyebrow started hanging with the wrong crowd. Chuck Todd's goatee, Rand Paul's wet, soggy mop and all of Gabe Kaplan from \"Welcome Back, Kotter.\" Then after a wild night with David Letterman's beard, it become undeniable, Justin Trudeau's left eyebrow had hit rock bottom. Flat broke, he began renting himself out as a moustache for fake IDs until one fateful day when an old friend reached out. That friend, none other than John Bolton's moustache.

The coach apologizes to the boys' families and promises to take care of them, and despite the dangers, the boys seem to be in good spirits.

Overall, more than half of American consumers prefer drinking at home. Reasons range from it being more relaxing to cheaper to personal, whatever that means.

      "utterance": "... before I talk about North Korea, I want to say that we are closely following the news of the flooding and landslides that are hitting western Japan. The United States expresses its deep condolences to the families of those who died, and we send our thoughts and prayers to the families who are injured or missing. To our Japanese friends, the American people stand with you as you recover from this tragedy. As we build on the momentum of President Trump And Chairman Kim Jong-un's historic summit, the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan continue to strengthen our trilateral cooperation to achieve the goals set out in Singapore. To that very end, today's meeting was a top priority after my talks in North Korea these past days. Over two days, my team and I met with the Vice Minister Chairman Kim Yong-chol and his colleagues. We had good faith, productive conversations which will continue in the days and weeks ahead. In the meantime, sanctions remain in place and we will continue to enforce them with great vigor. During the visit we intended to build upon the agreements made by President Trump and Chairman Kim, and we made progress. But first, let me make clear, North Korea reaffirmed its commitment to complete denuclearization. We had detailed and substantive discussions about the next steps towards a fully verified and complete denuclearization. In addition, North Korea agreed to meet in mid-July in Panmunjom to discuss the repatriation of remains of our American service members. North Korea also reaffirmed its earlier commitment to destroy its missile engine test site which will make the region and the world safer. We also established a working level team that will carry out the day-to-day work of our two sides. Yes, the road ahead will be difficult and challenging, and we know critics will try to minimize the work that we've achieved. But our allies like the Republic of Korea and Japan, President Trump and I believe that peace is worth the effort and that's something that we all want. As allies, we share and are committed to the same goal, the fully verified, final denuclearization of North Korea as agreed to by Chairman Kim Jong-un. As President Trump has said, there is no limit to what North Korea can achieve if it gives up its nuclear weapons, should the DPRK follow through on its commitments, we look forward to eventually helping North Korea obtain prosperity and earn the respect of the world. However, North Korea will first have to fulfill its commitments to denuclearize. Sanctions will remain in place until final fully-verified denuclearization as agreed to by Chairman Kim occurs. Multiple UN Security Council resolutions unanimously passed require all nations to fully enforce those sanctions. Our three countries will continue to be vocal in reminding each country of its obligations to do so. And so while we are encouraged by the progress of these talks, progress alone does not justify the relaxation of the existing sanctions regime. There is also no change to our ironclad commitment to the defense of our allies, the Republic of Korea and Japan. The security of our allies is integral to our American security. The United States looks forward to continuing our close coordination with Japan and South Korea as we achieve the successful implementation of the agreement that was achieved at the Singapore Summit. Thank you."

      "utterance": "Thank you very much. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen of the press. It is indeed a distinct honor for me to be here with Secretary of State, Mr. Mike Pompeo, and my Japanese counterpart, the Foreign Minister Taro Kono here in Tokyo so soon after Secretary Pompeo's third visit to Pyongyang. But first of all, let me also reiterate the sentiment expressed by Secretary Pompeo about the terrible losses caused by the torrential rain and flooding in Western Japan. Our thoughts are very much with the families and communities affected by this climactic event, and we wish them, the government swift recovery and our greatest sympathies to the families affected. Secretary Pompeo's visit to the Pyongyang, his third one, this visit having taken place in follow-up to the historic US/North Korea summit has been a productive starting point for implementing the agreements reached between President Trump and Chairman Kim in Singapore. Today's meeting among the three of us underscores the unwavering commitment on the part of our three countries to achieve the shared goal of complete denuclearization and the establishment of lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude and admiration to Secretary Pompeo for his tireless efforts to advance the dialogue with North Korea with a great deal of patience and deep commitment to turning this historic opportunity into reality of a nuclear-free, peaceful Korean peninsula. At today's meeting, Secretary Pompeo explained to us in detail the results of his visit to North Korea and gave us a good sense of the work going forward including the meeting scheduled at Panmunjom on July 12th regarding the return of the POW/MIA remains, but further consultations to be had with North Korea going forward. In the two rounds of the inter-Korean summits and last month's US/North Korea summit, the three leaders clearly set the direction towards our shared goal and Secretary Pompeo's visit to Pyongyang this time has taken the first steps in that direction, and we expect these to be followed up by further constructive and productive negotiations between the US and North Korea and the Republic of Korea stands ready to provide whatever assistance is needed to move the dialogue along. The Security Council sanctions, as we have agreed in our trilateral meeting, will remain in place and faithfully implemented until we are assured of complete denuclearization by North Korea. North Korea's denuclearization and provision of security guarantees and economic development that it desires must move together in our joint efforts to chart a brighter future towards lasting peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula and, indeed beyond in this region. This was the blueprint set forth in President Moon's speech in Berlin a year ago as well as the vision that President Trump and Chairman Kim agreed to in Singapore, and, therefore, it is thus in the interest of all that we move forward expeditiously in this endeavor. We have also confirmed once again that the ROK/US alliance is firm and strong and will remain so during this process of North Korea's denuclearization. We have made it clear that.
