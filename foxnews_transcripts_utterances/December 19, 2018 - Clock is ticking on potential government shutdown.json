In moments, we'll be joined by Joe diGenova, Congressman Jim Jordan to discuss renegade judges. A shocking revelation inside the Jim Comey testimony and boy, do we have a lot more, also tonight. I thought the Left wanted us out of foreign entanglements.

He told the court, \"I wasn't suggesting that he was committing treason. I was just curious if he could have been charged. Lots of conspiracy theories out there.\" Since when do judges start invoking conspiracy theories as grounds for imposing additional jail time or any jail time at a defendant.

No, well, the move was needed because asylum seekers were abusing the system aided by a lot of leftist NGOs, migrants began parroting lines about gang violence and domestic violence to establish this expanded credible fear category because they don't want to return to their homeland.

Now we've been talking about the scourge of an elected judges substituting their own policy preferences for those of the American people's representatives since this show started back in October of last year. The President ultimately won, remember on his travel ban at the Supreme Court but for every issue from transgender people serving in the military, to climate change, to the 2020 census, to the keystone pipeline, these activist judges have waged an assault on Trump's agenda and they've exceeded their constitutional authority in almost every instance. We're reminded of how important it is that Trump gets his judicial nominees confirmed as quickly as possible. Mitch McConnell's done a pretty good job but we need this done faster, more expeditiously and like yesterday.

In moments, we'll be joined by Joe diGenova, Congressman Jim Jordan to discuss renegade judges. A shocking revelation inside the Jim Comey testimony and boy, do we have a lot more, also tonight. I thought the Left wanted us out of foreign entanglements. Well, we'll tell you why Trump's decision to bring some of our troops home has official Washington up in arms plus Michelle Obama's book tour has turned now into a petty war against the Trump family. Her comments later on in the show. And since it's Christmas, we have something very important for you. Raymond Arroyo takes us behind the scenes of a special holiday journey of joy and remembrance for hundreds of gold star families. And he speaks to the catalyst behind it all, Actor Gary Sinise so stay tuned for that incredibly moving report. It's going to bring tears to your eyes, it did when I first saw but first, Black Robed resistance, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. If you're like most Americans, you grew up with a special sense of reverence for judges. Watching films or reading books, regular folks have seen countless portrayals of judges as consummate professionals who set their own personal opinions aside and objectively weigh the merits of each case."

Case in point. Yesterday's sentencing hearing of former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Judge Emmet Sullivan most recently a Clinton appointee, used his moment in the spotlight to castigate Flynn with incendiary charges that weren't even brought by the Special Counsel. At one point, he told the decorated Lieutenant General, \"arguably you sold your country out.\" Well, then he decided Flynn failure to register as a foreign agent and the Judge actually used the word treason but with clever phrasing. He told the court, \"I wasn't suggesting that he was committing treason. I was just curious if he could have been charged. Lots of conspiracy theories out there.\" Since when do judges start invoking conspiracy theories as grounds for imposing additional jail time or any jail time at a defendant. The Special Counsel actually recommended no jail time. Nevertheless Judge Sullivan warned Flynn that even if he cooperated further with the Special Counsel, he could still serve time."

No, well, the move was needed because asylum seekers were abusing the system aided by a lot of leftist NGOs, migrants began parroting lines about gang violence and domestic violence to establish this expanded credible fear category because they don't want to return to their homeland. With Judge Sullivan's opinion, today, it's back to business as usual, pre- Trump the way it used to be. The judge not only by the way, demands that the administration revert to the old rules of asylum entry but further he instructed that, \"the government return to the United States, the plaintiffs who were unlawfully deported and to provide them with new credible fear determinations consistent with the immigration laws.\" Wouldn't you like a mint on your pillow too? In other words all those deported have to be brought back for new asylum hearings. Now I guess they can stay at Sullivan's house as they await trial. Who knows? But from his activist judicial high horse, Sullivan apparently isn't bothered by the growing backlog of 800,000 now immigration court cases. 30 percent of those involved asylum requests, that's more than triple the number from 2009. Now we've been talking about the scourge of an elected judges substituting their own policy preferences for those of the American people's representatives since this show started back in October of last year. The President ultimately won, remember on his travel ban at the Supreme Court but for every issue from transgender people serving in the military, to climate change, to the 2020 census, to the keystone pipeline, these activist judges have waged an assault on Trump's agenda and they've exceeded their constitutional authority in almost every instance. We're reminded of how important it is that Trump gets his judicial nominees confirmed as quickly as possible. Mitch McConnell's done a pretty good job but we need this done faster, more expeditiously and like yesterday. And - and if this means staying in session for an extra few days every month or even maybe into the Christmas holiday, well, guess what? The country depends on it, the constitution depends on it. And shame on Congress for not doing its job in the first place and passing urgently needed asylum reform at any point in the last two years. They have the House and the Senate, they should have addressed this issue, they should have done a lot of immigration including pass that funding for the wall, they didn't. Shame on them, shame on these judicial activists and that's THE ANGLE. All right, joining me now with reaction is Joe Digeneva, former U.S. attorney and Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan and Al Mottur, Attorney and Democratic strategist. Joe, what can we do about these activist judges, they're fighting Trump tooth and nail, let's talk about Judge Emmet Sullivan. This was stem-winder of an opinion by the way. A107 pages, Immigration Law is pretty tedious stuff but I practiced a little Immigration Law back in the day at my old law firm so I know it fairly well. What is your take?"

      "utterance": "We have a rule, if it takes 107 pages to explain, it's probably wrong. It's pretty clear that the Judge substituted his legislative and political judgment for that of the President of the United States. What the President did here was a perfectly reasonable rewrite of Obama's asylum roles. They are subject to a presumption of regularity, the President's rules. He denied him that but more importantly, he used a weird standard. He said that the plaintiffs had a moral right to make certain arguments, that is ludicrous, that's juvenile, that's first year law school nonsense. So when all is said and done, this is judicial anarchy, it's a shame and after yesterday's performance."

He exonerated her illegally, she broke the law, there isn't any question about it she broke the law and he, the President was communicating with her under a pseudo name to her private email account so what you saw was a lie. He knew she was using a private server. He knew it because he sent her emails using a pseudo name and you know what, that's the kind of thing that makes people sick of politics. There's Obama lying through his teeth, he knew that she had a private server, he knew there was classified information because when you communicate with the President, that is classified automatically.

It wasn't the first time that President Obama did that. Remember in the IRS investigation before it's closed out, he said there was no corruption there, not even a smidgen so he did the exact same thing where when the investigation is going on, he's doing a big time interview and he pre- judges the outcome there as well so it's not the first time."

They get a lot of love, a lot of support, and it's emotional for them, too, because they are all thinking about the reason that they are here. That's why we do it in December. It is a tough time for children that have lost a parent."

It's also a reminder of the high costs of our freedoms, Laura, that I think we forget. And I was surprised to learn from Gary and the families there the high number of servicemen and women who are plagued by PTSD once they come home. And the 20 members of our active and veteran members of the military commit suicide. So we need to stand with them, particular this time of year, these families. God bless them. These kids were incredible. And the Gary Sinise Foundation, I have such respect."

I called Michelle Obama Obama's bitter half. And the comments she made going all the way back to her Princeton thesis about her worldview, it's just -- she's just exercising it all over again. And she's back with a vengeance, and saltier than ever, and showing none of those grace and class that past first ladies have had and the kind of collegiality that you're supposed to --"

But there is something else going on here to. I diagnosed it several months ago, the particular hatred that the left has for Melania Trump. This is an incredibly accomplished, polished woman. And yes, they like to throw her past in her face when every leftist is always saying that we should be allowed to make mistakes and learn from them, et cetera, et cetera. This is a woman who speaks multiple languages, whose is an incredible mother."

If we just used the Trump standard of how he has constantly attacked the Clintons, Obama, throughout the last 12 years -- if you look at his tweets. You look at his insults. And Michelle Malkin is going to come on your program and call this hatred, vengeance. And then she spins off typically and talks about the left. And we are taking \"Bye, Felicia,\" and I submit to you, Laura, that look at all the Trump insults, and I will accept your reference. It's a snipe. She's on a comedy show, an entertainment show. But if you listen to Michelle, it's the end of the world. It's the worst thing ever said by a former first lady. Shame on you, Michelle."

Let's compare Michelle Obama to Michelle Obama, the woman who said when they, meaning us, conservatives, go low, we go high. What is high about \"Bye, Felicia\" except for the hand wave? Hi, bye, Felicia. Where is the going high? Compared her to turn her own standards."

What is so dramatic about this that we're going to do a character assassination by Michelle of Michelle Obama. It's ridiculous.

What does he do again? Oh, he's the secretary of state. We're going to talk to him and all sorts of other surprises. So tune into the radio tomorrow.
