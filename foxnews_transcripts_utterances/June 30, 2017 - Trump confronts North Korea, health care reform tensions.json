President Trump has taken a little bit more hardline, as Olivier mentioned, with these sanctions and some of the deals he's made.

I was surprised by President Moon because he seemed a little bit more conciliatory toward the North when he was running for president, and today he was very effusive in his praise for President Trump. President Trump has taken a little bit more hardline, as Olivier mentioned, with these sanctions and some of the deals he's made. President Trump has actually, I think, played a pretty sharp game with North Korea thus far. And with China, the question is what China will do. They are as an enigmatic as ever about that."

      "utterance": "It's clearly a repudiation of the idea behind the Obama administration which was basically that's a euphemism for not doing anything, for thinking that somehow, which is the Obama policy, which is that the North Korean regime is so inhuman, so inefficient, so much starvation that it can't survive in the long run. We just wait and eventually it will collapse. It's not going to happen. And the main reason it's not going to happen is because it's sustained by China economically and politically and diplomatically. Look, I think the administration made the right choice to try to go through China, to threaten, to cajole, to see whether China will do it. I think in the end China is not going to do it. I think it thinks what the Americans are doing is a bluff. The bluff being China, if you don't act we're going to take this in our own hands, strategic patience is over. It was announced earlier in the week that the president is looking at military options. Well, those are pretty serious. That's all-out war on the Korean peninsula which we tried 60 years ago, or the North Koreans tried it, initiated it, and we suffered a lot. So we don't have a lot of options here. I think we have to play the China card, which is what the administration is doing, but we have to understand that it is a longshot choice."

This makes it a little harder for them to lock up the support for the existing Republican legislation. The president has had a couple of different scenarios over the past six months, including the one you showed but also another one in which he said we can just watch Obamacare collapse, maybe nudge it along as well, and then that will force Democrats to come to the table. That's still an option as well. But I think we have to watch and see what Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader decides to do."

And I think from talking to Republicans and Democrats I've talked to, I think that what's working here is they are going to try to get anything past that they can get if they can get something done. Then they're worried about fixing it later. It's not so much about repeal and replace. Down the road they are going to have to fix it along the margins with some Democrats even eventually. But I think at some point I think they're going to try to figure out a way to claim victory because if they don't pass anything, that's a loser. This bill was a loser from the beginning, but they're going to try to work on something so that they can get it passed in the Senate so it passes the Byrd rule. It gets to the House. They manage to figure out a way to reconcile the Senate and the House versions, and after that they will fix it somewhere down the road."

If we can't do them together, let's do it as much repeal as we can and then let's have the president asked us to cancel our August recess period and stay here and then work on replace separate."

      "utterance": "That's the best element in that idea is to cancel the senators' recess. They haven't quite earned it yet. Look, in theory the repeal first idea is good. But there is a reason why it was abandoned. It's not going to pass. You can't have a clean, bald, and naked repeal because it means that there are millions of Americans who are going to be out of health care insurance, out of coverage almost overnight, and that will be utterly intolerable. It will not get a majority. The reason why Sasse wants to advocate it is because he knows it's so intolerable it would then force the Senate into doing a repair, a replacement quickly. But that may not work. I think that's going to be seen as a bluff. The only way to go I think right now is the McConnell way where you try to piece together a replacement. And if you can do it, you do it. If you can't, you can't do repeal alone."

One of the options that was talked about earlier on, it's passing repeal immediately, but the repeal wouldn't take affect for a couple years. One of the original ideas was to have the repeal takes effect after the 2018 midterms, for example. So that would give them a longer window. One of the problems is that would problem hemorrhage conservative support because a lot of conservatives want a pure up and down repeal. And so how do you get them back on the table on the replace front?"

They are being taught patho-history, pathology, all the things that we did wrong, all the sins, all the injuries, all the crimes, and none of the glory of it. You raise a generation like that, you end up not exceptionally proud of your country. That's probably the most important reason."
