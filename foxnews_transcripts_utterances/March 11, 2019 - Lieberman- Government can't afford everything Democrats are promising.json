Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggesting that this great country of ours is garbage, that capitalism is redeemable, Ronald Reagan and FDR's New Deal was racist. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You know, fake news chief, CNN president Jeff Zucker trashing Fox News and everyone who works here.

It's also a dangerous state. We start with the speaker of the house in name only, Nancy Pelosi. In an interview with \"The Washington Post\", Pelosi said impeaching President Trump is just not worth it because the process is too divisive. Here's my message tonight. Do not ever believe a single word she says.  Pelosi now presides over what is the most radical extreme group of socialist Democrats that have ever existed. That includes socialist members of Congress that we know want to get rid of oil and gas, the lifeblood of our economy. All gas-powered cars, cows and planes in the next ten years and tell everybody it's free. Everything's free, whether you're willing or unwilling to work. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And breaking tonight -- well, the person that's really leading the Democratic Party, Ocasio-Cortez, she doesn't think Trump's impeachment is off the table. I believe her more than Pelosi. Pelosi is utterly controlled by these new radicals. And she knows her power is in jeopardy every day. She will go with their every whim. And I have a message for those that think, oh, socialism is so cool, everything's free. Well, Democratic genius Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, over the weekend, she took a plane. You know, we're not supposed to have those in 10 or 12 years -- well, the world's going to end in 12 years, where she offered her expertise on a variety of issues at the South by Southwest Festival, it's a liberal festival. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Naturally, she found time to bash capitalism and America in the process.  Let's take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But by calling Reagan a racist, FDR a racist, suggesting the United States is based on a garbage system, and she wants you, the American people, to hand over the keys to your private businesses, your private property. She wants government control of the means of production. Literally, she wants state control of all health care. How did Obamacare work out? And all energy? We're going to be -- no oil or gas in ten years. Good luck. And she wants to tell every business how to operate.

Not you, not we, not the American people, not the people who risk reward, incentive, and create goods and services that make our lives easier and better, that people want, need, and desire. She and her colleagues know better, which is a pretty disturbing concept because she actually had a business. We found out today she owes nearly $1,900 in back taxes over her small defunct business that she founded in 2012. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, socialism is all about do as I say, not as I do. And you're always generous with other people's money. We're all supposed to pay taxes, not them. She's just in government to reap the rewards. We'll have more on this coming up tonight. First, I want to turn our focus to the arm of the Democratic Party, and that, of course, is fake news, all over the place. But in this particular case, fake news CNN. Now, the network will soon be facing a whopping $250 million lawsuit for its willful smears, slander, besmirchment, libel of a Covington high school student Nick Sandmann. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I'm going to make a prediction. CNN is going to lose a fortune. You know attorney Lin Wood. He's been on the show. He will crush them. Their public vilification of a young 16-year-old high school student who did nothing wrong, showed incredible grace under pressure, was nothing short of a disgrace. His life will never be the same. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But their rush to judgment -- it wasn't just the media. It went on for more than two days. And don't forget, CNN singled out Sandmann. Why? He was wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat, the new trigger for the extreme left. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, recently, CNN president, professional Trump hater, one who presides overall of those lies against the 16-year-old, he emerged from his glass house, had the gall to call the FOX News Channel a propaganda outlet. Jeff, I have a message for you. How about a public apology from you and your on-air talent, if you want to call them talent, your networks, your disgusting rush to judgment, your smearing, your slandering? Let's just stay with a 16-year-old kid and your network's hatred of Trump which caused this because that's all you cover every second of every day. And you also said the employees who work here, my friends and colleagues, support a place that has done tremendous damage to the country. Look at the damage you did to that 16-year-old. Would you like it if it was your kid? That from Zucker, the head of the New York that literally hates Trump so much they'll go after a 16-year-old and not ask a single question about whether what they hear and see, a snippet is true, like the fake story. Let's go through CNN's history about Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember Trump and the prime minister feeding the fish in the pond. Yes, they got that wrong. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Or CNN fake news story about Trump and WikiLeaks? Yes, wrong again. Or the fake news story about Trump and Russia that forced three CNN journalists to resign? Wrong. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Or the fake news story about Sessions and Russia that they were forced to walk back? Wrong again. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Or the fake news story predicting that Comey would refute Trump? Nope.  And FOX -- and fake news goes on and on and on, every day, every hour, conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory -- all driven by an irrational rage and hatred for President Trump. Did they ever tell one success story, record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian- Americans, women in the workplace, millions out of poverty off of food stamps? Every second, hour, every day, every year for three years. Now, sadly, this hatred, it's only the tip of the iceberg. Journalism is dead. Their anti-Trump obsessive coverage is impossible to watch, which is probably why so few Americans actually watch. All right? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We've got the video proof.

They're giving the world a very distorted, perverted view of our country every single day. They never talk about America's greatness, America's success, the president's success. Just hate Trump all day long. That's what the world sees through the CNN lens. And, of course, in addition to their obsessive coverage, we know that fake news CNN also utilizes bias of omission, again to malign the president.  Look at this study from \"NewsBusters\". CNN's Wolf Blitzer, \"The Situation Room\", frequently promoted the congressional Democrats' frivolous and wrong investigations into the president. Last week, Blitzer found time to ask 86 uncritical questions about the investigation while asking only three that challenge the never-ending inquiries, in spite of all of the news we had last week. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If Zucker really wants to see propaganda, just look at your own network because that's all you are. And while Zucker and his fake news minions are busy hating all things Trump all the time, they also continue to provide 24/7 cover for the collusion conspiracy theorist Adam Schiff. We change gears. Adam Schiff sent out a fundraising letter this weekend. Literally his team, Team Adam, they're begging, they're pleading for help, all because of this show and that we dared to tell the truth and call out his constant lying and leaking in a new fundraiser ploy. There's Adam, well, at least we call him the cowardly Schiff, because he won't come on the program. But he's begging supporters to pitch in at least 5 bucks, please, to send a message to Hannity after he dedicated 40 minutes of his show covering the cowardly Schiff. And add to the quote, trust us, Adam isn't about to back down because of Sean Hannity. That's part of all this is cowardly Schiff, we've offered him the full hour, even after liberal Bill Maher told him to do it. Congressman, I'll give you three hours, too, on my radio show on 610 of the best radio stations in the country. So, you clearly watch the show.  You're now using my show to beg for money from your adoring fans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Come on the program. I'll give you the full hour. Three hours of my radio show. I will point out every single lie, every piece of propaganda, misinformation that you have been peddling for two straight years. And guess what? We have every lie of yours chronicled, every TV appearance chronicled. We will expose your efforts to undercut this democracy and undermine the president and say things that are just false, like reportedly sending staff -- oh, let's see, why did your staff meet with Michael Cohen for ten hours before his recent testimony? Oh, that doesn't sound -- that's not witness tampering is it?

It's amazing this is on tape. Will somebody please send this to Robert Mueller? Maybe he missed it. Take a look.",

So, you can see the hate Trump mob that want to do anything, everything to try to take down this president, like making materially false statements to a FISA court.

Now, in the 2016 FISA application against Carter Page, it reads, quote: The FBI is unaware of derogatory information pertaining to Christopher Steele.  Lie. It gives us some of the most damning evidence yet. The top officials inside, upper echelon, not rank and file, the FBI, DOJ, they made materially false statements to the FISA court. They purposely withheld information. They committed a conspiracy of fraud against an American citizen sent, denying that citizen of their constitutional rights, all to get an opportunity to spy on the Trump campaign through an associate, at the height of the 2016 election.

Look at the Soviet Union, look at Venezuela, look at Cuba, look at present-day places that we can see. Look at the lights turned off in Venezuela - should be one of the richest countries. We see this system has created wealth and prosperity for every American, regardless of where you start out in life. Socialism less opportunity, stifles business, endless regulation, constant confiscation, pushes business out of the way, disincentivizes people to risk, reward, invest and create jobs and opportunities and goods and services that make us better as a country. If you just look at history, we're always reminded, we were but one generation away from extinction. Ronald Reagan said that. And if we don't learn the lessons of history we're doomed to repeat it. This will be an unmitigated economic disaster. Let not your heart be troubled now because here is Laura Ingraham, standing by in our nation's capital, the swamp.

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" A big weekend celebration for the radical, socialist, far left Democrats in this country. There she is. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggesting that this great country of ours is garbage, that capitalism is redeemable, Ronald Reagan and FDR's New Deal was racist. You know, fake news chief, CNN president Jeff Zucker trashing Fox News and everyone who works here. I have a response for him tonight. Also, known liar Adam, well, shifty, cowardly Schiff, he sent supporters out a letter, a desperate plea for help, begging for money, using my name, trying to raise money on my name, because we dare to call him out, we will call him out again tonight. And stay tuned, because we'll cover this very important Hannity Watch on the sad state of this Democratic Party. It's also a dangerous state. We start with the speaker of the house in name only, Nancy Pelosi. In an interview with \"The Washington Post\", Pelosi said impeaching President Trump is just not worth it because the process is too divisive. Here's my message tonight. Do not ever believe a single word she says.  Pelosi now presides over what is the most radical extreme group of socialist Democrats that have ever existed. That includes socialist members of Congress that we know want to get rid of oil and gas, the lifeblood of our economy. All gas-powered cars, cows and planes in the next ten years and tell everybody it's free. Everything's free, whether you're willing or unwilling to work. And breaking tonight -- well, the person that's really leading the Democratic Party, Ocasio-Cortez, she doesn't think Trump's impeachment is off the table. I believe her more than Pelosi. Pelosi is utterly controlled by these new radicals. And she knows her power is in jeopardy every day. She will go with their every whim. And I have a message for those that think, oh, socialism is so cool, everything's free. Well, Democratic genius Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, over the weekend, she took a plane. You know, we're not supposed to have those in 10 or 12 years -- well, the world's going to end in 12 years, where she offered her expertise on a variety of issues at the South by Southwest Festival, it's a liberal festival. Naturally, she found time to bash capitalism and America in the process.  Let's take a look."

But Ocasio-Cortez, she wants to trade it in for a socialist system, like, what, Venezuela?  North Korea? Cuba? The former Soviet Union? And that's not all. Ocasio-Cortez also went onto suggest that the United States, it's pretty unbelievable, is we're basically a garbage country.  Take a look."

      "utterance": "Let's recap. Ocasio Cortez, the new radical extreme, socialist Democrats enlightening the crowd at the South by Southwest festival. But by calling Reagan a racist, FDR a racist, suggesting the United States is based on a garbage system, and she wants you, the American people, to hand over the keys to your private businesses, your private property. She wants government control of the means of production. Literally, she wants state control of all health care. How did Obamacare work out? And all energy? We're going to be -- no oil or gas in ten years. Good luck. And she wants to tell every business how to operate. Oh, boy. And according to her, her government knows best. Not you, not we, not the American people, not the people who risk reward, incentive, and create goods and services that make our lives easier and better, that people want, need, and desire. She and her colleagues know better, which is a pretty disturbing concept because she actually had a business. We found out today she owes nearly $1,900 in back taxes over her small defunct business that she founded in 2012. Remember, socialism is all about do as I say, not as I do. And you're always generous with other people's money. We're all supposed to pay taxes, not them. She's just in government to reap the rewards. We'll have more on this coming up tonight. First, I want to turn our focus to the arm of the Democratic Party, and that, of course, is fake news, all over the place. But in this particular case, fake news CNN. Now, the network will soon be facing a whopping $250 million lawsuit for its willful smears, slander, besmirchment, libel of a Covington high school student Nick Sandmann. I'm going to make a prediction. CNN is going to lose a fortune. You know attorney Lin Wood. He's been on the show. He will crush them. Their public vilification of a young 16-year-old high school student who did nothing wrong, showed incredible grace under pressure, was nothing short of a disgrace. His life will never be the same. But their rush to judgment -- it wasn't just the media. It went on for more than two days. And don't forget, CNN singled out Sandmann. Why? He was wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat, the new trigger for the extreme left. Now, recently, CNN president, professional Trump hater, one who presides overall of those lies against the 16-year-old, he emerged from his glass house, had the gall to call the FOX News Channel a propaganda outlet. Jeff, I have a message for you. How about a public apology from you and your on-air talent, if you want to call them talent, your networks, your disgusting rush to judgment, your smearing, your slandering? Let's just stay with a 16-year-old kid and your network's hatred of Trump which caused this because that's all you cover every second of every day. And you also said the employees who work here, my friends and colleagues, support a place that has done tremendous damage to the country. Look at the damage you did to that 16-year-old. Would you like it if it was your kid? That from Zucker, the head of the New York that literally hates Trump so much they'll go after a 16-year-old and not ask a single question about whether what they hear and see, a snippet is true, like the fake story. Let's go through CNN's history about Trump. Remember Trump and the prime minister feeding the fish in the pond. Yes, they got that wrong. Or CNN fake news story about Trump and WikiLeaks? Yes, wrong again. Or the fake news story about Trump and Russia that forced three CNN journalists to resign? Wrong. Or the fake news story about Sessions and Russia that they were forced to walk back? Wrong again. Or the fake news story predicting that Comey would refute Trump? Nope.  And FOX -- and fake news goes on and on and on, every day, every hour, conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory -- all driven by an irrational rage and hatred for President Trump. Did they ever tell one success story, record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian- Americans, women in the workplace, millions out of poverty off of food stamps? Every second, hour, every day, every year for three years. Now, sadly, this hatred, it's only the tip of the iceberg. Journalism is dead. Their anti-Trump obsessive coverage is impossible to watch, which is probably why so few Americans actually watch. All right? We've got the video proof. As Warner Wolf used to say, let's go to the videotape."

      "utterance": "The really sad part of what they call is news, we know it's not, is that many people sadly around the world -- we see a bigger picture here.  They see America through the lens of CNN International and their coverage, pretty wide-reaching, as they were the first cable news -- so-called news network on the market. They're giving the world a very distorted, perverted view of our country every single day. They never talk about America's greatness, America's success, the president's success. Just hate Trump all day long. That's what the world sees through the CNN lens. And, of course, in addition to their obsessive coverage, we know that fake news CNN also utilizes bias of omission, again to malign the president.  Look at this study from \"NewsBusters\". CNN's Wolf Blitzer, \"The Situation Room\", frequently promoted the congressional Democrats' frivolous and wrong investigations into the president. Last week, Blitzer found time to ask 86 uncritical questions about the investigation while asking only three that challenge the never-ending inquiries, in spite of all of the news we had last week. If Zucker really wants to see propaganda, just look at your own network because that's all you are. And while Zucker and his fake news minions are busy hating all things Trump all the time, they also continue to provide 24/7 cover for the collusion conspiracy theorist Adam Schiff. We change gears. Adam Schiff sent out a fundraising letter this weekend. Literally his team, Team Adam, they're begging, they're pleading for help, all because of this show and that we dared to tell the truth and call out his constant lying and leaking in a new fundraiser ploy. There's Adam, well, at least we call him the cowardly Schiff, because he won't come on the program. But he's begging supporters to pitch in at least 5 bucks, please, to send a message to Hannity after he dedicated 40 minutes of his show covering the cowardly Schiff. And add to the quote, trust us, Adam isn't about to back down because of Sean Hannity. That's part of all this is cowardly Schiff, we've offered him the full hour, even after liberal Bill Maher told him to do it. Congressman, I'll give you three hours, too, on my radio show on 610 of the best radio stations in the country. So, you clearly watch the show.  You're now using my show to beg for money from your adoring fans. Come on the program. I'll give you the full hour. Three hours of my radio show. I will point out every single lie, every piece of propaganda, misinformation that you have been peddling for two straight years. And guess what? We have every lie of yours chronicled, every TV appearance chronicled. We will expose your efforts to undercut this democracy and undermine the president and say things that are just false, like reportedly sending staff -- oh, let's see, why did your staff meet with Michael Cohen for ten hours before his recent testimony? Oh, that doesn't sound -- that's not witness tampering is it? Does that sound a little bit like collusion? And, of course, that's nothing for Schiff because he's the one guy we have on tape really colluding with the Russians so that he can impact the electoral process in this country. It's amazing this is on tape. Will somebody please send this to Robert Mueller? Maybe he missed it. Take a look."

This like Obama didn't know his mic was hot, tell Vladimir Putin I'll have a lot more flexibility after the election. Tell him we can do the deal then, but we won't tell the American people. So, you can see the hate Trump mob that want to do anything, everything to try to take down this president, like making materially false statements to a FISA court. We're now getting all the confirmation I told you what was coming, tick tock, of what \"The Hill's\" John Solomon reported months ago surrounding the dirty Steele dossier. According to newly released testimony, Bruce Ohr warned the top FBI brass, yes, Christopher Steele hated the president, that the dossier was tainted with an anti-Trump bias, that was it never verified, it was never corroborated. Now, you got to give Steele some credit because he managed to get paid by a Russian oligarch, the FBI, Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC, all for the same dossier that he doesn't even stand by himself.  Pretty amazing job if you can get it. Now, in the 2016 FISA application against Carter Page, it reads, quote: The FBI is unaware of derogatory information pertaining to Christopher Steele.  Lie. It gives us some of the most damning evidence yet. The top officials inside, upper echelon, not rank and file, the FBI, DOJ, they made materially false statements to the FISA court. They purposely withheld information. They committed a conspiracy of fraud against an American citizen sent, denying that citizen of their constitutional rights, all to get an opportunity to spy on the Trump campaign through an associate, at the height of the 2016 election. Then they leaked all the lies to you, we the people, so that it would influence your vote. Russian paid for lies to influence the vote. Let not your heart be troubled. Tonight, my sources are again confirming to me that those who broke the law, those that abused power, they are going to be held accountable. So far, we've not been wrong. Here with us now, Fox News contributor, former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, Salem radio nationally syndicated host, Larry Elder. I don't know where to start. Maybe we can start in Austin, Ari, or maybe start with fake news CNN or maybe we can start with Adam Schiff or maybe start with the real Russia collusion. I think that tape's pretty damning.  Why didn't Mueller investigate that?"

It's all part of Trump derangement syndrome which replaced policy making in the hearts and souls of most of the Democrats and that's the problem that they have. I think this explains Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's statements that she has made, and half the Democrats are making these statements well. But what really is troubling now, though, is how socialism has found a happy home inside a major American political party's leadership. And it has become the dog wagging the tail. That's the problem the Democrats have and the hatred for Trump, the ideology. And if anything's going to boost the president's reelection, it's going to be the Democrats more than anything else."

Arianna Huffington and \"Huffington Post\" wouldn't even cover him in the news section because she thought he was a joke. So, the media gave Donald Trump all this air time, all this uncritical airtime. He got bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger. They kept talking about how low his ceiling was, how long his ceiling was. Uh-oh, he won the nomination. Uh-oh, he won the presidency.

What's happened is the media, to protect their ability to be tough on government people, think they have an unfettered license to be tough on everybody. And that's what New York Times v. Sullivan held up. It's about time that case gets revisited. In the hands of a 16-year-old who was dealt the worst type of journalist coverage, the worst type of negativity, malice.

So, you even have people in the news media criticizing the way the media has gone into Trump derangement syndrome. Only 7 percent of reporters self described as Republicans. I mean, 93 percent call themselves something else. That's not healthy. That's not fair and balance. People aren't really getting facts.

But what we've seen over the last two years with all the investigations being conducted by Congress, the conversations that I've been on, John Solomon, you've been on everything that we've reported, shows a direct line between Russia and the Hillary Clinton campaign. This is what's so incredible, so if anything needs to be investigated - and not only that. We've not only seen that. We also saw extensive abuse and malfeasance in the FBI, what we're seeing with the FISA documentation. And here you have Adam Schiff who is so desperate that something come out that he's moving forward with his own investigations into - with absolutely no criminal evidence of anything.

And while I grew at Nancy Pelosi, the reality is right now that that Representatives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are driving the narrative of their party, and that's really problematic. And I actually feel bad for a lot of my Democratic colleagues who really don't agree with her. But the reality is that she's driving the narrative. A lot of the presidential candidates coming out are really repeating a lot of the talking points we see this in endorsement of the Green New Deal, they are repeating the same talking points as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and that's really problematic for the Democrats. The American people really don't want to see it. And--"

Just read Adam Schiff's Twitter feed. Instead of running the Intelligence Committee or a very important National Security Committee, that's really important for the safety of our country, all he talks about is investigating Trump.

Let not your heart be troubled. Well, first I got to tell you more about socialism. I didn't know. I really thought it was a minute ahead of time. Let me tell you something. Look at the Soviet Union, look at Venezuela, look at Cuba, look at present-day places that we can see. Look at the lights turned off in Venezuela - should be one of the richest countries. We see this system has created wealth and prosperity for every American, regardless of where you start out in life. Socialism less opportunity, stifles business, endless regulation, constant confiscation, pushes business out of the way, disincentivizes people to risk, reward, invest and create jobs and opportunities and goods and services that make us better as a country. If you just look at history, we're always reminded, we were but one generation away from extinction. Ronald Reagan said that. And if we don't learn the lessons of history we're doomed to repeat it. This will be an unmitigated economic disaster. Let not your heart be troubled now because here is Laura Ingraham, standing by in our nation's capital, the swamp.
