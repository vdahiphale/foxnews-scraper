      "utterance": "Yes, I think the president's statement was pretty clear. I think it really undermines the Republican talking points that somehow he is controlled by the left wing of his party or he does too much to cater to them. This is pretty clear. He wants to work with the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas. He's going to help Israel replenish Iron Dome, its defense system that seems to have worked pretty well against Hamas rockets. So he know where he stands in the Middle East. He did work for the ceasefire. People criticized him for not coming out and calling for a ceasefire sooner, even when about half the Democrats in the Senate were calling for one. But it was pretty clear that Joe Biden, like other American presidents before him, did not want to call for a ceasefire before Israel was ready to engage in one because they didn't want to be left looking like they had no leverage at all with the Israeli government. But I think we now know where the president is. I'm sure the progressive wing of his party isn't thrilled about it, but I don't think it's the kind of rift that's going to spill over into other domestic issues."

The president was very clear, as Mara mentioned, about replenishing the Iron Dome and how critical that has been to protecting the people of Israel. Matthew, I want to play something from two different sides of the aisle in the Senate about how this is being viewed on Capitol Hill and beyond."

      "utterance": "Matthew, it feels like so many of the conversations and disputes that are happening on Capitol Hill and more broadly in Washington come back to these semantics games about what people really mean, what their intentions are. What do you make about how this particular issue is playing on Capitol Hill? MATTHEW CONTINETTI, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": I think someone needs to explain to Senator Sanders that it was Hamas who initiated the violence by firing rockets indiscriminately at Israel's civilian population. It's Hamas that controls Gaza undemocratically since it seized control in 2007 from Fatah, it's rival Palestinian faction. It's Hamas that imbeds its terror infrastructure within its own civilian population in order to maximize civilian casualties of its own people. And it's Hamas that in your own clip with Trey Yingst was firing on humanitarian aid. We need to be absolutely clear, Shannon, it's Hamas' conflict. And the reason that the ceasefire is good news is that it signals that Israel is confident it has destroyed enough of Hamas' terror infrastructure to at least stop the rocket attacks for some amount of time."

To a much less heated battle, but one that is political and growing here domestically is this fight on Capitol Hill over Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in light of the CDC's conversation and recommendations in recent days, mandating that masks still be worn on the House floor when members are there to speak. Here is a bit of the back and forth from the two sides over that."

      "utterance": "One of a trillion. Shannon, there were a lot of rules when I was in the House, and they were usually honored only in their breach. We weren't supposed to bring drinks on the House floor. We weren't supposed to take pictures. Almost everyone violated those. I did not. I'm a rule follower, which kind of brings me to my larger point. Anyone can follow a rule they agree with. It takes no courage to follow a rule you agree with. It's those that we don't agree with that separates the law and order people from everyone else. So, if you don't like the rule, then retake the House and change the rules, or honor it, or if you are going to break it and engage in civil disobedience, pay your dadgum fine. Those are your three options. Honor the rule, change the rule, or engage in civil disobedience but pay your fine if you're going to do so."

She wants to punish the members, mainly Republicans, who haven't taken the vaccine, when, in fact, they are only endangering themselves by not having the vaccination.

The White House just concluded a review of North Korea policy, which was very vague, so this gives the opportunity for the president to put some meat on the bone. But more importantly, Shannon, this White House has been buffeted by crises, the latest is just this Middle East and the Colonial pipeline hack. I'm afraid that Kim Jong-un there in North Korea might be cooking up another surprise this summer."

      "utterance": "I have ceasefire welcome but does little to resolve the conflict. I think the tragic thing about this ceasefire is that we can expect this kind of conflict to happen again. It's been happening periodically. Neither side steams have any appetite for real negotiations for a two-state solution. And the Israelis like to say that every so often they just have to go in and mow the lawn, degrade Hamas' capabilities, shoot down a lot of their rockets, and get ready for the next time."
