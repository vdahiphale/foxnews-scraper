The storm making landfall for the second time today after the eye briefly ventured back into the Gulf of Mexico. Harvey is the biggest rainstorm in continental US history and is responsible for over 20 deaths, a figure that is sadly expected to rise. According to the Red Cross, over 30,000 people slept in shelters in last night due to the storm. For the latest, we go to Steve Harrigan in Kountze, Texas. Steve, what do you got? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

It's gets to be about seven feet deep behind me, and there's actually frogs jumping all around me right now. Throughout the day, we've seen volunteers with flat bottom boats. They've been going into sub-divisions, to my left and to my right, going door to door and pulling out anyone who wanted to leave. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For those who wanted to stay in their flooded houses, they been bringing out medicine and canned goods. What happens here has been tremendous; 49 inches of rain in just five days. In one effect when you get that much water here that quickly. Entire towns have become islands. We saw two men going out in the boat here earlier. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They were going to Sour Lake. That is about 60 miles away. They say the entire town is cut off by water. No rescuers have been there yet. We don't know what we are going to find. That's the real worry here when this water begins to recede. What will we find? Real concerns about casualties going up in places like Beaumont. Greg, back to you.",

Opinion slingers like me, who are sidelined as we become -- like you -- witnesses to real news. When all you have are visuals of human misery and human spirit, who needs me? The only thing that matters is helping the helpless.

Governor Blanco shed tears, while delaying National Guard troops for days. Mayor Nagin shouted on TV, but what about those buses left unused then ruined, or the Red Cross being delayed entry to New Orleans? Ultimately, Blanco went away, Nagin's in jail and President Bush won't be noted for turning the other cheek when both blamed him for their errors. Now, it's too soon to judge Mr. Trump. But you know it's coming. Just weeks ago the media used an evil act in Charlottesville to indict America. Now Harvey arrives to repudiate that notion, righting a perspective that had been wrong for so long. We aren't what the media says we are: divided, hateful, evil. What the news has been telling us for years has been dispelled in just a few days. There's no room for spin when you see those rescues with your own eyes. Americans are what those pictures are: selfless, colorblind, inspiring. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The news may be bad, but for once it shows us who you really are in times of crisis: good.",

But when something like this happens, and as devastating as it is, there's something so brutally honest about what were seeing. It's just a 180 degree different from what we've been hearing in the last couple months under President Trump. And this - a lot of myths have been busted. That Texas is racist, false. You see blacks saving whites, and vice versa. Texas hates immigrants. They put out a story that people were checking IDs for illegals at homeless shelters, also false. They were saying that - the American's are always helpless and they're always victims. But 90 percent of these people are pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps. Left says that we spend too much money on the military. Well a lot of these helicopters from the Coast Guard are very expensive. They're saving a lot of lives out there and they're not run on solar power. They're run on diesel. They're saying President Trump can't run the government. I think the coordination has been spectacular. And if you're Republican president you're always going get criticized. Bush was criticized for flying over Katrina. President Trump criticized for landing in the aftermath. President Obama golfed during the BP oil spill. He golfed during the flooding in Louisiana last year, and the press praised him.

I think the president has handled this very well. Believe me, there will be 3,000 news stories about how bad it was, if he made a misstep. And, the most that they could cling to that - they were complaining that the first lady had heels on during one portion of it. That's what they had to seize on, so I am encouraged, Greg, once again by something like this that terrible devastation that you see going on that people actually come together, and you see people carrying other people on their back, trying to carrying them to safety.

This is the very reason why we have not had major bipartisan tax reform since 1986. So he went to the Heartland Missouri to say he wants to set a goal of cutting the corporate tax rate as low as 15 percent from the current 35 percent and brought back some of the populous rhetoric from the campaign, the president is saying that he wants to see individual tax cuts go to the middle class, not to the rich, go to the workers. Yet on the left and the right he almost immediately found opposition. Ann Coulter and Chuck Schumer are both saying this is going to help Wall Street not Main Street. Coulter had a tweet storm telling the President he should focus instead on illegal immigration, save taxes for a second term. Saying, \"Oh stop pretending. This is about letting families keep more of their money. Half of Americans don't pay taxes. This is for Wall Street.\" Schumer is saying much the same, \"If the President wants to use populism to sell his tax plan he ought to consider actually consider putting his money where his mouth is and putting forward a plan that puts the middle class, not the top one percent first.\" The President as you can imagine rejected all of that and said it's now time for Schumer and the Democratic leaders and well as the Republican leaders to step up to the plate and get this done unlike health care.",

Harvey is the biggest rainstorm in continental US history and is responsible for over 20 deaths, a figure that is sadly expected to rise.

They've been going into sub-divisions, to my left and to my right, going door to door and pulling out anyone who wanted to leave. For those who wanted to stay in their flooded houses, they been bringing out medicine and canned goods. What happens here has been tremendous; 49 inches of rain in just five days. In one effect when you get that much water here that quickly. Entire towns have become islands. We saw two men going out in the boat here earlier. They were going to Sour Lake. That is about 60 miles away. They say the entire town is cut off by water. No rescuers have been there yet. We don't know what we are going to find.

It's just a 180 degree different from what we've been hearing in the last couple months under President Trump. And this - a lot of myths have been busted. That Texas is racist, false. You see blacks saving whites, and vice versa. Texas hates immigrants. They put out a story that people were checking IDs for illegals at homeless shelters, also false. They were saying that - the American's are always helpless and they're always victims. But 90 percent of these people are pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps. Left says that we spend too much money on the military. Well a lot of these helicopters from the Coast Guard are very expensive. They're saving a lot of lives out there and they're not run on solar power. They're run on diesel. They're saying President Trump can't run the government. I think the coordination has been spectacular. And if you're Republican president you're always going get criticized. Bush was criticized for flying over Katrina. President Trump criticized for landing in the aftermath. President Obama golfed during the BP oil spill. He golfed during the flooding in Louisiana last year, and the press praised him. So now Trump lacks empathy because he did not go put his arm around and cry with a survivor. I'm not so sure that's what counts. It - it'll perfectly boils down what liberalism is.

They have to shut down such a large perimeter. It really changes the game. It actually can prevent people from getting - their lives saved, from getting shelter, from getting food, and housing, all of the above, so you have to be smart about how you handle it. So you that you come in to do your job and see it up close and personal, but you are not an impediment in terms of being able for people to get the resources they need. And there by, even creating a further public safety problem, and impacting it in a negative way. I think the president has handled this very well. Believe me, there will be 3,000 news stories about how bad it was, if he made a misstep. And, the most that they could cling to that - they were complaining that the first lady had heels on during one portion of it. That's what they had to seize on, so I am encouraged, Greg, once again by something like this that terrible devastation that you see going on that people actually come together, and you see people carrying other people on their back, trying to carrying them to safety.

This is the very reason why we have not had major bipartisan tax reform since 1986. So he went to the Heartland Missouri to say he wants to set a goal of cutting the corporate tax rate as low as 15 percent from the current 35 percent and brought back some of the populous rhetoric from the campaign, the president is saying that he wants to see individual tax cuts go to the middle class, not to the rich, go to the workers. Yet on the left and the right he almost immediately found opposition. Ann Coulter and Chuck Schumer are both saying this is going to help Wall Street not Main Street. Coulter had a tweet storm telling the President he should focus instead on illegal immigration, save taxes for a second term. Saying, \"Oh stop pretending. This is about letting families keep more of their money. Half of Americans don't pay taxes. This is for Wall Street.\" Schumer is saying much the same, \"If the President wants to use populism to sell his tax plan he ought to consider actually consider putting his money where his mouth is and putting forward a plan that puts the middle class, not the top one percent first.\" The President as you can imagine rejected all of that and said it's now time for Schumer and the Democratic leaders and well as the Republican leaders to step up to the plate and get this done unlike health care."

They promised health care, they promised tax reform, they did not deliver on health care, and they have to deliver on tax reform. It's going to be complicated, the reason why this hasn't happened in over 30 years is because it's incredibly complex. I think that Republicans are better off with tax reform than health care because health care was very complicated to try to message to the American people because you're not really actually substantially reforming health care through the reconciliation process. I think there is more they can do with healthcare, it was smart to go to Missouri, a state that he won, I think by 19 points. Putting pressure on a red state Democrats, going around to all the ten states where Democrats are seeking tough reelection."

Now I'm reading there only dropping the tax, top brackets from 39 to 36? That is nothing. And now I'm hearing they might not even drop it at all, they might leave the top rate at 39 quarts mark that is not a massive amount of tax relief. That is nothing, and that is not good to stimulus growth either. This is our money. We made the money."

      "utterance": "I hope some of her colleagues take heed of what she did and follow along. You want to know why they don't condemn this type of left wing of violence. It's because reporters never ask them to. Let's give you an example, if there's a tea Party guy and he gets into a fender bender. Every reporter on Capitol Hill will go into every single elected Republican official and say what you think about this right wing road rage? And then they would have to answer for it and it would become a story. What happens is these left-wing reporters cover for the Democrats and I don't have to condemn their own. You want to know why the Democratic leadership hasn't said anything about this, because there are no Democratic leaders, besides Nancy Pelosi, who was it? Chuck Schumer? Nine of the ten Democrats on the street don't even know who he is. That is why they're not condemning it, there's no leadership."

A day later she puts on a statement, it's good to know she listens to make him a text my advice, I'll have more advice later throughout the night. It exposes a couple things. It exposes the hypocrisy of the Democratic Party who sat here over the past couple of weeks and said we denounce hate, we denounce violence in this country but the only person we've heard from his Nancy Pelosi. Terry McAuliffe couldn't even bring himself to say no, Antifa is bad. It exposes the bias in the media because Jesse is absolutely right. Where is the media going to Democrats and asking for statements, putting them on record. Do you support Antifa or not? It exposes their bias because they were more than happy to use a hate group which every Republican under the sun denounced and try to malign the Republican Party in the President of the United States. Shame on Democrats and shame on the media."

I do have to congratulate her, I'm glad she said it because we should condemn all violence on both sides. Who said that first? And got yelled at? Let's not go there, but we know who said that he was right. Let's also be clear, this is not a protest group. It's a violent group of clowney cowards. A protest group does not hide behind a masks. You know what group hides behind a mask? The KKK. The Antifa is the new KKK, those are the only two groups I can think of that wear masks beside kids on Halloween. They go after, they attack people and they know they are doing wrong which is why they wear the mask. If they were doing something right, they wouldn't wear the mask like the KKK. They are the Antifa KKK, let's call them that from now on."

It wasn't an all-out condemnation, I think it wasn't what the left wants, the left is in fury with President Trump, I think what she said is almost pedestrian, I hope that he can learn, I hope that he becomes a matter man in a better President. I must say that the notion, the things that she touched on, Charlottesville, the pardon of Arpaio. What I'm seeing for example a Fox poll out, 56 percent think Trump is tearing the country apart. When you get this Senator, the much respected former Senator of San Francisco, saying I hope he can do well, I think there are a lot of people who overreact, I think that is what happened here."

One side he is Hitler, the other side sees a decent guy who might actually be a good President. She stepped out of her movie and that is why she was in that other movie. She burst of that share dilution. She was supposed to say he is evil. She was supposed to say he is impeached, but instead she spoke like a rational human being. She stepped out of that movie that is why everybody freaked out."

I thought what she said at the commonwealth class was good. It was mature, reasonable, rational thing to say. We all wish for the President to do well. What I didn't like is that she went ahead and criticized, mea culpa because people criticized her. She didn't do anything wrong when she said that at the commonwealth club. She is stronger and smarter than that, I wouldn't have caved to that."

We have someone like Claire McCaskill of Missouri were President Trump it just was says she may be inclined to work with him on lowering the corporate tax rate. Do you think there's any semblance for the Democrats realizing worst fund-raising was seen in forever, very long time for the Democratic Party? Is there any semblance were Democrats might work with Republicans on any of the stuff, tax reform or anything else."
