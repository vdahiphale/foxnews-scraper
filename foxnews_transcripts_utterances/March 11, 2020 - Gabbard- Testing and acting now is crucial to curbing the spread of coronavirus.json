Tom Hanks plays Presley's long time manager Colonel Tom Parker. And Hanks just tweeted out quoting here: we felt a bit tired like we had colds and somebody and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went slight fever.

But the problem becomes is this the end for the NBA season? We will find out more in coming hours. We should note that the World Health Organization resisted calling this a global pandemic fearing it would give the impression that Coronavirus was unstoppable. Now that designation has been made and the Director-General of W.H.O. is saying that all countries have the power to change the course of the disease. Coronavirus has now infected more than 120,000 people in 114 countries on six continents. In this country 1100 plus cases in 40 states some 38 deaths.

Many of us were freaking out and frightened and expecting for terrorism can't blame us. Congress rushed to pass the Patriot Act we invaded Afghanistan and later Iraq. Most of us gave our unwavering support, I did. It wasn't until many years later though that we learned that the Patriot Act well there were abuses there and over time in both wars thousands were killed and others badly injured. And families were shatter by losses and PTSD. Trillions of tax payer dollars were spent. A massive displacement of Iraqis Christians and others not to speak of a domino effect of instability in the Middle East but when key decisions were made in the 2000s few thought about these long-term ramifications. I didn't and few thought of the potential for lasting damage to the United States. Now back to today as Dr Fauci said we haven't seen the worst of it. We must take a good aggressive measure so that our hospitals are not overwhelmed. Yet at some point and we hope soon as with SARS in H1N2 this will pass. It's a severe problem but likely also a short term one. As we consider measures to fight the virus is spread we also need to think longer term this includes protecting our economy. Now this may shock you. But I'm going to compliment Nancy Pelosi. Good for her well we should be mindful about mitigating community spread we should also try and no it's not easy but try to strike a balance here.

Joining me now is Tezlyn Figaro, political analyst, former social justice director for Bernie Sanders's 2016 campaign. Tezlyn, great to see you. This seems potentially like a -- just looking at the politics of it, putting the public health issue aside for a moment. But just looking at this politically, this seems like this could be a problem for Sanders, yes? TEZLYN FIGARO, FORMER SANDERS 2016 NATIONAL STAFFER: It absolutely can be a problem. Joe Biden will certainly benefit because we don't have to worry about him threatening to take somebody out back. So we don't have to worry about that as an issue. But then again it might benefit Senator Sanders as well because then he won't have to explain why the big crowds just won't show up at the polls. So at this point I think it's time that voters really just make a decision on who they want to go with, and I think people are finding out that folks are just not socialists. I worked for Senator Sanders and I've always said, at least for the last four years on FOX, that I am independent, I'm moderate. I joined him in 2016 for very different reasons.

People must have access to food, clothes, water, basic needs, even some religious considerations, and that significantly limits the ability to impose a quarantine.

We're learning more we'll get back to you as the hour progresses. More breaking news Laura the NBA has now released a statement saying the league is suspending all games until further notice after tonight's schedule. This comes after a Utah jazz player just tested positive for the Coronavirus. The test result was reported shortly before the tip off in tonight's game between the Utah Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder. That game was canceled and we didn't have a reason why. It was just canceled out of the blue and the NBA would not tell us. Now a short time ago the NBA comes out with a statement saying the player was not in the arena at the time which should give comfort to the people of Oklahoma City. But the problem becomes is this the end for the NBA season? We will find out more in coming hours. We should note that the World Health Organization resisted calling this a global pandemic fearing it would give the impression that Coronavirus was unstoppable. Now that designation has been made and the Director-General of W.H.O. is saying that all countries have the power to change the course of the disease. Coronavirus has now infected more than 120,000 people in 114 countries on six continents. In this country 1100 plus cases in 40 states some 38 deaths. Dr. Tony Fauci the Director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease told lawmakers that things are going to get worse. Then he was asked to give the public a realistic assessment. Listen to this."

On one of the other networks I'm not even going to name them because they're not worthy of it but they were talking about how he was breathing during his commentary. Somehow that he seemed nervous. They could not bring themselves to say that the one thing they were looking for him to do, which was to take this very seriously you don't suspend travel for 30 days from Europe and not somehow believe that's serious. It's very serious. I thought the President had exactly the right tone, he had the right message. I don't think anybody doubts that this is a serious issue. The President just like he did with China is taking a serious action with Europe. And I think he made it clear he will do whatever he can to protect the American people.

It's harder but wiser for elected officials to proceed carefully and not get frightened in the making decisions they're later going to come to regret. To some extent this moment does remind me a little bit of the immediate aftermath of 9-11. I remember. I was here. Many of us were freaking out and frightened and expecting for terrorism can't blame us. Congress rushed to pass the Patriot Act we invaded Afghanistan and later Iraq. Most of us gave our unwavering support, I did. It wasn't until many years later though that we learned that the Patriot Act well there were abuses there and over time in both wars thousands were killed and others badly injured. And families were shatter by losses and PTSD. Trillions of tax payer dollars were spent. A massive displacement of Iraqis Christians and others not to speak of a domino effect of instability in the Middle East but when key decisions were made in the 2000s few thought about these long-term ramifications. I didn't and few thought of the potential for lasting damage to the United States. Now back to today as Dr Fauci said we haven't seen the worst of it. We must take a good aggressive measure so that our hospitals are not overwhelmed. Yet at some point and we hope soon as with SARS in H1N2 this will pass. It's a severe problem but likely also a short term one. As we consider measures to fight the virus is spread we also need to think longer term this includes protecting our economy. Now this may shock you. But I'm going to compliment Nancy Pelosi. Good for her well we should be mindful about mitigating community spread we should also try and no it's not easy but try to strike a balance here. Where the risk is minimal the business of America must go on. FDR told us that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. And fear alone is certainly not a sound basis for making significant decisions that impinge our constitutional rights. Rights like freedom to assemble free association free speech. Should we think about the type of precedent we're setting here? Should we assume maybe we should I don't know going forward that anytime a serious disease migrates here from another country we're going to have to close everything down? As one economist said the other night that could end up being more catastrophic for America over the long term then this horrific virus itself.

Will this new President again thinking longer term the new President will require that we start canceling everything all in new. And that means no more campaign events like rallies no more town halls, no more interacting with the voters. Our constitution requires that our political process continue. This crisis must not be used to help candidates of either party escape the questions and accountability from the voters. Nor must it be used to guilt candidates into canceling events for healthy people. At some point people are going to begin pushing back against mass hysteria.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We knew it would happen, the coronavirus infecting the presidential election. President Trump just announced that he is canceling a pair of events out west. Both the Sanders and Biden campaigns canceled their rallies over public health concerns. And while that might be prudent, and as a move it is no secret that canceling events benefits one candidate in particular -- Joe Biden. Joining me now is Tezlyn Figaro, political analyst, former social justice director for Bernie Sanders's 2016 campaign. Tezlyn, great to see you. This seems potentially like a -- just looking at the politics of it, putting the public health issue aside for a moment. But just looking at this politically, this seems like this could be a problem for Sanders, yes? TEZLYN FIGARO, FORMER SANDERS 2016 NATIONAL STAFFER: It absolutely can be a problem. Joe Biden will certainly benefit because we don't have to worry about him threatening to take somebody out back. So we don't have to worry about that as an issue. But then again it might benefit Senator Sanders as well because then he won't have to explain why the big crowds just won't show up at the polls. So at this point I think it's time that voters really just make a decision on who they want to go with, and I think people are finding out that folks are just not socialists. I worked for Senator Sanders and I've always said, at least for the last four years on FOX, that I am independent, I'm moderate. I joined him in 2016 for very different reasons. But it is important for folks to understand that this country, they just don't want to elect a socialist. So Senator Sanders has to take some responsibility for that as well."

      "utterance": "It is time for us to shut this primary down. It is time for us to cancel the rest of the debates, because you don't do anything but get yourself in trouble if you continue this contest when it's obvious that the numbers will not shake out for you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Tezlyn, they are not saying that because of the coronavirus, but you can get the point. The coronavirus just makes that argument for them I think more powerful. Just end it, Bernie Sanders sit down, you don't matter anymore. But how is that heard from the perspective of all of the supporters he does have? That sounds a little bit insulting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FIGARO",
      "utterance": "It's extremely insulting. And Jim Clyburn said, you heard him say you don't do anything but get yourself in trouble because they are afraid that Joe Biden will continue to have more gaffes. And I don't know why they're hiding that. People are well aware that Joe Biden has consistent gaffes and they still voted for him anyway. But just to have the audacity to say let's just shut the puppy down is disrespectful even to those who want to vote for Joe Biden, even those who want to vote for Sanders or those who want to write in in a candidate. It is disrespectful to American democracy to just decide you want to stop midway. There's still half of the delegates to be earned. Senator Sanders certainly has a hard road ahead. It won't be easy. He would have to pretty much win by a landslide in order to have a path to the nomination. But it is a little bit early to be making that call, and it shouldn't be made by just one or two folks at the top. That's why we're in the situation that we're in right now, and folks are hash-tagging right now \"Dem Exit\" because of that type of nonsense."

But I just think it gives -- whether this is the GOP establishment trying to shove stuff down people's throat, or whether it's the Democrat establishment trying to cut off primary voters, I just think people are tired of this. They just want their say, and then we will see where the chips fall. But to just say we are done with this now. No, we are not. States have a right to have primaries. They are going to have a lawsuit on their hands, as well. Tezlyn, thanks so much."

And what would that mean for our constitutional rights? Joining me now is William Kishman, labor and employment attorney, John Eastman Claremont Institute senior fellow and constitutional scholar. William, let's start with you. What are the constitutional concerns with, first let's start with a containment zone or imposed quarantine?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAM KISHMAN, LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Right. There are quite a few different constitutional checks that at least significantly limit the government's ability to impose these types of mandatory quarantines or containment zones where people just are not permitted to leave. There is the due process clause which requires people to have a hearing if this were to happen. It would either be forehand or at least promptly thereafter. There is the equal protection clause which prevents the government from arbitrarily imposing quarantines. There is quite a bit of authority that requires the conditions of any quarantine to be humane. People must have access to food, clothes, water, basic needs, even some religious considerations, and that significantly limits the ability to impose a quarantine. And then the laws that are on the books right now inherently include at least some protections. For example, many states have laws that require people to have a hearing at least within a couple of days. So there are significant limits."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I think the reason -- I'm sorry to interrupt. But John, I think when we hear about people saying campaigns should be basically just stopped, primaries should be stopped. Cruise ships are different, especially for the elderly, because that's real close quarters. But we do have constitutional rights in our country also to at some point balance about freedom of movement and assembly. But those can be overridden, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN EASTMAN, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW",
      "utterance": "They can. And the last time we had a mass quarantine was a century ago in the Spanish flu outbreak in 1918. There is statute on the books, Title 42, Section 264, that basically allows the head of Centers for Disease Control has been delegated the authority to develop regulations that would quarantine to stop the spread of any infectious disease. And the respiratory disease we're talking about here, the coronavirus, is one of the diseases listed inside the series of executive orders that identified what diseases qualify for creating that quarantine. You have got two things. You've got quarantine and you're got isolation. Isolation for people that are already manifesting the disease and risk infecting others. And then quarantine of those people who have been exposed to it but don't yet have the disease. And we can quarantine them for a shorter period of time to make sure they don't develop it and become contagious to others."

The National Guard that is now tonight in New Rochelle, New York, they are not stopping people -- from what the reporting says, they're not stopping people from leaving New Rochelle. They are helping deliver food and getting people to medical facilities and doing other essential things. But people think there are guns -- they are not doing that. Could they do that in extreme cases?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KISHMAN",
      "utterance": "I think that's going to be very rare at a minimum for a lot of different reasons. So we have already seen evidence about how governments prefer to address this situation. There have been many governments, even in Washington state, northern California, areas that have been pretty heavily impacted already that have considered mandatory quarantines with some law enforcement mechanism. They have decided against them. There's CDC people who have gone on public record saying that they don't think mandatory quarantines are the best option. And obviously, a quarantine is going to be much more expensive than doing steps like tracking, just prohibiting public gathers. And then also a quarantine is more vulnerable to a court challenge than some of these other steps."

      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, there are a couple of aspects of how it's, I think, being deployed, or exaggerated. And I don't begrudge the seriousness of the issue. But even today the World Health Organization's use of the word \"pandemic\" sows a great deal of confusion. We think that means millions and millions and millions of people are going to die. What pandemic means is millions and millions may get the disease. But there is a very low percentage of people that get it that are going to have mortality issues. So even the use of the way we're using the words can then be redeployed to create a different kind of frenzy. That tanks the stock market. That takes off the table one of the big issues for President Trump's reelection. And if there is any connection between those two, you've got a real big concern that this is being deployed for political purposes."
