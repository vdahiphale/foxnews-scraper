He's actually, by the way, in the building. He's not begun his speech yet. Very interesting. The president talked about his opposition, if you will, to Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. He also talked in length about Michael Wolff, calling him a fantasy writer. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Wolff, of course, the author of the latest book \"Fire and Fury\" which has created so much of a controversy in Washington and consternation for the White House. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In case you just missed this one, he also talked about an Axios piece, Neil, that was sort of laying out his executive time. I'm not suggesting that the piece was saying he didn't work hard. It just said that he had more free time than other presidents. And he pushed back on that, saying he works as hard as any president ever has. Now, as you pointed out, he's actually here in Nashville expected to address this overflow crowd of the American Farm Bureau in just a few moments. He's going to be talking once again about the importance of the new tax law and how it will benefit American families and, in particular, America's farm families. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let me show you a little excerpt for you, my friend, while we have a moment. This is, again, as prepared from the White House. \"From now on, most family farms and small business owners will be spared the punishment of the deeply unfair estate tax known as the death tax, so you can keep your farms in the family. In every decision we make, we're honoring America's proud farming legacy.\" Now, as you also know, Neil, as we have discussed on a number of occasions, usually, events like this are back-ended by other policy initiatives and announcements and the like. And we will see once again if that is the case. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, I can tell you this. Given the venue here, it is a massive crowd. Given it's a state that he won like 60 to 34 and given the VIPs in attendance, it is a pretty good bet he will be rolling out something. Of course, we will let you know what we find out here shortly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Live coverage your way in just a bit, but, for now, my friend, back to you.",

That was the good thing, was Reagan didn't worry about what was in the press and he didn't go crazy over it. And he had a staff certainly in the first term that was very loyal to him. Second term, he had a new staff, mainly Don Regan's people, who had been the treasury secretary. And that didn't work quite as well. And after Iran-Contra, he was very disturbed that that could happen on his watch. Those were things he was contrary to. But every single day, and I was with him all the time until the end, he functioned effectively. He had a great sense of humor. He was a guy who was shot in the second month of his administration, almost killed. He had basically colon surgery. He had a whole variety of things. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But more fundamental than any of it, he was deaf in one ear. The gun had gone off when he was making movies and he was hard of hearing. And he was a little bit blind. But other than that, he was fully functioning, could write beautifully, he could speak beautifully and basically had a core of beliefs. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Again, the key thing was, he came in knowing what he wanted to do.

But whoever was in charge of the microphone at that desk has now disappeared. We can't track that individual down. But, obviously, that was a big mistake. The president making light of it, though, on a day he was reminding folks, look what's been happening in the markets, look what's been happening in the economy, and look at this $5.5 trillion in tax cuts. We wondered where he got that figure. That's the net total of -- I'm sorry -- the gross total of tax cuts offset by about $4 trillion in revenue raisers. Hence, you get the $1.5 trillion net tax cut cost over the course of 10 years. But it began in $5.5 trillion in the aggregate, and of course the number raises to offset that prompted all of this. Anyway, back with my guests. Katie, did the president make good on just -- on just forcing that point across and letting people know, all right, there might be a lot of people paying attention to this Michael Wolff book, he did not, and maybe that's the way it should be?

George Bush Sr. was the last. Meanwhile, critics are ramping up their attacks on him, but the economy and the market seems to be proving a lot of those critics wrong. If that is part of the instability that they like to talk about, probably a lot of investors would welcome that instability.

      "utterance": "Hey there, Neil. A little loud here at the Opryland Hotel, as you can well imagine, pretty excited crowd looking forward to the president's remarks. I want to share just a bit of the gaggle notes, as we got them before the president made his way here. He's actually, by the way, in the building. He's not begun his speech yet. Very interesting. The president talked about his opposition, if you will, to Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. He also talked in length about Michael Wolff, calling him a fantasy writer. Wolff, of course, the author of the latest book \"Fire and Fury\" which has created so much of a controversy in Washington and consternation for the White House. In case you just missed this one, he also talked about an Axios piece, Neil, that was sort of laying out his executive time. I'm not suggesting that the piece was saying he didn't work hard. It just said that he had more free time than other presidents. And he pushed back on that, saying he works as hard as any president ever has. Now, as you pointed out, he's actually here in Nashville expected to address this overflow crowd of the American Farm Bureau in just a few moments. He's going to be talking once again about the importance of the new tax law and how it will benefit American families and, in particular, America's farm families. Let me show you a little excerpt for you, my friend, while we have a moment. This is, again, as prepared from the White House. \"From now on, most family farms and small business owners will be spared the punishment of the deeply unfair estate tax known as the death tax, so you can keep your farms in the family. In every decision we make, we're honoring America's proud farming legacy.\" Now, as you also know, Neil, as we have discussed on a number of occasions, usually, events like this are back-ended by other policy initiatives and announcements and the like. And we will see once again if that is the case. Now, I can tell you this. Given the venue here, it is a massive crowd. Given it's a state that he won like 60 to 34 and given the VIPs in attendance, it is a pretty good bet he will be rolling out something. Of course, we will let you know what we find out here shortly. Live coverage your way in just a bit, but, for now, my friend, back to you."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

This tweet saying, \"I have had to put up with the fake news from the first day I announced that I would be running for president. And I have to put with a fake book written by a totally discredited author. Ronald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well. So will I.\" A guy who used to work for that president, in fact, elected him president, former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. Ed, is there a similarity here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ED ROLLINS, FORMER U.S. OFFICE OF POLITICAL AFFAIRS DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, there's only a similarity in the sense that they -- from the day Ronald Reagan got elected, they were trying to dismiss him as a viable person. They talked -- he was the oldest man to serve in the presidency. Trump is the same age at this point in time. And they were always basically saying, well, he was a movie star, he was this, he was that. They forgot the fact he had been governor for eight years in California. He had won a great campaign, won by a landslide in 1980, won by a bigger landslide in 1984. I think what happened to Reagan -- and Reagan didn't pay attention to it. That was the good thing, was Reagan didn't worry about what was in the press and he didn't go crazy over it. And he had a staff certainly in the first term that was very loyal to him. Second term, he had a new staff, mainly Don Regan's people, who had been the treasury secretary. And that didn't work quite as well. And after Iran-Contra, he was very disturbed that that could happen on his watch. Those were things he was contrary to. But every single day, and I was with him all the time until the end, he functioned effectively. He had a great sense of humor. He was a guy who was shot in the second month of his administration, almost killed. He had basically colon surgery. He had a whole variety of things. But more fundamental than any of it, he was deaf in one ear. The gun had gone off when he was making movies and he was hard of hearing. And he was a little bit blind. But other than that, he was fully functioning, could write beautifully, he could speak beautifully and basically had a core of beliefs. Again, the key thing was, he came in knowing what he wanted to do. Didn't have disarray in his White House initially. And I think, to a certain extent, but they still tried to take him apart."

But I thought the most was his sense of humor, that if he was thin-skinned, he certainly didn't show it. And he let the critics and the criticisms just sort of roll right down his back. And I wonder if there's a lesson there. Some of our more effective presidents have been able to turn what are seen to be flaws, you know, but by just joking or kidding about them, John Kennedy famously saying that he wouldn't let his -- yet his father told him he wouldn't pay for a landslide. Or even Ronald Reagan in dismissing critics who say he wasn't too bright, and he would famously say, well, I'm here, aren't I?"

You pay attention to the people you believe in like FOX and other places. But The Washington Post, The New York Times, they're never going to write good stuff about him. And I think every day he wants that reinforcement. He's like every politician. He wants to be loved a little bit. And I think that's -- and he reacts and overreacts sometimes."

World leaders who basically sit down face to face with him, no one walks away saying this guy is not stable. We knew what he was when we elected him. He was a different sort.

He said, I got panned every single day, every single movie. And I basically just -- you just keep going on, appreciate what you have. I'm just grateful to have this country to serve and I basically care very much about the people. And I think to a certain extent, that's where what drove him.

There's none of the comradery and loyalty, for example, that Ronald Reagan enjoyed with his staff, Cabinet officials, higher-ups, people like yourself. But that might be just a wrong impression.

And I was really amazed in a very short period of time -- this was before they had to change the chief of staff -- they were all kind of getting even with each other. Everybody kind of had their own little power center. Everybody had their own little media program, as opposed to basically being there to serve the president. One of the key things when you do a lot of campaigns, you do a lot of service, as I have, in government, you serve the person that is there. There are 538 people who got votes in Washington, D.C., president, vice president, 100 senators, 435 congressmen. Everybody lives off of their reflected power. And the bottom line is, those are the people who got the votes, those are the people you serve. And if you can't serve them, you walk out. You don't basically trash them in magazines and publications."

I think if it were not for some of these lapses where either tweets or gets vexing with those who are criticizing him, he does have a record with the markets, and the economy, these tax cuts that could be bigger and more substantial and beneficial to the American people and the economy than has generally been given the case, that that would have him soaring right now."

Every day is a brand-new day. And I think to a certain extent, he knew what he wanted to do and it's kind of a question of working itself out. And it hasn't been a communications operation. It's much better now. Someone like Hope Hicks is very loyal to him. Sarah Sanders is very loyal to him. But there are a whole bunch of people out there trying to serve themselves and tell -- there's always a tendency to tell the press I'm so smart, I'm the one making the speech, I'm the one that is doing this, I'm really the power behind the throne.

Whatever the case, those two seem to have buried a hatchet here. But whoever was in charge of the microphone at that desk has now disappeared. We can't track that individual down. But, obviously, that was a big mistake. The president making light of it, though, on a day he was reminding folks, look what's been happening in the markets, look what's been happening in the economy, and look at this $5.5 trillion in tax cuts. We wondered where he got that figure. That's the net total of -- I'm sorry -- the gross total of tax cuts offset by about $4 trillion in revenue raisers. Hence, you get the $1.5 trillion net tax cut cost over the course of 10 years. But it began in $5.5 trillion in the aggregate, and of course the number raises to offset that prompted all of this. Anyway, back with my guests. Katie, did the president make good on just -- on just forcing that point across and letting people know, all right, there might be a lot of people paying attention to this Michael Wolff book, he did not, and maybe that's the way it should be? What do you think?"

I think it was a politically savvy move to do this right now, because it reminds everyone in the middle of America, it reminds rural workers, rural families that Trump still sees them, he pays attention to them, he cares about them. And that's something that the Democrats failed to do in the election, and if they don't catch up to this, that Trump is reminding those voters, you feel just disenfranchised, and I'm listening, then they're going to have a bad time. I think it was really smart on Trump's part. I just hope he stays off Twitter after the fact."

They wanted to hear from him. And, of course, the strong economy is really helping them. One thing that he hit on is regulations. For every one new regulation, they cut 22. And to really put this in perspective, when Obama left office last year, I nation federal registrar, we had almost 100,000 pages of regulations. That was an all-time high. This year, or last year, 2017, as we came out of 2017 into this new year, 2018, we cut that by almost half, down to under 62,000 pages, which is just incredible..."

You know, Charlie, the president was more or less getting back that this is one of the things that I can do alone, if I want to, these executive orders, executive memoranda, whatever you want to call it. And as you reported very early on, a lot of corporations, businesses of all sizes and shapes, that this was the biggest burden to them. Before they saw the fruition of tax cuts, it was getting regulations off of their back, and this was a reminder that is something a president can do."

And it's what we were reporting on FOX Business all year, that just by the fact that he hired more free market people in the various agencies, you didn't even have to do anything on it. Then, on top of it, he did executive orders which cut some of these regulations. That was the de facto tax cut for corporations. And that's why you see the markets, and not just the markets, the economy. And, remember, the markets and the economy were supposed to slow down after seven years. Right? Even though it was like a weak growth spurt, it was supposed to slow down. That's the usual cycle. And they kept going. And one of the reasons why, big reason, is this whole thing with regulation. I will say one other thing, Neil. That was a very sane speech. We keep hearing that this man is insane from the Democrats and from Michael Wolff, 25th Amendment. That -- no -- no insane person gives that speech. That was a great speech. But my one worry about President Trump, if I was his political adviser, I would say, you give -- he does some great stuff. And most of his best speeches are economic speeches. And you have so many skills. Did you just pollute the water so much with so many people that you can't like get back in their good graces? Did all the tweeting, errant tweeting just hurt him so much with people?"

If I'm crazy, then the world is crazily going along with this run-up in paper wealth that not only we have seen here, but spurred similar run-ups across the globe. He doesn't have to do that, of course. And it's always risky assigning the president and giving him the credit for something exclusively like that, because when the markets go down, he will have to take the blame as well. But he seems to be preaching to a choir that could say look, you know, truth be told, this has been a crazy, but a very real run-up. And if that's crazy, we welcome it."

Markets went to 25000, pricing in more economic growth. And you see some better economic numbers. That is a major, major achievement. And most of it is because of him and what he's done.
