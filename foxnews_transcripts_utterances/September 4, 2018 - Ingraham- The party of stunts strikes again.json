Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez, moveon.org, Black Lives Matter and other leftist groups organize thousands of protesters to swarm the venue. There were scuffles and violence. The security threat was so intense that the Trump campaign decided to cancel the rally. If you can't beat them, intimidate them. Today's Kavanaugh spectacle was revealing.

And breaking tonight the president is fighting back, charging author Bob Woodward has credibility problems and some anecdotes are simply false. One scene charging that after the Syrian president launched a chemical attack last year, Mr. Trump told the defense secretary James Mattis about Bashar Al Assad, quote, let's bleeping kill him, let's go in, let's kill the bleeping lot of them.\" The book claims Mattis humored the president but saying he would get right on it, but was stunned the president ordered an assassination, telling associates he's trying to prevent World War III. The retired general just put out a blistering statement tonight, though, saying, this is fiction, and any claim he uttered contemptuous words about the commander in chief is a product of, quote, someone's rich imagination. Chief of Staff John Kelly also denying the claim he privately said of the president, quote, he's an idiot. We are in crazy town. I don't even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I've ever had. Kelly declaring, quote, \"The idea I ever called the president an idiot is not true. As I stated in May and still firmly stand behind, I spend more time with the president than anyone and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship. He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is BS. I'm committed to the president, his agenda, and our country.\" The book goes on to say there was a practice session to prep the president for a possible interview with Bob Mueller and it went badly. The president's personal attorney John Dowd allegedly said, quote don't testify. It's either that or an orange jumpsuit. Well, Dowd is insisting, not true. He says, quote, \"There was no so-called practice session or a reenactment of a mock interview at the special counsel's office. Further, I did not refer to the president as a liar, did not say he was likely to end up in an orange jumpsuit. It was a great honor and district privilege to serve President Trump.\" So you see a pattern there. The president telling \"The Daily Caller\" in an interview tonight, this is nasty stuff. He would have refuted it all but he did not get the message, apparently, that Woodward wanted an interview. The \"Washington Post\" has obtained audio of a recent phone call between Woodward and the president. Listen.",

It's nice to see images like this one I snapped pre-game of the Michigan team.

THOM TILLIS, R—N.C.: I'm reviewing a tweet from NBC that said Democrats plotted coordinated protest strategy over the holiday weekend, all agreed to disrupt and protest the hearing. Chuck Schumer led a phone call and committee members are executing now. SEN. DICK DURBIN, D—ILL.: Mr. Chairman, there was a phone conference yesterday and I can tell you at the time of the phone conference, many issues were raised. One of the issues was the fact that over 100,000 documents related to Judge Kavanaugh have been characterized by the chairman of the committee as committee confidential."

It was meant to fluster Republicans and more importantly, to mobilize the party's left wing base. In other words, it's all about the midterms. They are not going to defeat Kavanaugh. He's going to get confirmed. They know it, we know it. But the truth is this is all the Democrats have. They are now basically just a party of wacky protests, silly sideshows and groupie stunts. They have no governing agenda or a cogent (ph) argument. They can't run against a thriving economy or record low unemployment or booming consumer confidence. So feigned outrage is all they are left with. One group of leftist women outside the Kavanaugh hearing actually donned \"Handmaid's Tale\" costumes, as if the judge's confirmation of the high court would turn women into slaves of the state. I looked closely at it, it looked more like a high school send-off of I don't know, \"Little House on the Prairie.\" It was really stupid. Got to get a new costume department. Among the protesters scattered through the hearing room was a familiar face. Leftist activist and professional rabble-rouser, Linda Sarsour.

The circus of today's hearing might only have involved, I don't know, three or four dozen people or something like that, but it was just as well-organized as the women's marches or any of those spontaneous pro-amnesty march as we saw earlier this year. I call this governance by stunt. We don't have the votes to change policies so we are going to try intimidation. After all, we know that most of the media are just going to laugh it up so let's just let it rip. And this is the same play they used in Chicago back in March 2016 when Trump was scheduled to attend a rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Remember that? Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez, moveon.org, Black Lives Matter and other leftist groups organize thousands of protesters to swarm the venue. There were scuffles and violence. The security threat was so intense that the Trump campaign decided to cancel the rally. If you can't beat them, intimidate them. Today's Kavanaugh spectacle was revealing. And that it shows the Democrat's enduring rage over the election of 2016. They just cannot get over it. And although Kavanaugh is supremely qualified, extremely well-regarded as a selection for the high court, he must be opposed because of the man who nominated him. This absurd political jacking today by Democratic 2020 hopefuls was as disruptive as it frankly was embarrassing."

The hysteria around Supreme Court confirmation hearings is coming from the fact that we have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American life now.

And, you know, much as probably you and I both disagree with Ben Sasse on the president quite a bit, I think he was the star. Ted Cruz was also a star today. And they have pointed out calmly what's the role of the court, and you wouldn't have these losers in their \"Handmaid's Tale\" costumes out there protesting.

He will sit for oral argument in the first week of October and that's going to happen, again, unless some bizarre thing happens. But as we are talking about this, in Massachusetts tonight there was a big primary. In the seventh district of Massachusetts, the incumbent Michael Capuano, who was endorsed by John Lewis and Maxine Waters -- OK, they're not exactly moderate Democrats endorsing him -- was beaten by an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsee whose name was a Ayanna Pressley -- how could I forget the king's last name, spelled differently. Ayanna Pressley, who is far left and was from the Boston City Council like an at-large member, that came out of nowhere. Again, the Democrats are losing control of this party here, I mean, even their gold standards of activists, I mean, liberals like John Lewis and Maxine Waters.

So let me get this straight, while NBC is embroiled in multiple scandals including completely blowing it on the Weinstein sexual assault story, Chuck Todd is telling Fox and others how to handle its business? Nice try. Joining me now with reaction, conservative radio talk show host, fox news contributor Tammy Bruce and Chris Hahn, a liberal radio talk show host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer. All right, Tammy, take it away. I find this to be rich.

And this is where, you know, in their private lines, how they all network together. But they are -- he's arguing now that going 24/7 against the president of the United States is not enough. They now want to go 24/7 against Fox News, that's what he's advocating for. In the midst of wondering why no one trusts the legacy media, and it's because they're untrustworthy. You can actually see a Gallup poll tracks the trustworthiness that media enjoys. And when Fox News began in 1996, the trustworthy index went up. It went up for a number of years. And but you can see when major events have occurred, that when the American trust mechanism, the quotient for the media starts to go down on major events, like after September 11 and other dynamics. So, you can just see, you know, they can fight back. Chuck Todd says in this piece he wants to fight back. He can fight back by actually doing his job --"

Instead of having an actual debate on the issues, its Trump's bad, Fox is bad, Fox hosts are bad. Meanwhile, Ronan Farrell releases a statement last night about what NBC had claimed, Chris, about this Weinstein coverage saying, well, it wasn't adequately sourced that's why we didn't go with Ronan's reporting. He says this last night, \"Executives there have now produced a memo that contains numerous false and misleading statements or misleading statement, so I'll say briefly: their list of sources is incomplete and omits women who were either identified in the NBC story or offered to be.\" \"The suggestion to take the story to another outlet was first raised by NBC, not me, and I took them up on it only after it became clear that I was being blocked from further reporting. The story was twice cleared and deemed reportable by legal and standards only to be blocked by executives who refused to allow us to seek comment from Harvey Weinstein.\" So covering up, it looks like for a pal of the network or pal of the executives, and now lecturing Fox?

So the ideal that when you go into a community and you see that community is depleted of talent, depleted of goods and jobs and education, and you take the talent out of there and that talent brings you billions, I think it's only morally right to bring that community forward and help that community come forward.

And 32 percent job approval, 18 percent said they would reelect him, 69 percent said trust in government was a major problem, that's from Garry McCarthy who is running for mayor there. Do you think Garry McCarthy has a decent shot here at this race for mayor? I mean he thinks we should be much tougher on the hardened criminals. You've got to have a better clearance rate, actually locking people up who commit violent crimes. And he thinks this is a 911 situation in the west and Englewood neighborhood, southside. It's bad."

      "utterance": "Laura, I think it's a bad plan for the city of Chicago. When you think about the way the current mayor handles the situation, it's with a heavy hand. And it's constantly talking about policing, and there has been no real plan, no real compassion for the city of Chicago. So we have to make sure that we have strong police in the city of Chicago, police that can handle the crime. But we also have to make sure that we eliminate the crime and give people opportunities throughout the communities where the violence is happening. The violence costs people in Streeterville, downtown Chicago, millions of dollars because we have to hire more police. So we have to have a point in Chicago where we are going to make sure that we say, after 30 years, Mayor Daley was the mayor for 22 years. He did a fine job of developing downtown and Rahm picked up on the develop, but that really hurt the city of Chicago. We have to make sure that we spread the developments so that Chicago can be the royal class city that we all know it could be. But you are never going to get rid of the violence."

And absolutely you can remove the violence. This idea, this policy of containment, like there is a bunch of George Kennans running around in charge of Chicago containing violence in these poor neighborhoods that have been turned into shooting galleries, most of the residents are law abiding. They are more worried about the layout than they are about protecting black families in the city of Chicago. It is a failure of the Chicago Democrat model of governance."

      "utterance": "Laura, good to see you. You're right, the book doesn't even come out until September the 11th, and already Washington is abuzz. And breaking tonight the president is fighting back, charging author Bob Woodward has credibility problems and some anecdotes are simply false. One scene charging that after the Syrian president launched a chemical attack last year, Mr. Trump told the defense secretary James Mattis about Bashar Al Assad, quote, let's bleeping kill him, let's go in, let's kill the bleeping lot of them.\" The book claims Mattis humored the president but saying he would get right on it, but was stunned the president ordered an assassination, telling associates he's trying to prevent World War III. The retired general just put out a blistering statement tonight, though, saying, this is fiction, and any claim he uttered contemptuous words about the commander in chief is a product of, quote, someone's rich imagination. Chief of Staff John Kelly also denying the claim he privately said of the president, quote, he's an idiot. We are in crazy town. I don't even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I've ever had. Kelly declaring, quote, \"The idea I ever called the president an idiot is not true. As I stated in May and still firmly stand behind, I spend more time with the president than anyone and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship. He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is BS. I'm committed to the president, his agenda, and our country.\" The book goes on to say there was a practice session to prep the president for a possible interview with Bob Mueller and it went badly. The president's personal attorney John Dowd allegedly said, quote don't testify. It's either that or an orange jumpsuit. Well, Dowd is insisting, not true. He says, quote, \"There was no so-called practice session or a reenactment of a mock interview at the special counsel's office. Further, I did not refer to the president as a liar, did not say he was likely to end up in an orange jumpsuit. It was a great honor and district privilege to serve President Trump.\" So you see a pattern there. The president telling \"The Daily Caller\" in an interview tonight, this is nasty stuff. He would have refuted it all but he did not get the message, apparently, that Woodward wanted an interview. The \"Washington Post\" has obtained audio of a recent phone call between Woodward and the president. Listen."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "People have been raising those questions again and again and again. Woodward carries more weight than Michael Wolff and some other authors like, say, Omarosa. He has a track record, we should acknowledge that, of reporting. But the fact of the matter is his critics were making these same allegations against the president before the book and I suspect they will do it after the book whether it's true or not, Laura."

I was a guest of Lou Holtz, what an amazing man, aside from the fact that he was a phenomenal coach. I met a lot of the 88 national championship team members. They had a big charity event that was fantastic. Lou's lads, it's called, support it. And I was thinking about all the controversy swirling around the NFL and the anthem. It's nice to see images like this one I snapped pre-game of the Michigan team. We know the Notre Dame team prays before and after the game, a legendary prayer in the locker room and beyond, but this was nice to see from Michigan as well. And they played a great game, and it was a great privilege to be there. Up next, of course, Shannon Bream and the 'Fox News @ Night' team did all the great coverage today for the network on the Kavanaugh hearings."
