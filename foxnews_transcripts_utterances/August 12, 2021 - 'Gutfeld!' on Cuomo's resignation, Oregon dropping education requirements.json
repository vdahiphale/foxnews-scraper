Yes, the worst state in history. You're welcome, New Jersey. Has decided to drop the requirement that students demonstrate that they've mastered those skills. Crap, I said mastered. That's racist too. According to activists Ben Crump, the phrase master as in master bedroom is racist. I can only wonder what he thinks of my sheets. You know, there's another joke I can make involving master. But why bait the audience? So, being heckled, I am being heckled. All right, shut up. This is a serious topic. So for the next five years, Oregon students will get a diploma without the necessary skill base, making that road paper as meaningful as a pink belt in karate. That is whaling currency is more valuable. You get more respect if you showed up at a job interview with a teardrop tattoo from Rikers or in Joe DeVito's case, when he applied for this job with a Curious George book in a mesh t shirt.",

There was no signing ceremony probably because again, writing is racist. The state legislature had publicized other passed laws but not this one. They hit it like a cold sore on prom night. I remember that. It's weird. Progressives have happily trumpeted a lot of crazy (BLEEP) they're even still bragging about defunding the police. But maybe here they actually feel some shame about this particular travesty. The governor won't talk about it. Why should she? That's like asking Andrew Cuomo, how he feels about misogyny in the workplace. So is this new bill racist? Well, according to one of the government lackeys, they dropped the requirements in order to benefit Oregon's black Latino, Latina, Latin X, Indigenous Asian, Pacific Islander tribal, and students of color. Effectively turning their degrees into a participation trophy. So to answer your question, hell yes, that's racist. You couldn't do worse if you named the bill minorities are stupid. Because now expecting them to learn is viewed as oppression rather than providing knowledge and opportunity. Apparently, in the progressive mindset, minorities aren't up to the task, which sounds kind of racist as opposed to the education for the assume these groups are hopeless. But tell that to Sergey Brin or Elon Musk or any other immigrant who came here and hit it big. I wonder what the angry black male thinks.",

No wonder the left hates school choice so much because parents would choose schools that expect kids to learn math. If you think it's too hard for Latin, Latino and Latin X to do sophomore level math. Well, first, congrats on using the most well classifications, but you're still a racist, you jackass. Hell, even Tony Montana had to learn the metric system. Something as white Americans quit on. Fact is every arena in life where standards are being dropped is racism. It's the ultimate condescension. We make the rules so only idiots can follow them. But they -- maybe they don't know they're being racist because they're too busy calling everybody else and everything racist. Maybe we start pointing out to them with the same tenacity they use to point us out. It's boring and it's repetitive but someone has to do it. And it sure beats doing math, racist.",

According to Chris Rufo, writing for The New York Post, American Express recently hosted a critical race theory training program. As part of an anti-racism initiative started by Amex execs last year in the wake of the George Floyd protests. Which raises a key question, how many things instituted by terrified corporate virtue signalers in the wake of the George Floyd protest ended up being unmitigated disasters? Probably a lot. Other elements of the program reportedly include teaching white employees how to identify their privilege, while likely ignoring that you're specifically marginalized for being white. Rufo says that guest lecturer Khalil Muhammad argued that profits must be sacrificed to advance racial justice. I bet Amex really loved that part. But it's only because of capitalism that American Express is able to employ over 60,000 people. But if it were up to the woke, they would all be broke. But I guess this training program isn't as bad as last year's Amex seminar, office parkour.",

Yes, the worst state in history. You're welcome, New Jersey. Has decided to drop the requirement that students demonstrate that they've mastered those skills. Crap, I said mastered. That's racist too. According to activists Ben Crump, the phrase master as in master bedroom is racist. I can only wonder what he thinks of my sheets. You know, there's another joke I can make involving master. But why bait the audience? So, being heckled, I am being heckled. All right, shut up. This is a serious topic. So for the next five years, Oregon students will get a diploma without the necessary skill base, making that road paper as meaningful as a pink belt in karate. That is whaling currency is more valuable. You get more respect if you showed up at a job interview with a teardrop tattoo from Rikers or in Joe DeVito's case, when he applied for this job with a Curious George book in a mesh t shirt."

There was no signing ceremony probably because again, writing is racist. The state legislature had publicized other passed laws but not this one. They hit it like a cold sore on prom night. I remember that. It's weird. Progressives have happily trumpeted a lot of crazy (BLEEP) they're even still bragging about defunding the police. But maybe here they actually feel some shame about this particular travesty. The governor won't talk about it. Why should she? That's like asking Andrew Cuomo, how he feels about misogyny in the workplace. So is this new bill racist? Well, according to one of the government lackeys, they dropped the requirements in order to benefit Oregon's black Latino, Latina, Latin X, Indigenous Asian, Pacific Islander tribal, and students of color. Effectively turning their degrees into a participation trophy. So to answer your question, hell yes, that's racist. You couldn't do worse if you named the bill minorities are stupid. Because now expecting them to learn is viewed as oppression rather than providing knowledge and opportunity. Apparently, in the progressive mindset, minorities aren't up to the task, which sounds kind of racist as opposed to the education for the assume these groups are hopeless. But tell that to Sergey Brin or Elon Musk or any other immigrant who came here and hit it big. I wonder what the angry black male thinks."

No wonder the left hates school choice so much because parents would choose schools that expect kids to learn math. If you think it's too hard for Latin, Latino and Latin X to do sophomore level math. Well, first, congrats on using the most well classifications, but you're still a racist, you jackass. Hell, even Tony Montana had to learn the metric system. Something as white Americans quit on. Fact is every arena in life where standards are being dropped is racism. It's the ultimate condescension. We make the rules so only idiots can follow them. But they -- maybe they don't know they're being racist because they're too busy calling everybody else and everything racist. Maybe we start pointing out to them with the same tenacity they use to point us out. It's boring and it's repetitive but someone has to do it. And it sure beats doing math, racist."

As part of an anti-racism initiative started by Amex execs last year in the wake of the George Floyd protests. Which raises a key question, how many things instituted by terrified corporate virtue signalers in the wake of the George Floyd protest ended up being unmitigated disasters? Probably a lot. Other elements of the program reportedly include teaching white employees how to identify their privilege, while likely ignoring that you're specifically marginalized for being white. Rufo says that guest lecturer Khalil Muhammad argued that profits must be sacrificed to advance racial justice. I bet Amex really loved that part. But it's only because of capitalism that American Express is able to employ over 60,000 people. But if it were up to the woke, they would all be broke. But I guess this training program isn't as bad as last year's Amex seminar, office parkour."
