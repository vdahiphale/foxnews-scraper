It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” This is a Fox News alert. Millions of Americans are under evacuation orders from Florida to the Carolinas as Hurricane Dorian threatens the east coast. The outer bands of the massive category 2 storm lashing the coast of Florida. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This as we are getting a first look at the devastation Dorian left in the Bahamas. The images are shocking. There are at least five deaths after the slow moving storm pummeled the islands for nearly two days. And in the days ahead, I'm sure we're going to see more of that event and we will bring that to you, of course. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But right now we have live team coverage on the life threatening storm's path and strength. Bill Hemmer is in Atlantic Beach, Florida; Rick Leventhal in Jacksonville. But let's begin with chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth in the Fox weather center who has the latest. Rick, the National Hurricane Center just issued an update. What's the latest? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, CHIEF METEOROLOGIST",
      "sentences": "Yes. So the latest is it -- we're actually watching the forecast kind of behave exactly as we think it will from now on out, so overall things are looking good. I will tell you, take a look at this. We are about one week away from the peak of hurricane season. We've got five different systems out in the Atlantic that we're watching. The only one at this point that, obviously, we're concerned about is Dorian. And I'll tell you, we've been talking for days that we couldn't tell exactly where the storm was going to stall and take this right-hand turn. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's amazing where we are with science now that we could have about 100 miles off the shore of Florida a cat 5 storm and not have hurricane warnings in Miami because we knew this storm would take this turn once we got to that kind of a forecast. But the images coming out of the Bahamas, I think if we can share some more of this, it takes a while to get in there after a storm goes through like this, but they're still getting impacts from the storm. The storm still bringing a lot of rain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But look at this aerial video coming out, I believe this is from the Abaco Islands, marsh harbor, right around that area, the damage is extensive. You can still see places flooded. The storm surge comes in, doesn't go out right away. They probably got about 30 inches of rain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And when this came on land right here, this had a 185 mile-an-hour winds. That's the second strongest storm we've ever seen in the Atlantic, and it hit the northwestern Bahamas as that cat 5, and then stayed there for the better part of 24 to 36 hours. So, these images coming in, obviously, people can't get out and do any of the rescue and recovery very easily. It's hard to get into that space. Very fearful for what we're going to see of more images and what the potential for injury and the death toll in that area, and then how do they recover? It's hard to imagine. My point to all of this is the Bahamas took the worst of it. Had that turn or that stall happened about 100 miles further, it would have happened somewhere across areas of South Florida, which would have been so damaging here. They had a cat 5 just last year, hitting the panhandle of Florida. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so, for the most part Florida spared. This is what the future radar kind of a representation of what the models think the radar will look like in time, and by tomorrow morning somewhere around Cape Canaveral, Daytona Beach. By Thursday morning, right around Charleston, South Carolina, probably getting hurricane force winds. And then at this point, most of our guidance brings us center of it just going pretty much up and down the entire North Carolina coast line which will cause a lot of damage for them. A much weakened storm, a category 1, category 2 storm, not that category 5, 185 mile-an-hour storm that hit the Bahamas, but this storm, nonetheless, if you're here in this area, you've seen a lot of storms including Florence last year that brought record breaking flooding to North Carolina. You have another storm that you have to deal with here throughout Thursday and Friday.

It doesn't quite feel that way. But they'll pick up throughout the evening hours. But just to contribute to the excellent reporting of Rick and Rick just there, I think in addition to the lessening of the strengthening of the storm itself, it's a big part of the story. The other big part of the story is the movement of the storm. We've been waiting for days to try and get Dorian to move out of the Bahamas. Well, today she finally did. We were out here at 7 AM this morning. National Hurricane Center at 8 AM said it was moving at 1 mile-an-hour. By 11 AM, it was moving at 2 miles-an-hour. By 2 o'clock this afternoon they bumped that up to 5 miles-an-hour. Just moments ago we shared the forecast it's at 6 miles-an-hour. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this is an enormous storm moving at 6 miles-an-hour is exceedingly slow. But to think that it was stationary over the Bahamas for 18-plus hours is just mind-blowing to think that anyone could survive that or withstand the power of mother nature just for a day pounding that area. It's -- if you were to think about that storm shifting 100 miles to the west, what would we be experiencing here on the east coast of Florida? It's just really thoughts with the people of the Bahamas trying to recover out there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, for the moment, the fact that the storm is moving out, I think, A, it gives the folks in the Bahamas some relief. And, B, it gives the forecasters and the millions of people along the southeastern part of the U.S. an idea about what to expect. Because, frankly, Dana, this has been a guessing game. And it's been a guessing game for about a week.",

So, when Debra Messing calls for the list of Trump supporters to be released, she's not doing it for the good of the country for some good cause, she's doing it so that these people in Hollywood can't work again. There is an underground movement in Hollywood, it's been there for 30 years about conservatives who work in Hollywood, who stay quiet, do their jobs. They can't come out publicly and talk about politics even though you see it in award shows and the Left is allowed to talk about it whenever they want and shove it down your throat. But when it comes to having a different point of view, Hollywood actresses like Debra Messing and people who have a lot more credibility and power than she does in Hollywood think that you should believe in Leftism, that you have a monolithic thought process and if you don't, we're going to harass, we're going to print your phone number and your address, your family will be harassed and you will never work a day again. That's why she's doing it and it's disgraceful. So, Whoopi Goldberg stood up for them, good on her, but releasing lists of names usually goes one way, it's the Left calling for it to be released on the right.

I'm sure he's frustrated with the media. I thought the bigger problem for the Biden campaign was the big piece in The New York Times yesterday by - Sunday by Mark Leibovich and asking him what is your rationale to be president. And really, it's not sharp. It's not there. It's basically like well somebody has got to beat Trump and I think that African-American voters who love him are going to stick with him. That is going to be something that is going to be solid. That's not going to end. And you can imagine that the Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren supporters are like, what are we going to do. Elizabeth Warren is polling at 1 percent with African-American voters, so there is a big reckoning to come. I don't think it will come for a few months.

      "utterance": "Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Katie Pavlich, Geraldo Rivera, Jesse Watters, and Brian Kilmeade. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” This is a Fox News alert. Millions of Americans are under evacuation orders from Florida to the Carolinas as Hurricane Dorian threatens the east coast. The outer bands of the massive category 2 storm lashing the coast of Florida. This as we are getting a first look at the devastation Dorian left in the Bahamas. The images are shocking. There are at least five deaths after the slow moving storm pummeled the islands for nearly two days. And in the days ahead, I'm sure we're going to see more of that event and we will bring that to you, of course. But right now we have live team coverage on the life threatening storm's path and strength. Bill Hemmer is in Atlantic Beach, Florida; Rick Leventhal in Jacksonville. But let's begin with chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth in the Fox weather center who has the latest. Rick, the National Hurricane Center just issued an update. What's the latest?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, CHIEF METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes. So the latest is it -- we're actually watching the forecast kind of behave exactly as we think it will from now on out, so overall things are looking good. I will tell you, take a look at this. We are about one week away from the peak of hurricane season. We've got five different systems out in the Atlantic that we're watching. The only one at this point that, obviously, we're concerned about is Dorian. And I'll tell you, we've been talking for days that we couldn't tell exactly where the storm was going to stall and take this right-hand turn. It's amazing where we are with science now that we could have about 100 miles off the shore of Florida a cat 5 storm and not have hurricane warnings in Miami because we knew this storm would take this turn once we got to that kind of a forecast. But the images coming out of the Bahamas, I think if we can share some more of this, it takes a while to get in there after a storm goes through like this, but they're still getting impacts from the storm. The storm still bringing a lot of rain. But look at this aerial video coming out, I believe this is from the Abaco Islands, marsh harbor, right around that area, the damage is extensive. You can still see places flooded. The storm surge comes in, doesn't go out right away. They probably got about 30 inches of rain. And when this came on land right here, this had a 185 mile-an-hour winds. That's the second strongest storm we've ever seen in the Atlantic, and it hit the northwestern Bahamas as that cat 5, and then stayed there for the better part of 24 to 36 hours. So, these images coming in, obviously, people can't get out and do any of the rescue and recovery very easily. It's hard to get into that space. Very fearful for what we're going to see of more images and what the potential for injury and the death toll in that area, and then how do they recover? It's hard to imagine. My point to all of this is the Bahamas took the worst of it. Had that turn or that stall happened about 100 miles further, it would have happened somewhere across areas of South Florida, which would have been so damaging here. They had a cat 5 just last year, hitting the panhandle of Florida. And so, for the most part Florida spared. This is what the future radar kind of a representation of what the models think the radar will look like in time, and by tomorrow morning somewhere around Cape Canaveral, Daytona Beach. By Thursday morning, right around Charleston, South Carolina, probably getting hurricane force winds. And then at this point, most of our guidance brings us center of it just going pretty much up and down the entire North Carolina coast line which will cause a lot of damage for them. A much weakened storm, a category 1, category 2 storm, not that category 5, 185 mile-an-hour storm that hit the Bahamas, but this storm, nonetheless, if you're here in this area, you've seen a lot of storms including Florence last year that brought record breaking flooding to North Carolina. You have another storm that you have to deal with here throughout Thursday and Friday. Dana?"

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "All right, Rick, thank you so much. We have another Rick to go to. Rick Leventhal is in Neptune Beach, Florida. Rick, what are you seeing there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICK LEVENTHAL, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, we've just been told by Volusia County officials to expect tropical storm force wind gusts starting sometime tonight, and we could be feeling those tropical storm force gusts over the next 24 hours. The beach patrol and others have tried to protect the downtown here and the homes and businesses by building up the berms here along the beach. This was a cut where you could walk right out to the ocean, but now they've pushed all this sand up, hoping to protect against the storm surge which has been predicted to be 3 to 5 feet, potentially, sometime over the next day or so. That's on top of a 2-foot higher than normal tide. You can see the dual red flags flying, that means the water is simply not safe. They've pulled all the lifeguard stands off. But as you head down here into Atlantic Beach and Neptune Beach, all of -- a lot of the businesses have already closed and many of them will be closing soon because there's a curfew that goes into effect in Volusia County for any area east of the river starting at 6 o'clock tonight. So if we just -- Doug could zoom in over there and show some of the businesses that have already boarded up, Dana, and guys, I mean, the town has shut down for the most part. We do see some people out here, but a lot of folks are -- there's nowhere really for them to go because most of the businesses have now closed."

      "utterance": "Hey, Rick, as you've been on the ground there talking to locals, how do they feel being prepared and what are they doing in terms of making sure that they get out if this storm were to hit where they are?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, Floridians are used to this drill. They've been through it far too many times. And they keep a close eye on the forecast and the track of the storm. And, obviously, they're very grateful that it is now tracking further to the east away from the coast. They know if this thing was coming right at them, I guarantee you, a lot more people would have gotten out. But a lot of people, I think, stayed put because they knew that the winds and the rain and the surge would not be as bad as first had been feared. That said, the folks who are staying behind, you know, if the winds top 39 miles-an-hour, they're going to shut down the causeways and the bridges, so the folks who decide to ride it out know that they're going to be stuck here riding it out until the winds die back down again and services can be restored."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "All right, Rick Leventhal, thank you. Now let's go to Bill Hemmer, he's on the ground in Atlantic Beach, Florida. Bill, OK, you've got to tell us what it's like there. We're getting a full picture right here on THE FIVE."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL HEMMER, HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Dana, good afternoon to you. Nice to see you again and earlier today on the 2 o'clock hour. Winds from the northeast around, they're saying 25 miles-an-hour. It doesn't quite feel that way. But they'll pick up throughout the evening hours. But just to contribute to the excellent reporting of Rick and Rick just there, I think in addition to the lessening of the strengthening of the storm itself, it's a big part of the story. The other big part of the story is the movement of the storm. We've been waiting for days to try and get Dorian to move out of the Bahamas. Well, today she finally did. We were out here at 7 AM this morning. National Hurricane Center at 8 AM said it was moving at 1 mile-an-hour. By 11 AM, it was moving at 2 miles-an-hour. By 2 o'clock this afternoon they bumped that up to 5 miles-an-hour. Just moments ago we shared the forecast it's at 6 miles-an-hour. Now, this is an enormous storm moving at 6 miles-an-hour is exceedingly slow. But to think that it was stationary over the Bahamas for 18-plus hours is just mind-blowing to think that anyone could survive that or withstand the power of mother nature just for a day pounding that area. It's -- if you were to think about that storm shifting 100 miles to the west, what would we be experiencing here on the east coast of Florida? It's just really thoughts with the people of the Bahamas trying to recover out there. But, for the moment, the fact that the storm is moving out, I think, A, it gives the folks in the Bahamas some relief. And, B, it gives the forecasters and the millions of people along the southeastern part of the U.S. an idea about what to expect. Because, frankly, Dana, this has been a guessing game. And it's been a guessing game for about a week."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And you've been there all day for us. Bill Hemmer, thank you so much. We'll be in touch with you as the night goes on. We're going to take it around the table a little bit. I think, Geraldo, you've covered several hurricanes. But you also, right before the show started, you were concerned about the Abaco Islands."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GERALDO RIVERA, HOST",
      "utterance": "I, as a sailor, in -- Elbow Key and the Abaco many times with my boat. I absolutely am horrified by the notion of the -- what the overnight must have been like in these very low lying islands, Dana. They're only 40 feet high. But I have to say, if this is not a mass casualty event in the Abaco Islands, then I think that Hurricane Dorian will be remembered as a miracle storm, why? Because it was so powerful, cat 5, coming roaring over the win ward islands had a bead on Hispaniola where Haiti and the Dominican Republic is, and then it was going to hit the Mona passage between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, then it was going to hit Puerto Rico again, not yet recovered from Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Irma, then it managed to squeeze between St. Thomas and Puerto Rico, hitting nothing. Going into the Atlantic, then, of course, this -- whatever happened in the Bahamas we'll know tomorrow for sure, but then missing the east coast of the United States. I think that Hurricane Dorian, 2019, for all the hyperbole about the historic nature and the strength of this storm it is a miracle that the casualties are relatively low."

We know this, 13,000 homes are wiped out. The Red Cross tweeted that out. We know 5 people have lost their lives. And we saw some devastating footage. We're also seeing some things of people saying I'm up by my ceiling, me and my grandchildren, please help me out. So, my fingers are crossed but I'm realistic about what will happen because as you know better than anyone it's flat. There's really nowhere to go. I mean, it's not like you've got to get special glass or a special building. You know, you've got to get something that can take -- go underwater almost"

Those have been conflated, if you will, over time. But I will tell you what we expected today is somebody to connect the dots. Someone to give us what happened. The ignition source. The cause of this fire. That didn't happen. The sheriff, instead, said he was going to wait until he completed formal interviews with THE FIVE surviving crew. However, he did say that an explosion did not cause the fire, but once started that fire blocked the escape hatch as well as the main exit to the upper deck -- or rather the leading -- or to the main deck essentially trapping all 34 victims below deck."

Have they done toxicology test on the crew? I want to know, were they drunk? Were they stoned? They were awake. There was a party that night. Were they partying that night? Why just the crew above? What started that fire with the engine not running? How did it start? Why were there no escape hatches available to the people down below deck? I had a 70-footer for 20 years. Each hatch -- each compartment had its own hatch. How could it be one escape route for 30 people sleeping in bunk beds down below deck? This is -- I know the Truth Aquatics. This company has a good recommendation. But I'm telling you, the engine wasn't running -- how that fire start? And only the crew jumped off. Five crew members end up in the water?"

When the dispatchers talking to the crew members and saying can you go back to the boat to help people get out? But it's very clear they left them there without any thought about getting them out before jumping off the boat, right? And the idea that they didn't know where the fire extinguishers are and dispatchers saying you don't have any fire material, any firefighting gear, none of that, indicates maybe there wasn't a proper protocol followed in terms of telling people on board where these things were in the case of a major fire like this.

So, when Debra Messing calls for the list of Trump supporters to be released, she's not doing it for the good of the country for some good cause, she's doing it so that these people in Hollywood can't work again. There is an underground movement in Hollywood, it's been there for 30 years about conservatives who work in Hollywood, who stay quiet, do their jobs. They can't come out publicly and talk about politics even though you see it in award shows and the Left is allowed to talk about it whenever they want and shove it down your throat. But when it comes to having a different point of view, Hollywood actresses like Debra Messing and people who have a lot more credibility and power than she does in Hollywood think that you should believe in Leftism, that you have a monolithic thought process and if you don't, we're going to harass, we're going to print your phone number and your address, your family will be harassed and you will never work a day again. That's why she's doing it and it's disgraceful. So, Whoopi Goldberg stood up for them, good on her, but releasing lists of names usually goes one way, it's the Left calling for it to be released on the right.

So, when you combine the gaffes, the poor decisions, the age and the sleepiness on the trail, it is a very nasty mix of negatives that is going to drag him down.

He's one who has this in the bag, but when it comes down to going against the Trump campaign juggernaut. And Joe Biden clearly not really wanting it considering he's saying that he's you know maybe wouldn't be in it if it wasn't President Trump, his wife having a hard time selling his plan saying you know his plan might not be the best one. He might not be the best candidate, but you should elect him to beat Donald Trump. Is he really going to be able to keep up when it comes to him taking campaign stops off of his schedule right now when he's not even really in a hard battle for the front right now?"

The Jonas Brothers launched a whirlwind reunion tour, all sorts of young ladies here went to this concert last week at Madison Square Garden. 16 year old Lily Jordan. She's a fan of the band, she's battling cancer. She had tickets to see Saturday's concert in Hershey, Pennsylvania, but she couldn't make it because of a round of chemotherapy. In a long shot effort, the lead put out a call into the universe with a post on her Instagram tagging the Jonas Brothers and inviting them to visit her hospital room right by the concert hall. And guess what. It happened. It went all around the Internet. But the Jonas Brothers actually go into the hospital room, so she thought it was pretty cool. Exact quote was crappy chemo session into something incredibly special and unforgettable."
