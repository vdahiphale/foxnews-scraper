Now check out this idiocy in The New York Times. Trump's shadow lingers over divided GOP as the former president puts around Mar-a-Lago, the vast majority of his party has stayed faithful to his lingering political legacy.

And this was despite the fact that Lincoln Project members appeared at least 21 times on those networks. Now, as for the money grubbers that the Lincoln Project itself, they didn't forthrightly address the predatory behavior of its co-founder until the Times coverage made it impossible for them to avoid. But it's time for America to hold these people accountable for their misrepresentation and relentless defamation. The only reason the Lincoln Project was able to raise $87 million in the first place was because of the glowing coverage and the endless platforms it received in the press. It didn't have any following in the Republican Party, which regularly gave Trump an approval rating in the 90s, anyone with a brain understood that the Lincoln Project operated as merely another arm of the Democrat Party, another weapon in the war to defeat Trump. There's nothing Republican or conservative about them. You see, the perversion though, didn't end with John Weaver.

It never was. It's a recipe for a shrinking Republican Party and an evisceration of the middle class. Donald Trump proved that the only way to grow the GOP is to turn it into a party for the every man and every woman. And if not for the pandemic, he'd be kicking off his second term, I'm sure of it, but never Trump Republicans like Cheney and Romney and the pro-war Adam Kinzinger mistakenly believe that impeaching Trump means impeaching Trump's policies and advancing their own careers. But as usual, they get it wrong. Primary challenges of congressional never Trumpers are growing by the day. But these people are so desperate for relevance in a post-Bush world, they don't have the situational awareness to see when they're being used and exploited by the press.

Now check out this idiocy in The New York Times. Trump's shadow lingers over divided GOP as the former president puts around Mar-a-Lago, the vast majority of his party has stayed faithful to his lingering political legacy. Lingering legacy, by the way, I still remember when the Times was known for its writing talent, but now they're just too blinded by ideology to even try to understand the 74 million Americans who voted for Trump. Now, to those voters, his political legacy isn't defined by his tweets, but by his conservative populist agenda. They admire the president's courage for taking on the swamp and are faithful to his America first policies that brought us staggering prosperity, peace and rising incomes until the China virus hit. And by the way, they're fine with calling it the China virus, too. They saw Trump as a man who was working for, not against them, and as the only candidate who truly wanted to preserve the America we love.

The true conservative is now accused of making sexual overtures to 21 young men, including a 14-year-old, asking questions about his body while he was still in high school. And then more pointed ones after he turned 18. Now, until the Times report, MSNBC, and CNN, they didn't have the stones or the journalistic integrity to cover this shocking allegation on air. And this was despite the fact that Lincoln Project members appeared at least 21 times on those networks. Now, as for the money grubbers that the Lincoln Project itself, they didn't forthrightly address the predatory behavior of its co-founder until the Times coverage made it impossible for them to avoid. But it's time for America to hold these people accountable for their misrepresentation and relentless defamation. The only reason the Lincoln Project was able to raise $87 million in the first place was because of the glowing coverage and the endless platforms it received in the press. It didn't have any following in the Republican Party, which regularly gave Trump an approval rating in the 90s, anyone with a brain understood that the Lincoln Project operated as merely another arm of the Democrat Party, another weapon in the war to defeat Trump. There's nothing Republican or conservative about them. You see, the perversion though, didn't end with John Weaver. The entire marketing used to raise money for the Lincoln Project, consisted of false advertising, a fraudulent framework. It was all the fruit of a poisonous tree and everything that flowed from it as well. Now, sexual perversion was the most salacious aspect of the saga, but the ideological perversion was also disgusting. Every corporation that aided and abetted The Lincoln Project's activities and helped fund its fat salaries is complicit. How much did Weaver himself make while he was trolling young men? Appalling. The media running the exact same scam right now, elevating never Trump Republicans as they did with The Lincoln Project.

The journalistic Left and the Democrats, they serve absolutely love a complicit opposition, meaning Republicans who fight other Republicans harder than they fight liberals. Now, the last anti-populist Republican who won national office was George W. Bush, and that was more than 16 years ago. Since then, the party has moved inexorably and smartly to become a grassroots blue collar pro-America first movement. It's likely that we're never going to see a Bush Republican in the White House again, not anytime soon, at least. We've seen the folly of our previous interventionist ways of allowing China to commit unchecked trade abuses. We've seen the folly of sanctuary cities and lax border enforcement of policies that encourage the offshoring of millions of U.S. jobs. None of that is conservative. It never was. It's a recipe for a shrinking Republican Party and an evisceration of the middle class. Donald Trump proved that the only way to grow the GOP is to turn it into a party for the every man and every woman. And if not for the pandemic, he'd be kicking off his second term, I'm sure of it, but never Trump Republicans like Cheney and Romney and the pro-war Adam Kinzinger mistakenly believe that impeaching Trump means impeaching Trump's policies and advancing their own careers. But as usual, they get it wrong. Primary challenges of congressional never Trumpers are growing by the day. But these people are so desperate for relevance in a post-Bush world, they don't have the situational awareness to see when they're being used and exploited by the press. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is the aforementioned journalist, Ryan Girdusky who spoke with us on this show nearly three weeks ago about John Weaver and The Lincoln Project.

I was working with another writer on this project for months, trying to get young men to go on the record. During that time frame, I got calls from several friends, very plugged into the Washington, D.C. Circuit that several members in Lincoln Project had heard I was asking questions about John Weaver, were very involved in trying to see where I was on the investigation. Molly Jong-Fast who was an adviser to The Lincoln Project, called several people asking questions about my project. Several days after that, when John Weaver had his heart attack, one young man publicly expressed that he spoke to at least three members of The Lincoln Project, including Mike Madrid, one of the co-founding members, saying that he was being sexually targeted by John Weaver. And recently, I heard that a writer who I cannot mention his name, but he is a very, very well-known conservative writer who does not like Donald Trump and publicly does not like Donald Trump, but is a household name, was asked to join The Lincoln Project, and he said, I can't because of John Weaver's operation (ph).

Obviously, George Connolly was not involved in the text messages and DMs to young men as young as 14 years old that John Weaver was committing. However, The Lincoln Project was used for two purposes, a grift to make money and as a predatory grooming organization for John Weaver to get young men into bed. I mean, what you've seen in the media is nothing compared to what the messages I have are. And I'm not out to embarrass somebody, but they are descriptive. They are disgusting. And he was - and people are saying the 21 men in The New York Times, I had 30 young men. Another writer had over 50. It's probably over 100 young men in a five-year period. This wasn't like he was doing it to one person, two person. Bill Cosby would blush at the actions of John Weaver. And it's not - it was the biggest open secret in Washington, D.C.

Billionaire donors like Wal-Mart heiress Christy Walton, Steven Mandel, big hedge fund funder, Big Oil, Gordon Getty, David Geffen, Sequoia partner capital, Michael Moritz, Jonathan Nelson from Providence Equity Partners. These are big money people. Are they going to demand their money back? Are they going to - are they going to demand the salary of John Weaver back?"

    {
      "speaker": "GIRDUSKY",

Remember, it was three weeks ago that I was on your show and you were - had me on almost the day after that, I wrote the first story. They ran cover from Axios story that was a puff piece, basically saying John Weaver said, I'm gay and I've struggled with it. Giving the Kevin Spacey excuse, and it was deemed acceptable because John Weaver, who hates the president, was sitting there and doing it. Most gay men aren't predators, it's not acceptable. This was a deliberate attempt to sit there and cover for somebody because they hated the right person and had the right politics.

Social media, Hollywood, professional sports, K through 12, universities, I could go on is progressive, but not just progressive. It's intolerantly progressive. And these people join that movement.

And the disturbing part is it's happening at the same time as you have legislation before Congress to make this a domestic war on terror, so that you - what does that mean exactly? That you can now surveil any American citizen who participated in the January 6th event? Does this mean that anyone who supported Trump is fair game? Is that what you're talking about?

That's where the people are. That's where 51 percent of the people are. And you're absolutely right.

Their biggest goal is getting drunk, half the time. And these people identify who they are. They don't have to hide their identity. They don't all wear the same, i.e., the black bloc of ANTIFA, so that they're harder to recognize. They don't scrub their metadata and instruct people who want to cover them that they're only allowed to film the police and they're not allowed to film their actions, and so on. So, what you have here then is on the one side, you have this complete and utter nonsense where they deny the existence of ANTIFA, ANTIFA had said it was a myth and now they're saying, we were distracted by this when this was the real threat. But look who's behind that. The Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti- Defamation League, the ACLU, the Brookings Institute, ISD Global at the UN.

The Trump administration turned the tide, we said enough, to protect American jobs. President Trump said we're not going to have the Chinese dumping product here. So, we put tariffs on them. All the things that recognize the threat from the Chinese Communist Party, right, where they were spying in our facility in Houston, we closed it. We took real actions. And I hope this administration will do the same thing. The track record from the eight years prior to that is not good. It was an appeasement strategy. And when I hear people talk about places we can cooperate, I dealt with these folks. I dealt with the senior leadership.

This is the Wuhan virus. It started there. It may have commenced from a laboratory there. We don't know for sure. We need that investigation to figure out exactly where it began. But we know this. We know that the Chinese Communist Party disappeared journalists. We know that they took doctors and professionals who wanted to tell the story about human to human transmission early on when something could have been done that would have saved countless lives and billions of dollars of wealth and lots of jobs for the American people as well. We know that the Chinese Communist Party covered that up. They wouldn't permit that information to get out.
