We will not go back to discrimination, segregation, sexism, isolationism, racism with the KKK. Like NY's motto says, Excelsior, ever upward, (not backward).\" Mike, this was not the best rhetorical effort by the governor."

      "utterance": "No, of course not. This is going to go down I think along with the basket of deplorables of memorable quotes that public officials had wished they hadn't said. Up on Axios, right now we have a trailer from a film that Steve Bannon has coming September 9th as part of a new group that he is starting to get Republicans to turn out in midterms. September 9th, maybe it wasn't on your calendar. It is on Steve Bannon's calendar. The second anniversary of the basket of deplorables, quote, using it again to juice Trump voters. That's exactly what this does. You don't want to be on the side of arguing about whether or not America is great. That just isn't how Americans think, especially in upstate New York and in the middle of the country."

We saw it with Michelle Obama saying the first time she was proud of her country was when Obama was winning that primary. And we've seen this a lot in the last few days. We saw Cynthia Nixon say ICE is a terrorist organization."

      "utterance": "We had Elizabeth Warren say the justice system is racist from front to back, got in a little bit of trouble. So I think Democrats have to be careful because, to Mike's point, I don't think it's not a widely held view, not a popular sentiment in the country. I think Democrats can really get themselves in trouble if they continue to do this. It does energize a certain slice of their base but not the rest of the country."
