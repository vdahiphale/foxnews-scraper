And it's time now for our Sunday group. Jason Riley of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and The Manhattan Institute, poster Kristen Soltis Anderson, and Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service. Kristen, let's talk about what Kamala Harris brings to this Democratic ticket. Before she dropped out in December, and that was before any of the primaries, a national poll had support for Harris among all Democrats -- as you can see there -- at 3 percent, support among women at 4 percent, and support among blacks at 5 percent. So why does the Biden campaign -- why should we all think that she is going to appeal to and win the support of those voters? KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, ECHELON INSIGHTS, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think the idea is that she represents a safe pick. Now it's a strange time we're living in where a progressive senator from California is the safe pick, but I -- I define safe as being, she does not really lose you or gain you many votes on net. I think in the Democratic coalition, they are primarily motivated by wanting to seek Trump unseated. So as long as someone who is not terribly risky was chosen, they would still be energized. And you are hearing stories of -- in particular the south Asian community being very excited. Remember, Kamala Harris is -- is African-American, but she's also of Indian dissent. And so there are some folks that are very energized. At the same time, if you don't like Kamala Harris, you were probably not voting for Joe Biden to begin with. So that's why I believe she represents a quote/unquote safe pick.",

JASON RILEY, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,\" MANHATTAN INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm not so sure that he runs the risk, Chris. You know, Trump, by this point, is a known quantity, so I don't think he's saying much that voters don't expect him to say that the electorate doesn't expect to hear from -- from the president. But the fact of the matter is, Harris is straight out of progressive central casting. She's got this exotic background and that is what the activists on the left place a lot of store in. This is, you know, racial diversity. It's -- it's the end-all be-all. I -- I -- I agree that she probably doesn't hurt the ticket much, but what she does do is play into one of the president's chief criticisms of Joe Biden, which is that he's not his own man. I don't think she was Biden's first pick. She was the base's pick. I think he would have gone with someone with a more moderate voting record in the Senate.

This is a moment in American history where we've got to put the us versus them in the rearview mirror and come together in common purpose.  New Jersey, by the way, is in many respects the most diverse state in America, so that's a particular badge of honor. And as you put it, it is an unconventional convention to say the least but I think the lineup is overwhelmingly compelling. The theme is overwhelmingly compelling. I think it's going to be a terrific week."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let's talk about the big new issue that has just arisen and you are on the frontlines of it, as we pointed out in the production opener (ph).  On Friday, just 11 weeks before the election, you directed that New Jersey will send ballots to all plus -- 6 million plus voters who are on your rolls (ph) there so they can do mail-in balloting for president.  Does it make sense -- you've never done this before. Does it make sense to change the system this close to the election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so, Chris, we've actually had a pretty deep history with vote by mail and we just had a primary which was a little bit different, only because it was a primary, but we learned a lot from it and we liked what we saw.  Ensuring voter security is completely understandable. I've spoken to the president about it -- and by the way I send our prayers in his direction over the loss of his brother. But we've got enough experience to believe between the option of vote by mail, to drop your ballot in secure boxes that we'll have all around the state, to show up actually on Election Day and hand your ballot over, or, failing all that, to actually vote in person.  It's a hybrid model, actually. We think based on our experience, especially from this primary, the system is going to work for us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, you say you have a history of it, but let's review that history, because you had some problems in your primary last month. Some people got the wrong ballot, some people didn't get ballots at all. You had a different election in Paterson, New Jersey, in May and four people were charged with voter fraud for harvesting ballots. I mean, that doesn't sound like a very good record, sir."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. MURPHY",
      "utterance": "So, Chris, the Paterson experience was a local election in May before the primary. I actually view that differently. I view that as a positive data point.  Some guys tried to screw around with the system, they got caught by law enforcement. They've been indicted. They'll pay a price. So I actually have some optimism from that, that actually people tried to screw with the system and they failed.  The primary in July -- yes, I'm not suggesting you always bat 1,000. You don't do that in in person elections either. There are always some glitches you're dealing with but it was overwhelmingly successful. And again, our hope is to expand democracy and we believe this is the right way to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But to answer some of the questions the president raises, what's the danger -- you know, people move, you send a ballot to me at my house, but I've moved and now somebody else has got my ballot and they want to fill it out. What are the safeguards you have that when you send a ballot out to somebody, that they are going to be the one that sends the ballot back and it's their vote?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Again, folks, including the president, who have concerns about voter security, we all want to make sure that every vote counts, that every person gets to vote once. We've got checks and balances for all of that, Chris.  Again, this is an iterative reality. We're learning from prior experiences. We actually had a high degree of success on that very point you're raising in terms of tracking people down in the July primary we just had. And again, remember, we're giving people the option to deliver their ballot in a secure box or in person. If they've got concerns about the postal service, there are a number of outlets we are giving folks to get their vote counted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I want to pick up on the postal service because they sent a letter out to 46 states, including New Jersey, recently in which they said that with this huge surge in mail-in balloting [ph], there were 33 million votes, absentee and mail-in in 2016. We could be talking double, triple that. That with this huge surge that they can't guarantee that they're going to be able to get all the ballots out and return them in time to be counted.  What do you think of that and what do you think of the president's opposition to the Democratic proposal for $25 billion more for the postal service?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I support unequivocally more money for the postal service, Chris. By the way, we extended, in the primary, we'll do it again, the number of days after the Election Day where your mail-in ballot can be counted for the very reason that you've raised in terms of the volume.  This is -- the last thing we should be doing is politicizing the postal service. It's not as though it exists just for vote by mail. Think about the seniors who rely on it for medicines. Our veterans, our small businesses, thecommerce associated with the backbone of this country. We need to fund the Postal Service. We need to root for its success as opposed to the opposite."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Do you think that the president and his postmaster general, who is a big Trump fundraiser, contributor, do think they are playing politics with the Postal Service?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "I can't say. I have not dealt with the postmaster general. I have dealt regularly with the chief operating officer of the Post Office, and will continue to, by the way. We were very tough and strong on them during the primary. And I can assure you that we will be doing the same during the general to make sure their performance is what needs to be. And also that, again, back to Congress, we need to fund them properly and I strongly support that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let's turn to the other big news this week, Joe Biden's new running mate, Kamala Harris and her voting record in the Senate. Harris was the first senator to cosponsor Medicare for All before walking that back and including private insurance. She supports the Green New Deal. She wants to ban fracking. And last year, an independent group ranked her as the most liberal member of the U.S. Senate.  Question, sir. Is Kamala Harris too far to the left for swing voters?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Now, Chris, listen, I think she is a fantastic choice both in her personal history from an immigrant family, a woman, a woman of color, her professional experience as attorney general, as a prosecutor, as a U.S. Senator, how she complements the -- how she complements Vice President Biden. I think when you look at that ticket and you look at this party in this moment in time in our country, I don't think we could ask for a better running mate for Vice President Biden."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "What do you think of the president's continuing refusal to dismiss the claim that she is not eligible to run and serve as vice president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not true and I hope and pray that the president moves off of that and gets to the substantive stuff. You put up a bunch of things that I suspect that the president is not going to agree with. Let's hope for a debate based on substance, a campaign based on substance, on the issues. This is one of the most extraordinary moments in our nation's history. We owe it to our citizens, we owe it to members of both parties to focus on the facts, on the vision, on where we are going to go as a country. And I hope we get to that sooner than later."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let's talk about the campaign. Let's talk about Joe Biden. As I mentioned, President Trump is going to be campaigning around the country in key swing states this week while Joe Biden remains in Delaware where he has been -- either Delaware or a few miles away in Pennsylvania throughout this campaign since the public health crisis started.  I understand we are in the middle of a pandemic, but would you like to see Joe Biden get out more, to campaign more, to travel to more states? And would you like to see him submit, participate in more interviews like you are doing right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Listen, I can't speak for the vice president, but I think he has done this exactly as one would hope. We are in the midst of a pandemic. New Jersey has paid an extraordinary price with over 14,000 lost lives. It's a lot better than it was a few months ago, but, boy, we are not out of the woods yet.  So balancing public health with the sacred right of voting, as we've discussed, with democracy, I'm sure the vice president will be, between now and Election Day, after his eyeballs in interviews and debates. I'm sure he'll get out there. But we've got to get that balance to it. We've got to get that balance right.  That's a message I think that's being sent to America by the vice president, that this is a moment in time unlike any other. And balancing public health with democracy is something that we have to get right. And I believe he has gotten it right so far, and I'm sure he'll continue to."
    },
    {

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Now you have mandated that in your state people must wear masks if they are outside and can't socially distance, at least six feet apart. Do you think governors, all governors across the country, should issue that kind of mandate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "I do, Chris. I think the science and the data, the facts are unequivocal. It used to be up until in fact a few weeks ago that the science said by doing so you're protecting others, the science now says it works both ways. And I think if we had a national, as we've called for now for many weeks if not months, a national masking policy, I think we could accelerate dramatically driving this virus into the ground.  It has been a big weapon for us in New Jersey. But as a nation we are only as strong as our weakest link. To have a national strategy I think would be a game-changer."

She seems to be an opportunist and to do whatever is most expedient of the moment for political power, but here is the reality of the Kamala Harris of 2020, the candidate right now for vice president of the United States. In the previous segment, you mentioned some of her extreme far left radical views, things like banning fracking, but there are more than things you listed. For example, she believes in decriminalizing crossing our border illegally. Those who would trespass into our country would no longer be sanctioned by rule of law. She is in favor of confiscating the most popular rifle in America, mandatory confiscation. This is -- I know you mentioned the GovTrack data, so it's not just my opinion. That is a data-driven model that says from the year 2019, she was the most liberal member of the United States Senate, even to the left of Bernie Sanders. This -- her nomination in our view completes the complete radical takeover of the 2020 Democratic Party. The Democratic Party today is not your parents or your grandparents' Democratic Party. It does not represent the interest of blue-collar workers in this country and it doesn't represent the interests of people who have traditional values in this country."

There's nothing ambiguous about whether president and the campaign stands on universal vote by mail. We are firmly against it. We believe in absentee voting, we believe in early voting. What we do not believe in is blanketing a city or a state with every single person who is listed on the voter rolls because we know that the voter rolls are not accurate. And again, that's not just my opinion. The data shows us that example in Clark County in Las Vegas, according to a story from \"The Las Vegas Journal Review\", we know that 17 percent of all ballots that were sent out -- these are live ballots, these aren't applications -- 17 percent of them, over 200,000, were returned as undeliverable because we're a mobile society, people move, people die. The voter rolls are not accurate. So, we're against universal vote by mail as a principle. Now, regarding the Postal Service, that is a separate issue. The Postal Service needs systemic reform. It has lost $78 billion since 2007 (ph) --"

In his interview with Maria Bartiromo, I just want to quote what we just heard: if they don't get the money, that means they can't have universal mail-in voting. I understand issues with the Postal Service but he is specifically saying, he's linking money to the Postal Service for universal mail in voting, and that raises -- that raises this question because the Postal Service, because of its money problems has just made a bunch of changes. They have eliminated over time, they have taken hundreds of mail sorting machines out of -- out of operation at a time when you're going to have a new crush of mail from mail-in voting. And it isn't just mail-in voting, Steve, because it is also, as Governor Murphy said, people aren't getting their Social Security checks. People aren't getting their drugs in the mail. But isn't the president at a time when the mail is more important than ever for an election, why not make it easier for people to vote, not harder?"

He also said in his press conference on Friday when questioned about this, he said he would be willing -- he's already offered $10 billion of additional aid to the postal system buried if the Democrats would come to the table and make a deal. He was asked, would he go all the way up to the $25 billion that the Democrats want and he said, yes, if they come back to the table with the tax cuts that the president wants for American workers and the relief he wants for those who are jobless and still looking.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Jason Riley of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and The Manhattan Institute, poster Kristen Soltis Anderson, and Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service. Kristen, let's talk about what Kamala Harris brings to this Democratic ticket. Before she dropped out in December, and that was before any of the primaries, a national poll had support for Harris among all Democrats -- as you can see there -- at 3 percent, support among women at 4 percent, and support among blacks at 5 percent. So why does the Biden campaign -- why should we all think that she is going to appeal to and win the support of those voters? KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, ECHELON INSIGHTS, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think the idea is that she represents a safe pick. Now it's a strange time we're living in where a progressive senator from California is the safe pick, but I -- I define safe as being, she does not really lose you or gain you many votes on net. I think in the Democratic coalition, they are primarily motivated by wanting to seek Trump unseated. So as long as someone who is not terribly risky was chosen, they would still be energized. And you are hearing stories of -- in particular the south Asian community being very excited. Remember, Kamala Harris is -- is African-American, but she's also of Indian dissent. And so there are some folks that are very energized. At the same time, if you don't like Kamala Harris, you were probably not voting for Joe Biden to begin with. So that's why I believe she represents a quote/unquote safe pick."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Jason, since Biden picked Harris as his running mate, President Trump has called her anger, he's call her nasty. And as we have pointed out earlier in the program, he has failed to dismiss the claim that she's ineligible to -- to run for vice president. Does the president run the risk in his attacks on Harris of actually driving some of those voters I was just talking about with Kristen into the Biden-Harris camp? JASON RILEY, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,\" MANHATTAN INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm not so sure that he runs the risk, Chris. You know, Trump, by this point, is a known quantity, so I don't think he's saying much that voters don't expect him to say that the electorate doesn't expect to hear from -- from the president. But the fact of the matter is, Harris is straight out of progressive central casting. She's got this exotic background and that is what the activists on the left place a lot of store in. This is, you know, racial diversity. It's -- it's the end-all be-all. I -- I -- I agree that she probably doesn't hurt the ticket much, but what she does do is play into one of the president's chief criticisms of Joe Biden, which is that he's not his own man. I don't think she was Biden's first pick. She was the base's pick. I think he would have gone with someone with a more moderate voting record in the Senate. So -- so I think in that sense President Trump will be able to make some hay of the pick, that -- that Joe Biden will -- will be, if he becomes president, will be controlled by -- by the left, just as he was in having to choose Harris as his running mate."

And the real issue is -- is -- is the top of the ticket, the vice president, in this case. Doesn't he still have an energy deficit not traveling around the country to campaign -- for instance this week, as we pointed out, the -- the president is going to be going to four different states -- and not submitting himself to interviews and -- and appearances like you have to say the president has?"

I mean, look, the president's been out there campaigning now for months and we've seen a steady decline in his support. He might actually do better to scale back a little bit. Now, look, should Joe Biden be doing more media appearances? I think so. Should he be trying to find more creative ways? I think this week we're going to see that by moving to a virtual convention, though they're going to have more creative content out there. But we're in the middle of a pandemic, which means people are consuming information differently than they did before. Think the old rules are out the window. As long as he and his running mate are out there every day in some capacity making the case that they are different than this president for all the reasons that people do not like this president, then I think you're going to see him continue to do fairly well."

First in the horse race, Biden leads Trump 49 percent to 42. But let's look at the internals. The president's job approval is still under water, 44 percent approve, 54 percent do not. How things are going in the country, you could say right track, wrong track, 33 percent satisfied, 66 percent not satisfied. And what message would you send to the government now? Fifty-seven percent, lend me a hand, 36 percent, leave me alone, which is a flip from just 12 months ago. Kristen, these are not good numbers for any incumbent seeking re-election, are they?"

Within the -- the across tabs of that poll, you see that Trump is still losing senior citizens by nine points, which is remarkable considering that seniors are a group that Trump had previously done pretty well with. They're also a group that's particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. So when you take a look at his job approval, which has fallen as we've gone further and further and it still feels like this virus is not really well under control, that's clearly driving a lot of voters to feel frustrated with the status quo and perhaps making them more open to saying, let's just go for a change."

That's his strongest suit against Joe Biden is the economy that we had going in this country prior to Covid. So he's going to need some -- some outside help there. A lot of his supporters like to dismiss these polls because some of them were off in 2016. And there may be some -- some noise in there with -- with respondents not wanting to tell pollsters that they're Trump supporters because it's so politically incorrect. But -- but I don't think there's seven points worth of noise in there. So I -- I think he has his work cut out, and he knows that, which is why he changed campaign managers last month."

When there are hiccups, the system typically catches it, as we've seen in a couple of the cases that have been in the news lately. So there is a system in place of checks and balances against widespread fraud or any kind of fraud. But if the -- the president and his political appointee continue to go after the Postal Service, taking machines away, taking mailboxes away, and taking funding away, it does leave the risk of a huge mess.

That is not going to fix what is wrong with the Postal Service. It needs top-down reform. But the second point here is that according to the Post Office, they are not going to run out of money until 2021. And the Postal Service says that they have the capacity right now to handle the uptick in -- in -- in a -- mail-in ballots that everyone is anticipating come November. So that -- there -- so, yes, it was wrong for the president to say, I oppose more funding because it will mean that the Post Office won't be able to do universal mail-in voting. That's not -- that's not the issue here. And I'm glad he -- he walked that back. But he is right that the Post Office does need reform.

And as we've seen in places like New York state, have attempted to spin up really fast one of these mail-in voting situations, and all of a sudden you have huge numbers of ballots that get disqualified. If Republicans are overwhelmingly voting in person when they vote, those votes are very likely to count.

      "utterance": "Well, look, it's ain't over until it's over. And I think there's going to be huge pressure on both Democrats and Republicans to get a deal, particularly as the -- the crisis continues. The question, as always, is, what does the deal look like with both sides being very firm and sort of the things that they'll except and the things that they won't accept. And it's going to cause some -- some challenges for people out there. I do think that -- that all the bells and whistles that are -- that -- that -- like some of the -- the tax cuts that Republicans are trying to attach are going to potentially cause challenges for them with voters who are saying, I need help now. I need these direct payments now. I need some of the things now. And what the president's offering compared to what the Democrats are offering I'm not sure is going to -- is going to satisfy what people are looking for. So, you know, it's just creating more of a sense of mess here in Washington that is potentially going to hurt the administration at the ballot box."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Jason, same question. As this -- this stalemate over providing coronavirus relief drags on and really is affecting millions of people who are unemployed or businesses that are right on the edge, who do you think gets most of the blame?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I -- I think Pelosi is sort of playing this like a -- a government shutdown situation where traditionally the -- the administration in -- in power gets blamed by the public. And -- and I think she thinks that she has the upper hand here. And so she's asking for everything, just pulling things off the shelf, a wish list, basically, the demands, some of which have nothing to do with Covid relief at all. But she figures if she doesn't get what she wants, and nothing gets passed, Republicans will get blamed for it. And she's probably looking at the president's poll numbers and -- and thinking, I'll just keep on doing what I'm doing, it's working for us. So I think that on the substantive level, what the Democrats are asking for in terms of relief package could actually show -- slow down the economy or prevent it from getting back up to speed. Again, when you're paying people with these unemployment benefit add-ons not to work or paying them more not to work then employers could pay them to come back on the job, you've got these perverse incentives in place and this economy is never going to get going again so long as those perverse incentives are in place."

The big speeches and funny hats and balloon drops have produced a great show and provided some indelible moments in our politics. And for much of the action, I've been lucky to enjoy a front row seat."

Senator Estes Kefauver beat Kennedy on the third ballot, which many think launched JFK to victory four years later. In 1968, there was drama both in and outside the convention. Police and anti-Vietnam war protesters clashed in the streets of Chicago and the battle raged in the arena."
