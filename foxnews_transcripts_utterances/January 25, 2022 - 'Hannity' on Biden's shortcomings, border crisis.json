      "sentences": "All right. And, Tucker, we'll be watching. Thank you. Welcome to HANNITY. Tonight, we're tracking multiple major stories, including a new alarming development from the ongoing border crisis. Now, the Biden administration, they are dispersing droves of single male illegal aliens all over the U.S. Sara Carter just spoke to a newly retired U.S. Border Patrol commander about the ongoing nightmare at the southern border. We're going to play this exclusive tape, obviously, in shadow so he can keep his pension. Plus, we'll detail the explosive allegations surrounding the Biden family's very lucrative ties to the highest levels of Chinese intelligence. Peter Schweizer will join us with more from his brand new investigative reporting and book. Let's put it this way, the communist Chinese party pretty much owns the entire Biden family syndicate. And also tonight, we'll ask Geraldo, along with Dan Bongino, if Joe Biden is mentally fit to serve as president, and tonight, a little different from last night, we have the real videotape. And then later, get this, the Biden administration is now blocking the state of Florida from accessing those life-saving monoclonal antibodies. I guess the cult of vaccines and vaccine only and one-size-fits-all medicine strikes again. We have a full report tonight that you don't want to miss because it's dangerous. But first, it was a big day for Joe Biden. Don't take my word for it. Just listen to the always honest and ever forthcoming White House propagandist Jen Psaki circling back.",

Joe even picked out a brand new mug with Kamala Harris's face on the front. See how wonderful it is. They really don't hate each other at all like the press has been suggesting, even though it's clear the relationship is extremely tense. And, of course, he also took some time to gaze at women's blouses. Very important work for president. And when you look at this, here he is enjoying some much-needed ice cream and Joey even got his favorite flavor chocolate. What inflation. What COVID. What border crisis. What Russia- Ukraine crisis. No doubt for a guy who doesn't often leave the house, it was a really, really big day. He's probably sleeping by now, filled with fun and adventure and yet somehow, Joe still managed to find time to answer this important question. Take a look.",

You're now ongoing catastrophes at home and abroad. Europe is on the cusp of war. Joe Biden is in a clothing boutique looking at a lady's blouse. Anyway, with no other events on his schedule, none. Tonight, I have a message -- whoever's really running the show at the White House, we the American people are not stupid. Now, it is now painfully obvious to everyone, Joe is not fit to serve. U.S. presidents don't just hang out at ice cream parlors and then call it a day at three o'clock in the afternoon. That is not normal. And, of course, by all accounts Joe has never been -- well, to be blunt, the sharpest tool in the shed anyway. Remember, he plagiarized speeches, cheated in law school, still finished near the bottom of his class, lied about that, too. High-level officials in the Obama administration, they even openly mocked Joe for getting pretty much everything wrong. But now, it's serious and much worse.

Now, we're going to ask two doctors this very question. Now, I'm not a medical professional but it appears to me to be very transparent, very obvious, very clear and so many others that Joe Biden is in a steep cognitive decline. It seems to be accelerating to me. We know that he required not one but two potentially degenerative brain surgeries from aneurysms during his time in the U.S. Senate and we can all see that Biden now struggles to find words, these long awkward pauses of his, often confusing names and places and dates. He has these, you know, bouts of sudden anger are very real. Over the past few days, Joe called not one but two Fox News reporters stupid, even one a son of a bitch, even accused another reporter of not knowing how to read. Today, Jen Psaki did her very best to try and clean up that mess without apologizing, of course. Why would they say they're sorry? Not that I care, but take a look.",

And I -- when I spoke to President Trump in the White House last year, in 2020, he brought up the issue of cognitive testing for elderly presidents. And I think that that puts it on the table. And I saw his last physical, President Biden's, and it didn't mention cognitive testing. Now, why would I be concerned? First of all, there have been erratic emotional outbursts. There have been lapses. There have been memory losses. I ran this by one of the top experts in the country on cognition and he said, my eyebrows are raised too. There's also the issue of the surgical repairs of his brain aneurysms that he had in 1988 before all-stars like Dr. Saphier's husband, Dr. Paul Saphier, who does some elegant technique by the way that wasn't available in 1988. They opened the skull in '88, and there's a study that shows a risk of long-term cognitive problems. Atrial fibrillation, he has an irregular heartbeat. Study out of \"Nature Cardiology\" in 19 -- in 2018 shows twice the risk of cognitive problems as a result. So, we have enough reasons to be questioning this, to have eyebrows raised, especially these outbursts. And one more thing, Sean, that wasn't a hot mic moment with Peter Doocy. He was talking into the mic one minute, and the next minute, he's calling him SOB into the same mic. Why would he think the mic was off? It was on a second before.

You know, now, we have breakthrough cases, fully vaccinated, boostered, natural immunity, you're still getting COVID. Now, the FDA removed the emergency use authorization, claiming it doesn't protect against the omicron variant. They provided no clinical data and from what I can find, there is none. Governor Ron DeSantis slammed the decision, rightly so, in a strong statement. There are real world implications to Biden's medical authoritarianism and Americans access to treatment is now subject of the whims of a failing president. The Biden administration now playing petty politics with American lives, denying access to life-saving treatments. Now, we have to give credit to the state of Florida for opening up these centers, especially once breakthrough cases started with the delta variant. We've got to give credit to Regeneron, Eli Lilly, their science, their monoclonal antibodies were phenomenal and save lives. But we do need to warp speed, let's see, oh, tests, Regeneron, Eli Lilly, get them to be able to adapt to the new variants. We need to warp speed the GSK sotrovimab monoclonal antibodies which seem to do a little bit better with omicron or a lot better, doesn't matter. We should be sharing this information, warp speeding all of it. And we still need antivirals. Every doctor I talked to says they're phenomenal. Why aren't they being mass produced? How did we run out of tests? How -- why are we taking away the one therapeutic everybody said worked? They shouldn't be shutting down centers. They should be giving everyone what they need when they need it. It's all the dangerous consequence of the cult of that one size fits all medicine. Vaccines, boosters, vaccines, boosters only. Here with reaction is the Florida surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo is with us. Doctor, thank you. First of all, I give you and I give the governor of Florida so much credit. You set up when the delta variant, we learned we had breakthrough cases, fully vaccinated people were still getting COVID, and the next option was therapeutics. The therapeutic that saved lives then for original variant, right from the beginning, the delta variant, was Regeneron and Eli Lilly's version of monoclonals. Now, I understand GSK, sotrovimab, is better for omicron. Why aren't we mass producing all of this so its' readily available for everybody? Wouldn't that be the answer?",

Let's give tonight a broad overview of how involved the Bidens are with China and others. PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR OF \"RED-HANDED\": Well, what's interesting about the Biden story, Sean, you know, we first broke the relationship between the Biden family and the Chinese back in 2018 on your show, and at that time, it seemed like a story about corruption and influence peddling. We basically took the laptop and other information and traced back who in China actually made those deals happen for the Biden family. And what we discovered is that is some $31 million were provided to the Biden family by five individuals in China and those individuals all have ties to the highest levels of Chinese intelligence. So what has been a story about corruption and cronyism increasingly is a story about spying, espionage and national security.",

But in the midst of Hunter Biden striking these deals in China, he does something really shocking. He goes to the U.S. Secret Service and says, I do not want any protection when I travel overseas. So that means he's going to China elsewhere around the world, he clearly does not want certain elements in the federal government to know exactly what he's doing and where he's going.

Tonight, we're tracking multiple major stories, including a new alarming development from the ongoing border crisis. Now, the Biden administration, they are dispersing droves of single male illegal aliens all over the U.S. Sara Carter just spoke to a newly retired U.S. Border Patrol commander about the ongoing nightmare at the southern border. We're going to play this exclusive tape, obviously, in shadow so he can keep his pension. Plus, we'll detail the explosive allegations surrounding the Biden family's very lucrative ties to the highest levels of Chinese intelligence. Peter Schweizer will join us with more from his brand new investigative reporting and book. Let's put it this way, the communist Chinese party pretty much owns the entire Biden family syndicate. And also tonight, we'll ask Geraldo, along with Dan Bongino, if Joe Biden is mentally fit to serve as president, and tonight, a little different from last night, we have the real videotape. And then later, get this, the Biden administration is now blocking the state of Florida from accessing those life-saving monoclonal antibodies. I guess the cult of vaccines and vaccine only and one-size-fits-all medicine strikes again. We have a full report tonight that you don't want to miss because it's dangerous. But first, it was a big day for Joe Biden. Don't take my word for it. Just listen to the always honest and ever forthcoming White House propagandist Jen Psaki circling back."

Joe even picked out a brand new mug with Kamala Harris's face on the front. See how wonderful it is. They really don't hate each other at all like the press has been suggesting, even though it's clear the relationship is extremely tense. And, of course, he also took some time to gaze at women's blouses. Very important work for president. And when you look at this, here he is enjoying some much-needed ice cream and Joey even got his favorite flavor chocolate. What inflation. What COVID. What border crisis. What Russia- Ukraine crisis. No doubt for a guy who doesn't often leave the house, it was a really, really big day.

Tonight, I have a message -- whoever's really running the show at the White House, we the American people are not stupid. Now, it is now painfully obvious to everyone, Joe is not fit to serve. U.S. presidents don't just hang out at ice cream parlors and then call it a day at three o'clock in the afternoon. That is not normal. And, of course, by all accounts Joe has never been -- well, to be blunt, the sharpest tool in the shed anyway. Remember, he plagiarized speeches, cheated in law school, still finished near the bottom of his class, lied about that, too. High-level officials in the Obama administration, they even openly mocked Joe for getting pretty much everything wrong. But now, it's serious and much worse.

Now, we're going to ask two doctors this very question. Now, I'm not a medical professional but it appears to me to be very transparent, very obvious, very clear and so many others that Joe Biden is in a steep cognitive decline. It seems to be accelerating to me. We know that he required not one but two potentially degenerative brain surgeries from aneurysms during his time in the U.S. Senate and we can all see that Biden now struggles to find words, these long awkward pauses of his, often confusing names and places and dates. He has these, you know, bouts of sudden anger are very real. Over the past few days, Joe called not one but two Fox News reporters stupid, even one a son of a bitch, even accused another reporter of not knowing how to read. Today, Jen Psaki did her very best to try and clean up that mess without apologizing, of course. Why would they say they're sorry? Not that I care, but take a look."

Without a doubt, the president of the United States has one of the toughest, most consequential jobs on earth. That's the serious part of this. If a president is publicly exhibiting symptoms that he may be unwell or mentally unfit, that's real cause for the concern. So is Joe Biden exhibiting some symptoms? Joining us now with more are FOX News medical contributors, A-Team, Dr. Marc Siegel and Dr. Nicole Saphier. Look, I would -- I wouldn't wish this. If this was a family member, now, the serious side of this for me, Dr. Siegel, I'm not a doctor. I don't play one with COVID. I'm not going to play one here. I see with my own eyes a dramatic, significant decline cognitively with the president. I tried to show it over the years. He was a very different person. My question is, you -- I know you haven't examined him yourself. What do you see? Are these classic symptoms of somebody that is in such a decline?"

In terms of President Biden, I think it is on the table for us to say and even Chuck Todd said last week that the American public is questioning his competence, right? And I -- when I spoke to President Trump in the White House last year, in 2020, he brought up the issue of cognitive testing for elderly presidents. And I think that that puts it on the table. And I saw his last physical, President Biden's, and it didn't mention cognitive testing. Now, why would I be concerned? First of all, there have been erratic emotional outbursts. There have been lapses. There have been memory losses. I ran this by one of the top experts in the country on cognition and he said, my eyebrows are raised too. There's also the issue of the surgical repairs of his brain aneurysms that he had in 1988 before all-stars like Dr. Saphier's husband, Dr. Paul Saphier, who does some elegant technique by the way that wasn't available in 1988. They opened the skull in '88, and there's a study that shows a risk of long-term cognitive problems. Atrial fibrillation, he has an irregular heartbeat. Study out of \"Nature Cardiology\" in 19 -- in 2018 shows twice the risk of cognitive problems as a result. So, we have enough reasons to be questioning this, to have eyebrows raised, especially these outbursts. And one more thing, Sean, that wasn't a hot mic moment with Peter Doocy. He was talking into the mic one minute, and the next minute, he's calling him SOB into the same mic. Why would he think the mic was off? It was on a second before. So all of this is eyebrow-raising and needs investigation."

But I can tell you that the people who notice these changes are the ones that are closest to them family, friends and those in the public eye, they can tell when there have been subtle changes over time and that can lead to potential cognitive impairment. Anyone over the age of 65 should be routinely screened for some level of cognitive impairment. And while his physicians may not have publicly mentioned it in his recent physical as Dr. Siegel mentioned, you know, they have to be screening for his cognition because there are prevention strategies, treatment strategies and you know it would be great for the American public if they did make that accessible to us to see."

You know, now, we have breakthrough cases, fully vaccinated, boostered, natural immunity, you're still getting COVID. Now, the FDA removed the emergency use authorization, claiming it doesn't protect against the omicron variant. They provided no clinical data and from what I can find, there is none. Governor Ron DeSantis slammed the decision, rightly so, in a strong statement. There are real world implications to Biden's medical authoritarianism and Americans access to treatment is now subject of the whims of a failing president. The Biden administration now playing petty politics with American lives, denying access to life-saving treatments. Now, we have to give credit to the state of Florida for opening up these centers, especially once breakthrough cases started with the delta variant. We've got to give credit to Regeneron, Eli Lilly, their science, their monoclonal antibodies were phenomenal and save lives. But we do need to warp speed, let's see, oh, tests, Regeneron, Eli Lilly, get them to be able to adapt to the new variants. We need to warp speed the GSK sotrovimab monoclonal antibodies which seem to do a little bit better with omicron or a lot better, doesn't matter. We should be sharing this information, warp speeding all of it. And we still need antivirals. Every doctor I talked to says they're phenomenal. Why aren't they being mass produced? How did we run out of tests? How -- why are we taking away the one therapeutic everybody said worked? They shouldn't be shutting down centers. They should be giving everyone what they need when they need it. It's all the dangerous consequence of the cult of that one size fits all medicine. Vaccines, boosters, vaccines, boosters only. Here with reaction is the Florida surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo is with us. Doctor, thank you. First of all, I give you and I give the governor of Florida so much credit. You set up when the delta variant, we learned we had breakthrough cases, fully vaccinated people were still getting COVID, and the next option was therapeutics. The therapeutic that saved lives then for original variant, right from the beginning, the delta variant, was Regeneron and Eli Lilly's version of monoclonals. Now, I understand GSK, sotrovimab, is better for omicron. Why aren't we mass producing all of this so its' readily available for everybody? Wouldn't that be the answer?"

But ultimately, what we care about is whether that same laboratory finding translates to patient findings and we're studying that in Florida. But there's data out there, and the federal leadership hasn't released those data. They haven't analyzed them as far as I know. And that's really want you want to know. You want to know whether it actually -- does it help patients anymore, or helps patients a little bit, or helps patients a little bit more than that.

Let's give tonight a broad overview of how involved the Bidens are with China and others. PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR OF \"RED-HANDED\": Well, what's interesting about the Biden story, Sean, you know, we first broke the relationship between the Biden family and the Chinese back in 2018 on your show, and at that time, it seemed like a story about corruption and influence peddling. We basically took the laptop and other information and traced back who in China actually made those deals happen for the Biden family.

That has not happened in this case and, Sean, what's really stunning about it is you know you have this connection with the vice minister for state security in China, you have this connection with a former head of the ministry of state security in China who runs the entire spy apparatus, you have those relationships. But in the midst of Hunter Biden striking these deals in China, he does something really shocking. He goes to the U.S. Secret Service and says, I do not want any protection when I travel overseas. So that means he's going to China elsewhere around the world, he clearly does not want certain elements in the federal government to know exactly what he's doing and where he's going.

I mean, look, if Chinese ministry for state security is trying to engage in elite capture as they call it with the Bidens, and $31 million has been provided, they would view it as a catastrophic intelligence failure if they did not achieve leverage and compromise on the Biden family. That's what makes this so troubling, and requires investigation because if we don't, the president is going to be basing decisions on his family financial interests and the fact that Beijing has leverage over his family."

It goes into other industries, especially big tech and others about they're getting rich off of China and we ignore all their human rights abuses and everything in between. We'll have a lot more. We're going to do more with Peter. Thank you, Peter, for being with us. More HANNITY right after this."
