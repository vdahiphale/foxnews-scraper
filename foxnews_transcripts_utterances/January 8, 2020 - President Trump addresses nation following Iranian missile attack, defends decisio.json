The headlines were still awful about the president. I think there are certain quarters out there that are never going to approve of anything that he does, even though he said we want to have talks. We want to have peace. This is offering. Let's de-escalate and be done with this.

When Barack Obama was in charge, they push all of our real allies away, cozy up to Iran, and to the Europeans, quite frankly, who have really done nothing to stop the proliferation of Iranian terrorism all around the world.  And the Israelis didn't like the Iran deal since the beginning, because they knew that there was a sunset clause that would eventually lead to the Iranians getting a nuclear weapon, which they proved when they went into Iran and took out all of those files that they found and took out into Israel, which proved that the Iranians had every intention of restarting their nuclear program once that sunshine clause was triggered. So that's a lie for him to say that. The other thing is the Obama administration approached Iran as only with the nuclear issue.

I will be interested to see if there is a change in the numbers after his speech today, his remarks today.  Because last night what we were hearing endlessly is this is World War III.  The president's done everything wrong. He's failed on foreign policy. And this morning when the president came out and gave these remarks and said we want peace. We are de-escalating. This is it. The headlines were still awful about the president. I think there are certain quarters out there that are never going to approve of anything that he does, even though he said we want to have talks. We want to have peace. This is offering. Let's de-escalate and be done with this. He didn't come out as many of his critics predicted, saying we are going to bomb Iran off the face of the Earth. So even when they give him, I think, what's unexpected than what they said they wanted, they don't still seem happy."

Critics say, well, we appreciate the fact that the president seems, right now, to be acting in a restrained manner that doesn't look like things are going in the wrong direction in the case of war. But that he didn't say anything about this so-called imminent attack that he said existed and was the reason for, you know, sending a missile to kill Soleimani."

      "speaker": "BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "I think it's important to take a step back, Juan, and say how did we get here? Basically, the thing that was the breaking point for the president was when he saw the embassy raided. When he got past the perimeter, when they were in rest room (ph), they burned the reception area and they spray painted on the outside among many things this is Soleimani's land. And we know he was calling the shots. I think anybody here argues here or there what is power is. The thing about him he is not a crazy man. He is a tactical terrorist. He knows how to link it together. He knows how to plot and plan. He's had 40 years of experience. But I would say this. To take him out, I think the president and his staff and the Secretary of Defense had the wrong reason. It shouldn't be an imminent attack. It should Benghazi accumulation of attacks, including the one that happened four days ago, and we wouldn't be in this controversy. It allowed his critics to say excuse me, Mr. Pompeo, what exactly did you see? And it's almost off track in my mind."

      "utterance": "Well, look. The president gave the Iranians a choice today. He said we are opening the door to a new deal and new negotiation. We want the Iranian people to have an economy that is beneficial to them. We want the leadership to make the right decisions to be a normal country, to stop using proxy forces to destabilize the region and to carry out terrorist attacks against American troops, allied troops, and also innocent people who live in places like Lebanon and Yemen and Syria. But he was resolved today. And he made it very clear that this is not over with Iran, and that he is taking a comprehensive approach to the issue.  His first line was not about Soleimani or even the attack last night from Iran. It was about the nuclear program. So it's very clear that he is taking this approach as a long-term issue. And he's not done with this.  And of course, the Iranians will continue their proxy attacks until they can come to terms with the idea that they want to move forward. And the sanctions that the president put on them today in addition will hopefully put them in that direction."

You can't get a Blackhawk Down. You might get even one episode of MASH out of it, because he is not about war. He's about shaking the box and creating new beginnings. I want to think -- think about the variables of the last couple of days. We know Iran can hit stuff, but they didn't. They put the miss in missiles on purpose. We got advanced warning, right? We had an ayatollah that told the proxies to layoff. And then he said that last night was proportionate to America killing a general. What is he telling you? They are not so upset about what happened that in fact that maybe the general was an impediment to the things that they wanted to do too. He killed a lot Iranian protestors.

He decided, as the commander- in-chief, to carry out his duty, to protect Americans, so he took out the top leading Iranian terrorist who was in Iraq meeting with other terrorists like Rogmati Mohandas (ph) to plan more attacks. And they are sitting across from the U.S. embassy in Baghdad doing this. And so if Democrats want to argue that he is the one to -- who was provoked, it goes in line with their blame America first policies, matter what it is, but especially when it comes to foreign policy. And the question for people like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders who has a long record of praising people like Che Guevara and Maduro and dictators who've killed a lot people. The question what is your alternative. If you want to be the commander-in- chief, it is your duty to protect Americans from threats. Soleimani was a threat. He's a threat in the future.

When Barack Obama was in charge, they push all of our real allies away, cozy up to Iran, and to the Europeans, quite frankly, who have really done nothing to stop the proliferation of Iranian terrorism all around the world.  And the Israelis didn't like the Iran deal since the beginning, because they knew that there was a sunset clause that would eventually lead to the Iranians getting a nuclear weapon, which they proved when they went into Iran and took out all of those files that they found and took out into Israel, which proved that the Iranians had every intention of restarting their nuclear program once that sunshine clause was triggered. So that's a lie for him to say that. The other thing is the Obama administration approached Iran as only with the nuclear issue. They completely when they're negotiating this left the terrorism ballistic missile issue out of the picture. The Trump administration is doing the opposite. They're doing a whole comprehensive approach and saying, we don't separate the two. We're doing everything."
