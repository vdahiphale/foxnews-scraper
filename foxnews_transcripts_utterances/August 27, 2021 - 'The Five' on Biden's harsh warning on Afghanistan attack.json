      "sentences": "Well, in terms of people getting out the White House is now shifting the goal post on that again. So, a couple of weeks ago they said anybody who wants to get out will be able to get out, which is also a way for them to evade responsibility for when people couldn't get out and were getting stuck at Taliban checkpoints. Getting the documentation ripped up whether it was American citizens getting beaten by the Taliban or it was SIV applicants and people who were already eligible to come here. Now we're hearing that the United States will no longer have a diplomatic process or function on the ground when we leave on August 31st. So, the question now is how are you going to get Americans out of the country if you don't have a military presence, you don't have a diplomatic presence and you are relying on the Taliban to kind of facilitate getting these people out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So that's the first thing. The idea we are even contemplating leaving Americans behind is a new thing to, I think the American ethos. And I think it's absolutely despicable that that's even on the table rather than saying we will not leave until we get every single person out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So that's where they are on that. In terms of the attack that they keep warning about and the response of the president promise not just yesterday but over the course of the last week to retaliate against any kind of attack on American forces or troops. Well, the time for that is now. The time is now to say well, another terrorist attack may happen because they determine the deterrence. So, they could, you know, it's 1.3 a.m. in Kabul. Hopefully there's planning is going on and people may be out right now conducting those retaliatory attacks. But this idea that we're sitting back and saying we're going to allow the Taliban to continue doing security and maybe we'll see another attack rather than acting immediately for a deterrence says quite a lot about where we are in terms of our strength and the position.",

Joe Biden mangled this withdrawal. But he was put into a corner when he got in there. And he should have said at the beginning we could have -- we should -- I'm not going to abide by any dates. I'm going to do everything in my power to ensure and take as long as I need to, to get all the Americans out. But it's worth pointing out that in this 2020 agreement we allowed, we released 5,000 Taliban fighters that American troops put in jail for doing bad things, right? Terrorists by any structure and means of the imagination. We put -- we release them from jail.

Why? Because we have military troops on the ground. And we want to be sure that we don't lose. We've already lost 13 military. I don't want to lose another one because we made a faulty decision. So we got to get everybody we can get out as fast as we can.

What it is, you don't, no interest in going back in, but it's what I call terror, terror control. Every few months, six months, once a year you go in and you spray for bugs. And what I mean by bugs, I mean terrorists. And that's all we have -- that's all we have the best soldiers, the best -- the best operators, we have the best weapons. We got to go in, we got to go in and we're like exterminators. We exterminate the terrorists. We don't -- it's not a forever war. But we can't get into this either-or crap. We're going to lose.",

And also, he needed to deliver a message that the security around the airport was going to be their responsibility and that if they did allow bombers through like the one that we saw attack yesterday that they would be held accountable. So, there have been diplomatic messages sent. There has been constant contact but from Admiral Vasely who is in charge of the operation overseeing the operation at the airport. But in essence, I think what they're going to find, and what we have been hearing is that the Taliban want to set up a government. Now does the Taliban control all of their fighters? Are some of those fighters going to leave the Taliban when they have to become a normal so-called government and they'll then join ISIS-K? What you find in this -- in countries like this where there are these off shoots and various terror groups competing for recruits is that the more extreme ones are not going to want to be in government. So, the U.S. is hoping to use that leverage so they can keep that airport open and still get some of these SIVs and other Americans and Afghan evacuees out after August 31.",

So, in terms of the relationship between the Taliban and ISIS-K, it's very complicated. On the one hand, they are rivals. ISIS-K doesn't think the Taliban are extreme enough. But on the other hand, they certainly would work together with a common goal to embarrassing the Americans and striking Americans. The Taliban have not exactly changed in that sense. Right now, again, the relationship is going to be evolving. I think you're going to see some Taliban members leave the Taliban and join ISIS-K. Certainly, what we learned today and what was so fascinating in the briefing this morning when I asked John Kirby about how many ISIS-K prisoners had been released from Bagram which was a prison that the U.S. basically controlled until they left Bagram Air Base and left it in the hands of the Afghan National Army. But I was surprised by the numbers. He said that there were thousands of ISIS-K in that prison and another prison. That is a huge shot of recruits into ISIS K. And again, we don't talk -- I noticed that the administration is intentionally not mentioning al-Qaeda, because it would be somewhat embarrassing, I think, because President Biden had mentioned that early on, after this operation began that there were very few al-Qaeda left 20 years later after 9/11 in Afghanistan. That's not true based on intelligence reports and U.N. figures that were published in July. But you notice that the State Department Pentagon don't want to talk about al-Qaeda, they want to talk about ISIS K.

My guess is that what happens after the U.S. leaves is that Afghanistan is going to fall into a civil war you already have in the Panjshir Valley, a resistance rising of former Afghan National Army and resistance fighters, you're going to have competition and fighting between ISIS-K and the Taliban.

China is also building up their nuclear arsenal and Russia is still launching cyberattacks on our critical infrastructure which Joe Biden gave him a list -- a list much like we apparently gave a list to the Taliban with all of our interpreters, and Americans were still stranded in the country.

      "utterance": "Well, in terms of people getting out the White House is now shifting the goal post on that again. So, a couple of weeks ago they said anybody who wants to get out will be able to get out, which is also a way for them to evade responsibility for when people couldn't get out and were getting stuck at Taliban checkpoints. Getting the documentation ripped up whether it was American citizens getting beaten by the Taliban or it was SIV applicants and people who were already eligible to come here. Now we're hearing that the United States will no longer have a diplomatic process or function on the ground when we leave on August 31st. So, the question now is how are you going to get Americans out of the country if you don't have a military presence, you don't have a diplomatic presence and you are relying on the Taliban to kind of facilitate getting these people out. So that's the first thing. The idea we are even contemplating leaving Americans behind is a new thing to, I think the American ethos. And I think it's absolutely despicable that that's even on the table rather than saying we will not leave until we get every single person out. So that's where they are on that. In terms of the attack that they keep warning about and the response of the president promise not just yesterday but over the course of the last week to retaliate against any kind of attack on American forces or troops. Well, the time for that is now. The time is now to say well, another terrorist attack may happen because they determine the deterrence. So, they could, you know, it's 1.3 a.m. in Kabul. Hopefully there's planning is going on and people may be out right now conducting those retaliatory attacks. But this idea that we're sitting back and saying we're going to allow the Taliban to continue doing security and maybe we'll see another attack rather than acting immediately for a deterrence says quite a lot about where we are in terms of our strength and the position."

But how we got here was on February 2020 we started negotiating with the Taliban and we excused the Afghan government from those negotiations. Now don't get me wrong. Joe Biden mangled this withdrawal. But he was put into a corner when he got in there. And he should have said at the beginning we could have -- we should -- I'm not going to abide by any dates. I'm going to do everything in my power to ensure and take as long as I need to, to get all the Americans out. But it's worth pointing out that in this 2020 agreement we allowed, we released 5,000 Taliban fighters that American troops put in jail for doing bad things, right? Terrorists by any structure and means of the imagination. We put -- we release them from jail. And they're now fighting us on Quantico guarding the airports and guarding American troops. And I think it's also important to realize that the Pentagon, as well as the State Department, as well as our intelligence agencies have to be very strategic about the next move that we make when it comes to retaliating against ISIS-K. Why? Because we have military troops on the ground. And we want to be sure that we don't lose. We've already lost 13 military. I don't want to lose another one because we made a faulty decision. So we got to get everybody we can get out as fast as we can. And with that being said, this White House has gotten over 100,000 people out in less than 10 days."

The only way we go back in any significant way is if we suffer a 9/11 style spectacular attack here on the homeland. That's the only way we're going to go back big. And if we go back big, we aren't nation building. We learned that lesson. So, we're getting out of Afghanistan, we're going to get out of Iraq, out of Syria, and we're going to sit. The military is going to rest. And we will be pretty locked and loaded. So, the next enemy that tries to mess with the United States we are going to come out so strong and smash these idiots like a monster. So, think twice before you do that.

Can you run the airport? Right? Literally they asked the president of Turkey to, can you run our airport because they don't know how to do that. Right? And they want some sort of world legitimacy. They have two embassies currently open, the embassy of China, the embassy of Russia. Go figure. And they're like, listen, we want to be legitimate so that we don't get invaded again. So, I think that's thing number one. And I think thing number two, anybody that thinks we have to go back in I don't think -- I think the American public is adamantly against that. Like this withdrawal made it very clear that Americans like, yes. We don't want to go back in and we don't to see these horrifying pictures on our screens ever again.

They basically ask that they -- those conditions say that the Taliban will not allow further territory for ISIS-K or Al-Qaeda to regrow. We know that both of those things are happening but those agreements say very carefully they're not supposed to do that. So, I don't see a world in which we can go back to war. But I understand that if anybody who says that we need to be in there, understand that once we go back in or once we stay in it could escalate to a full-blown war which I don't think Americans want."

There has a much smaller footprint. The Taliban did let thousands of them out of prison when they went to Bagram and took it over. So that's one issue. And that's what we're talking about retaliating against now. The Taliban is basically on the verge of being recognized as an international player. They are about to be recognize as a government, essentially, the State Department is basically calling them our Afghan partners. They have a bunch of generals saying that. They have 600,000 rifles that are ours. They have thousands of vehicles that are ours. And for us to go back and take on the Taliban would require another full- scale war.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the Pentagon and State Department are working hand and hand. And the leverage that they believe they had, and remember Bill Burns of the CIA met with the Taliban leader Mullah Baradar on Monday and likely would have delivered a stern message, perhaps try to fill out what the Taliban's intents were, what they could, how they could work together. And also, he needed to deliver a message that the security around the airport was going to be their responsibility and that if they did allow bombers through like the one that we saw attack yesterday that they would be held accountable. So, there have been diplomatic messages sent. There has been constant contact but from Admiral Vasely who is in charge of the operation overseeing the operation at the airport. But in essence, I think what they're going to find, and what we have been hearing is that the Taliban want to set up a government. Now does the Taliban control all of their fighters? Are some of those fighters going to leave the Taliban when they have to become a normal so-called government and they'll then join ISIS-K? What you find in this -- in countries like this where there are these off shoots and various terror groups competing for recruits is that the more extreme ones are not going to want to be in government. So, the U.S. is hoping to use that leverage so they can keep that airport open and still get some of these SIVs and other Americans and Afghan evacuees out after August 31."

These are - - this is a chaotic street scenes where, you know, people can get through. It's not a tight cordon around the airport. So, in terms of the relationship between the Taliban and ISIS-K, it's very complicated. On the one hand, they are rivals. ISIS-K doesn't think the Taliban are extreme enough. But on the other hand, they certainly would work together with a common goal to embarrassing the Americans and striking Americans. The Taliban have not exactly changed in that sense. Right now, again, the relationship is going to be evolving. I think you're going to see some Taliban members leave the Taliban and join ISIS-K. Certainly, what we learned today and what was so fascinating in the briefing this morning when I asked John Kirby about how many ISIS-K prisoners had been released from Bagram which was a prison that the U.S. basically controlled until they left Bagram Air Base and left it in the hands of the Afghan National Army. But I was surprised by the numbers. He said that there were thousands of ISIS-K in that prison and another prison. That is a huge shot of recruits into ISIS K. And again, we don't talk -- I noticed that the administration is intentionally not mentioning al-Qaeda, because it would be somewhat embarrassing, I think, because President Biden had mentioned that early on, after this operation began that there were very few al-Qaeda left 20 years later after 9/11 in Afghanistan. That's not true based on intelligence reports and U.N. figures that were published in July. But you notice that the State Department Pentagon don't want to talk about al-Qaeda, they want to talk about ISIS K. You're really talking about shades without a difference between these three groups."

My question is after the United States leaves on August 31, what are the chances of the Biden administration outsourcing essentially consequences for ISIS K to the Taliban who does have an interest once the United States leaves to maintain full power of the country and to kind of eliminate ISIS-K from the picture?"

But if the Taliban are going to remain the government, then the U.S. will have to decide if they are going to reopen that embassy if they're going to deal with the Taliban as a legitimate government. My guess is that what happens after the U.S. leaves is that Afghanistan is going to fall into a civil war you already have in the Panjshir Valley, a resistance rising of former Afghan National Army and resistance fighters, you're going to have competition and fighting between ISIS-K and the Taliban. So, my guess is that it's not clear whether the Taliban are going to be able to hold on as the government of Afghanistan. And it's also not clear that the U.S. is going to recognize them."

How do you insert those guys into that country?"

But the really big problem is that their entire intelligence network has dried up. They would be probably dependent on the Taliban for intelligence to go after ISIS-K. That would be the only realistic scenario that I can see in the days after August 31. Those partners that they relied on those CIA networks, those have all been rolled up. They -- the CIA has gotten many of their people out and a lot of the partners that we haven't been able to evacuate, they're in hiding and it's doubtful that those partners are going to be working with the U.S. anytime soon."

They took it down because of the timing, right? But that's not the problem. The problem is the story itself, which is false, and it's garbage. And this is the reason why Vice is hemorrhaging money and had to lay off so many workers is because essentially, they become a woke zombie of Media Matters. It's like all their stuff comes from Media Matters, The Daily Beast, and they put it all together, and they hire terrible writers. They don't pay him anything, and then this is what happens.

That is one of the most important lessons learned.

They know what they're up against. They know that they've got three terror groups, and they've got giant bull's eyes on them.

All of that is possible right now, but Biden -- he -- Biden is going to pivot back to COVID real soon when school gets back into session.

And now, what the American people now need more than ever is reassurance. When the State Department is briefing, when the Pentagon is briefing twice, when you hear -- see the president every day or every other day briefing the American people, they might not have all the information, but they have some information, and that reassures the American people that they were trying to get ahead of it. We made a mistake at the beginning and we're working our way to try to fix it. While not perfect, we're getting there.

This is about now the question of whether President Joe Biden can protect the United States of America from Islamic terrorism. This is now -- our enemies are watching this. Some of the same people who were on the team, who were in charge of the Afghanistan pull-out, are now in charge of negotiating the Iran Nuclear Agreement. China is also building up their nuclear arsenal and Russia is still launching cyberattacks on our critical infrastructure which Joe Biden gave him a list -- a list much like we apparently gave a list to the Taliban with all of our interpreters, and Americans were still stranded in the country. So, this is not just about Afghanistan and leaving Afghanistan, this is a broader problem of having no deterrence, and our enemies understanding that Joe Biden is incredibly weak. And based on how he handled this and hanging out to the sunk cost, is he really going to be able to stand up to other countries that have things like ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons?"
