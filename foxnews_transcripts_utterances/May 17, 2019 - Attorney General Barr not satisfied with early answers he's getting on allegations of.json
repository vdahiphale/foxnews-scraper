If we are worried about foreign influence for the very same reason, we should be worried about whether government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale.

We know that the Russians tried to meddle. Now we need to know how it was done and who helped them. It's the same argument in reverse. And the dossier, the great dossier it's like a bad batch of egg salad serve to -- serve at the buffet and everyone who took a taste got food poisoning. It's the food poisoning of the news.

The ratings are taking a nose dive. Wouldn't you want to know why and how you were lied to? It seems like they have no interest in finding out what went wrong with the collusion hoax? But they don't care. Now, to your point about the Steele dossier and the FISA warrant, we are learning a lot and more about that. So, the whole FISA warrant on Carter Page looks like it was based off the Steele dossier. A major red flag in the Steele dossier, it said that they were running this operation through Carter Page out of the Russian embassy in Miami. There is no Russian embassy in Miami.

We're now learning that this is really not really what started off the entire investigation and that's going to come out. He never even spoke to a Russian.

It's not silliness, Juan if there was corruption. It's not silliness if there is an abuse of power. And you know why Hillary Clinton is being quiet about this? Because the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign paid for that dossier. What could be disinformation by Russia which was, if you read the whole Mueller report, the whole Mueller report, basically discredits big, big elements that were in that dossier. And I just want to point this out. I point it out all the time. Jim Comey looked at Bret Baier in the spring of last year and said I can't definitely say I know that the Steele dossier was paid for by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. He was running the FBI. They got a warrant on an American citizen to spy on him and he didn't know that. That is boulder dash and hog wash and -- we all know it. And by the way, I also read that poll, Juan.

So good for her. Obviously, Sanders is going to kind of take a gut punch when Biden officially announces. He was taking a lot of that front runner space. But I really do believe the comment he made about the Boston bomber may have hurt him. I think it would. Because his backers are so crazy.

Local politician they are saying about 1,000 migrant families will be sent to Broward and Palm Beach counties each month for an unknown period of time. U.S. customs officials just saying they are not currently sending migrants to Florida but they are looking at possible locations across the country. Jesse, this is a crisis.

Remember, that was considered payback. Greg made that point. Why is it payback if we're supposed to like these people. They don't want them on the border Texas towns. They don't want them south of the border in the northern Mexican border towns. Listen, if Palm Beach and Broward are Democrat counties but Florida is a red state, it's a swing state. Republican governors, Republican senators. Both parties have no infrastructure to handle these people. And I don't think any of the local people want them either because it's going to crush their local economy. Where do you put them you? Where do you out them? The only solution is you keep the, you hold them, you extend the settlements so you could hold the families together. Process them.

Your country or the world. Until you have a process the world controls your immigration. Whoever sends the caravans controls your immigration. That's wrong. It has to be our country. We control the border. That's the first thing. The second thing is, he's transformed it into a competitive thing."

But also he would change the law so that people from the Northern Triangle countries are treated such as Canada and Mexico. That seems fair to me. That sounds like a common-sense balanced thing that people should be allowed - would be willing to vote for. The other thing is you can solve our problems here, we also know that they're going to keep coming. Right, so there's the pressure on the border and we haven't talked about solving the problem at its source, because that's the only way that it's going to stop. People are not going to stop leaving. They're going to leave. But you look at people that trying to leave Syria, they'll do anything to get out of there, desperate people do desperate things.
