That June, the Dow jumped nearly a quarter, 24 percent, thanks to what was then a big stimulus package of $4 billion.

That big stock market increase must be credited to me. If Hillary won, a big crash.\" Well, as for this month, you can thank investor hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal, with that big Trump-Xi meeting taking place tonight on the sidelines of the G20. But mostly credit the Federal Reserve for the month, with nearly 100 percent of the market predicting a rate cut next month, which will mean trillions of dollars will be released into the U.S. and global economy. And June can also be characterized as a month of Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency up nearly 40 percent and more than tripling in value so far this year, some big numbers there -- Neil, back to you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But the vice president's chief of staff is tempering expectations, telling me today -- Marc Short saying that he supports indexing capital gains to inflation, but he says the conversations at the White House are still in the -- quote -- \"infant stages.\" And he hasn't addressed this specifically with the president. Indexing capital gains would slash tax bills for investors when they sell stock or real estate by adjusting the original purchase price, so no tax is paid on appreciation tied to inflation. Critics of this idea say it mostly benefits the 1 percent and it could push investors to sell. A lot of those critics, Neil, work on Capitol Hill, but in 1992 some key Democrats voted in favor of cutting taxes on inflation -- 27 years ago, then Congressman Chuck Schumer said this on the House floor about capital gains:",

That was more than 80 years ago. Gas was selling for around 20 cents a gallon back then. Seabiscuit beat War Admiral in a horse race that captured the nation's attention. And Howard Hughes flew around the world in record time. It only took three days and a little over 19 hours. And Orson Welles created a panic with his radio broadcast \"War of the Worlds\" about Martians invading Earth. That was then. So where do we go now? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" To Susan Li with more on a June we won't soon forget. Hey, Susan."

That June, the Dow jumped nearly a quarter, 24 percent, thanks to what was then a big stimulus package of $4 billion. So 1938 may dwarf 2019's 7 percent gains, but it's a different time and also a much healthier economy. For instance, unemployment back then was 19 percent 80 years ago. Now it's at 3.6 percent and near its best in 50 years. And President Trump taking credit this morning, tweeting that \"The stock market is up massively from the day that after I won the election, all the way up to the day that I took office because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be president. That big stock market increase must be credited to me. If Hillary won, a big crash.\" Well, as for this month, you can thank investor hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal, with that big Trump-Xi meeting taking place tonight on the sidelines of the G20. But mostly credit the Federal Reserve for the month, with nearly 100 percent of the market predicting a rate cut next month, which will mean trillions of dollars will be released into the U.S. and global economy. And June can also be characterized as a month of Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency up nearly 40 percent and more than tripling in value so far this year, some big numbers there -- Neil, back to you."

That is 1-3-3 -- right now at around 26566, yet another reminder that if you stick with it for the long term, you will be richly rewarded. So, as the market keeps going up, Democratic presidential candidates continue to rip the rich, disproportionately, they say, benefiting from all this, as President Trump, as Susan reported, takes credit for the strong markets. So who's going to win out on this argument? Let's go to market watchers Keith Fitz-Gerald, Kimberly Foss and, well, he was there in 1938, Teddy Weisberg, outside the New York Stock Exchange."

I mean, it goes on and on and on. And yet that's all trumped by a very good economy, very good corporate earnings, an accommodative Fed, and low inflation and low unemployment. And the latter is the fuel for a positive market environment. And so the markets -- the markets just continue to climb this proverbial wall of worry. And I suspect it will continue, Neil, because Mr. Market never lies."

So, we definitely want to see this agreement come through, and especially for the businesses around the world. Our markets are so interconnected now. It wasn't like it was 80 years ago.

It's all -- we're all -- we all could look at the markets, all have an opinion, and all be right or wrong at any given time.

And the rap against Wall Street, it was just for a select few, the rich fat cats who were benefiting, that in an environment that produced a 133 on the Dow. We sit here, similar arguments today, just in the past couple of days, these two days of Democratic debates, that it's tilted to the rich, Wall Street is their playground, not Main Street's, and many of them want to raise taxes. They was talk with Elizabeth Warren and others to start a trading tax, a wealth tax. And Bernie Sanders much has -- to do the same to provide college for all.

And, right now, it's being rewarded in the U.S. markets. And as I said before on your show many times, Neil, the United States stock market is the greatest wealth creation tool in the entire history of the human being, right? And so long as markets remain free -- and that's what this has done in the last couple of years, it's made the markets freer. And as long as we are free, our investors, people with the 401(k)s, they're the ones who are going to benefit for it. So stay invested long term. And you know what?

But just said you weren't going to put tariffs. Now you are going to put -- but, no, that's all I'm going to do. All right, so what could make these talks and a possible deal happen? And would it be the president giving away any preconditions or offering up the tantalizing possibility of delaying the higher-priced tariffs maybe for another six months? We're getting mixed reads from the president himself, but let's see what our guests think of that, National Taxpayer Union's Mattie Duppler. We have got FOX Business' Charlie Gasparino and Democratic strategist Christy Setzer. You know, Charlie, are the markets anticipating we're going to get a deal? Because it seems to me that they have been waiting for this, but they might just as well be happy if they don't get it and what they get is a guaranteed cutting interest rates. What do you think?"

So he's going into this meeting not worried about higher interest rates. And the markets are pretty stable. We're kind of like at the highs at the Dow, 26500. The real question is, if he does get something marginal -- and this is what I -- I think it will be a positive for the market. It's kind of a debate out there whether it's priced it or not. If you get something marginally positive, markets could rally on this. And I think they could rally. And depending on how good it is, they could rally significantly. I mean, this is -- then you have low interest rates and a trade deal at the same time. And, by the way, this helps him going into the elections. I mean, there's no doubt, Dow 29000-30000 and decent GDP, because you got the trade issue, and you got interest rates..."

So I think what, again, what Wall Street's expecting is that we will have this result where, sure, we're keeping the existing tariffs, there's not going to be new ones. And that would be an OK sort of middling result that is not actually probably going to allow for a bump in the market. But if we don't even get that, then, no, I mean, there's no reason to think that the markets are going to rally, because what would we have gotten out of it?"

And, of course, Joe Biden, remember, got into some controversy a weekend into his announcement saying that China wasn't a competitive threat. And then he reversed himself and said it is. And now I notice, in the candidates' issues of top worries, for I think about six or seven of them, China was among them. What do you think has changed here?"

And so, no, I mean, look, I think that the Democratic electorate, for the most part, is far more ginned up about other issues than they are about trade.

I don't -- when I say I spoke with Wall Street, I mean I spoke to some of my sources. So they have different opinions. But you get a decent trade deal, you get you get low interest rates or stable interest rates, that is a really good positive for the markets. I don't care. And one other thing, even though we have a tariff war, GDP is still pretty strong. We're still at 2 to 3 percent. It's not really impacting the economy in the major way that the doomsayers say.

We haven't had a lot of conversation, I think, in our political elections about trade. But what President Trump was very smart at doing was, he identified the problems that people in the Midwest and blue-collar communities were having. And he said he understood them. He respected what they were going through and was going to help fix it. Now, the consequence of that is, trade has become a major issue for this administration."

If you were able to cement that, I think a lot of these questions about China and the U.S. would be blunted a little bit, because it would show the administration is serious about creating certainty for those businesses to invest and giving a lot of that economic feedback back into the country that's been missing a little bit, or at least has been dampened by the trade war with China."

They're inside of the shelters doing things that they were not hired to do. These are brave men and women on the border. Doing their job on the border is what they should be doing as law enforcement officers.

But it is interesting how much Trump's behavior towards Russia disagrees between policy and persona. I mean, obviously, this hostility that he's showing towards Iran is not benefiting Putin. Putin obviously doesn't want us to go to war with Iran or tighten our sanctions on them. Yet, when Trump meets Putin in person, he can't help but be this affable with him."

And I think there's a level of machismo that Trump appreciates about Putin. I don't think it's some 4-D underwater backgammon strategy. I think Trump, just as -- on a personal level, likes building a rapport with people like this. We see him do it with North Korea, and now we're seeing him do it again with Russia. And it's one of his worst -- it's one of his worst tendencies, especially considering that his Russia policy has actually been quite good."

They're not happy about it on a whole host of issues, from the ongoing trade war with China, to, as you said, the way we're handling Iran, to his beefing up security around the Venezuela issue. So he has a history of his actions speaking louder than his words. But what I do notice -- and this is a consistent theme -- he will blast another foreign leader. Yet, in that foreign leader's presence -- Theresa May comes to mind about a year ago, when he was blasting her how she was handling Brexit and everything else. Meet her in person, it was all pie in the sky. Pretty much the same with Angela Merkel, blasting how she handles the Russians, with her today, pleasant and agreeable. And maybe that's just human nature. Maybe we're all that way. But it does stand out."

And she did -- she demonstrated pretty much the perfect display of how a thug like Putin should be handled. He is obviously a diplomatically elected leader. People in his own country recognize that he is the leader. It's important that our world leaders all meet at G20. But she didn't cower to him. She didn't smile. And she made it very clear that Russia is responsible for people being killed on British soil. And she treated him like the thug that he is. Trump would be wise to maybe take a note from May in that respect."

Administration officials are looking at an executive order that would cut taxes by indexing capital gains to inflation. And they're on a tight deadline. Reportedly, White House officials want the tax cut to move forward as soon as possible, so the benefits of it hit before the 2020 election. But the vice president's chief of staff is tempering expectations, telling me today -- Marc Short saying that he supports indexing capital gains to inflation, but he says the conversations at the White House are still in the -- quote -- \"infant stages.\" And he hasn't addressed this specifically with the president. Indexing capital gains would slash tax bills for investors when they sell stock or real estate by adjusting the original purchase price, so no tax is paid on appreciation tied to inflation. Critics of this idea say it mostly benefits the 1 percent and it could push investors to sell. A lot of those critics, Neil, work on Capitol Hill, but in 1992 some key Democrats voted in favor of cutting taxes on inflation -- 27 years ago, then Congressman Chuck Schumer said this on the House floor about capital gains:"
