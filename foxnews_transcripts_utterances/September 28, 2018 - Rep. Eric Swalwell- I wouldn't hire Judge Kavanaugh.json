They're not going to have votes on the Senate floor until, at least, the middle or later part of next week. They were hoping to get this done up or down by next Tuesday. It's going to be at least a few days more as the FBI reopens this investigation. That is dangerous for Judge Kavanaugh because as he himself testified yesterday, every day feels like an eternity. And more unverified allegations can come out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But on the plus side, this could lock in some yes votes among moderate Democrats and Republicans who have been wavering if the FBI doesn't find anything new, this could mean that they vote for it and actually confirm Kavanaugh. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The risk though, the caveat is Kavanaugh could be confirmed as long as the FBI does not find the evidence to corroborate Dr. Ford's allegations at the urging, as you said of Republican Jeff Flake, the committee has now asked the White House and the president has moved forward on that directing the FBI to conduct this supplemental background investigation that is, \"Limited to current credible allegations that must be completed one week from today.\" Except that does not seem good enough for Dr. Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, who released a statement a short time ago praising the Senate for moving forward with a thorough investigation. But added there should be no artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That seems to blow up things a bit, but Dr. Ford's team does not run the Senate, and this FBI probe may move quickly. Kavanaugh's friend, Mark Judge has already said he will cooperate. Democrats have been demanding he testify, even though he is just tonight given the Senate Judiciary panel a new sworn statement saying he has no recollection of that incident from the early 1980s. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The key here is, at least, five moderates say they backed this one-week investigation or delay. So, if the president has now moved forward with this, Kavanaugh would not be guaranteed to get these votes but we likely get the backing of moderate Republicans like Flake, Susan Collins, Murkowski, Democrats Heidi Heitkamp, and Joe Manchin. They all say they're in favor of this one-week delay. If the FBI doesn't find something new, they very well may vote for the nominee. Democrat Chris Coons worked with Jeff Flake to broker this. This allowed the committee to report it out of the panel with a favorable 11-10 vote the Kavanaugh nomination. But then, pause before it goes to the Senate floor.

Those are digital keys that keep you logged in so you don't have to re-enter your password every time you use Facebook. The access tokens were then used to take over people's accounts. Fifty million of them as you said. The company says passwords and credit card information was not stolen. But things like names and gender, hometowns were taken. And here is the big headline. The hack gave the attackers full control of the accounts. Meaning if they took over your account they could send messages, post pictures and notices as if they were you.

Quoting, \"We are continuing to improve our defenses and I think that this also underscores that there are just constant attacks from people who are trying to take over accounts or steal information from people in our community.\" Zuckerberg went on to say, \"There is no indication of who is behind the attack or whether it could be state sponsored.\" Remember, earlier in year, Facebook was hacked by Cambridge Analytica. A political sonsulting firm that stole raw data from 87 million Facebook users after that attack Zuckerberg was called before Congress. This time around Facebook says it's working with the FBI and working on better securing its site. We should note that along with the 50 million users who were hacked, Facebook has also reset access codes to an additional 40 million users. So in all, 90 million people will have to log back in to their accounts before using them. Trish?",

      "utterance": "Trish, great to see you. Over what Mitch McConnell was trying to do there is reassure conservatives are a little upset tonight that this is not moving as quickly as they wanted. They're not going to have votes on the Senate floor until, at least, the middle or later part of next week. They were hoping to get this done up or down by next Tuesday. It's going to be at least a few days more as the FBI reopens this investigation. That is dangerous for Judge Kavanaugh because as he himself testified yesterday, every day feels like an eternity. And more unverified allegations can come out. But on the plus side, this could lock in some yes votes among moderate Democrats and Republicans who have been wavering if the FBI doesn't find anything new, this could mean that they vote for it and actually confirm Kavanaugh. The risk though, the caveat is Kavanaugh could be confirmed as long as the FBI does not find the evidence to corroborate Dr. Ford's allegations at the urging, as you said of Republican Jeff Flake, the committee has now asked the White House and the president has moved forward on that directing the FBI to conduct this supplemental background investigation that is, \"Limited to current credible allegations that must be completed one week from today.\" Except that does not seem good enough for Dr. Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, who released a statement a short time ago praising the Senate for moving forward with a thorough investigation. But added there should be no artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation. That seems to blow up things a bit, but Dr. Ford's team does not run the Senate, and this FBI probe may move quickly. Kavanaugh's friend, Mark Judge has already said he will cooperate. Democrats have been demanding he testify, even though he is just tonight given the Senate Judiciary panel a new sworn statement saying he has no recollection of that incident from the early 1980s. The key here is, at least, five moderates say they backed this one-week investigation or delay. So, if the president has now moved forward with this, Kavanaugh would not be guaranteed to get these votes but we likely get the backing of moderate Republicans like Flake, Susan Collins, Murkowski, Democrats Heidi Heitkamp, and Joe Manchin. They all say they're in favor of this one-week delay. If the FBI doesn't find something new, they very well may vote for the nominee. Democrat Chris Coons worked with Jeff Flake to broker this. This allowed the committee to report it out of the panel with a favorable 11-10 vote the Kavanaugh nomination. But then, pause before it goes to the Senate floor. Watch."

But let's also understand, they were faced with a very unhappy thing. They were going to have to jam this through quite potentially with Mike Pence having to cast the deciding vote and there would be this cloud. They are left again with the chance, something they hope for from the beginning that they would get Democratic votes that it would be bipartisan and that it would go through in a way that was more pleasing to everybody involved. That's what they really want and though this FBI investigation does pose peril for them. It reintroduces the concept that this might end up as a happy ending story for Republicans rather than just sort of saving, the last man."

Is this going to actually galvanize people, get them to the polls? You know, now they've got a reason to go because if this is still lingering as we head into midterms, they're going to be fired up in a way that maybe they -- you know, might not have been otherwise."

I'm angry, I think Senator Lindsey Graham was right yesterday where this has been a complete unethical sham in these allegations that had been leveled and weaponized by the left against Brett Kavanaugh have been completely baseless. Zero corroboration, not a single witness who have stepped forward to reiterate or say that these accusers are correct in her accusations and stories. Yet the Left has dragged his name and his family through the mud and is absolutely despicable. And I think, Judge Kavanaugh hit the nail on the head yesterday when he said, this isn't about advice and consent for the left on the Senate. This is about search-and-destroy. That's also what calling for an FBI investigation is for, for those on the Left. What they are hoping is to continue to seek out just like they did with the Deborah Ramirez story. But, as Ronan Farrow the author of The New Yorker piece has said, the Democrats found her. They are going to try to go out and find more baseless uncorroborated stories to try to further ruin Judge Kavanaugh's good name. And I think it is absolutely despicable and it's going to galvanize so many Republicans who otherwise would have been complacent heading into the midterm election."

And I think Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins realized that the optics of jamming through this nomination may be barely squeaking by when we are forty days for a midterm where -- Look, Lisa talks about Republican women. The numbers were seen from independent women and Democratic women, they are fired up, they are angry at the GOP already. And the -- and the optics of pushing this through, look, one of two things will happen in this week. The FBI will either come up with evidence, they will find a witness who corroborates your story or they won't. And at the end of the week, we will all be better because we know the FBI has looked into it. And then, he can vote to be confirmed or not.

But the Republicans would have a base intensity problem if it does fail because they will be punished by those who said, \"I don't care what he did, get them on the court.\" So there's that. But to your point, if the seat is vacant, that does raise the stakes and it does raise the stakes for Republican voters.

And I don't understand why you wouldn't want to hear from that person and put him under oath just as you put Dr. Ford under oath. Again, I will just say this, Trish. Twenty seven years ago when Anita Hill came forward most people agree that was a disgrace. But 20 witnesses were heard at that hearing.

And second, I am 100 percent confident that the Democrats will take over the House. He did neither. And I think that was telling on both counts. I think that speaks to the fact that -- I mean, the idea that Nancy Pelosi from San Francisco isn't progressive enough for the Democratic Party right now and they believe that their ideas are old, and tired, and worn out and not the future of their party speaks volumes for what Tom Perez sees in his own party. But I also found it very illuminating that when given the opportunity he says he hopes that they take over the House. If you are the chair of the DNC or frankly the chair of the RNC you are supposed to be out there expressing unbelievable confidence in your party's ability to either win or maintain a majority.

Once we explain to people that she would be the speaker, we make that race a binary choice. America First is out there running ads around the country and supporting candidates that make it very clear that they are going to support President Trump's policies and agenda. And then if we lose the majority, it's Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff and Maxine Waters who are going to start taking over the House of Representatives.

One that's galvanizing support from right to left. I think the interesting thing that I find fascinating in terms of the coverage is for all these folks on the left and you saw, you know, not a single question in that clip asked of Tom Perez. The deputy chair of the DNC Ellison from Minnesota facing very similar charges and all of these folks from the Democratic and the left side have yet to mention the allegations that are leveled against him and why he is still the deputy chair of the DNC. That is something that I think should be asked of every Democrat and leadership and in rank and file.

That's what you click on when you want to see how your profile looks to the general public. And once the hackers got into view as, it allowed them to steal Facebook access tokens. Those are digital keys that keep you logged in so you don't have to re-enter your password every time you use Facebook. The access tokens were then used to take over people's accounts. Fifty million of them as you said. The company says passwords and credit card information was not stolen. But things like names and gender, hometowns were taken. And here is the big headline. The hack gave the attackers full control of the accounts. Meaning if they took over your account they could send messages, post pictures and notices as if they were you. Today, Facebook held a couple of news conference calls trying to tamp this down with CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledging there is work to be done. Quoting, \"We are continuing to improve our defenses and I think that this also underscores that there are just constant attacks from people who are trying to take over accounts or steal information from people in our community.\" Zuckerberg went on to say, \"There is no indication of who is behind the attack or whether it could be state sponsored.\" Remember, earlier in year, Facebook was hacked by Cambridge Analytica. A political sonsulting firm that stole raw data from 87 million Facebook users after that attack Zuckerberg was called before Congress. This time around Facebook says it's working with the FBI and working on better securing its site. We should note that along with the 50 million users who were hacked, Facebook has also reset access codes to an additional 40 million users. So in all, 90 million people will have to log back in to their accounts before using them. Trish?"
