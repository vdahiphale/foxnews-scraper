For a progressive, the personal is always political, where the right isn't just wrong but evil. So good for Sarah for deciding that you're OK. You've met the approval of someone paid to talk to you. She appreciates you the way a cat appreciates yarn. Would her new enlightenment hold? I don't know.

The bigger the pool, the more likely there might be a creep in that pool. However, you have to be cognizes if you're the lifeguard, should you say something? And I think one of the flaws with Donald Trump, it's a salesman's flaw. You never want just turned down a sale. It's actually not -- it's not a moral choice. It's not a correct choice, but it's a part of thinking that the money is green, so you never turn down a sale. You never know. You never condemn anyone until somebody else comes along. So there is a glimmer of truth here. But the other issue here is that the Democrats have a problem.

It's the biggest mistake that both Al Gore, John Kerry, who came on as secretary of state, and Hillary Clinton did make. Because if you come on, and Juan, as you know, if you went on you solve some of your best segments were on with people, and this show in particular, who disagree with you because you win people over and some of you don't, but at least you go in there and you'll get your hands dirty. And she in this interview said, Uranium One, that's still going on, and still everyone proves it didn't exist. Well, there's a problem with that. That story is moving. And she goes on the problems with my emails they made it the number one story. It shouldn't have been. Well, the problem is, there was a lot there, but you didn't go in and attack it. You know what she did, admitted it in this interview. I didn't even listen, nor did her staff.

Like that was nice. She was kind. She was fine, whatever. And it's not a total train wreaked. KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: No. I mean, you know, appreciate the upside there. If you believe in yourself and your confident in what you have to offer that you're a great candidate, and you have ideas that are compelling that would resonate with the American people, then why wouldn't she take a chance and get in the ring and go into a forum where you might be able to reach some of those crossover, or swing voters, or people -- independent that -- you know what I think? I feel more certain going with somebody like her. It could happen. The point is she didn't take that chance. And you would think, Brian, to your point, that other people made this same mistake, that they would learn. How many high paid consultants and experts does it take to figure it out when you have eyeballs and the reach of a network like the Fox News Channel and FBN, why wouldn't you take that opportunity?

He defected by trying to cross the heavily armed border with the south. When his comrades caught wind, they opened fire. He was hit several times and collapsed on the South Korean side. And what an amazing sight it was to see troops from the south pull him to safety.

In a new show, Sarah travels the country interviewing groups who don't live near Whole Foods. It's like wild kingdom for gender studies majors. And now she claims after meeting so many Trump voters, she likes them. She loves them. Yes, what a surprise. You can feel comfortable around people who you don't agree with. So this is progress for a progressive, especially one who called for a military overthrow of Trump, a coup, while actual riots were going on. Imagine if anyone had listened. So this is a big step. For a progressive, the personal is always political, where the right isn't just wrong but evil. So good for Sarah for deciding that you're OK. You've met the approval of someone paid to talk to you. She appreciates you the way a cat appreciates yarn. Would her new enlightenment hold? I don't know. I remember how Sarah ridiculed Andrew Breitbart, not to his face, but when she took his seat after he left the set on Bill Maher's show."
