By the way, Judge Emmet Sullivan, Your Honor, where are you? It's time to let this man go free. We need to hear from you.

We need to hear from you. And coming up, we'll show you all of the explosive new developments from the Intel Committee documents, 53 -- I mean, hundreds and hundreds of pages of interviews that Adam Schiff has been hiding from the public because they reveal all of his lies. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We're going to review how the Pravda propaganda arm of the Democratic media, that is the Democratic Party, the media mob, socialist state TV, how they are reacting defensively to this week's incredible news.

You've seen the videotape. We have a lot of questions tonight. But, first, we begin on this Friday night, the corrupt, the compromised, the congenital liar Adam Schiff, he is a national disgrace that even worse than I thought. Thanks to Acting National Intel Director Ric Grenell, thanks to the Attorney General of the United States Bill Barr, we have definitive proof of Schiff's malicious dishonesty in the form of roughly 6,000 pages, newly released, sworn testimony he's been hiding from the American people. This comes from the Intel Committee's 2017 Russia investigation. These are the interviews that were taken under oath. We have a complete timeline of Schiff's unethical behavior, his outright lying on all of the media and we begin. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's start with the date, July 17, 2017. It is on that day that Adam Schiff listened to Obama's director of national intelligence, that guy in the middle, James Clapper. And he testified under oath saying, quote: I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting or conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election. On October 13th, same year, Adam Schiff heard from Obama official Samantha Power who testified she has no evidence of collusion. Quote: I'm not in possession of anything. On September 8th, 2017, Susan Rice telling Adam Schiff, quote: To the best of my recollection there wasn't anything smoking and I don't recall intelligence that I would consider evidence to that effect. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } On November 3rd, 2017, former Deputy Attorney General Yates, Sally Yates, concluding to Adam Schiff -- there was no evidence of collusion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But on March 13th, 2018, just four months after those four officials and others testified there was zero evidence of any Trump-Russia collusion, the congenital liar Schiff got in front of a camera and, of course, not questioned, he was held up as some kind of hero by the mob and the media, the socialist Pravda of our day, that said there was significant evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. He knew it was a lie. He had all the testimony proving it was a lie, but this is what he told the American people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The mob and the media -- you people in the mob, you are his willing accomplices.

In fact, he also testified, McCabe did, he didn't know if the Steele material on Carter Page, he didn't know if any of it was true, none of it was true. This was the material that was used starting there in October of 2016 as the basis for four separate FISA applications. Even McCabe admitted in sworn testimony, no dossier, no warrant.

The DOJ's inspector general, he was telling the truth. Steele's dossier was Russian disinformation all along. Schiff lied to socialist comrades in the Democratic Party, they helped him lie and the mob in the media acted as his PR staff.

Instead of upholding his oath of office, he lied again and again. It was a coup attempt, a conspiracy theory to unseat a duly elected president, and, by the way, after they couldn't prevent him from getting elected because we the people didn't listen to them.

I've always known. You were a prosecutor that never lost a case and as I read parts of these 6,000 pages, I'm a little tired, I need sleep and I'm even cranky tonight. But I see that you grilled Andrew McCabe. At what point did the bureau ask Steele, why did you do this research, who were you doing it for, is anyone paying you to do it? When did those questions came up? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, his answer, Trey Gowdy, am I reading this correctly?

When does he get the money for the house he had to sell back and when it is he get his good name back, because tonight, we're still waiting to see if a federal judge will sign off on the DOJ's rightful request to drop its case against Flynn, thanks to the Attorney General Barr, thanks to Rick Grenell, director of national intelligence. But let's be clear, General Flynn, a 33-year military veteran, as we have told you now for years on this show, he was set up. It was an ambush. It was a corrupt ambush by agents all because he was connected to Donald Trump. Before Trump entered the White House, the case against Flynn, it was done, it was closed. The FBI found no good derogatory material on Flynn, but then high-ranking officials at the FBI, Peter Strzok, James Comey and company, they decided on January fourth that they'll reopen the case. Whoopsy-daisy, we can go after him. The very next day, January 5th, well, 2017, in the Oval Office of Barack Hussein Obama with quid pro quo Joe there, Sally Yates there, clapper there, Brennan there, all of them according to Intel Committee testimony from Sally Yates, Obama pulled her , Comey aside after the meeting to discuss Lieutenant General Flynn, Yates describes how the president had intimate knowledge of the contents of General Flynn's wiretap calls which shocked the Deputy Attorney General Yates we now know that a few weeks after that meeting, that would be on January 20th. Susan Rice goes back into the Oval Office, memorializes the meeting and says, Barack said to do everything by the book.

His deputy telling Flynn, you don't need a lawyer when he absolutely did need a lawyer and that's where we get the -- well, what's our goal here, admission or get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired? Four days into Trump's presidency. One agent involved, as I said, what is our goal? These questions should never be asked by anybody in the FBI. Andrew McCabe should have told them he needed an attorney, but following the ambush that he said -- Comey said we'd never do in a prior administration because he wouldn't get away with and wouldn't even try -- well, they still didn't think Flynn was lying. In fact, we now finally have, finally, an early draft of the first 302 that has been missing this whole time. It shows that Flynn didn't lie. Look at your screen. Thanks to Ric Grenell, thanks to the Attorney General Barr. That document dump yesterday, thousands of patients -- pages, we now know Flynn never denied talking to the individual as soon-to-be counterpart. As a side note, Susan Rice and Samantha Power said they did the same thing before they got into the Obama administration. But at the center of the FBI perjury case against Flynn, he said, I don't remember. Ultimately, the FBI relied on a subsequent, an adjusted 302 that was completely altered by Strzok and Page and they're bragging about it in the little text messages they have. This is gross misconduct, abuse of power, corruption at the highest levels of your government. This is the very definition of abuse of power. The mob, the media, willing accomplices as usual. They have an agenda. They are the PR. They are the socialist wing propaganda arm of the Democratic Party. They are state-run socialist TV and the New York toilet paper \"Times\", they lived up to their billing. They wanted Flynn locked up forever, and all because of his association with Donald Trump. You associated with Trump, you have no civil rights. And now, they are apoplectic that Flynn -- we're not going to run this now -- has been vindicated by the DOJ. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } How can anyone ever trust these mob members again?

They don't care. Papadopoulos, they don't care. Look at your screen. There are corrupt government officials -- look at them -- who could face really serious crimes because they finally got caught, they almost got away with all of it.

I wish I was wrong, frankly, for the sake of our kids and grandkids in our country, because they've shredded the Constitution the whole time.

A lot of us didn't know this week would come. Finally, it has come in this country and it's only the beginning. The Russia collusion hoax has been brought to its knees and we have much more that will be coming in the days and weeks and months to follow. That I can assure you. The corrupt, the compromise, that guy, the congenital liar -- everything I've been telling you about him is true. He is now facing public embarrassment, he may just not know it yet. Lieutenant General Michael Flynn has been exonerated. By the way, Judge Emmet Sullivan, Your Honor, where are you? It's time to let this man go free. We need to hear from you. And the biggest news is former President Barack Obama as of yesterday has now been implicated in what is the biggest abuse and power corruption scandal in American history. So, Barack, Joe, what did both of you know and when did you know it? We need to hear from you. And coming up, we'll show you all of the explosive new developments from the Intel Committee documents, 53 -- I mean, hundreds and hundreds of pages of interviews that Adam Schiff has been hiding from the public because they reveal all of his lies. We're going to review how the Pravda propaganda arm of the Democratic media, that is the Democratic Party, the media mob, socialist state TV, how they are reacting defensively to this week's incredible news. Spoiler alert, the hysteria has now reached new heights because they have been exposed. Also, we have a full report on this horrific shooting in Georgia. You've seen the videotape. We have a lot of questions tonight. But, first, we begin on this Friday night, the corrupt, the compromised, the congenital liar Adam Schiff, he is a national disgrace that even worse than I thought. Thanks to Acting National Intel Director Ric Grenell, thanks to the Attorney General of the United States Bill Barr, we have definitive proof of Schiff's malicious dishonesty in the form of roughly 6,000 pages, newly released, sworn testimony he's been hiding from the American people. This comes from the Intel Committee's 2017 Russia investigation. These are the interviews that were taken under oath. We have a complete timeline of Schiff's unethical behavior, his outright lying on all of the media and we begin. Let's start with the date, July 17, 2017. It is on that day that Adam Schiff listened to Obama's director of national intelligence, that guy in the middle, James Clapper. And he testified under oath saying, quote: I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting or conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election. On October 13th, same year, Adam Schiff heard from Obama official Samantha Power who testified she has no evidence of collusion. Quote: I'm not in possession of anything. On September 8th, 2017, Susan Rice telling Adam Schiff, quote: To the best of my recollection there wasn't anything smoking and I don't recall intelligence that I would consider evidence to that effect. On November 3rd, 2017, former Deputy Attorney General Yates, Sally Yates, concluding to Adam Schiff -- there was no evidence of collusion. But on March 13th, 2018, just four months after those four officials and others testified there was zero evidence of any Trump-Russia collusion, the congenital liar Schiff got in front of a camera and, of course, not questioned, he was held up as some kind of hero by the mob and the media, the socialist Pravda of our day, that said there was significant evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. He knew it was a lie. He had all the testimony proving it was a lie, but this is what he told the American people. Take a look."

Yes, but, of course, Vladimir knows compromising material on Donald Trump. That's him on tape. He thought he would -- he thought -- he was colluding with a Russian, he thought. A year later, by the way, March 24, 2019, there Schiff repeating his lies as he had all throughout this time period all over the media, they never ever challenged him. They were -- they were giddy, they said, welcome back, congressman. Thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate you thrashing Trump. What news do you have today? What lies did you tell us?

      "utterance": "That is the guy that represented the entire Democratic Party in the House Intel Committee -- Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine. A proven liar, a disgusting sociopath and a congenital liar, Schiff, he damaged this country with all of these lies, one hoax after another, all his conspiracy theories. The mob and the media -- you people in the mob, you are his willing accomplices. You've been his dupe the whole way, lie after lie, Russian lies, Ukrainian lies, Schiff show lies, and he's leading this party and the mob into what are uncharted waters that literally threaten the constitutional order of this country. Just take a look at this creepy-looking lunatic who will do and say anything to smear, slander, besmirch Donald Trump and thrust himself, of course, into the lights of the cameras, and the limelight. This lying that you just witnessed, it is only the tip of the iceberg. For example, I could go on the whole show, November 15, 2017, Schiff defended Hillary's bought and paid for -- even \"The New York Times\" now recognizes likely Russian disinformation from the get-go -- because the Russians knew Schiff, knew Steele was feeding it to Hillary. They were helping Hillary. They were creating the chaos Devin Nunes warned Obama and Biden about in 2014, and they didn't listen to him. And he said that much of the documents meaning the dossier approved true. That was another lie. December 19, 2017, during McCabe's sworn testimony, the former deputy FBI director could not point to one single claim, not one, this is McCabe -- one, not once in Steele's dossier that he knew was true and accurate, and all of that is in this document dump yesterday, but thanks to Ric Grenell and Attorney General Barr. In fact, he also testified, McCabe did, he didn't know if the Steele material on Carter Page, he didn't know if any of it was true, none of it was true. This was the material that was used starting there in October of 2016 as the basis for four separate FISA applications. Even McCabe admitted in sworn testimony, no dossier, no warrant. They said it wasn't true. It's in his testimony. In February 2018, Schiff authored a memo claiming there's absolutely no FISA abuse whatsoever despite Congressman Devin Nunes who told the country the truth. Schiff lied, Nunes told the truth, warning to the country. Nunes was telling all of us. The truth this guy was telling us lies even when he had testimony that was telling him they were lies. The DOJ's inspector general, he was telling the truth. Steele's dossier was Russian disinformation all along. Schiff lied to socialist comrades in the Democratic Party, they helped him lie and the mob in the media acted as his PR staff. This is a revolting but clear and present danger -- and that remains to our constitutional republic the rule of law, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws. They must be held accountable. The dossier's contents were not verified. He knew he was lying. They told him it's not true. It is a disgusting, despicable, revolting lie by the biggest liar we've ever witnessed. Even Christopher Steele himself, he couldn't stand by his own dossier, as we've been telling you in an interrogatory under the threat of perjury and Great Britain. So, you have this corrupt, compromised, congenital liar Adam Schiff not only a national embarrassment, this -- what he's doing is a threat to our national security and he was helped and literally the mob and the media and his fellow Democrats are complicit and they were complicit every step of the way. Instead of working to combat government abuse of power and corruption, Schiff chose to bolster his own publicity at the risk of innocent people whose lives were destroyed. Instead of upholding his oath of office, he lied again and again. It was a coup attempt, a conspiracy theory to unseat a duly elected president, and, by the way, after they couldn't prevent him from getting elected because we the people didn't listen to them. He lied about an innocent man, protected those who were truly guilty. They worked together, they coordinated. Now, make no mistake, history will not be kind to this pathetic idiot from California's 28th congressional district. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor, former Congressman Trey Gowdy. Mr. Gowdy, I actually am very impressed. I've always known. You were a prosecutor that never lost a case and as I read parts of these 6,000 pages, I'm a little tired, I need sleep and I'm even cranky tonight. But I see that you grilled Andrew McCabe. At what point did the bureau ask Steele, why did you do this research, who were you doing it for, is anyone paying you to do it? When did those questions came up? Well, his answer, Trey Gowdy, am I reading this correctly? The answer to your question is \"I don't know\" the answer to that? Is that possible at this point? Did that really happen?"

It was after it was used. Now, granted they used it in a court proceeding, in a pleading, but they had not even taken the first step towards trying to verify that when we interviewed Andy McCabe. You know, Sean, I listened to your monologue, it wasn't just that we asked Susan Rice and Samantha Power and Ben Rhodes and Sally Yates, we didn't just say give us all the evidence of collusion coordination and conspiracy, I asked every one of them, even if it's hearsay, even if it's something you heard that you didn't believe, even if it's inadmissible in court, tell me everything you've ever heard about Trump, his campaign or even the groupies and the hangers-on in his campaign conspiring with Russia, there was nothing. So my expectations of Adam Schiff are very low. He still doesn't meet him but they're very low my invitations of the D.C. media was a little bit higher and they aided and abetted him for the entire year we conducted this investigation."

      "utterance": "All right. You did a great job behind the scenes as to Devin Nunes, and I don't -- I can't even name everybody. Trey Gowdy, thank you. We now turn our attention to Lieutenant General Michael Flynn lost only nearly four years of his life getting the vindication he deserves. When does he get the money for the house he had to sell back and when it is he get his good name back, because tonight, we're still waiting to see if a federal judge will sign off on the DOJ's rightful request to drop its case against Flynn, thanks to the Attorney General Barr, thanks to Rick Grenell, director of national intelligence. But let's be clear, General Flynn, a 33-year military veteran, as we have told you now for years on this show, he was set up. It was an ambush. It was a corrupt ambush by agents all because he was connected to Donald Trump. Before Trump entered the White House, the case against Flynn, it was done, it was closed. The FBI found no good derogatory material on Flynn, but then high-ranking officials at the FBI, Peter Strzok, James Comey and company, they decided on January fourth that they'll reopen the case. Whoopsy-daisy, we can go after him. The very next day, January 5th, well, 2017, in the Oval Office of Barack Hussein Obama with quid pro quo Joe there, Sally Yates there, clapper there, Brennan there, all of them according to Intel Committee testimony from Sally Yates, Obama pulled her , Comey aside after the meeting to discuss Lieutenant General Flynn, Yates describes how the president had intimate knowledge of the contents of General Flynn's wiretap calls which shocked the Deputy Attorney General Yates we now know that a few weeks after that meeting, that would be on January 20th. Susan Rice goes back into the Oval Office, memorializes the meeting and says, Barack said to do everything by the book. That's called the CYA where I grew up. January 24th, four days into the Trump presidency, there's Mr. Higher Loyalty himself, Jim Comey, super patriot, directing his agents to ambush Flynn at the White House. His deputy telling Flynn, you don't need a lawyer when he absolutely did need a lawyer and that's where we get the -- well, what's our goal here, admission or get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired? Four days into Trump's presidency. One agent involved, as I said, what is our goal? These questions should never be asked by anybody in the FBI. Andrew McCabe should have told them he needed an attorney, but following the ambush that he said -- Comey said we'd never do in a prior administration because he wouldn't get away with and wouldn't even try -- well, they still didn't think Flynn was lying. In fact, we now finally have, finally, an early draft of the first 302 that has been missing this whole time. It shows that Flynn didn't lie. Look at your screen. Thanks to Ric Grenell, thanks to the Attorney General Barr. That document dump yesterday, thousands of patients -- pages, we now know Flynn never denied talking to the individual as soon-to-be counterpart. As a side note, Susan Rice and Samantha Power said they did the same thing before they got into the Obama administration. But at the center of the FBI perjury case against Flynn, he said, I don't remember. Ultimately, the FBI relied on a subsequent, an adjusted 302 that was completely altered by Strzok and Page and they're bragging about it in the little text messages they have. This is gross misconduct, abuse of power, corruption at the highest levels of your government. This is the very definition of abuse of power. The mob, the media, willing accomplices as usual. They have an agenda. They are the PR. They are the socialist wing propaganda arm of the Democratic Party. They are state-run socialist TV and the New York toilet paper \"Times\", they lived up to their billing. They wanted Flynn locked up forever, and all because of his association with Donald Trump. You associated with Trump, you have no civil rights. And now, they are apoplectic that Flynn -- we're not going to run this now -- has been vindicated by the DOJ. How can anyone ever trust these mob members again? DNC, MSDNC, conspiracy TV, fake news CNN, the New York toilet paper \"Times\", Erik Pimple's Washington compost, he can't even get on the main page -- none of them give a crap about civil liberties, constitutional rights of Flynn, of Roger Stone, of Paul Manafort, of Donald Trump. They don't care. Papadopoulos, they don't care. Look at your screen. There are corrupt government officials -- look at them -- who could face really serious crimes because they finally got caught, they almost got away with all of it. No one in the media mob is pursuing justice they lied and got it wrong for three and a half years, we're not patting ourselves on the back. I wish I was wrong, frankly, for the sake of our kids and grandkids in our country, because they've shredded the Constitution the whole time. The only thing they seem to care about is bludgeoning Trump. They want an election to be won in 179 days.

I have to tell you, I taught a criminal law at Harvard Law School for 50 years. I taught 10,000 students. And for years, I taught that this kind of abuse by the Justice Department, by the FBI, by individuals -- look, the Justice Department is great, the FBI is great.

Both of those things have now been proven to be not true, and it seems that Gowdy's brilliant lawyering back in 2017 that we're only able to see now proves those two statements untrue. The number one question I get asked from Americans is, why no one has gone to jail and been held accountable?

Now, Sean, listen the golden axiom of politics right is the most damaging political stories are the one that change a pre-existing notion you had about a candidate. Honestly, Sean, I don't think this particular technical glitch hurts Biden one bit because the preexisting notion about Biden was he can't even turn on a computer. So nobody actually expects him to get this Zoom thing down or whatever. But having said that, on a very serious note, these Tara Reade allegations which are getting more substantial and appear to be more credible by the day, I don't know what happened. Joe Biden's entitled to the presumption of innocence, but there's certainly a lot of evidence building. This does change a pre-existing notion, Sean. He's running as the safe pick and the morally upstanding guy. And what do we know about him now? We know he's a liar. We know he's plagiarized speeches. He said he had three degrees he's graduated at the top of his class. The videos are everywhere and none of that is in fact true. Those are very damaging narratives which I think are going to take a toll on him."

They did a New York City flyover honoring front health care workers and frontline healthcare workers, tweeting out, nothing like a corporate PR campaign that burns jet fuel at low altitudes over vulnerable communities dying from a respiratory virus. Congressman, why don't you ask Nancy Pelosi how she goes back and forth from San Francisco, and whether or not she uses a private jet? Asked her that. Here with reaction, author of \"Don't Burn This Book\", Dave Rubin. Salem nationally syndicated radio host, Larry Elder. Mr. Rubin, really? Weed, booze and cigarettes?

I mean, I think San Francisco has got some sort of new economic thing working out right now. But the whole thing, of course, is nuts. Look, my good friend Larry Elder and I, we're here in Los Angeles. I mean, quite literally, I can't bring out bottle of wine to Larry's house and us have a drink, but were going to give booze and weed to homeless people? I'm not even against booze and weed, OK?

This is a town that gives -- a state that gives illegal aliens in-state tuition, something that your kid couldn't get if your kid got into UCLA or USC. So, why should anybody be surprised?

Now, no charges were filed by the Brunswick district attorney's office. He said he did not see grounds for an arrest. But earlier this week, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case over the case, and within 48 hours, a warrant was issued for the arrest.
