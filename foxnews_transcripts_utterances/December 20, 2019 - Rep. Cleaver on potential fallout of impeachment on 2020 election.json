      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto, anchor",
      "utterance": "All right. Plenty of drama on Wall Street, but it's really not responding in any way to the drama on Capitol Hill because we have an impeachment and kind of a limbo here, folks. The bottom line is, unless Nancy Pelosi formally passes along those impeachment directives to the Senate, you technically don't have impeachment. So, the big question then becomes, \"When do we have impeachment?\" Mike Emanuel on Capitol Hill with a high-stakes game of poker, it looks like, here, Mike. What's happening?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mike Emanuel",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Neil, no doubt about it. Good afternoon to you. Several senior White House officials were up here for a walkthrough for a potential Senate trial. And when they left a short time ago, Eric Ueland, the legislative affairs director, told reporters, \"President Trump wants the opportunity to present his case fairly and robustly.\" And he says that the White House is working very carefully with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans. Meanwhile, lawmakers are gone until the week of January 6th and a Senate impeachment trial is totally up in the air. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent the House of Representatives home for the holidays without sending those articles of impeachment over to the Senate. But a complicating factor for Pelosi and her team is Harvard Law Professor, Noah Feldman, who testified for Democrats in a House Judiciary impeachment hearing, tweeting, \"Trump isn't impeached until the House tells the Senate.\" Today, the ranking Republican on House Judiciary blasted the Speaker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doug Collins",
      "utterance": "Remember, her great statement was, \"This is going to be a conscience vote. Vote your conscience. We're doing this for the moral -- for the morals of our country and for the, you know, clear and present danger that this president creates.\" And now she's holding the documents? This is typical Speaker Pelosi. This is typical from what she's done from day one. She has no rudder, except one thing, get this president defeated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mike Emanuel",
      "utterance": "The top Senate leaders, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer, we are told, had a cordial conversation yesterday. But the majority leader says they are at an impasse. Democrats had all the power in the House. But in the Senate, Republicans are the majority, which could frustrate the Democrats."

      "speaker": "Jeanne Shaheen",
      "utterance": "It would be nice if it could actually be a bipartisan process. I think that's what the American public is looking for. They want answers to the questions. They want to see a process that they believe is fair. And I think the -- this kind of maneuvering just further raises questions in the public about what's happening in Congress."

      "speaker": "Mike Emanuel",

    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "-- very, very much. By the way, I mentioned at the outset, this was not a concern to anyone who is investing right now, today. I know I'm sounding like a broken record here, but the fact of the matter is the Dow hit another record today, the S&P hit another record today, the NASDAQ got another record today. So, Wall Street is concerned about this. As I so often say, it has a funny way of showing it. It is a nonevent to investors thinking it ends up that way, a nonevent. Are they right? Or, are they getting ahead of their proverbial financial skis? Attorney Lisa Kuharski is with us, and The Wall Street Journal's James Freeman. James, what do you think? The market's shrugging shoulders again at this; in fact, buying on it. What's going on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "James Freeman",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think the expectation is still that the president does not get removed from office. Maybe there won't even ever be a Senate vote, I guess, waiting to determine whether the articles ever go over. And I think it continues to be a rebuttal to the Pelosi claim that the president is tearing apart our rule of law and our Republic. Investors like to invest in places where there is sturdy, predictable rule of law. And that number on the screen tells you they still believe that's true about the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You know, help me with the mechanics of this, not the Wall Street part, Lisa, but just the legal part. Is that true that if those actions in the House are not forwarded to the Senate, you don't technically have an impeachment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Lisa Kuharski",
      "utterance": "Yeah, legally, you do not have an impeachment right now. It -- according to the article, the Senate must receive the articles to impeach and they, also, must receive the managers. Those will be the prosecutors at trial."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "But the time to get those articles, is there a timeline on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Lisa Kuharski",
      "utterance": "There is no timeline. This is the question. And that is because nobody has ever faced this question before. There have been --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "Well, this is the first time we've done impeachment in the House that has not been followed immediately with passing the baton to the Senate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Lisa Kuharski",
      "utterance": "Yes, and obviously --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "Nixon, of course, resigned before it got to that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Lisa Kuharski",
      "utterance": "Of course. And we all look at this, as Americans, people watching the impeachment process. And this was put forth as a crisis. So, certainly, we are expecting a sense of urgency, but we're not seeing it. The only thing that the Senate can do would be to amend those rules, which, quite frankly, I'm not sure if that would be the right thing to do to go forward. I think, now, people are saying, \"Trump needs an opportunity to defend himself.\" I think the Senate is going to support that. I think there starts to be a lot of pressure to deliver the articles. Quite frankly, I think it's, basically, you have to question now what the articles truly contain."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "So, are they physical pieces of paper, data, files that are given to the Senate that articulate the abuse of power, obstruction of justice? Is there more to this than I'm missing? Because it's been everywhere in the press."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Lisa Kuharski",
      "utterance": "There is a certain degree of formality. There are --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "All right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Lisa Kuharski",
      "utterance": "-- actual articles that are presented, and they are called managers. They are the lawyers that will go --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Lisa Kuharski",
      "utterance": "-- before the Senate. I mean, look, in the past, this was done very quickly because, obviously, the people want to see it completed. We are, also, in a 2020 year. You're talking about the markets. I mean, there's a lot of impact going on out there. And I think right now you're just seeing really, like, the circus continues. We're questioning, really, can they meet this, the -- can they meet the threshold that they've set for themselves when they get to the Senate floor? I wouldn't be surprised to see the Senate adjourn as soon as they do present the articles, if they wait too long, and an adjournment in the Senate when it comes to impeachment, that could actually be a dismissal, unlike an adjournment in a legal proceeding in a federal or state level."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "But, one way or the other, if it goes beyond the timeline that others had envisioned -- I don't know and I'm not here to debate whether that was Democrats or Republicans. I do know it could complicate a lot of other things people want to see done. Now, they've been walking and chewing gum at the same time, you know, by getting a spending bill done to avoid a government shutdown, dealing with the, you know, the Mexican-Canadian American trade deal, to get that wrapped up. But, then, you start backing up into time deadlines here, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "James Freeman",
      "utterance": "Yeah. The timing of this is -- this is interesting. Because I think there's a liberal fantasy that, perhaps, Nancy Pelosi could hold on to these charges until there's a new Senate. As you point out, unlike legislation, an impeachment --"

      "speaker": "Lisa Kuharski",

Now, we're going into legalese. And go into a 2020 year. Maybe they wait until a certain point in time, for election cycles. You know, there's a lot --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Lindsey Graham",
      "utterance": "The Constitution never envisioned the House being able to impeach the president and dictate the terms of the trial in the Senate and hold them back at a time of their choosing. That does create a constitutional extortion mechanism that's dangerous for the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "All right. Lindsey Graham convinced that this delay here is the equivalent constitutional extortion. There are many on both sides who fear he might be right if it drags out the process. The president has already indicated that he would like an opportunity for a trial and and witnesses and those from the Bidens and you name it, who could prove that this was all a cabal against him. As I said, for the financial community, this has been a nonevent. Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus joins us right now. His thoughts on how all of this is playing out. Always good to see you, Bernie. Thank you for coming in. What do you think? How is this playing out?"
    },

      "speaker": "Bernie Marcus",

And very frankly, I'd like a refund on my tax dollars right now after watching this going on for a week in the House and listening to the nonsense going on, one speech after the other. Nobody listening to anybody. It's a total waste of their time, and I think the American people have to start looking at this and saying, \"What is going on here? What was the whole purpose of this thing? It accomplished nothing.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "Do you think the fact that the support numbers for impeachment have been dropping steadily, slowly, but consistently, particularly in the battleground states that this is boomeranging?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bernie Marcus",
      "utterance": "Look, I hope so. I think the American people have to look at this again as a charade. It's politics at work, pure politics and not only that. Think about the damage that's been done to the president. I hope the American people understand that this whistleblower thing is going to go on for many, many years. I don't know how the next president comes in, whether a Democrat or Republican, is ever going to be able to speak freely on the phone because he doesn't know who is on the phone, who disagrees with him. And, you know, we're going to end up in an impeachment policy from here on in. So, it's going to hurt our foreign policy. It's going to hurt the presidency itself. It's going to have a ramification for America that we don't want to know about. And I'm talking about Democrats should understand what you've done. This is not good for America."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "Do you worry right now on that, regardless of how this plays out, you know, obviously, the financial community is interested in the big picture stuff, earnings, which are good, numbers, which are good, very strong retail sales, all of that housing that seems to be picking up depending on the day and the data and then that will dictate the course of events? None of this impeachment stuff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bernie Marcus",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, it is. And listening to the debate last night, Neil, you know, it's as though people are passing on a different plane in America. If you listen to them debating last night, the economy's in terrible shape. The fact is the economy's in great shape. They're talking about America losing out, American workers losing out. And yet all the policies that they want to continue or the policies they want to bring back are going to create jobs losses in America. And I don't get the whole thing is, oh, Zo, they're living in a world that doesn't exist. The facts are the economy is the best it's ever been in 50 years. The facts are more people are working than ever, ever in the United States and ever, the lowest unemployment rate for Blacks and Hispanics, and the general for small businesses, which are creating most of the jobs, and you know, Job Creators Network, which we helped to fund and start, is working with the small business people. They love what's happening. And yet, last night, they're talking about taking away those tax reforms. Why would you want to hurt the economy? Why would you want to hurt the very people that you claim you represent? It doesn't make sense to me, and I don't know. I don't know how -- where they're coming from, frankly. I really don't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "I do wonder, too, Bern, as well. I mean, there was a discussion of impeachment, which was fairly limited. I was surprised. It was more about more moderating proposals, moderating among a group of candidates who all want to raise taxes, do something I'm sure you're not keen on. But they have sort of recalibrated from the, you know, Medicare for All, all this big government stuff. They dialed it back a little bit. I don't know whether that is -concern that they got ahead of themselves or the fact that Elizabeth Warren started scaring people or the Boris Johnson thing in Britain. But it is clear to me that they're trying to pivot. What are we to make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bernard Marcus",
      "utterance": "I think you're probably right. I think that they are pivoting. You know, they're supposed to be out visiting with the American people. I think the American people are saying, \"What did you do? What did you accomplish? Have you solved the problem of immigration? Have you really solved the problem of medical care for all for people? Have you solved the problem of the budget, which is going to come back in another year and hit us again in the rear end?\". The fact is that they put their mind and they put their effort and energy all on something, and then they came up with weak excuses for impeaching the president. There's nothing criminal. I'm not a constitutional lawyer, I can't tell you about it. But from what I understand, most of the issues that came up at the past were criminal charges and there was nothing criminal charge of, \"I just hate Donald Trump. I don't like Donald Trump. I think Donald Trump is a terrible human being.\" And on that basis, you impeach him? Come on. This is America. He was voted into office. He is the president. Support him or just don't vote for him again. It's as simple as that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Neil Cavuto",
      "utterance": "So when you hear Joe Biden and some of these others talking about, you know, the jobs aren't what nearly the president says they are or that the quality isn't good and that people are, you know, between a rock and a hard place -- obviously, I understand the position of the opposition party when the economy seems so strong, but they seem to be advocating for more government to patch that, to fix that. Now, of course, you come from a position of just the opposite of that. But they're saying that, ironically, that capitalism has failed us. Do you think capitalism, the one that made you a millionaire and created this Home Depot empire, has failed us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bernard Marcus",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not [laughs] -- it not only made me a wealthy person. You know, we have over 400,000 people working for Home Depot. I would estimate that we had millions working for the Home Depot over -- since, you know, 1979 when we started the company. How many millionaires we created -- forget about myself -- how many millionaires we created of people who had high school educations, who never could have made any other way, who worked hard every day, and achieved things that --."

But 80 hours a week, week after week, stuck struggling to build this company up. The government didn't help me. I must tell you, the government did everything they could to stop me from being successful and to cancel all the people, you know, to hear this nonsense -- look at her. How much money is she worth today, and what the hell did she do to get that money? Did she work the way I worked? I doubt it very much."

And then they grow up and they start to learn to real life in the real life is that life it doesn't give you anything and nobody gives you anything. You have to earn it and work hard for it."

That was on his dime he made that possible and it's found its iconic destination worldwide. He made that possible. We'll have more after this, including Emanuel Cleaver, a top Democrat, who's also a minister by training. Who's kind of saying everyone take a chill pill he's next."

And I'm sure he's been urging for calm on both sides right now. You know, a lot more is getting done than was the case before congressman, you know, both sides, I guess, trying to prove that they can do lots of stuff at the same time. Are you concerned, though, that when all of this is done and settled, whenever Nancy Pelosi hands over these articles of impeachment, the Senate, whatever that process is, the Senate presumably, you know, doesn't, you know, impeach the president, then everyone has to move back to doing stuff together. Can you guys get to that stage?"

We have some bipartisan legislation that should be eventually taken up by the Senate and sent on to the president's desk. The impeachment thing, make no mistake, and with some of the members, some Democrats and some Republicans, it has been all consuming it's been a point of anger and hostility and so forth. But for many of us, we went -- we came we went to Washington to try to get something done for the country and for our communities, so we've been working together. For example, the bill that the White House is warning us about now, warning us not to push, which is sanctioning Russia for their meddling in our elections, that's bipartisan. Lindsey Graham is one of the sponsors of the legislation."

It's still close nationwide, but it's been dipping consistently, slowly but remarkably consistently, particularly in battleground states. Are you concerned that this is hurting your party? And this was one of the reasons why Nancy Pelosi and others was trying to say we're working on USMCA, we're not going to talk about impeaching, as she said yesterday, when prior to that, it was always impeachment.

Here's what I think is that nobody knows what's going to happen and nobody can figure out what's going on with the American public 70 percent, for example, say they want us to have the trial and they want the witnesses, the witnesses to come forward. I think we're frustrating the people in the country.

These were -- these were acts possibly intentional. We know of at least one case by the FBI lawyer who changed a fact, that that was an intentional act. And then, I also am reminded sort of -- one of the things when I became acting attorney general that I really tried to implement at DOJ, and that was to follow regular order, where investigations are handled at the appropriate levels, like they always are. And anytime the executives -- in the fifth floor at DOJ, or on the seventh floor at the FBI -- get involved in a meaningful way in investigations, they -- it always turns out to burn them in the end.

Well Congress is heading home for the holidays at an impasse on impeachment and President Trump is just a few hours away from leaving the White House, he's going to be going to Florida and we're hearing that he's experiencing a range of emotions after the week that he has had here in Washington. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he's mad as hell, while his daughter Ivanka says that he's really been energized by everything that's happened this week. But he's mad as hell, according to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, because of what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has decided to do. She has decided not to send those articles of impeachment over to the Senate. She says she's doing it because she wants to ensure a fair trial in the Senate, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says it is not up to her and President Trump he simply wants to get all of this over with. He wants the trial to start as soon as Congress gets back from winter break but, Neil, it will almost certainly be delayed days, weeks, perhaps even longer now Neil."
