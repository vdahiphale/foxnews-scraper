Biden, to them, is completely innocent. You're not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor investigating Hunter. They mentioned that numerous times. He's innocent. OK.

Because the Constitution clearly states, the House has the sole power to impeach. Not you guys in the Senate. It's not the role of the Senate to interview witnesses that Nadler and Schiff failed to subpoena. They impeached him. Now, House managers will present their case to you.

She didn't get that. Remember, just last year, claiming there needs to be a bipartisan initiative. Instead, what we saw over the past 100 days was purely a partisan scheme to negate the vote of over 62 million, bloodied up the president politically as he now moves towards reelection in 294 days. A political hatchet job. It stems from two very simple, basic facts. One, the left has not, cannot, will not ever accept the results of the 2016 election. Guess what? Two hundred ninety-four days, you get to shock the world again -- Democrats and the mob and the media. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And two, they are scared President Trump will destroy them in 2020. Imagine for a second, when -- if the news says on election night, or early the next day, we cannot project Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States, it's just worth the price of admission. Now, tonight, they have every reason to be worried. Far away from the D.C. swamp and the coastal elites, in New York, San Francisco -- San Francisco, L.A., and D.C., wow, we had a packed stadium last night, national championship game in New Orleans. President Trump, the first lady, they walked out -- wow, crowds cheering, loudly, chanting \"four more years,\" chanting \"USA\". if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Let's watch the powerful moment.

Every city, major metropolitan area either stay the same or got better. And as crazy as that sounds, it hasn't happened since 1992. The unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent.

No president has gone below 4 percent in the first three years other than Trump.

If you walk into the caucus and you're Klobuchar, who's at 8, or Yang at 3, or Steyer at 4, or Gabbard at 2, and your candidate is not getting 15 percent in that caucus, they say, OK, your candidate is out.

Eighteen percent for Buttigieg, 15 percent for Warren, and surprisingly, only 11 for Sanders. So, with these other candidates begin to fall by the wayside, it may give a modest boost to Biden.

We will take you there live throughout the hour. We'll bring you all the highlights coming up tonight. First, we do start with big breaking news in the swamp. Finally, Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only and the House Democrats have finally agreed to send over their B.S. articles of impeachment to the Senate tomorrow. Because Democrats know these articles are so laughably weak, they have now decided to include brand new, a trove of documents that were not presented during their Schiff sham impeachment proceeding. This 25th hour of desperation reeks of more pathetic Trump rage, psychosis and derangement. And get this -- all the new documents, they center around quid, pro, and quo and Joe and his son, zero experience Hunter, and the international pay- for-play scheme. Now, remember, I've always said that the president, any president, does have a sworn duty to faithfully execute the laws of the land. Please remember that little part. Put that in a compartment in your brain. But if you read these new findings, you will quickly see how politically skewed their new information, their trove of documents is. Now, look at this new material we're learning tonight. Biden, to them, is completely innocent. You're not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor investigating Hunter. They mentioned that numerous times. He's innocent. OK. I don't even think they believe that, to be honest. They call the accusations against him false, over and over and over again. They've exonerated Joe and Hunter. They definitively say the Ukrainian prosecutor named Shokin that Biden forced out, he was the corrupt one, all while totally omitting Joe Biden's bragging and public comments about shaking them down. Fire the guy, you get the billion. If you don't fire the guy, you don't get the billion. You got six hours. Son of a B. Take a look."

He had no relevant experience in Ukraine, oil, gas, whatsoever, none. So, did the Democrats, did they bother to look into why zero experience Hunter was getting rich, compliments of the shady Ukrainian company, all while his father was in charge of Ukraine policy for the Obama administration?

Answer, the only company that would pay millions and millions to somebody with zero experience is a company trying to corruptly buy influence -- and in this case, that would be his father, the second-highest ranking at the time, elected official in America. Quid, pro, quo and Joe bragging on tape, leveraging the billion, fire the prosecutor, you don't get the billion dollars -- our dollars, by the way -- and, of course, we know the zero experience was (ph) all there. Now, tonight, this new bogus evidence, last minute, brought to you by, who? The compromised, in this particular Ukrainian case, oh, and caught on tape, conspiring with real Russians to dig up dirt on Donald Trump to influence election -- the congenital liar himself, Adam Schiff. It came from him. The abusively biased, corrupt Schiff himself in an 11th hour Hail Mary pass. Now, you, Senate Republicans, don't buy into this charade. This is an assault on your body, an assault on our Constitution. Remember, you have the sole power -- it's right there in the Constitution -- you try all impeachments. It is not your role -- Constitution clear again -- to sort through and investigate and fix, and reinvestigate troves of documents the sloppy House Democrats neglected to include in their bogus articles of impeachment. Because the Constitution clearly states, the House has the sole power to impeach. Not you guys in the Senate. It's not the role of the Senate to interview witnesses that Nadler and Schiff failed to subpoena. They impeached him. Now, House managers will present their case to you. This is their case, this is their constitutional role. Remember, it was so urgent that they urgently did this just before Christmas, and urgently went on vacation. Senate tries the House articles before them and renders a verdict of the House articles of impeachment. That's it. That's your job. After stalling the so-called urgent process for nearly a month, as part of a bizarre strategy, trying to tell Mitch McConnell how to do his job and fulfill his constitutional role, finally, the process is moving forward, without any concessions from the Senate majority leader. Good for him. Pelosi, yes, looks stupid and delusional, as usual. And according to reports, the very angry Nancy is now telling her colleagues, Mitch McConnell might be a Russian op, because he wouldn't play nice with her insane demands."

In 294 days, we have another election, and based on these two articles of impeachment, ran through without any bipartisan support that she said any impeachment articles would need. She didn't get that. Remember, just last year, claiming there needs to be a bipartisan initiative. Instead, what we saw over the past 100 days was purely a partisan scheme to negate the vote of over 62 million, bloodied up the president politically as he now moves towards reelection in 294 days.

Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States, it's just worth the price of admission. Now, tonight, they have every reason to be worried.

Some of you weren't even born yet. Eight millions Americans now have been lifted off of food stamps, and we have nearly 8 million new jobs created, incomes rising all across the board. Now what has the Democratic Party done the last four years, to contribute to your prosperity, your safety, and your security, for you and your families? Well, I can report to you tonight, absolutely nothing. They have whined, they have complained, they have lied, they have schemed, they have pushed conspiracy theories and hoax, they smeared, besmirched, slandered, they obsessed over one conspiracy theory, then when it's wrong, they moved onto another one. Even made excuses for an evil Iranian regime. They want to go back driving those mullahs again with $150 billion, and call everyone who makes them mad a Russian asset. And, by the way, pretty pathetic for your track record of the Democratic Party. And come next week, they will reap what they sow. Hunter Biden now, by the way, could be called to testify in that Senate trial. We'll have more on that in a moment. Joining us first is House Judiciary Ranking member, Doug Collins. Congressman Collins, I think this about sums it up. And I read it, I'm like, oh, they have totally exonerated Joe and zero experience Hunter. Then they went after the prosecutor, who is investigating the company that was paying millions and millions to somebody with no experience. They condemned him. They said he is corrupt, not Joe who said, you're not getting the billion unless you fire the guy."

But remember, Lev Parnas is a convict -- is an indicted -- someone on campaign finance issues. Bill Barr and the Justice Department will handle this, but we don't let -- do not let them -- the Democrats -- try to deflect anything from the weak case that they are not going to send to the Senate tomorrow because this president did nothing wrong.

And then the president's team will able to give his defense, and they will show forcefully and they'll be able to take that and say, this is why this process was wrong, this is why the facts are wrong, and this is why this has been nothing but a hatchet job for over three years, and going back to November of 2016. What is so pathetic right now, Sean, is that we have done absolutely nothing in the House of Representatives for the last two weeks, and now, they have held these documents, trying to make a case, and now, they're trying to send them over at the last minute, tried to make these arguments that the Senate should be doing these different things.

Bloomberg just came out with a study that shows, since 1992, we haven't had a year like we did last year, where no metropolitan area declined. Every city, major metropolitan area either stay the same or got better. And as crazy as that sounds, it hasn't happened since 1992. The unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent. We had 155,000 jobs created last December, month over month. You have 3.9 percent economic -- I mean, unemployment rate over the course of his presidency. No president has gone below 4 percent in the first three years other than Trump. So the American people are feeling what a Trump presidency does for their lives, for their families, for their businesses, for their communities. And what's really interesting, Sean, is that when you look at the network coverage, right? And I know that you've been keeping up this and harping on it night after night. But when you look from September to January, there was less than 1 percent, to be -- it was 0.8 percent -- 9 minutes of airtime paid to the economy and trade. So, whether you're talking about the China trade deal, all these other deals that we've been talking about, the economy, all of the good news that's coming out, 9 minutes of network news between September 24th and January 20th. Mark that in contrast to the 900 minutes that had been spent on this impeachment.

I know, at one point, Sidney, before you became General Flynn's lawyer, you suggested this might come to this. I'm a little surprised that the judge's ruling in this case, for my understanding, I have a very good mutual friend of ours. I have a long list of Brady material that hasn't been handed over in my view, in my opinion. But here's the thing. We know that the special counsel, we know -- the inspector general found that James Comey lacked candor. That would be lying. We know the same thing was said about Andrew McCabe.

And with new counsel standing by his side, of course, there was no way I was going to let him do that, and he didn't want to do that. So we pushed back on that, with evidence that we presented to them for hours, showing them all kinds of different things that supported the fact that he was telling the truth. And instead, they've doubled down, came against him, trying to designate him a coconspirator even though they had told a judge in the Eastern District that he was not, they never thought he was.

I was like, all you have to do is listen to how former director, fired FBI Director James Comey laughed about how they took advantage of this administration. And one more point here, Sean.

If you walk into the caucus and you're Klobuchar, who's at 8, or Yang at 3, or Steyer at 4, or Gabbard at 2, and your candidate is not getting 15 percent in that caucus, they say, OK, your candidate is out. Who are you for now? So, this 26 percent could end up determining, based on where this happens, obviously, not every precinct, every precinct caucus is somebody, Amy Klobuchar got to be in 8, she may be above 15 percent among the -- in precincts along the border with Minnesota. But where that 26 percent breaks out is going to determine it. Right now, 19 percent of the people who are -- who are for somebody else say they are for Biden. Eighteen percent for Buttigieg, 15 percent for Warren, and surprisingly, only 11 for Sanders. So, with these other candidates begin to fall by the wayside, it may give a modest boost to Biden. But, you know, this is why it's so unpredictable, because it depends on, is it -- you know, West Des Moines or is it in Waterloo? Is it in the Western Prairies, or is it along the Mississippi River? It really depends on where it happens."

Tonight, Project Veritas, James O'Keefe, wow, releasing a new undercover video featuring a Bernie campaign field organizer. We reached out to the Sanders camping for comment. Shockingly, we have not heard back. Now, this is the video. You can watch for yourself."

But to tell you the truth, Sean, the undercover video from Project Veritas and the public statements by pundits like Alec Baldwin are pretty similar. There is a contempt for Trump supporters. It's not just that they don't like the president, detest the president, they think of his followers, the people who backed the president, as being people without souls, people without conscience, without compassion. They dismissed them all as racists. The stereotyping is so razor-sharp. This -- I can't believe -- like when Vince Vaughn got all this heat from Hollywood for just shaking the president's hand, there is this hatred that is so dismaying to me. I just -- I can't get my arms around it, it is so disappointing. You come out of the Trump supporter, you have to put on your bullet proof vest and your helmet and hunker down. The Bernie Sanders fellow just reveals, you know, what is the secret agenda, not-so-secret agenda of so many."

I say all the time, conservatives generally think liberals are people with really bad ideas. Liberals -- I'm not talking about Democrats -- radical leftist like the Sanders people, they think you're bad people with ideas. That's a totally different thing. The evidence, by the way, is everywhere. I will never forget reading an article by a woman who was a Democrat, an Obama supporter who went to CPAC, the Conservative Action Conference. And she wrote this article, she was so stunned how she was welcomed by everyone, and nobody attacked her. They invited her into some symposiums and stuff. Try that at an Antifa rally. You will need a Secret Service detail with you. It's the exact opposite. None of this -- none of the stuff in the video surprises me."
