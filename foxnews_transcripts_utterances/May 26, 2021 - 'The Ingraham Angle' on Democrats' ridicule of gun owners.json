Senators Tom Cotton, Lindsey Graham are here along with Newt Gingrich announcement there and Candace Owens. Plus, why some people will not get rid of their mess, no matter what, and Arroyo drops his mask in a big way. Raymond Arroyo has that in seen and unseen. But first, redefining and disarming America. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, the hardcore left that now basically owns the Democrat Party has been hard at work for decades, the redefining terms, concepts in historical events, all for one purpose, to redefine what America itself means and also to take away our freedoms. Thus, basic terms of, for instance, biology are redefined. The factual classifications of male and female are continually expanded beyond sex to include dozens of gender categories all without regard to science.",

Now, it's obvious that this guy who is representing Joe Biden's views, does not believe in the Second Amendment and does not believe that Americans should be trusted with guns. Period. We know what this means, what it's going to look like, right? Only criminals will have guns and innocent people will be at risk. Now all over the country, left-wing cities are being destroyed right now by crime. New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Minneapolis, California has among the toughest gun laws in the nation. The assault weapons ban that Chipman wants and yet a deranged man still shot and killed eight people there today in San Jose. So the left's position on guns is not only unconstitutional, it's utter madness, especially when combined with their hatred of the police. So wherever the left ends up gaining power, criminals end up being emboldened and good people find themselves in more danger. It's tragic that so many people in our cities have fallen prey to the left's lies, and they blame their problems on the honest gun owners of this country. We have to keep doing everything we can to alert the good people of crime-ridden cities who live there, that there is a better way. But in the meantime, the GOP and every sane Democrat must steadfastly resist any effort to promote the left's pro-crime agenda. The positions they're taking are contrary to our Constitution, they're immoral and they're insane. No matter what Democrats say, no matter how they try to manipulate language and hide the truth, we all have to recognize the reality. They want to take all privately-owned guns in the country and prevent Americans from owning guns ever again. That's their true position as it has been since the 1960s, and we have to resist it with everything we've got. Because once our freedoms are lost, they're very difficult to regain. And that's THE ANGLE. All right. Joining me now is one of those you saw press Chipman, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. Senator, conservatives get mocked when they claim that the left wants a massive gun grab in the United States. But I think this testimony today showed us that's exactly where we are.",

And the reason he can't answer it is, there is no such thing as an assault weapon. It's a term that's made up by liberal lawyers and pollsters in Washington who are trying to scare Americans into acquiescing into gun confiscation. He did, however, in the exchange at one moment, say something very illuminating and very troubling. He said that he would define it maybe as any rifle with a detachable magazine that has a .22 round or larger. Laura, that would be almost every modern sporting rifle in America.

And these are issues where the left is totally opposed. School choice, for example, is a 72 or 74 percent positive with both Black and Latino families, who realize that the current school system simply isn't serving them. You have a number of other places. And after all this talk about racism and racial division by '91 to '05, the American people prefer Reverend Martin Luther King's proposition that he cared about the content of your character, not the color of your skin. As like '91 to '05, you find that in terms of dismissing this corrupt politicians' bill and insisting that you know who is voting that you can identify them is (inaudible) that's what an 88 percent issue. And I think that part of the problem is Republicans don't appreciate the power of describing a better future, not just attacking the sick present. And so, I think there are things we could do that the ones you mentioned are exactly in the right direction. Biden wants to raise taxes, 75 percent American people want to lower taxes. Now, you can't sustain. I mean, if we're competent, if we learn the arguments, if we are prepared to be disciplined, if we continually focus on the future, we're going to build an American majority that is bigger than the Republican Party and we're going to shrink the radicals to about 15 or 16 percent.

We live in a country that is largely biracial. Could you imagine what it's like for me who has a biracial child who is being told that your child is going to be literally taught in the school system that they are either half oppressed or have privileged? There's no space for these people. I believe that you are correct, Laura, when you say that this is where we hit, education. We need to stop the conversation -- yes, it's important, the lower tax argument, but it's not the argument that's hitting home when you talk about what's happening inside the school systems. Everybody cares about their children. They understand what's going on. This pick your gender, the transgender that is going on, and most important and most potently telling children that they need to see race everywhere at the same time, you are not telling them to focus on hard academics. We are not teaching engineering and math anymore. We are teaching Critical Race Theory.

So it really just led to more devastation for black people. Some of us had the courage to call this out early on. People are now seeing what this means. Less policing doesn't mean that nothing is going to happen in the neighborhood, there's not going to be police. What it means is that the gangs are going to rise up and take the place of police officers. We've seen this story in America before. And I personally think that if Republicans don't have the courage to call this stuff out, one of the biggest issues that we are facing right now is Republicans are scared to be called racist.

Now, it's obvious that this guy who is representing Joe Biden's views, does not believe in the Second Amendment and does not believe that Americans should be trusted with guns. Period. We know what this means, what it's going to look like, right? Only criminals will have guns and innocent people will be at risk. Now all over the country, left-wing cities are being destroyed right now by crime. New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Minneapolis, California has among the toughest gun laws in the nation. The assault weapons ban that Chipman wants and yet a deranged man still shot and killed eight people there today in San Jose. So the left's position on guns is not only unconstitutional, it's utter madness, especially when combined with their hatred of the police. So wherever the left ends up gaining power, criminals end up being emboldened and good people find themselves in more danger. It's tragic that so many people in our cities have fallen prey to the left's lies, and they blame their problems on the honest gun owners of this country. We have to keep doing everything we can to alert the good people of crime-ridden cities who live there, that there is a better way. But in the meantime, the GOP and every sane Democrat must steadfastly resist any effort to promote the left's pro-crime agenda. The positions they're taking are contrary to our Constitution, they're immoral and they're insane. No matter what Democrats say, no matter how they try to manipulate language and hide the truth, we all have to recognize the reality. They want to take all privately-owned guns in the country and prevent Americans from owning guns ever again. That's their true position as it has been since the 1960s, and we have to resist it with everything we've got. Because once our freedoms are lost, they're very difficult to regain. And that's THE ANGLE. All right. Joining me now is one of those you saw press Chipman, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. Senator, conservatives get mocked when they claim that the left wants a massive gun grab in the United States. But I think this testimony today showed us that's exactly where we are."

And the reason he can't answer it is, there is no such thing as an assault weapon. It's a term that's made up by liberal lawyers and pollsters in Washington who are trying to scare Americans into acquiescing into gun confiscation. He did, however, in the exchange at one moment, say something very illuminating and very troubling. He said that he would define it maybe as any rifle with a detachable magazine that has a .22 round or larger. Laura, that would be almost every modern sporting rifle in America.

We should respect them, we should esteem them, we should support their work, we should give them more training, more resources, however. When seconds count, the police are only minutes away.

We've gotten good feedback actually. We got some people who are sending in their concerns. I just want to say again tonight, if you're out there anywhere around the world, and you're worried that you're not focused on training, to fight and win our country's wars, but rather to be indoctrinated along the lines that the Democrats are proposing and Congress so often, please contact my office, so we can actually do something about it in the Congress."

See, end all COVID restrictions that remain, forget the mask mandates, stop the out of control spending, keep taxes low, get rid of critical race theory, support law enforcement, secure the border. Well, sounds a lot like the new \"Contract with America\" that Donald Trump is working on with my next guest, former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich. He added another pillar to \"Politico\". He said, \"It should be positive school choice, teaching American history for real, abolishing the \"1619 Project\", eliminating critical race theory. We should say, bring it on.\" Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, joins me now. Newt, why is now that time to resurrect the blueprint - an idea of a blueprint that you launched nearly 30 years ago? It's hard to believe."

      "speaker": "NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER",
      "utterance": "I know. It is hard to believe. Well, look, I think that the radical left has given us an enormous gift. Working with a number of pollsters, we found out that, in fact, John McLaughlin, in particular, there are over 30 issues where 75 or 85 percent of the American people agree. And these are issues where the left is totally opposed. School choice, for example, is a 72 or 74 percent positive with both Black and Latino families, who realize that the current school system simply isn't serving them. You have a number of other places. And after all this talk about racism and racial division by '91 to '05, the American people prefer Reverend Martin Luther King's proposition that he cared about the content of your character, not the color of your skin. As like '91 to '05, you find that in terms of dismissing this corrupt politicians' bill and insisting that you know who is voting that you can identify them is (inaudible) that's what an 88 percent issue. And I think that part of the problem is Republicans don't appreciate the power of describing a better future, not just attacking the sick present. And so, I think there are things we could do that the ones you mentioned are exactly in the right direction. Biden wants to raise taxes, 75 percent American people want to lower taxes. Now, you can't sustain. I mean, if we're competent, if we learn the arguments, if we are prepared to be disciplined, if we continually focus on the future, we're going to build an American majority that is bigger than the Republican Party and we're going to shrink the radicals to about 15 or 16 percent. That's what Margaret Thatcher did, that's what Ronald Reagan did."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

What is happening in our public and private schools in the teaching of history and the obsession with race in all subject matter from that summer reading lists of schools to the curriculum in the fall? This is populated by garbage and contemporary literature, which is poorly written and poorly conceived. And it teaches our kids to dislike each other not to come together, but to dislike each other and distrust each other. You're on to some. I think, I'm telling you so many mothers are coming up to me today, complaining about this very thing, today."

Look, I think in places, for example, like Fairfax County, which is supposedly a very good county, you go around the county and you ask parents, how they feel about dumbing down education, how they feel about bringing in racism? We've got to be straight, and we've got to be as clear and as strong in our language as the radical left is. The radical left is the most racist group in America. And we need to say that and take it head on, and we need to not be intimidated by the elite media, who are all sucked into this baloney. And, frankly, are increasingly out of touch with the American people. And the American people talk to themselves and they build an understanding, and there is, I think, a hurricane coming. Anti-left wing, anti radical, anti racist views, where people are just going to say nonsense, either close the schools, fire the people, break up the teachers union, but get rid of all of this effort to brainwash our children, and for that matter, to brainwash the military, to brainwash corporate executives.

And by the way to Newt's point, now one of the reasons the new \"Contract with America\" could pay dividends for the GOP is because the absolute insanity, of course, that we just described from the left. And case in point, just days ago, Brandeis University's assistant dean Kate Slater, who is white went on an Instagram screed writing, \"Yes, all White people are racist in that all White people have been conditioned in a society where one's racial identity determines life experiences, outcomes, and Whiteness is the norm and the default. That includes me!\" Oh, she was quick to clarify, however, that she doesn't hate White people, just Whiteness.

Now, Candace, this Lamont Hill's of the world are propelling, I think the GOP to massive victory if they play their cards right in 2022. This is insanity. CANDACE OWENS, \"CANDACE\" HOST: Yes, I mean, it's alarming, first and foremost, because he is a tenured professor. I think that that needs to be spelled out. This is a tenured professor that is saying this. And I want to say that Newt is correct in saying that we have to use stronger terms here. We need to tell the truth. The left right now is segregationist, we need to start saying that over and over again. They are the party of segregation. That is what they are calling for. They are obsessed with race, they want your children to know that they are either oppressed or they are privileged. And by the way, talk about people to appeal to. We live in a country that is largely biracial. Could you imagine what it's like for me who has a biracial child who is being told that your child is going to be literally taught in the school system that they are either half oppressed or have privileged? There's no space for these people. I believe that you are correct, Laura, when you say that this is where we hit, education. We need to stop the conversation -- yes, it's important, the lower tax argument, but it's not the argument that's hitting home when you talk about what's happening inside the school systems. Everybody cares about their children. They understand what's going on. This pick your gender, the transgender that is going on, and most important and most potently telling children that they need to see race everywhere at the same time, you are not telling them to focus on hard academics. We are not teaching engineering and math anymore. We are teaching Critical Race Theory. That is the most important element, and that is because what they want to do is water down the education system to produce dumber kids, because dumber kids means that you can almost guarantee they're going to become servants to the government. They will end up on welfare because they have no practical skills."

      "utterance": "Now, another data point, Candace, ahead of 2022, Americans are increasingly turning on Black Lives Matter because the movement's favorability rating is down from 61 percent right after the Floyd killing to just 48 percent today.

    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. Black Lives Matter is an organization that has led to more black death. They said that it was done in the name -- these riots and these protests -- in the name of George Floyd with a long criminal record. And what actually ended up happening was that black neighborhoods burned, black men and black women were killed during these riots, and black people were arrested. So it really just led to more devastation for black people. Some of us had the courage to call this out early on. People are now seeing what this means. Less policing doesn't mean that nothing is going to happen in the neighborhood, there's not going to be police. What it means is that the gangs are going to rise up and take the place of police officers. We've seen this story in America before. And I personally think that if Republicans don't have the courage to call this stuff out, one of the biggest issues that we are facing right now is Republicans are scared to be called racist. Stop being fearful to be called racist when you are not racist, and you are looking at the person that is actually a racist and is a segregationist, and that is the left, that is Democrat Party, and that is how Republicans win going forward, because people are seeing exactly was going on."

Like I said, we need to start talking specifically about the segregationist policies that the left is attempting to implement amongst children. Children of the united issue.

      "utterance": "Joining me now are two parents fighting against CRT in their schools, Ian Prior, executive director of Fight for our Schools, and Nicki Neily, president and founder of Parents Defending Education. Ian, let's start with you. You spoke at that news conference. So what happened after the BLM crew -- it wasn't all that big, but they showed up. What happened?"

      "speaker": "IAN PRIOR, RIGHT FOR OUR SCHOOLS",
      "utterance": "Yes, there were about four of them, local BLM activists. We actually refer to them as chardonnay Antifa out there. But right when we were about to start our press conference, you had these folks come in with their banner and actually physically occupy the space that we had set up in order to conduct the press conference. And then when the parents -- and these parents are dedicated parents that have been working every day, all day to go out there and get petitions to recall the school board. And when they started speaking, these folks, they didn't want to hear from them. All they wanted to do is disrupt, continually interrupt, harass them and call them racist. Eventually we were able to get the press conference going, and then when we were done, with the exception of one individual, all the rest of them just left. They didn't take the time to talk to the press, they didn't take the time to put their views out there. All they want to do is disrupt and silence the opposition, as they say."

      "utterance": "We would be all over the mainstream media, for starters, which strangely -- it's where to find \"The Washington Post\" and a lot of these other D.C.-based outlets not covering this. It's just a total mystery to me."

      "utterance": "Well, Democrat candidates for Virginia lieutenant governor debated last night, and they did touch on Critical Race Theory, specifically your county. Sean Perryman said \"critical Race Theory is not even being taught in our schools. It's a Republican dog whistle, meaning racist, \"where anything they disagree with is Critical Race Theory.\" Ian, is that true? They claim it's not even present, it's not even a factor."

      "speaker": "PRIOR",
      "utterance": "That's absolutely nonsense. We have actually invoices from the Equity Collaborative in California to Loudoun County public schools in Virginia where they say teaching teachers and coaching teachers on Critical Race Theory."

      "utterance": "They talk about culturally responsive learning. You don't have to spend too much time on a Google screen to put \"culturally responsive learning\" in and \"Critical Race Theory\" to understand that culturally responsive learning is the educational tool to implement Critical Race Theory concepts. They are trying to gaslight people. They realized that they are on the losing end of this debate, and they are trying to explain. And you know what the saying is, when you're explaining, you're losing. And we are certainly feeling momentum out in Loudoun County. We've got hundreds of parents that are committed to recalling this school board and giving kids an education in things like math, science, reading, typical things that you want your kids to learn to be able to succeed in life."

      "utterance": "Nicki, \"Washington Post\" columnist Christine Emba, she's out there defending Critical Race Theory, saying \"Calls for racial accountability can feel like an attack when you're not ready to acknowledge how your behavior or that of your ancestors has harmed others.\" So Nicki, that's what our children, apparently, should be steeped in is -- especially if they came from other countries, which many of the families from Loudoun County are from other countries. Nothing to do with slavery, nothing to do with -- they weren't even in this country, but they are supposed to be steeped in all of this to learn what, that America is an awful, rotten, racist country. How is that educating our kids?"

      "speaker": "NEILY",
      "utterance": "Of course, we are supposed to be paying for the sins of our fathers. My grandparents were put into an internment camp, yet I'm not chasing after a bunch white people because we can't keep blaming everybody else. Certainly, we can teach American history better, but we should not be trying to shame and degrade children, particularly at a time when mental health in children who have been out of school in many parts of the country for coming on 15 months at this point, to tell them that they are bad people because of the color of their skin, because of immutable characteristics. It's sick, it's emotional abuse, and that's where we see people around the country standing up, just like Ian is doing, just like other people around the rest of the country --"

It takes courage, and your being on the show tonight and your doing what you're doing every day on this issue, you're inspiring people across the country, and this movement is growing, and we are going to keep covering it. Thank you for doing what you're doing. And the A.P. lying about January 6th. What about January 6th? I'm going to explain it in moments."

      "utterance": "Last month President Biden described the January 6th riot as the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Well, the Associated Press now going even further, calling at the worst attack on the capital in more than 200 years. Really? What about when Marxist terrorists detonated a bomb inside the capital in 71, or that 54 shooting of five members of Congress by Puerto Rican nationalists? January 6th was terrible, and criminals have been apprehended, but let's not delude ourselves and think it was on par with actual terrorist attacks. We know what they're doing with that term.
