Fact is, the one thing Americans care least about besides the voting bill is what Putin is doing.

But the press is more disconnected from American concerns than Pelosi is from the dollar store. Meanwhile, walking Loony Bin Jen Rubin gave Joe an A-minus which makes sense if the A stands for ambulatory. I wonder what else you'd given A-minus too. Shingles? The Olive Garden's hotdog Bolognese?

When you get to be Joe Biden you stopped sweating the small stuff, like putting your shoes on the right feet. Problem is he sees everything as small stuff, notably your concerns and your pain.

Fact is, the one thing Americans care least about besides the voting bill is what Putin is doing.

But the press is more disconnected from American concerns than Pelosi is from the dollar store. Meanwhile, walking Loony Bin Jen Rubin gave Joe an A-minus which makes sense if the A stands for ambulatory. I wonder what else you'd given A-minus too. Shingles? The Olive Garden's hotdog Bolognese?

Hillary post 2016 who blamed her drubbing on every Russian since Yakov Smirnoff? Where the hell is he? Of course the press shares the blame. Again, nothing about crime as people get picked off left and right by Mad Men.

After all, he's doing a great job. And if you just don't get it, you're probably a racist. Bottom line. When you get to be Joe Biden you stopped sweating the small stuff, like putting your shoes on the right feet. Problem is he sees everything as small stuff, notably your concerns and your pain.

So like my request for an autographed photo of Stuart Varney, Totenberg, O for three. But as to be expected, liberal media picked up the original fake news story and ran with it. But like Brian Stelter jogging, they didn't get very far. The story quickly came apart like a Pamela Anderson marriage.

So, I started calling my sources over there like, okay, straight up, did the Chief Justice tell the other justices, they need to be wearing masks and then there was a refusal, and then Justice Sotomayor found out, she was upset, she ran off and I was told, no point of that story is true.

That mullet was so bad Billy Ray Cyrus offered him a ride to Supercuts. But all of the embarrassing stories I've heard launching a music career that makes you hundreds of millions of dollars is hardly the most devastating. Plus, isn't he kind of insulting me, as a fan?

The house built in 1851 by the aptly named Fowel family features a bathroom with four toilets next to each other without partitions. But it's like Michael Moore always said, it's good to have three backup toilets. Meanwhile, whoever wrote that, I love you. A couple in Italy, settled a 19- year legal battle regarding their neighbors flushing the toilet at night that was waking them up. The court decided the flushing decrease their quality of life and ordered the water tank removed. They ruled it was a human rights violation. The court also had neighbors switch to low fiber naki, noki? I ruined that one. Finally, the story isn't about poo, just food that looks like it. Chris Vangelo, a New York dad shared pictures of his son school lunch, which appears to include food that looks like something that would come out of your terrier. The superintendent says it's all about our limitations. But it's the limitation that the food must look like crap because that does. And that ends our very first and maybe our last."
