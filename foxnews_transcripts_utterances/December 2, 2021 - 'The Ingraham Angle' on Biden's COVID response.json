In June of 2010 Maynor was charged with robbery and struck a plea deal for a lesser offense. Six months later he was arrested for assault. Prosecutors dropped the case for insufficient evidence. Two years later the D.A.'s office again declined to prosecute a burglary case. Two years after that Maynor was finally convicted of felony robbery and sentenced to five years. He served four, and when he got out, he was almost immediately arrested again for felony robbery. And under California's then three strikes law, he should have been sentenced to nine years and would still be in prison. Instead, he got four years and ended up serving even less. Laura?",

And while he didn't shut down the economy, well, his reckless agenda has flattened the curve on wage and GDP growth. Inflation soaring, that's eating up wages, the price of gas, food, housing, it's all climbing. And millions of Americans are out of the labor force because of vaccine mandates or fat unemployment checks.

And no one is going to convince me that Youngkin's victory in Virginia wasn't impart a rejection of school closures and mask mandates. People are over both. Of course, the Biden White House refuses to see that they have a substantive problem on their hands at all. They think they can spin and spend their way out of bad poll numbers. Yet even after Biden signed that so-called infrastructure bill in the law, his polls and we predicted this, sunk to another new low today. A morning console survey has Biden at an abysmal 45 percent. Now, it seems that every time we report on another dismal Biden benchmark, the White House decides to send him out to deliver remarks that are both deadly boring and inconsequential.

But that's not all. Of course, Europe is quickly becoming its own COVID police state. Just yesterday, the Austrian government approved and extended 20-day nationwide lockdown, because they worked so well the first time. Now, this comes after they announced compulsory vaccinations for all. Meanwhile, Germany is imposing its own strict lockdown for the unvaccinated, and leadership there wants universal mandatory vaccinations. Now, with its dark history, Germany's tactics would make the old fascist proud. And don't think for a second that whoever is winding up Biden every morning, wouldn't do the same here with all these controls, if they could. But thankfully, America has a constitution that protects individual liberty. We have states that value freedom over false promises of safety. And we have federal judges who are one by one halting Biden's vaccine mandates. Yet another court challenge was announced today by Oklahoma's governor on behalf of members of the National Guard there, who are objecting to the vaccine order for the U.S. military. And in New Jersey, state legislators today did their own part in defying an order requiring that they show proof of negative COVID test, or proof of vaccination. A number of them ended up walking right past state troopers into the House chamber. The officers eventually let them through, although we hear that the assembly Democrats are still trying to figure out ways to physically remove these Republicans, prevent them from voting. But the GOP is on a roll there, almost winning the governorship in New Jersey. And remember, they flipped seven seats in the New Jersey legislature. It was their most successful state legislative election in three decades. New Jersey Republicans need to keep fighting. Most Americans need to be conscientious objectors and just say no, we need more of you. And congressional Republicans, right now they need to make it crystal clear that they will use every legal means at their disposal to stop any future domestic controls on the unvaccinated. No travel bans, no vaccine passports, no more mask mandates. Any such executive orders coming out of the White House are illegal and unconstitutional. And we believe the court will rule as such. They should fight these stupid mandates for masks on planes as well, forcing these little toddlers to wear masks. It's total child abuse. The order is always and was ineffective and idiotic. So, of course, Biden extended it today until the spring. Now, but as I've said since the spring of 2020, if left up to the Democrats and the media, we are never going to be free of masks and rolling lockdowns. No matter how many Americans are vaccinated or already have had COVID."

All 50 Democrats, including Manchin and Sinema voted to essentially fire frontline workers, military personnel, et cetera. So how can they look at their constituents in the eye after this vote today, given what it does to the regular working class people and military folks that we need so desperately?"

And it's threatening right now to fire 45 million American workers. We needed to have a vote on whether to decide to fund that feature of government that's going to enforce this mandate. Every Senator needed to put his or her name on the line. Tonight, they have that opportunity to do so. I'm glad I stood with the workers of Utah and of America.

Why? Well, because the government says, you have to get it. If the government has so little confidence in their ability to make clear that people ought to get this, that they have to force it on people or fire them, it's going to cause a lot of people understandably to say, maybe this isn't such a good thing. In fact, it's a reaction I hear about from a lot of people in any event, regardless of whether it's good or bad, regardless, even if you could demonstrate, which you can't, that this is somehow having some positive physical impact on American health.

I also mandate with regard to Medicare, dealing with facilities. And then, of course, the big OSHA ruling. And all of those courts said that they don't see at the preliminary injunction stage, the clear authority for the government to do what it did. In fact, the Fifth Circuit cited a Biden's own chief of staff Ron Klain, who really was - really ill advised when he cited the - or retweeted a statement that this was all a workaround. That it has acknowledged that they didn't have the constitutional authority to do this directly. And so, Klain retweeted that we found a workaround. Well, the Fifth Circuit cited that courts don't take to workarounds in the Constitution. They like to see direct authority. And many of the problems that they've encountered has been an effort to avoid, notice and comment. They used an emergency provision under OSHA that allowed them to skip that. Another court found that to be also a problem in another mandate. So there's a host of issues here that courts are flagging. And they're really racking up quite a litany of losses."

This is an extra constitutional move in some regards. Keep in mind that with the CDC eviction moratorium in another area, the President acknowledged that he was told by his own White House counsel that that moratorium was likely unconstitutional. He acknowledged that most legal experts that they spoke to said, that was unconstitutional. They could only find one apparently, Lawrence Tribe, who gave it a green light. And he said, you know what, we're going to go forward because by the time it takes them to strike this down, we'll get a lot of money out of the door. Well, the courts made fast work of it. But there's this reckless attitude of the administration towards some of this litigation. These losses cost the executive branch. They're creating precedent, not just against this president, but future president."

This is the American way of life and masks and mandates are never going away until we have a change in leadership. ALEX BERENSON, \"PANDEMIA\" AUTHOR: I think that might be true. Certainly, there's no scientific rationale for at this point even distinguishing between vaccinated and unvaccinated people in terms of their ability to transmit this. We know vaccinated people can be walking around with very high loads of virus just like unvaccinated people. And in writing Pandemia, I got to see all the lies and all the misstatements from Fauci and other public health people for the last two years. And I understand better now, why everyone is so cynical. Everyone who's been paying attention is so cynical about everything that comes out of this man's mouth, and Rochelle Walensky, and everybody else who's telling us what to do.

In June of 2010 Maynor was charged with robbery and struck a plea deal for a lesser offense. Six months later he was arrested for assault. Prosecutors dropped the case for insufficient evidence. Two years later the D.A.'s office again declined to prosecute a burglary case. Two years after that Maynor was finally convicted of felony robbery and sentenced to five years. He served four, and when he got out, he was almost immediately arrested again for felony robbery.

Our next guest saw Harris up close as a resident of California, and she was A.G. of course there, until he fled last year. Adam Carolla is a comedian and host of the brand-new show \"Truth Yeller,\" and podcaster extraordinaire. Adam, I want to get your new special in a moment, but first, what is up with Kamala? ADAM CAROLLA, HOST OF \"TRUTH YELLER\": Well, if you are going to be a politician or a used car salesman, you either have to be good or likable, and Kamala is zero for two. She is the least charismatic person on the planet, and I don't think she's very bright. This is Biden's fault, obviously. If he's going to do an affirmative action hire for the vice president of the United States, you sort of get what you got. He said it. I want a woman of color. He got a woman of color. He should have found a good woman of color. He didn't get that. And now we are all stuck with her."

      "utterance": "Adam, I know you are a big fan of Newsom, especially when it comes to his handling of COVID. Now \"The Daily Mail\" is reporting that just days after extending the state of emergency in California, he jetted off to a Mexican resort town for Thanksgiving and stayed in a $25,000 per night villa that's owned by Russian oligarch. Adam, are you surprised?"

      "speaker": "CAROLLA",
      "utterance": "No. I have a saying. It's called disappointers never disappoint, and that is all Gavin Newsom does is disappoint. But he's very consistent in his disappointments. The thing about Newsom, so I don't know if you know this, but Thanksgiving Day, there was no power at my house or my sister's house on Thanksgiving, not because there was a fire, but because the electrical grid was so weak they had to shut it down so it wouldn't cause a fire. So Gavin Newsom is hobnobbing in Mexico, and we are high and dry in a blackout in southern California. And by the way, when Larry Elder ran against him, Larry Elder ran on getting the power grid back up and running. And all Gavin Newsom did was focus on race. And the people of California are so stupid that they vote for the guy who never stops talking about racism, meanwhile the power grid is falling apart."

      "speaker": "JAY LENO, COMEDIAN",
      "utterance": "This is the biggest audience for last year. You couldn't go to bars, you couldn't go to restaurants. You had to keep six feet away from women. It's like every guy, they lived like Harvey Weinstein. I see Dr. Fauci every night on the news, and he says the same thing, coronavirus is a war, we've got to fight it like a war. And when you think about it, it's the only war in history that when the war is over, all the soldiers are fatter."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Adam, I watched that, and I thought, man, not only do we miss Jay Leno every night on television, but there was a reason he was the last one to get really big late night ratings on the major networks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAROLLA",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. And it's great to be doing standup specials on \"The Daily Wire.\" Hollywood is Hollywood, Netflix is Netflix, HBO is HBO, but they didn't count on these other entities popping up and creating a home for voices like myself. And God bless guys like Jay Leno for putting friendship over partisan politics and coming on and cracking wise with me and the audience. So there are two that are up now. We've got four more to do."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAROLLA",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. These specials are not political at all. They are just funny. But in a way, maybe just being funny is political in 2021, because somehow you have to denounce the right in order to get more applause than you do laughter. I think comedians are going for applause more than laughter now, and that is a big mistake."
