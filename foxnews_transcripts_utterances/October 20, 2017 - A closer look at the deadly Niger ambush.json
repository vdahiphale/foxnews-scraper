But I think this entire story shows they might be on the run, but they are running to other areas, and so all of these missions are really important. And they continue to be."

She credits Republicans for it. So I don't know where he got that from. I think he misremembered it, and I think the White House should have owned up to that. His performance yesterday was admirable. But I think it muddied the waters making that specific accusation against this congresswoman which really is an unnecessary fight for them to have."

I heard one report today show said that the developments of Niger were overshadowed by this controversy, over Kelly's remarks. Why were they? That's an editorial judgment. I personally think the issues in Niger are really important. To elaborate on what you said, we are definitely heading for congressional hearings about something like this, and that is a bigger story."
