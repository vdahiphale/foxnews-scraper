There's a truth in what he says there. He's troubled by Barr going against the narrative that they said. They put a lot of work into a narrative, that's being blown up just by people saying obvious facts such as that there was spying and that we should make sure that we don't do this against domestic political opponents.

And Dr. Drew Pinsky is here on the college scam scandal. Now - the admission scandal. Is the celebrity sorrow real or they just acting?

Raymond Arroyo is here with all the details. But first, intimidation by imbeciles, that's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” For more than a year now, we have been documenting how the Democrats, working in tandem, with far-Left smear squads, have said about to stifle conservative speech. Now these folks think of themselves as rough-and- tumble kind of football players, but they're ultimately blinded by the bright lights. Through campaigns a full outrage that stoked on social media, they whip up their frenzied followers and then that justifies their trampling on the free speech rights of others, everybody's all upset.

And it's even happening to children who step out of line.

Former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is another target. Yesterday Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted favorably in response to a Leftist who wants to punish Nielsen even if she returns to private life. So apparently it wasn't enough to harass people at their homes and in restaurants, now far-Left activists launched petition drives to prevent these former Trump staffers from earning a living after their government service - nice! Now what these activists are saying is this. The price of working for Trump is, you are now and forever unclean and untouchable.

CNN's Manu Raju commenting, \"Barr's comments here bound to please Trump\". The Washington Post Aaron Blake tweeting, \"The use of spying, it's obviously a loaded term, and one Trump favors\".

He's just saying the facts as they are known. And contrary to what we just heard, there's no dispute about whether there was spying or not. That is the common way to describe what happened. They used multiple human informants. There were wiretaps, there was other electronic surveillance. There were National Security Letters. If it were about anything other than the Trump campaign, we would all acknowledge that spying. And that is a very good word to use to sum up what was going on there. The media can't use that word, because they were complicit in this operation in two ways. One, they perpetuated the Russia collusion hoax. They accepted these leaks. They were not critical about them at all. They claimed they had all these bombshells. So on one side they extended the hoax."

      "utterance": "Yes, Brennan separately briefed Harry Reid from the rest of the gang of eight. And Harry Reid said that he understood he was getting this separate briefing. So he could publicize the Russia investigation during the 2016 campaign. People who care about election meddling should care about that story. We haven't really even begun to investigate how Brennan, how Clapper, how other Intel Chiefs were involved in this narrative, not just during the election, but then of course throughout the first two years of the administration. There's a truth in what he says there. He's troubled by Barr going against the narrative that they said. They put a lot of work into a narrative, that's being blown up just by people saying obvious facts such as that there was spying and that we should make sure that we don't do this against domestic political opponents. So I get the feeling Barr is sort of the adult who came in and said, \"Okay, you've had your games. We're going to try and restore the credibility of the FBI and Department of Justice now\"."

I touched upon the illiteracy rates, 75 percent of black boys in California not being able to read is a problem in black America. White nationalism, when black on black crime 90.1 percent of all homicides against black Americans are performed by other black Americans. The entire hearing in my opinion was a hoax.

She's just again assumed that all Democrats are hoping that black people fail. On her on her interview with C-Span she says that the word nationalism has been compromised or poisoned by elitist. Tell that to the people in Charlottesville. She did try to put herself in the same category of Donald Trump talking about the false narrative. But the part that was so insulting, which she's promoting your employer and said that she went to Jerusalem and not a single Democrat went there. Ms. Owens let me tell you, 72 percent of Jewish Americans voted for Democrats. So you did a great job of promoting yourself and playing the victim. And by the way, it's not just black people were not stupid by what you said, Americans were not stupid, because I listened to everything you just said, and I hope you can challenge what I said about the number of blacks - number of Jews who support Democrats. But you did a good job of marketing yourself today, putting yourself in the same boat as the President. Good job Candice."

The legal -- the prosecutors clearly are going to keep piling on one thing after another until she is forced to settle, so why not settle, take responsibility for what she has done, and do your time and get through this, because there is no way to avoid the consequences, it seems to me."

So look, in terms of her regaining her life and being able to have a career again, she's got to admit fault, move forward, take the consequences. And as you know, Laura, we live in a world where people love to act out. You and I, it seems I'm talking about narcissism every time I come on your show. Here I am again, here I am again, talking about the phenomenon of malignant envy. Malignant envy rules the land. People cannot stand somebody else having more or different or making them feel diminished in some way. It's one thing to feel jealous of another person, right? We feel jealous, and we go, oh, I like what that person has, I want to try to attain what they have. It makes me feel a little bit bad. But envy is the that person has something I don't, I need to bring them down to my size. I don't know what happened to this country, where, if you remember, every religious notion includes the idea of avoiding the sin of envy. Envy is a destructive emotion. And narcissists are prone to it, and once they develop envy and narcissism, they are prone to mob action. And now we have created the perfect public square for that with social media, and people like this are getting acted out on all the time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I think part of it might be that when people reach this level of fame, especially in the entertainment industry, and probably this industry too, it's like we are all susceptible to it, is that you do lose perspective. There is a sense of perspective on things, and maybe you even start believing your own narrative. Maybe Loughlin believes her own narrative, and Huffman is like, whoa, I've got to get out of this, I've got to get out of this mess. And the redemption stories is always something people like to grab onto."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PINSKI",
      "utterance": "We do like redemption because we feel guilty for acting out our malignant envy, right? We act out on people until they are destroyed, we feel bad about it, and then we don't mind the redemption afterwards. But you are absolutely right, this whole phenomenon seems to be about losing perspective. Listen, I just had kids applying to college and graduate school recently. You get desperate. And then they go to an advisor, somebody they pay a lot of money to who says everyone does this, you should do this, no big deal. You believe them, and pretty soon you're doing things you can't imagine you would have done."

When Pete Buttigieg announced publicly that he was gay in 2015, Mike Pence said he was a fine public servant and a good man. And the way he gets paid back is to be accused of hypocrisy and phoniness. And Laura, he said this on another network. The mayor said that Mike Pence, and I quote, stopped believing in scripture when he started believing in Trump.

If you point the finger at 60 million evangelicals and 25 million faithful, frequently mass attending Catholics, and say your faith is a fraud, and you are a hypocrite, that is not how you win friends and influence people and politics.
