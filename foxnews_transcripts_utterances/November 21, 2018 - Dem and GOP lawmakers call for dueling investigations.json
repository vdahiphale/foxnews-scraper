Now, local and media reports have identified this American as John Allen Chau. We're told he went to India on a tourist visa. And last week, he paid several local fishermen to take him to this area that is part of the extremely remote end of Minh Island archipelago. Once he got close to the island, he hopped into a kayak and moved closer to shore. Now, the fishermen told Indian police later that Chau was met by several members of this tribe. He offered them gifts, including a football, but then was shot at with bows and arrows by this group described online as the most dangerous tribe in the world. He escaped the first time, swam back to the fishermen, but Chau apparently returned the next day and the fishermen later saw the tribesmen dragging his body along the beach. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, officials from India check on the locals from time to time, usually with a military helicopter.

Tonight, the State Department has not yet officially confirmed the death of John Chau. He's been reported as being either 26 or 27. They're simply saying they're aware of these reports and are working with local authorities to try to get to the bottom of it. But, it's interesting.

Amtrak is reporting a train stuck near Albany, New York due to major engine problems in - in the sense that the engine appears to have left the train behind.

But first, that migrant Caravan looming on the U.S.-Mexico border, 3,000 people are encamped in Tijuana. And the federal government says they could grow to a mass of 10,000 or more. A representative of the group, Angels Without Borders, say the migrants are considering something truly unbelievable, a human stampede, across the Southern border of the United States. Meanwhile, a new Gallup poll shows that the percentage of Americans who view immigration as the country's top issue is surging rapidly. 21 percent of Americans say immigration is the top issue compared to 13 percent just a month ago. Kris Kobach is Secretary of State for Kansas. He joins us now. Kris, what exactly is the difference between what they're planning, which is this human stampede and, what we used to call in the old days, an invasion."

And Mark, one of the things that I think we need to consider right now is something that Congress wisely put in the federal law back in 1996. It's not too often you use the word wisely when talking about Congress. But they actually planned ahead. And they said, in federal statute, if ever there is a mass influx of aliens at our border, the President has the authority, the Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to call up state and local police to help repel this invasion or this influx. And, right now, that's necessary because ICE agents and Border Patrol agents whom I've spoken to say they are overwhelmed. They don't have the manpower right now, and they need it, and they need it quick."

I guarantee that if President Trump made a national - national appeal to Sheriff's departments across the country to say, \"Can you come help us? We need the manpower. We'll reimburse your deputies for their time. Can you help us to repel this mass influx of people who are planning to rush our border?\" I guarantee that there will be hundreds of Deputies, hundreds of Sheriff's departments saying, \"Yes, we will help.\" So, I think the time is now to use this power that has been given to the Executive Branch."

That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\" The President hit back on Twitter this afternoon saying, \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \"Obama judges,\" and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an \"independent judiciary,\" but if it is, why are so many opposing views (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned? Please study the numbers, they are shocking. We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!\" Jonathan Turley is a professor at George Washington University Law School. He joins us.

I mean he feels that his mandate is to stand up for the judiciary. I don't think that the President was fair about the - this criticism. The decision that - that he was referencing would have come out the same way, in my view, for both Republican and Democratic nominees. John Roberts himself voted to - to preserve the individual mandate of Obamacare. I disagreed with his decision there. I thought that the reasoning was wrong. But I also understood that he was following what he thought was the dictates of the law, not the person who nominated him. Now, where I - where I probably would criticize the Chief Justice a little bit is that I wish that he was more active in policing the court itself.

They will, at some point, disagree on - on a philosophical basis how to view the Constitution. In the vast majority of cases, there isn't that much disagreement. Most cases are unanimous even despite who people were appointed.

Not many. In fact, I'm going to go ahead and say none. You know, I'm in Northern Indiana. And I can guarantee you that the people in Fort Wayne, places like Huntington, aren't concerned with Ivanka's emails.

And I think what you have seen certainly in 2016 and a degree here in the last few weeks is people walking in to the - to the voting booth and using their middle finger to vote, and saying, \"Enough. Let's get back to the business of governing.\" And I think most people are so frustrated by the back-and-forth of not solving problems. Again, Huntington, I'll give you a great example. The - the Carrier Company shut down and has laid off a whole bunch of folks. Are they caring about Ivanka's emails? No, they're not. They want good jobs. They want to solve this - this global trade issue where every things get shipped off to - to Mexico or to China. That's the stuff that people care about, good healthcare. So, if people don't get the results they want, either from this last election where Democrats won or - or President Trump in his promises in 2016, parties are going to pay for it.

And it's a particularly cynical ploy. The signature gatherers, who are the people here, in this case, they can get up to $12 a signature for signatures on petitions, which is what was happening here. And yet, they're paying these poor bums on Skid Row a buck or a cigarette in order to get them to forge signatures. So, if you see this arrest happening in L.A. County, a Liberal county, you know for sure that it's happening all over the State of California. And it's just one of many examples I could give you of voter fraud happening in California."

In the year 2016 to 2017, in California, almost half a million people called for jury duty said they were not United States citizens. And now, that's very telling because the jury - because those - those rolls come from the voter registration. So, you're talking about massive fraud here and, frankly, a - a combination of Democratic Secretaries of State who have no interest in purging the rolls contribute to this like in California. In some states, like Georgia, you have Secretaries of State who are following the law and purging the rolls and so you have better outcomes there, despite what - what the gubernatorial candidate there said. And so, what Republicans need to do in the next election cycle is really be vigilant about this issue, and all Americans should be vigilant, because in any state people voting who don't have a right to or people signing papers who don't have a right to dilute the vote of every citizen, which is a very fundamental right to us in our country.

The Department of Justice has an Election Division and they should actually be taking a look at this issue and bringing some federal indictments because, like I said, Skid Row, this is just one incident, and if you scratch the surface you're going to find a lot more, and it's - it's huge."

It's playing out on North Sentinel Island in the Bay of Bengal, about the size of Manhattan, home to the Sentinelese tribe which is small, about a dozen people, but they're fierce and resist any contact at all with the outside world. Now, local and media reports have identified this American as John Allen Chau. We're told he went to India on a tourist visa. And last week, he paid several local fishermen to take him to this area that is part of the extremely remote end of Minh Island archipelago. Once he got close to the island, he hopped into a kayak and moved closer to shore. Now, the fishermen told Indian police later that Chau was met by several members of this tribe. He offered them gifts, including a football, but then was shot at with bows and arrows by this group described online as the most dangerous tribe in the world. He escaped the first time, swam back to the fishermen, but Chau apparently returned the next day and the fishermen later saw the tribesmen dragging his body along the beach. Now, officials from India check on the locals from time to time, usually with a military helicopter. For example, that happened, as you see here, after the Indian Ocean tsunami in '04. Even then, members of the tribe reportedly fired arrows at the helicopter when they thought it got too close to them. Tonight, the State Department has not yet officially confirmed the death of John Chau. He's been reported as being either 26 or 27. They're simply saying they're aware of these reports and are working with local authorities to try to get to the bottom of it. But, it's interesting. These local people are protected under Indian law. And basically, any contact with them is considered illegal because of the risk of disease. So, getting justice for this American's death could get very complicated from a diplomatic standpoint, Mark."

      "utterance": "It's the day before Thanksgiving, and a record-setting number of Americans are traveling to spend time with family. AAA estimates that 54 million Americans will be traveling at least 50 miles from home this holiday season. That's the most since 2005. More than 30 million Americans are expected to travel by plane around the holiday. That's a new record. And right now, there's breaking news of a big problem on the rails. Amtrak is reporting a train stuck near Albany, New York due to major engine problems in - in the sense that the engine appears to have left the train behind. And passengers are tweeting from the train. A rescue engine has been sent to pick up the passengers. But if you were looking forward to turkey and you have to make do with the last curling sandwich from the Club Car, it's no fun. A snowy and very cold Thanksgiving, very chilly, expected in the Northeast, and not just because your Liberal aunt still wants to talk about how Hillary was cheated, But Parade organizers hope to get the Macy's balloons off the ground in New York tomorrow for the 92nd Annual Macy's Parade with 16 balloons and 26 floats and more than 3 million spectators expected to brave the cold. There's lots to be thankful for. I'm thankful for the great Judge Jeanine right now. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
