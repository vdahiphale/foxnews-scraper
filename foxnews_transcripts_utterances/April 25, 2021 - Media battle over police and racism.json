And the third is that we still have the convenience of living life. I don't think many people want to go back to getting rid of air-conditioning, but we could do that. In fact, here's one way we could get to solar and wind immediately, get rid of all closed dryers and go back to clothes lines in the backyard like I had when I was a kid. That was solar and wind.

That was very hurtful.

Mollie, a colleague of yours at The Federalist wrote it's extremely hard to believe the jury was solely concerned with either truth or justice. This is the sort of conservative media critique that the jury was pressured into this verdict. But how does that square with the video and the other evidence that people on both sides seem to believe showed pretty clearly that Derek Chauvin was guilty?"

I think a lot of people, most people, the vast majority of people, look at that video and they weigh the evidence and they do think that the guilty verdict is a more than reasonable and fair verdict. It is different than saying that that is a free and fair trial. And we do need to care so much about whether -- whether people who are accused get free and fair trials. That's something that is the bedrock of civilization. There was a local broadcast media outlet in Minnesota that I thought did a great job. They interviewed what turned out to be an alternate juror. She didn't know she would be an alternate until the very end."

She was worried about people targeting her home. That's what we're talking about. That does not produce a free and fair trial even when you agree with the outcome of this particular trial. You don't want to create a system where people feel like pressuring people through riots and mob action is OK. It's not OK. It's the end of civilization. It has nothing to do with this particular verdict, but what we think about jury trials and the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven."

She said if Chauvin gets off, the protesters would need to be more confrontational, which a lot of people thought was a code word.

I didn't -- I didn't appreciate the word become, you know, more confrontational and the word was confrontational. But I also didn't appreciate the judge singling her out because, you know, across media, you had people on both the left and the right weighing in on this, you had other politicians weighing in on this, and they may not have used the word confrontational, but to me, I kind of started to have an idea of the political leanings of that judge.

Seems this was a big issue for the media in part because Joe Biden has been so far to the left on so many issues. This was the first time that he hadn't joined with this propaganda media in being so far in the left. He was keeping the refugee limit the same as Trump. That's the only way that they can be critical of him. We've seen it in their press conferences. We've seen it in their coverage. They are sycophantic and effusive in praising him unless he isn't on one issue being as far to the left as they are. And of course, they got him to heel by badgering him. But we need a media that actually thinks about the rest of the country and how the rest of the country is concerned about a border that is spiralling out of control, about facilities that are at 1,700 percent capacity with children urinating into bags because they can't have access to restrooms.

You had AOC and others on the left and not just the far left, but even moderates, you know, at the border calling him out on what they felt was a hypocritical stance on the children and how they were being not just taken care of, but where they were being taken care of at the border. But I want to respond to bowing to liberal pressure. If you remember in the campaign repeatedly, the president said that he was going to lift the refugee number to 125,000. He said that repeatedly, OK? Then he reduced it to 62,500. Then he reduced it to 15,000. Now, it is going to be 62,500 again. So if he bowed to the liberal pressure, if he bowed to the far-left faction of my party, well, then they pretty much failed because the number he originally quoted has practically been cut in half."

Well, Washington Post reporting, Mollie, Biden overruled his secretary of state, Tony Blinken, despite a personal appeal based on his own family's history as refugees and called this a botched policy rollout.

There is a little bit of interesting, you know, what's happening at the White House, but it seems like probably what the Biden administration is doing, is trying to avoid responsibility for the fact that the problems at the border are a direct result of the rhetoric and policies of the Biden administration. The problems began with Biden saying he wouldn't enforce border security. And this is a -- this is -- there's so much more interesting stuff for the media to be talking about than who's leaking. They spent the entire campaign claiming that Joe Biden would be a moderate and a unifier and that he was necessary because of how divisive the Trump administration had been. We're not even a hundred days into this, and this has been just an unbelievable left lurch for this administration that the media claimed would be moderate. Every leftist policy idea being put forward even though there's a tie in the Senate, six-vote majority in the House, and the presidential election came down to 42,000 votes in three states."

One thing is the supply is slowing down in some parts of the country which makes it more difficult to get appointments. Another big factor I would say is probably the way the government handled the J&J vaccine. A lot of folks, millions of folks have gotten -- 6.8 million as a matter of fact have gotten one dose, they are covered, and they're good to go. Six people got blood clots, women. And I'm not minimizing what they went through, but to all of a sudden slam the brakes on the J&J vaccine, now many Americans are probably looking at the J&J vaccine saying, well, I don't want that one. I'll wait for Pfizer or Moderna. And so that may also slow down the rate of vaccination which is part of the problem."

And so I think you have to look closely at what your messaging is about what the incentive is of getting the vaccination. If it's you're going to get your life back, you're going to be able to do what you want to do, then I think a lot of people will probably jump in and say, that's great, or to protect people around me, great.

There's been a lot of emotional hype that is been injected into this. The truth is we are getting better, America is the greenest it's ever been, and we're getting there, quite frankly, pretty rapidly.

Number two, it's going to be the economics of it so that it's efficient without breaking the banks of every family and busting their budgets. And the third is that we still have the convenience of living life. I don't think many people want to go back to getting rid of air-conditioning, but we could do that. In fact, here's one way we could get to solar and wind immediately, get rid of all closed dryers and go back to clothes lines in the backyard like I had when I was a kid. That was solar and wind.

But there's a couple of things that I think would really help. Number one it would help is, if the Biden administration would acknowledge President Trump's role in Operation Warp Speed to get the vaccine. Number two, I wish they would repent of some of the things they said just before the election when both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris said they might not take a vaccine that was associated with Donald Trump. That was very hurtful. And then they got to have a new message rather than take the vaccine but then don't go anywhere, don't do anything, wear a mask all over your face, keep the face diapered for the next 10 years, and you tell people that, what's the point of the vaccine if I've still got to lock down and not even have more than four people in my backyard for a hot dog dinner?"

      "utterance": "I want to take a moment to talk about the 25th anniversary today of Fox News Sunday. Congratulations to Chris Wallace. He's really become synonymous with asking tough questions of both sides. So many highlights were shown on the program. And we had some cake here at the Washington bureau for Chris, I'm on kind of a sugar high because I had too much cake. After the break, the teenage girl whose video was the centerpiece of the George Floyd murder trial and a controversial police shooting in Columbus. That's next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ (on camera)",
      "utterance": "New York Times, The Washington Post and other media outlets have been praising a teenage girl as the heroine of the George Floyd trial. Darnella Frazier took out her phone and recorded Derek Chauvin's assault on Floyd and later testified that he could have been any of her Black relatives or friends."
    },

      "speaker": "DARNELLA FRAZIER, WITNESS",

      "speaker": "KURTZ (on camera)",
      "utterance": "Joining us now, Harold Ford, the former Democratic Congressman and now a Fox News contributor. Harold, Daniela -- Darnell Frazier told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the world needed to see what I was seeing. Stuff like this happens in silence too many times. If she hadn't shot that video and put it on Facebook, would Derek Chauvin have even been charged, let alone convicted of murder?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAROLD FORD, JR., FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "You know, thanks for having me on and for the congratulations. I think the fact that we're even asking that question suggests that the answer could be he may not have been charged, and he certainly may not have been convicted. I believe the verdict was the right verdict. And I think it's now time for the political bodies and particularly the president and some in the Senate, Democrat, Republican to come together and try to find some bipartisan solution around police training and police accountability. It seems like the elements are there. If you believe our polling this morning from Fox and even from some other outlets, the president did get some high marks in some places, and I think it's now time to travel down a path as quickly as he can to try to find bipartisan support. Police accountability would be one and infrastructure would hopefully be two. But without that video, I think it's very likely we would not be sitting here today with a conviction of a police officer who killed someone in the street."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And here's why I think you're right. The Minneapolis Police Department put out a release before the video surface, saying that a man in custody died after a medical incident during police interaction. Now weapons were used. Police noticed his medical distress and took him to the hospital. Didn't even used his name. That was a lie and perhaps that lie would have stood. But what do you think of the argument being made by some conservative commentators that the jurors felt pressured into convicting the former police officer because they were concerned that there would be protests and riots and violence from the left if he got off?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FORD",
      "utterance": "You know, I don't buy the argument and, frankly, I'm a little bewildered and find confusing why people who say they're of goodwill and good intention would make that argument. The video was so overwhelming. Then the trial took place, and we all as Americans had a right to reach an opinion on it including politicians. President Trump certainly shared his views when he was president. Politicians today in office do the same. I think the evidence is what convicted Derek Chauvin, plain and simple."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me talk about this situation in Columbus. There's been a lot of media attention to a Columbus officer fatally shooting a 16-year-old girl, Ma'Khia Bryant. Terrible tragedy. But body cam footage shows seems to support the police account, that she was attacking another girl with a knife, the officer said four times to get down. There's a neighbor's security camera that shows her, Bryant saying to the other girl I'm going to stab the f out of you. Was there a media rush to judgment that the officer in this case had done something terrible before we had all the facts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FORD",
      "utterance": "There looks like it. You know, this video here, this is all the video there is, it's certainly strongly suggests that the officer made a decision that could be justified. We'll wait for all the facts to come out, but I think your question really yells at when people make comments about things before all the facts are in, once those facts are in, we should all do the responsible thing and either retract, recant or explain, or if it turns out to be the right, reinforce your position. There's nothing wrong being wrong. What's wrong being wrong is when you don't acknowledge it. And this video here suggests that maybe, maybe there was a rush, and anyone that rushed to the wrong judgment, at least at the outset, should be willing to come forward and say, look, we didn't know all the facts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, I couldn't agree more. I think because this happened so soon after the verdict or around the same time, and it kind of fit the narrative, there was an effort to paint this police officer as some kind of a hothead or racist when, in fact, he was trying to save another life. And you know, our police officers have to make these split-second judgments. Let me also ask you about the treatment of journalists because after another shooting, that of Daunte Wright, there were nightly demonstrations in Minnesota, and some of the stuff that happened, a Black New York Times photographer says police forced him out of his car, beat his legs and struck his camera. A CNN producer was thrown to the ground, arrested, strip searched and asked -- she's Asian-American -- do you speak English. A federal judge step in issued a restraining order against further arrests and assaults. I'm surprised this hasn't gotten more attention even though it obviously is being overshadowed now by the Chauvin conviction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FORD",
      "utterance": "Look, none of this is -- none of this is should -- none of this is anything anyone should support. We should not want anyone, police officers behaving towards any citizens this way and certainly not the press when they're doing their jobs. Look, again, I think this is why this moment, this administration, this president, I think is uniquely situated to bring sides together to figure out how we bring about some calm and how we bring about some accountability that is measured and that is right. We can't forget Derek Chauvin did a terrible thing, an awful act. He just happened to be a police officer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FORD",

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ (on camera)",
      "utterance": "But now Politico has decided to swear off the c word as well. In a memo reported by the Washington Examiner, staffers were told avoid referring to the president's -- present situation as a crisis. Although we may quote, \"others using that language while providing context. While the sharp increase in arrival of unaccompanied minors is a problem for border officials a political challenge for the Biden administration and a dire situation for many migrants who make the journey, it does not fit the dictionary definition of a crisis.\" A Politico spokeswoman is quoted as saying employees were just being given A.P.-style guidance. Though crisis did make it into one column headline. But with 14,000 unaccompanied minors having crossed the border, come on. Can you imagine that the Trump White House insisted some out of control disaster was not a crisis that news outlets would salute and go along? LeBron James committed a hard foul and a dumb one in the case of that Columbus police officer who fatally shot 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant while she was attacking another girl with a knife. The L.A. Lakers though he could score points by tweeting a picture of the officer with the words you're next, hash tag accountability. After being denounced for potentially encouraging violence against the cop, James deleted the tweet saying he's tired of seeing Black people killed by the police and it's not about this one officer except LeBron made it about this one officer who was trying to save another girl's life. One America News fired a producer Marty Golingan the day after the New York Post -- New York Times, excuse me, publish his on the record criticism of his network. He said the majority of people at the network did not believe the voter fraud claims being run on the air and that the news director had reprimanded him for referring to Joe Biden as President Biden. Golingan must have decided this would enable him to make a high-profile exit. Now the Times said 16 out of the 18 current and former OAN newsroom staffers interviewed said the channel had aired reports they believed to be misleading or untrue. Charles Herring, president of OAN's parent company said the network uses a review process with multiple checks and its investigation showed that voting irregularities took place last year. The question is to what extent. Finally, NBC anchor Kristen Welker was keeping a secret back when she moderated the second Trump/Biden debate. And she just broke it on The Today show."
