      "sentences": "So, everybody, mystery has always surrounded the Mike Flynn story, in one way or other. Right? The president's former national security advisor who was a big supporter from early on in the campaign, many are in the camp that believes he was wronged in this investigation. Others say he should've never been hired by the White House in the first place. And tonight, who is this mystery person, supposedly linked to the White House or the Congress that supposedly reached out to the former lieutenant general trying to influence his testimony to the Mueller team? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A lot of questions tonight. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” So, first of all, whoever this person is, they apparently left some evidence in the form of at least one voicemail.

A little notice section of the Mueller report reveals that intelligence officials who are under investigation themselves at this point had their eyes on Flynn earlier than anybody thought. So, what does that mean for this whole investigation? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They did that based on his \"relationship with the Russian government.\" The president had this to say about that. \"It now seems that General Flynn was under investigation long before it was common knowledge. It would have been impossible for me to know this. But in that, if that was the case, and with me being one of the two people who could become president, why was I not told so that I could make a change?\" He writes.

      "utterance": "So, everybody, mystery has always surrounded the Mike Flynn story, in one way or other. Right? The president's former national security advisor who was a big supporter from early on in the campaign, many are in the camp that believes he was wronged in this investigation. Others say he should've never been hired by the White House in the first place. And tonight, who is this mystery person, supposedly linked to the White House or the Congress that supposedly reached out to the former lieutenant general trying to influence his testimony to the Mueller team? A lot of questions tonight. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” So, first of all, whoever this person is, they apparently left some evidence in the form of at least one voicemail. According to newly report -- newly released court documents. And Flynn is back in the spotlight tonight for another reason. A little notice section of the Mueller report reveals that intelligence officials who are under investigation themselves at this point had their eyes on Flynn earlier than anybody thought. So, what does that mean for this whole investigation? They did that based on his \"relationship with the Russian government.\" The president had this to say about that. \"It now seems that General Flynn was under investigation long before it was common knowledge. It would have been impossible for me to know this. But in that, if that was the case, and with me being one of the two people who could become president, why was I not told so that I could make a change?\" He writes. But critics do say that the president was warned in some shape or form in 2017 by his predecessor."

And he stood by the president shoulder-to-shoulder, talking about national security, helping guide the campaign, and articulating a national security policy, and advising the president. And the president was loyal to him. He had headed the Department of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was highly qualified, a three-star general.

After President Obama and every Democrat had accused the president of all sorts of things during the campaign trail, he makes a comment apparently in passing during a meeting that they had. We had plenty of opportunities to be briefed, they had all the intelligence chief come up and briefed us on January 6th. Why didn't someone pull him aside then? Why didn't one of the intelligence chief say, Mr. President, I need to speak with you briefly, privately, as they did on other matters? Why did President Obama not follow up with one of his intelligence chiefs? He had made it clear, Obama had fired Flynn. He was clearly not a fan of him. But if it was this big deal --"

The attorney general was absolutely right. We need to figure out what's going on. If people are all concerned about whether a foreign entity tipped the scale in our election, and we had a -- extensive report on that, we should be equally concerned as he said about government officials trying to tip the scale.

So, I was a huge supporter, I'm not huge, but a consistent supporter of the Mueller investigation. We needed to know whether there was collusion, we needed to know what the Russian's did. But there's an entire other side of this controversy that has not been explored and examined properly. That's exactly what's happening now, and I support that as well."

Ask why they didn't tell Donald Trump that's having been said, Donald Trump knew his son, and son-in-law and campaign chairman met with Russians to get dirt. Well, we don't know that he knew it, but we know that they did to try to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. And we know that his campaign chairman met with Russian spies to give the most secret polling data. So, this -- let's correct the record. Mueller did not say there was no collusion."

Then you move on to the -- you know, the other side of the equation. And that's where we come into this other visit this other potential audio tape of Mike Flynn. Guy, you know, I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that revelation."

That did not happen based on the report. We now know that, that issue should be closed and settled. As for Flynn, I don't think it's an either or Martha. Going back to one of your original questions to Sean Spicer, you know, was Flynn screwed over in this investigation, or should he have never been hired in the first place? It is possible that both of those things are true. I think it was a mistake to hire him not just because of his Russia ties, but he had some very sketchy stuff going on with the Turkish government, and other issues that I think we're potentially compromising. It was probably a mistake -- a certainly a mistake to hire him. In the first place, he was then fired for lying to the vice president. And it is still also conceivable that he got some raw deal over the course of the investigation. We don't know that yet. But it's not necessarily mutually exclusive. It could be both."

But he said, you know, \"What we need to do is calm down and listen to the actual words that the A.G. is saying, and once we do, it's much less alarming.\" Do you think that some have overreacted to Bill Barr, given what we saw in the interview that he did with Bill Hemmer?"

      "utterance": "Andrew Napolitano who appears on this network regularly, he thinks that Bill Barr spoke dishonestly to Congress when he was asked in the House by Congressman Chris, \"Did -- were you aware of concerns?\" And he said, no. And then, he kind of hemming heart. When he was asked by Kamala Harris, \"Did the White House try to suggest that to doing investigations?\" And he ended up saying, \"No, I don't know.\" And so, you know, is that perjury? No. Is it a straight fault? Is what an attorney general, what we expect of him? I don't think it's that either. So, I think he's right. We should calm down."

Now they changed their views, but my question is was Barack Obama homophobic prior to 2012 when he finally decided he was for same-sex marriage? Mike Pence is not disrespectful of Mayor Pete but he's true to his convictions as an evangelical Bible-believing Christian. That doesn't make him homophobic. It means that he's faithful to something that he's always believed and adheres to. That's absurd to say that he's homophobic.

If you look at every study it shows that children do best in a home with stability there and you're more likely to get that if the parents are married. And when we talk about marriage these days, I think the big problem is not that gay people are getting married, it's that straight people are not getting married. And so I've always said, I believe in marriage equality. I believe in it so much. I even think straight people should get married if they're planning to have children."

Religious liberties the foundation of this country. It is part of the First Amendment of the Constitution. And for Congress to come along and say no, your faith isn't as big and the government is now drawn a circle around, and the government is going to tell you how much faith you can have and where the limits of your faith are. They can't do that according to the First Amendment and that's what this bill would do."

JASON MEISTER, CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, TRUMP 2020: Martha, you just asked New Yorkers. We all know who de Blasio is. He has devastated our city. If you look at homelessness which is up over 50 percent under his watch, if you look at murder rates, if you look at rape rates. I know that he said it's gone down, it's actually plateaued. But murder rates, and rape rates you cannot play with. They're up nearly 10 percent. This mayor has been the devastation to our city. And really what I think I would take out of this is that there is this debate in this country between socialism and capitalism. De Blasio has put the experiment of socialism into Manhattan, into New York City, and it has failed miserably under his watch. Look at what he did to Amazon. He chased tens and thousands of jobs out of the city. It devastated the economy. And so, I think that this is really what you have to do is look at New York City when you look at socialism versus capitalism."

It's done, basically. They lowered the number of charter schools that could start here. What do you make of that sort of broader national issue about the kind of things he's done here and whether or not they are going to sell nationally with the other candidates as well?"

I mean, we have to be honest that this election will be won in the states that Trump flipped in 2016. A New York City mayor is going to be able to show that he can work toward Pennsylvania and white working-class voters across that spectrum in order to do that. And these kinds of issues that he's run on or currently owns will be difficult to translate into those votes."

The economy is soaring, we have got GDP growth, we have historic unemployment for African-Americans, women. And so, I think it's going to be very difficult. I think they are going to rip each other apart, but I think going back to De Blasio, I think that he really is a miserable candidate for the Democrats.

Susan Collins, one of the only pro-choice senators on the Republican side of things made out that she was very concerned of it. We never actually got to the \"I will uphold Roe v. Wade.\" It's always a conversation of precedent. And then last week, while Brett Kavanaugh did vote with the liberals on the Apple case about the app, he did vote to overturn something it was 40 years of precedent, and that's where these alarm bells come from. As for Senator Gillibrand, I believe that women's issues is her lane. You've seen a number of candidates kind of pick of their topic. Jay Inslee he is the climate guy. Cory Booker and Eric Swalwell are going for guns. And Kirsten Gillibrand really wants to own this. She had her legislation about sex assaults in the military, for instance, she was out on the front on with Al Franken, for instance, as well. And I think that's where she's going with this. And I would say -- I would say I want to hear from you guys.

I totally agree with you with Kirsten Gillibrand and I think other 2020 female Democratic presidential candidates seeing this as something a bit of an opening for them, something where they can really relate to other pro- choice voters on.

Only 13 percent of Americans support third trimester abortions, yet I guarantee that Kirsten Gillibrand or Elizabeth Warren are not going be asked those questions along the campaign trail because the media has tipped its hand and has showed its hand the bias on the issue of abortion.

This week, came face-to-face with the American soldier of the 84th Infantry Division whose team helped to liberate her from Salzwedel concentration camp in 1945. It was one of three camps that she and her sister survived. Watch this."

      "utterance": "Yes, it was. And to give you a little idea what it was like to see these soldiers, the American soldiers, the G.I.s, they came into the camp on tanks, trucks, and seeing them was like angels from heaven jumping off these trucks and tanks, coming to open the gates. When they opened the gates, they told us you are free, the war is over. It was an overwhelming feeling because we never thought that this war, this horror is going to end, and meeting one of them in person was a very emotional feeling. I thanked him for giving us opportunity for a new life. Have a normal life, to be free, and hard to describe."

It's very difficult to relive Auschwitz. I was in Auschwitz as a very young girl. And to see the losing my whole family. It was very emotional. But then arriving in Israel, in the IDF jet plane, it was just hard to describe the feeling, the pride. And I met a lot of the young soldiers that are fighting for Israel. They are so brave and courageous."

      "speaker": "KLISMAN",
      "utterance": "That's right. Because we were starved, tortured, unbelievable cruelty we live through for so many years. So, some of the soldiers that looked at us, we look like living skeletons had tears and cried and tried whatever they had, crackers, or cookies, or chocolates. They would give it to us because it was a very dark period in the world to live through. And like I said, I'm one of the lucky ones out of my whole family. My sister and I were the only two to survive. I had a lot of aunts, uncles, cousins. Nobody survived."

It's just horrifically horrible -- I can't find the words to explain, and only people like you really know. But I am so grateful that you got the opportunity to meet this soldier and to think him, and we are grateful to you for your strength and your courage and for talking with us tonight. Sophie, thank you so much."
