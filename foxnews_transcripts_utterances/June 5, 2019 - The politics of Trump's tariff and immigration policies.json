But if it is simply going to be we're go doing do more on the southern border to prevent, what does that mean? How much money is that? What can the president say once he comes out of these meetings to have assurance or give assurance that the Mexicans are trying to do that? But if those numbers continue to spike, even after the Mexicans have given assurance, then what does he do? And I think that's the real question here, which is at what point the president said he's going to shut the border down at one point when he was frustrated with the number of illegal immigrants coming in and asylum seekers. He didn't do that. Now he's says he's going to put tariffs. He may not do that if he feels like he's getting what he needs from Mexico. If it continues to rise, what is the third that he says he's going to do? And if he backs down yet again, what kind of message is that going to send?"

We went from crisis where Democrats said it was not a crisis, then they said yes, it is a crisis. Now we're at full-blown emergency. You're running out of descriptors. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": And so I think that's when tariff man turns to his favorite weapon. You listen to Donald Trump describe this tariff threat, it's all upside. He is saying even if the tariffs go into effect and they're ratcheted up by the end of the summer, by October to 25 percent, then he said the jobs will come back here. And you talk to the Senate Republicans, and you hear only downside. The economic consequences, especially from those Republicans senators from border states. They're worried about the effect it might have on their state economies, so this is the classic divergence between Trump's philosophy and the philosophy of Republicans in Washington D.C."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. I think there's a bipartisan consensus that China is the emerging threat to the United States in the 21st century, and our trade relationship has been flawed with China for decades. And so there you have both parties supporting an aggressive approach to Chinese trade as well as security issues. Mexico, it's a little bit different. They're our largest trading partner. The import-export distinction is sometimes hard to draw, because as I think Senator Toomey said earlier in the program, some parts are assembled here, then they go there, then they come back. These supply chains are crucial to maintaining an American economy that looks to be weakening."

Adding tariffs will not make the U.S. great again, but hurt the country."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "We don't often talk about what it is doing to China, and we're going to get into that this week. But you look at the Dow today, guy, and there's not a lot of jitters about Mexico or China. Second day in a row, big gains, in part because the Fed said I'm your back stop."

I think that there are some concerns about where this might go. But there is I think the big question, to Amy's point before, is this something that the president is actually going to follow-through on this time, at least on the Mexico side of things. Matt is right that there's a consensus on China. That's clearly not the case with Mexico and this new gambit. I will say, though, talking to Republicans, while many of them are calling out this proposed remedy as something that they can't support, almost universally they're pointing to the other charts we were looked at, the crisis at the border, it is more acute and more real than ever, and they totally back the president on that point."

Further talks with Mexico will resume tomorrow with the understanding that if no agreement is reached, tariffs at five percent level will begin Monday with monthly increases as per schedule.

For the Hyde Amendment is one of the few where he's saying I'm not budging from this position that I took back in the 70s and 80s yet. And I think you're exactly right to put the emphasis on yet. This is a really, really important issue in a Democratic primary. It always would be. You put that on top of what has been happening in many of these conservative states, restricting access to abortion, and this is -- and also the emphasis and focus on poorer women, women who do not have access to healthcare, that is going to be a very, very difficult issue for him to have to justify defending as he goes through this Democratic primary."
