I also thought it was strange that Congresswoman Escobar said, you know, this is where we greet Americans as they come across the border. This is a dangerous journey, when I listen to the vice president talk about how we have to be so concerned about these children and we have to care about them, and you know, that they were -- that they inherited this disaster, I just can't help but think about these children that get dropped over the fence by themselves after being left by coyotes and they're screaming in the night holding their teddy bear asking someone to help them. I'm not sure how this is a more humane system than what we had before.

And AOC and a number of the other representatives have visited the facilities, said these facilities for kids are unacceptable.

And he knows as a cop, someone like that goes into prison, you have to be solitary confinement the whole time. If they go to the general, they're going to eat him alive. So, he's a dead man if he steps outside into general pop. So, he might have to off himself, maybe he was saying that, I don't know, I'm not inside his sick head. It's just a theory. Or there is some legal mumbo-jumbo he is going to unveil later with his team. I have no idea, but that was a very weird thing to do to the family at that time who are grieving. I just look back at the situation, this George Floyd death. I am so glad we are turning the page on this chapter in American history. I can't think of any positive thing that came out of this and I'm a silver lining kind of guy.

In Portland homicide is up by 500 plus percent in that city.

Ellis Island doesn't work where you've got a big hole in the fence and people like, you know, just make their way through. Ellis Island is a process. You have, you know, back then you had to go through it. There is still a process now to become an American citizen. And a lot of people go through it and do it the right way. I also thought it was strange that Congresswoman Escobar said, you know, this is where we greet Americans as they come across the border. This is a dangerous journey, when I listen to the vice president talk about how we have to be so concerned about these children and we have to care about them, and you know, that they were -- that they inherited this disaster, I just can't help but think about these children that get dropped over the fence by themselves after being left by coyotes and they're screaming in the night holding their teddy bear asking someone to help them. I'm not sure how this is a more humane system than what we had before. Granted there were, you know, legitimate questions about what was done before, but I'm not sure how this has become, you know, where all the progress is and how this is going so much better at this point remains to be seen."

I'm calling this the nothing to see here tour, because they don't want to go to McAllen because then they would see all of what's actually happening. She claims that this about children and people and humanity. Well, it would be nice if you want to visit them and talk with them and maybe listen to some of the stories about their journey and how they got here and what the root causes are and why they decided to make that journey and talk to those people firsthand. And the other thing that was so interesting about the comment made by the congresswoman and she says it's the new Ellis Island. Ellis Island was a welcoming place for people who wanted to become American citizens. Well, it didn't -- the vice president just go to Guatemala and say don't come?"

And AOC and a number of the other representatives have visited the facilities, said these facilities for kids are unacceptable. I don't think that those kinds of things and showing compassion and talking to kids talking to parents who have made this journey makes you look worse or makes your policies look worse because every administration struggle with this. And unless you're super polarized like the people on really the far left or the far right about it, I think people understand how complicated this issue his and would be amenable to listening about what the solutions are and just what you heard from people, what their journey was like, the humanity side of that."

If they did, they would have at least told people not to come and would have kept the wall there which was the only variable -- new variable that we had in this debate since I've been on this planet, that was the -- that's the first time I've never ever seen an actual change in the debate which caused everybody to hate it.

He is a really disturbed individual. Perhaps he is looking at life if you tap on the federal indictments to federal indictments on top of the 22 years. He's never going to see the light of day. And he knows as a cop, someone like that goes into prison, you have to be solitary confinement the whole time. If they go to the general, they're going to eat him alive. So, he's a dead man if he steps outside into general pop. So, he might have to off himself, maybe he was saying that, I don't know, I'm not inside his sick head. It's just a theory. Or there is some legal mumbo-jumbo he is going to unveil later with his team. I have no idea, but that was a very weird thing to do to the family at that time who are grieving. I just look back at the situation, this George Floyd death. I am so glad we are turning the page on this chapter in American history. I can't think of any positive thing that came out of this and I'm a silver lining kind of guy. The death, the destruction, the police retirements, the crime wave, the racial resentment, what good has come out of this? What concrete results have come out of this death and the aftermath?

But nobody can dispute the fact that this was a substantive sentence for a killer. And we sought other members of the police force get up there and say we don't teach people to do that.

That to me, that was one of the most crucial turning point of the entire summer that followed. Because he didn't say we've got your back, hold the fort, we are going to make sure that we, you know, we quell what's going on outside this precinct. They got in their cars and they rode away. They never got over that, those police officers. They never got over it. They abandoned their post. People ran in there. They flooded the entire place, they emptied the filing cabinets. It was so repulsive I think in such a deep way. And Jacob Frey, so now they're having elections to the city council where they all said they were going to reimagine the police force after that, right?

You had a number of Democratic city councils and mayors all over the place, Portland, Minneapolis, Baltimore, defunding the police and then all of a sudden crime goes up by. you know, murders are up 50 percent in some places. In Portland homicide is up by 500 plus percent in that city. And now all of a sudden you have the president this week coming in with essentially a crime bail out for these blue cities by saying you can take money from the American Rescue Act to refund your police forces that you took millions of dollars away from because you were buying into this narrative. That by the way, the prosecution didn't use it in court. The prosecution said Derek Chauvin is one officer in a force. He murdered George Floyd. That was the argument they made. The jury agreed with them. But the left took it and applied it to everybody else and we had a year of rage and summers of burning. And you have the White House now trying to get out in front of another summer like that because police are leaving in droves, people are not signing up to replace the people who are retiring. And people want more police in their communities. And so, there are consequences to applying the situation to everyone rather than just taking the fact as they were for this one case."

Right? I mean, they're all in cities that really needed law enforcement. And the law enforcement was no longer there. That created a mountain of dead. And that was driven by, in my view, like - - just taking a -- they are something like 25 to 30 cases like this every year out of millions and millions of stops and they're horrible and they're tragic, and that was -- the guy is going away for a long time.

He doesn't speak in a clear and concise way. And he gets frustrated, so he has three tells. The first tell is, come on, man. And that's Joe giving up. That's Joe knowing he can't convince you with an actual sentence. It's just, come on man. And then the other tell is the anger, the finger, the wagging, and the flash of the temper. That's when he gets frustrated that he's not communicating. The third tell is the whisper. The whisper is Joe lowering his cadence because he never does that. Because he's very boring, he lowers his cadence, and he comes down, and he tries to reassure the audience that everything is OK. I have things under control. I'm cutting a deal, I'm doing a great job. And that's the way a limited guy like Joe Biden communicates sometimes. And I hate to agree with you, Jessica.

And then she talks about the fact that everything that was considered old or feudalist was taken out and smashed. So, they're just taking out these phrases and smashing them. So, I am -- I'm worried. You know, maybe I'm crazy, but I look at all this stuff and I think this is scary. This is scary. And you're so right. You're going to pay all that money to -- what are these teachers doing?

I work out with Emma, I go interview people on the streets. So, you go to wattersday.com. That's right, wattersday.com, two tease, and purchase a ticket. You get a copy of my book and then you can watch the special 6:15 p.m. on July 1. You're going to love it. I'm going to show an exclusive clip on Monday. Also, I'm guest hosting \"HANNITY\" tonight. Apparently, there's a UFO report that just dropped. I'm sure we're going to be covering that in a fair and balanced way. Of course, \"WATTERS' WORLD\" Saturday 8:00. I hit the streets to find out what New Yorkers think about the crime wave. It's ridiculous. And lastly, every night next week, I'm hosting \"PRIMETIME.\" Every night. I got to sell books, Gutfeld.
