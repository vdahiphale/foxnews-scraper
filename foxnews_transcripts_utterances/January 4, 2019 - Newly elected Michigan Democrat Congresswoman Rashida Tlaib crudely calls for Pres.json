There is a new poll from GovExex of federal workers says 71 percent oppose the shutdown. So, these are people who are not getting paychecks. You know this, real life it's hard for many of these government employees without a paycheck.

You have another Republican senator today saying we need to re-open the government without border wall funding. They are feeling the heat and the pressure.

How this politically-correct society is starting to cannibalize itself. You're seeing it in Hollywood now.

You don't have to tax them when it is 70 percent because it's funny. Liberals try and completely discredit trickle down economics. They use the phrase, they don't really know what it means, but if there is a cause and effect relationship by wealth and other people who benefit from that, then there will also be one if rich people had less money to spend. It means they are investing less in companies. They are not starting new businesses. Those new businesses that they are not starting aren't employing people who desperately need to get into the work force for the first time. And when you shackle people with economic immobility, it is one of the most immoral things human being can do to one another. And so what she is actually putting forth is an, I know better than you.

You know, let's get away from the emotionalism for just a second because both sides are really stoking up their bases with this issue, which is what makes it less solvable. But if she believes that there should be border security and if she believes in the type of sovereignty that she has advertised in the past, then what does that mean?

The Democrats will have to put forward what they see for border security. I think that's an imminently reasonable proposal. You can get those 800,000 people back to work. I will also say President Trump today kept saying that the government workers who are not getting paid support him. There is a new poll from GovExex of federal workers says 71 percent oppose the shutdown. So, these are people who are not getting paychecks. You know this, real life it's hard for many of these government employees without a paycheck. Also interesting that Mitch McConnell was not at that press conference today because it's the Senate that really holds the cards here. You have another Republican senator today saying we need to re-open the government without border wall funding. They are feeling the heat and the pressure.

The issue excites his base. The issue, the wall, is favorable to Republicans. The government has not imploded. The sky is not falling and the market doesn't really care. On the Pelosi side, most of the government workers are Democrats. Let's be honest. And they are not radical, open borders Democrats that are partisan people. They probably want a little border security, but what they want more are their paychecks. And if Nancy Pelosi is holding their paychecks hostage to score political points against Trump, I don't think that looks good. Also, life goes on when the government is shutdown. The myth is everything stops when the government shuts down. And to have that fantasy out there really exposes Democrats."

Look at these dogs. They're amazing. Twelve-dog, 100-mile race. And an eight-dog, 65-miler. The race started in 1977, and as part as my mom's 70th birthday present, she is there with some of her friends. I think we have a photo of her. That's my mom, Jane Harf, with one of the dogs. The course goes through glacially-sculpted boreal forests, through an immense network of lakes and streams. It is beautiful. It is cold. It's very cool. Check it out. You can follow it online."

They were just out there before. But it was funny, because we traveled with all this luggage, and I found out one bag was exclusively stuffed animals for my youngest daughter. And I found this little schedule she drew on the hotel stationery, which is absolutely terrific. They have a picture of it. Morning, pee-pee, food, treat, pee. And I figure, these animals, these stuffed animals really have to go to the bathroom a lot. That's her writing. I did not make this up."
