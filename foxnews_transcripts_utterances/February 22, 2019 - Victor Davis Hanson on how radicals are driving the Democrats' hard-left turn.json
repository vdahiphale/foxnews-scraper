      "sentences": "Welcome to “Hannity” again tonight. We have so much breaking news all over the place, at out of Virginia, Vietnam, the swamp Washington, D.C. where Mueller's witch-hunt will soon officially be over and spoiler alert -- no collusion. And we learned earlier today there will not be a report next week. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Maybe someone actually figured out that an extremely important summit about world peace, about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula actually taking place in Vietnam next week. Not a good time. We, by the way, will be reporting from Vietnam all next week. We have more of that in a minute. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, first, we turn to our top story out of Chicago once again. Embattled \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett, he is still proclaiming his innocence after being formally accused of orchestrating what is an elaborate hate crime hoax and charged with a felony. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Smollett posted bond, he went directly to the set of \"Empire\". It is reported he told the cast and crew, quote: I swear to God I did not do. But according to TMZ, many of his co-stars, they are not buying it and they are bleeping furious. And today, producers announced that Smollett's role on \"Empire\" has been cut from the final two episodes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Jussie Smollett's lawyers, they are correct, he must be assumed innocent -- presumption of innocence before being proven guilty. With that said, the evidence against him as presented by the Chicago police yesterday and others is now overwhelming and frankly beginning to border on incontrovertible. And according to prosecutors, Smollett paid two brothers thousands of dollars to stage a homophobic assault against the actor on the streets of Chicago using a noose, bleach, all while wearing red MAGA hats, \"Make America Great Again\" hats and ski masks. Both of those individuals have been testifying both before the grand jury and police against Smollett. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as can you see right there that video, evidence shows that pair buying the items used allegedly in the assault. Surveillance also shows the brothers arrival at the scene of the incident phone records indicate Smollett called the brothers both before and right after this staged attack and text exchanges smell out how Smollett solicited their help. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And perhaps the most damning and most puzzling piece of evidence, he paid the accomplices with a check, kind of, aka Jerry Springer. Now, naturally the spin has already started. Smollett allegedly is trying to tell the police he had an untreated drug problem. Texts indicate that, in fact, the actor may have purchased the party drug known as \"Molly\" or ecstasy from one of the brothers involved in this hoax. So, is he saying the drugs made him do it but I didn't do it? Well, except ecstasy or \"Molly\" has never been known to cause any hate crime hoax. And, meanwhile, conspiracy TV, MSNBC, they are touting a brand new conspiracy maybe the Chicago police are just lying. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And they are morally superior. This is why fake victimhood is on the rise. Now, attention-seeking Trump haters know that they will garner sympathy almost immediately and fame from the media, because it advances their narrative, all while impugning the narrative of Trump supporters in the process. So, in the era of Trump, we see hoax after hoax after hoax, very little reporting on it. Remember, racist graffiti on a building at Eastern Michigan university staged by a former student. A woman in New York saying that oh a group of pro-Trump teens vandalized her car while yelling Trump 2016. Turned out she vandalized own car. Homophobic slurs spray painted on the side of Indiana church by the church organ player. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look at the side of your screen, fake, hate crimes are far too common in this country, and time and time again, this media mob and Democrats, if it fits their agenda, they buy these stories hook, line, sinker, constantly rushing to judgment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, they hold up each eventual hoax as a shining example of why Trump supporters are horrible people. And remember, we are the smelly Walmart people, the irredeemable, deplorables. We cling to our God, Bibles, guns and religion. And in doing so, they ruin the reputation and in some cases the lives of very good, honorable, decent people. And when the truth is revealed, crickets. They just move onto the next fake news story. No apologies, no accountability, no mea culpa, no nothing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is what happened in the case of Richard Jewell.

I said that's the most idiotic theory I have ever heard. Turns out he was a hero.

We have so much breaking news all over the place, at out of Virginia, Vietnam, the swamp Washington, D.C. where Mueller's witch-hunt will soon officially be over and spoiler alert -- no collusion. And we learned earlier today there will not be a report next week. Maybe someone actually figured out that an extremely important summit about world peace, about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula actually taking place in Vietnam next week. Not a good time. We, by the way, will be reporting from Vietnam all next week. We have more of that in a minute. But, first, we turn to our top story out of Chicago once again. Embattled \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett, he is still proclaiming his innocence after being formally accused of orchestrating what is an elaborate hate crime hoax and charged with a felony. And Smollett posted bond, he went directly to the set of \"Empire\". It is reported he told the cast and crew, quote: I swear to God I did not do. But according to TMZ, many of his co-stars, they are not buying it and they are bleeping furious. And today, producers announced that Smollett's role on \"Empire\" has been cut from the final two episodes. Now, Jussie Smollett's lawyers, they are correct, he must be assumed innocent -- presumption of innocence before being proven guilty. With that said, the evidence against him as presented by the Chicago police yesterday and others is now overwhelming and frankly beginning to border on incontrovertible. And according to prosecutors, Smollett paid two brothers thousands of dollars to stage a homophobic assault against the actor on the streets of Chicago using a noose, bleach, all while wearing red MAGA hats, \"Make America Great Again\" hats and ski masks. Both of those individuals have been testifying both before the grand jury and police against Smollett. And as can you see right there that video, evidence shows that pair buying the items used allegedly in the assault. Surveillance also shows the brothers arrival at the scene of the incident phone records indicate Smollett called the brothers both before and right after this staged attack and text exchanges smell out how Smollett solicited their help. And perhaps the most damning and most puzzling piece of evidence, he paid the accomplices with a check, kind of, aka Jerry Springer. Now, naturally the spin has already started. Smollett allegedly is trying to tell the police he had an untreated drug problem. Texts indicate that, in fact, the actor may have purchased the party drug known as \"Molly\" or ecstasy from one of the brothers involved in this hoax. So, is he saying the drugs made him do it but I didn't do it? Well, except ecstasy or \"Molly\" has never been known to cause any hate crime hoax. And, meanwhile, conspiracy TV, MSNBC, they are touting a brand new conspiracy maybe the Chicago police are just lying. Take a look."

They continually rush to judgment. It's always guilt by accusation -- but only if you are a Republican or a conservative -- pushing blatantly false stories, conspiracy theories, impugning the character of millions of Americans, now even teenagers that may wear a MAGA hat. Why? To push their favorite narrative every second, minute, hour of every 24-hour day, every week, month, year. Trump's evil, supporters are evil. And they are morally superior. This is why fake victimhood is on the rise. Now, attention-seeking Trump haters know that they will garner sympathy almost immediately and fame from the media, because it advances their narrative, all while impugning the narrative of Trump supporters in the process. So, in the era of Trump, we see hoax after hoax after hoax, very little reporting on it. Remember, racist graffiti on a building at Eastern Michigan university staged by a former student. A woman in New York saying that oh a group of pro-Trump teens vandalized her car while yelling Trump 2016. Turned out she vandalized own car. Homophobic slurs spray painted on the side of Indiana church by the church organ player. Look at the side of your screen, fake, hate crimes are far too common in this country, and time and time again, this media mob and Democrats, if it fits their agenda, they buy these stories hook, line, sinker, constantly rushing to judgment. And, by the way, they hold up each eventual hoax as a shining example of why Trump supporters are horrible people. And remember, we are the smelly Walmart people, the irredeemable, deplorables. We cling to our God, Bibles, guns and religion. And in doing so, they ruin the reputation and in some cases the lives of very good, honorable, decent people. And when the truth is revealed, crickets. They just move onto the next fake news story. No apologies, no accountability, no mea culpa, no nothing. This is what happened in the case of Richard Jewell. Remember I thought it was so bad in 1996. The media mob there accused him of being the Olympic bomber. Why? Because he lived with his mother. I was on the air at the time. Richard was listening. I said that's the most idiotic theory I have ever heard. Turns out he was a hero. But, watch this."

Robin Roberts? Anyone else in the hate Trump media? You talk about the rise in the far left hatred or obsess about the physical attacks on people merely wearing a red \"MAGA\" hat? Why? How many of these people support Black Lives Matter? What do we want dead cops? What do we want them now? Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon. It doesn't fit their narrative. Those people don't seem to matter if you are a conservative and wear a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. And it's why we've seen little to no coverage of this vicious assault from earlier this week.

That he was assaulted. He said it was over a pro-Trump sign. Mainstream media silence. No rushing to judgment here. In fact, pretty much no coverage at all. But what else should we expect from a mainstream media that is actively working on behalf of the Democratic Party? First, to stop Donald Trump from ever becoming president and but now they want to impugn the character of millions of Americans that support the president, that like the success in our economy, that like the 5.3 million new jobs. We will have a lot more on this coming up. But, first, a quick update on our “Hannity” watch of Mueller's witch-hunt. The probe is reportedly now in its final stages. There were earlier reports this week that it would wrap up and the report would be delivered to the DOJ next week. But according to a great new article from Kimberley Strassel, look at this -- uh-oh -- Democrats are anticipating a huge letdown. With no collusion literally written on the wall of this point, conspiracy theorists, House Intel Committee chair, biggest liar in Congress and I can prove it, Adam Schiff, he is plotting his backup plan. I'm sure the media will follow suit and it's something that we have warned about for months. That means nonstop, never ending, endless, frivolous, expensive, pointless investigations on the same topic and President Trump and his family and anybody associated with him. They know they will find nothing but it gives Democrats a venue to continue what has been two years of never ending smear and slander and innuendo and conspiracy theories and character assassination of Donald Trump and anybody that likes him. Gives Shifty Schiff an excuse to do his favorite activity -- lie to you, we, the people. All right. Joining us now, we have a lot to get to tonight, the author of the book \"The Case Against the Democratic House Impeaching Trump\", Professor -- Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz, and also, Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera. You know, Geraldo, you were so passionate last night and so -- you reminded me of the police superintendent. I said last night, I thought that was the best news conference I watched in my career. He was so good in describing the impact when people lie."

I thought that the police superintendent in Chicago, Eddie Johnson, saved the reputation of the city, the same voice to the partisans on both sides in this troubling issue. I think we cannot lose sight of what this is. This is a cynical, selfish, exploitive young man who shamed the history of true victims of race crimes in this country by his cavalier staging of this event. It's -- it reminds me a lot of O.J. Simpson, you know, not as serious because no one died but the mountain of evidence against him and the bizarre nature of the partisans who are continuing to support him in the face of this mountain of evidence is similar. There's no logic to it. It's infuriating. Smollett is going to get his just deserts. I think that people will abandon him eventually, but it is pretty clear from the evidence as we know it that this man sought to exploit the racial tensions in this country for his own financial gain. It's disgusting. It's the lowdown and dirty. I don't think his career -- what I would do or I him is just go to a tropical island, chill out for a couple of years and come back and crawl on your belly and apologize to the American people."

But they weren't prepared to give a presumption of innocence to the nonexistent MAGA hat wearing assailants. They immediately assumed the story was true and immediately convicted these people in the court of public opinion. And so, what we see is the presumption of innocence like so many other aspects of our life is selectively employed by the left against the right and sometimes by the right against the left. We have to have a presumption of innocence on both sides and you in your monologue set that out correctly. You said we have to assume Smollett to be innocent but look at the evidence. It is certainly mounting. Now, I believe strongly because I have been a victim myself of this -- when somebody deliberately frames somebody and deliberately makes up a false report of anything, that person must go to jail. The integrity of the system demands that the deliberate false reporters, not if you made an accident or honest mistake but deliberate false reporters must go to jail. You know, the Bible says that if you testify falsely against somebody, you get the penalty that that person would have gotten had he been guilty."

But it was the reckless way they talk about impeachment which is, obviously, serious a specific process of which there is no basis for. And remember, as crazy as the over-the-top as this behavior is with these new lawmakers, they have real influence. They are part of this hard-Left turn among 2020 Democrats, totally out of balance and out of touch with everyday Americans. For example, Elizabeth Warren is now saying that her \"Wealth Tax\". Now that means a new tax after you've ready paid your taxes if you manage to save money, well, it's just a big down payment on the Green New Deal and free child care. Don't forget about champagne socialist Bernie Sanders. He's now agreed to sign a pledge of firming. He will run as a Democrat. Why shouldn't he? He's the one that first pushed these radical extreme ideas -- free health care, free college, huge entitlements. That now the party is just embracing his socialist utopia. By way he might be a moderate compared to some of the other candidates. Look at this video from 1985 where he offers praise for the Castro regime. And let me remind you, Castro was a murdering thug dictator who stole people's land and literally created more poverty than you've ever seen. Take a look."

You know, not to say that Fidel Castro or Cuba are perfect, they are certainly not.

Sounds like the Senator could use a \"Hannity History\" lesson about human rights abuses, censorship and economic disaster of Cuba and murdering rage of innocent people. And it's not just Cuba we're watching this now unfold in real-time, this far-Left agenda playing out in Venezuela, where free leads to famine and socialism leads to suffering. They have food shortages and violent, constant chaos. Look at this footage Venezuela's Maduro is actually stopping aid from reaching his own country. May I ask the question, \"Well, how many people are fleeing capitalism?\" Not a lot. \"How many people are fleeing from America to Venezuela? Free market capitalism works. The greatest wealth creator in the history of man, and we see socialism failing time and time again throughout history. All right. Joining us now for reaction Author of \"The Case for Trump\", he's with the Hoover Institute, Victor Davis Hanson, one of my favorite writers. You wrote such a great column about the failed coup. But I want to ask you about this. I'm going to give me a litany and then I'm going to let you go. We're going to redo every home in America, eliminate cars, the combustion engine, planes and 70% tax. Then a well tax, if you save a few cents after it. And guaranteed job with a guaranteed wage, family medical leave, guaranteed vacations, guaranteed retirement, guaranteed college, guaranteed healthy government food, guaranteed housing, guaranteed health care -- but not private, you can't have that and even if you're unwilling to work.

And so each revolutionary position within 24 hours or a week becomes pass,. So Bernie Sanders -- remember, Sean, he was edgy when he used the word \"Socialist\". Now socialist is not radical enough. That green agenda of Al Gore seems pass, compared to the New Green Deal. We were -- not too long ago we were talking about how much of a wall we should build and there was a opposition between Democrats and Republicans and then it was whether you needed a wall. Now Beto wants to tear down the wall and you mentioned. The tax we went from Obama 39 and then we went to 70 and then 90, then a wealth tax. And so no radical position can be radical enough within the next iteration, and that's what this Democratic stampede over the cliff is in now. And the question is why--"

And I kind of blame Barack Obama, because he put a happy face on you didn't build that, now is not the time to profit. At some point you made enough money, the 1%. Then after him it became easier and easier. And we have universities that don't teach people anything other than ideology. So most of these young kids couldn't find Venezuela on the map or they don't know who Lenin is. Finally, Sean, we have 60 million immigrants in this country and we're not assimilating and integrating them in the melting pot traditions. And they're not Cubans fleeing tyranny in the 60s. They are not Hungarians fleeing from the 1950s at new communism. Most of them are coming from impoverished places where their critique was there wasn't enough entitlement and they come here hoping that there'll be a centralized redistributionist government and they become fodder for Left-wing ideologies."

But, if you think the \"Hate Trump Media\" mob, you think they're pushing any of these stories out to the public? Well, use your imagination. According to media research networks coverage of the Virginia scandals has fallen off a cliff. Joining us now to discuss the media's handling of this Fox News Contributors Tammy Bruce and our own Lawrence Jones. Tammy you were so powerful during the Kavanaugh hearings.

The media, clearly, is the water carriers for the American Left and they are not interested in this, just like the Democrats are not really interested in the issues that impact woman's lives, otherwise we'd have some successes. Right? They rely on this kind of victimhood and these problems remaining, so that they can run on them. That said, what the Republicans and people who care about this country need to do, is look at when coverage of issues like this falls off the cliff and it tells you what the Democrats are really afraid of. And it tells you what the Trump White House, what the what the GOP need to focus on. In general, first of all, because it's the right thing to do, because these are serious issues, of course that affect all of our lives. Certainly, they affect women. But they affect the men who love those women. And you know, your mothers, and your sisters, and your daughters and your wives, your best friends, so all Americans care about this. And the GOP must realize that it's been a fraud that the Democrats have been the leaders for minorities in this country and for women and they must take up that mantle, because all Americans deserve representation and it is only the conservative ideal that will deliver it."
