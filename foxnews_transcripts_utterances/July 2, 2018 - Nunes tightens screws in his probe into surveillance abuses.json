Plus the left just cannot stop comparing themselves to the bright ones. Of course the Conservatives are the Nazis, Ben Shapiro joins us for reaction to a vile new slur against him. Meanwhile anti-Trump forces are salivating over the prospect that Michael Cohen could flip. Of course flip on the President, but did he really imply that in an ABC interview today? But first, the Democratic melt down and the war on ICE, that's the focus of tonight's Angle.

I.C.E is the law enforcement agency that was set, remember, after 9/11 to protect us from international security threats, particularly those posed by the people in the country illegally. So how ironic is it that four New York politicians, Senator Gillibrand, Mayor De Blasio, gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon and Congressional candidate Ocasio Cortez are now leading the abolish I.C.E movement charge, nifty. Well the problem for all of them is that the people just aren't buying this. The latest Harvard Harris Poll shows that 88 percent believe that families who cross the border illegally should not be separated, 76 percent want secure borders. Then 53 percent believe we should prosecute those entering the border illegally, while 64 percent believe that you should send the border crossers back home.

Hamilton was fantastic, his writing, his composing. As Trump scores a win after the one on the economy, international relations and trade and now the second Supreme Court pick, the spirited Democrats are looking for hope somewhere so what did they do this weekend, other than listening to some off key performances? They turned to the one, the community organizer in chief himself, Barack Obama appeared with all the little people at a Beverly Hills fundraiser this weekend making his first appearance in months. He declared the gathering a mope fee zone and while the word is that he's been devoting himself to fundraising in his library and writing his memoirs, Obama is now on a DNC fundraising swing commanding more than $100,000 a plate. And without mentioning Trump, he told the swanky crowd, ‘This is a moment of great urgency and you're right to be concerned,\". Then with a self-referential air he mused, \"We shouldn't expect politics to be entertaining all the time, and Christina Aguilera was wonderful but you don't need to have and amazing singer at every event. Sometimes you're just in a church basement making phone calls and eating cold pizza\". That's easy for him to say, he spent a lot of the last year between like Tahiti and Richard Branson's private island in the Caribbean. Cold pizza though for the other people. Well, in many ways the explosion of protests that tilts to the left, the ineffective Democratic leadership, all of this is the fulfillment of what Obama first ushered in his party. The Obama era and the party it left behind always prized style over experience and results. And now a new generation of inexperience charismatic leftists are moving to the fore of the party. They're giving speeches they're leading marches and they're resisting Trump. But original thinking and a governing strategy continues to elude them. With every tack to the left, they merely estrange themselves from the vast middle and working class of this country, catering only to the progressive elites in Manhattan and Malibu. Should this continue come November, well voters, even the Democratic ones, may be pulling the lever to abolish the Democrats, and that's the Angle. Joining us now with reaction is Democratic Congressman from Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthi, former Pennsylvania Congressman and Democrat Jason Altmire and Democratic Strategist, LeDawn Jones.

House Intel chair Devin Nunes is redoubling his efforts to find out whether the Trump campaign really was under surveillance. He has something exclusively to share with us tonight. Plus the left just cannot stop comparing themselves to the bright ones. Of course the Conservatives are the Nazis, Ben Shapiro joins us for reaction to a vile new slur against him. Meanwhile anti-Trump forces are salivating over the prospect that Michael Cohen could flip. Of course flip on the President, but did he really imply that in an ABC interview today? But first, the Democratic melt down and the war on ICE, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. There were about 700 or so leftist marches over the weekend organized to protest President Trump's zero tolerance approach to border jumpers."

They were fulminating, about family separations, of course, at the border despite the fact that President Trump ended that policy two weekends ago, do they not read. Of course, what all of you smart people already know, because you watch the Ingraham Angle, the left isn't really worried about the kids. Is that cynical? Well, maybe it is but if they really worried about kids, they would be at regular rallies in Chicago and Baltimore where still an unacceptably high number of children are left fatherless of even die themselves because of gang bangers and fighting turf wars. Now what's most upsetting to these protesters is that despite all their efforts, Trump's approval numbers keep edging up. So they're only recourse is to demonize Trump as a heartless baby jailor. Do you know something they say, kids in cages? Kids in cages, you hear that all the time. Well it's also an opportunity, of course, for Democrats to trot out new radical policy positions. Now, ever since that 28 year old socialist in New York, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez beat Democratic incumbent, of course Joe Cowely, Democrat from leadership number four in the party, the party's old guard has been reeling. Now they're straining for relevance and tripping all over themselves to align with that millennial socialist. They want to now abolish Immigration Customs and Enforcement because that was a big part of her platform, look at how well she did. So again, rather than challenging her flawed thinking, this the Homeland Security's major enforcement arm, let's not forget, Democrats have decided to just dash leftward and endorse her idea."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Hey Dick, the policy doesn't exist any longer. And anyway, I.C.E does not separate kids at the border. Like many of the protesters surrounding Durbin, it seems like they're all confuse I.C.E with customs and border protection. It's border patrol that arrests illegals at the border and runs them through processing. I.C.E is the law enforcement agency that was set, remember, after 9/11 to protect us from international security threats, particularly those posed by the people in the country illegally. So how ironic is it that four New York politicians, Senator Gillibrand, Mayor De Blasio, gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon and Congressional candidate Ocasio Cortez are now leading the abolish I.C.E movement charge, nifty. Well the problem for all of them is that the people just aren't buying this. The latest Harvard Harris Poll shows that 88 percent believe that families who cross the border illegally should not be separated, 76 percent want secure borders. Then 53 percent believe we should prosecute those entering the border illegally, while 64 percent believe that you should send the border crossers back home. But no matter where they stand on the nuances of immigration policy, a whopping 70 percent want stricter enforcement of existing immigration laws. So how are you going to do that exactly if you abolish the agency that's charged with investigation human trafficking, drug smuggling, weapon smuggling? I.C.E is the agency that also tracks down criminal illegal immigrants and then they remove them from the country. Democrats claim that they're for that. So if criminals make it over the border, are we just to let them wrought across the country? Good luck on turning that into a platform that actually wins votes."

I think they have another thing coming. It not only sounds like an idea that you'd hear at some undergrad student center, over some like Ben and Jerry's, it's also dangerous.

Hamilton was fantastic, his writing, his composing. As Trump scores a win after the one on the economy, international relations and trade and now the second Supreme Court pick, the spirited Democrats are looking for hope somewhere so what did they do this weekend, other than listening to some off key performances? They turned to the one, the community organizer in chief himself, Barack Obama appeared with all the little people at a Beverly Hills fundraiser this weekend making his first appearance in months. He declared the gathering a mope fee zone and while the word is that he's been devoting himself to fundraising in his library and writing his memoirs, Obama is now on a DNC fundraising swing commanding more than $100,000 a plate. And without mentioning Trump, he told the swanky crowd, ‘This is a moment of great urgency and you're right to be concerned,\". Then with a self-referential air he mused, \"We shouldn't expect politics to be entertaining all the time, and Christina Aguilera was wonderful but you don't need to have and amazing singer at every event. Sometimes you're just in a church basement making phone calls and eating cold pizza\". That's easy for him to say, he spent a lot of the last year between like Tahiti and Richard Branson's private island in the Caribbean. Cold pizza though for the other people. Well, in many ways the explosion of protests that tilts to the left, the ineffective Democratic leadership, all of this is the fulfillment of what Obama first ushered in his party. The Obama era and the party it left behind always prized style over experience and results. And now a new generation of inexperience charismatic leftists are moving to the fore of the party. They're giving speeches they're leading marches and they're resisting Trump. But original thinking and a governing strategy continues to elude them. With every tack to the left, they merely estrange themselves from the vast middle and working class of this country, catering only to the progressive elites in Manhattan and Malibu. Should this continue come November, well voters, even the Democratic ones, may be pulling the lever to abolish the Democrats, and that's the Angle. Joining us now with reaction is Democratic Congressman from Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthi, former Pennsylvania Congressman and Democrat Jason Altmire and Democratic Strategist, LeDawn Jones. Let's first go to the Congressman, I feel like the Democrats are in a way where Republicans were kind of 2009 before the Tea Party really got going and their looking for traction somewhere. Now it's abolish I.C.E where, of course, I.C.E was working to deport people in large numbers when Obama was President but I didn't hear any of these fancy pants politicians talk about abolishing I.C.E back then so how does it actually get traction now, Congressman?"

I think that the way we get traction is basically connecting to the real economic problems of working families and presenting our agenda for making sure everyone gets on the up escalator of the economy. If you're working poor, how do we get you into the middle class? If you're in the middle class, how do we allow you to succeed? And if you want to start and grow a small business, how do we allow you to do that as well? I think that's how you take the majority."

Now they're returning to the workforce in very large numbers, some people say we have a dearth of employees, we need more in the country. But wages are starting to go up. African American unemployment very low, all-time low. Latino unemployment also at almost a record low so I get what you're describing and I think it's great. The problem is Trump is already doing it."

It appears that the Trump administration is not interested in necessarily doing that. A second issue that--"

      "utterance": "Okay so Obamacare will be your argument then? Mrs. Jones I want to go with you on that because, of course, what the Republicans worried about is that with Obamacare, contrary to what was argued, premiums would start to go up. It didn't happen immediately but when you mandate that people go into a pool of insured who obviously they are high risk because they have pre-exiting conditions, that cost is going to have to be spread around. Insurance is going to have more bills to pay, and rates start going up up up up up. That's exactly what's happened so it's no surprise that a lot of these exchanges couldn't keep up. How are you guys going to get the traction you need with this economy as hot as it is?"

But the way that we get the traction is with the recent elections. Democrats learned in the 2016 election that there is a voice trying to heard and rather than trying to move to the center to gather the votes of people who clearly were on a difference plane, those are the Trump voters and because you can't attract those voters so we have to stick to our principles. And our principles are making America a place for everyone to live. A place that has humanity and care and that includes healthcare, that includes sound immigration policy that is fair and right and just and humane. And that goes across the board and I think Democrats have learned--"

But the polls aren't bearing that out. Most people believe that of you come into the country illegally, it's sad when your family gets separated, no body want to see that but it's your responsibility. You made a decision to cross the border, you didn't go into a normal port of entry and now you're complaining that America doesn't have a heart which is what one woman did today who was reunited with her daughter. It's nice that she was reunited but she made that decision. I understand the hard argument, I get the compassion argument but Americans have been struggling for like three decades and haven't seen a raise.

You have the historical loss of seats by the incumbent party, you have some missteps that were made by the administration. The Democrats that successfully prevented the repeal of Obamacare where winning on the generic ballot had an issue that was very politically beneficial to them as well as, I feel, being on the morally just side in preventing the forcing the change in policy of the separations at the border. And then to move further to the left because of one election that occurred in one Congressional district now, to encourage uncivil disobedience. To confront the administration, members of the media, in a way that is outside the bounds of normal political discourse in this country.

House Intel Chair Devin Nunes is tightening the screws in his investigation into alleged surveillance abuses of the Trump campaign. The Congressman in now referring the names of 17 current and former justice department and FBI officials to the heads of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees for interviews.

Congressman, it's great to see you. Now, I know people across the country are getting ready for the fourth of July but Devin Nunes wants more information. I'm playing devil's advocate here, when will it end? You're always complaining about documents, now you're complaining about people but there are a lot of people on this list that are new names to people like Victoria Newland. Tell us why you want her to testify."

I think we've been very transparent about how we've conduct this process. We went on to Pfizer abuse and other matters and I've said for a long time that we are looking at the state department. When we began looking state department, you had Victoria Newland and other people who decided to go out and talk about things publicly which actually helped our investigation out quite a bit. The reason why is we still don't understand how this investigation was actually opened but we know that many people in the Obama era state department were involved in the opening of that investigation. So it all comes down to how did the information make it from supposedly from an Australian High Commissioner Ambassador to the FBI? So we know that that didn't come through what I would call Pfizer's Intelligence, it wasn't real intelligence product. It somehow short circuited that process. We also know that many people in the state department were also meeting with Christopher Steele. Christopher Steele is the person who was hired by the Democrats to dig up dirt on President Trump. So this is why this investigation has taken a while, but the good thing is that I believe that Chairman Gowdy and Goodlatte, I believe that their task force will interview these people and they will interview them in public so it will be the first time during this entire investigation that the American people get to see actual questions get answered to these potential witnesses."

Again, phony Dossier, Christopher Steele, MI6, worked as an agent, supposedly has all these Russian sources. And why would this woman Elizabeth Dibble be on your list. She was the deputy chief of the Mission in London for the state department? That seems like someone you might be looking at for one of the people put into the Trump campaign, allegedly, as an informant, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well I wouldn't go there but the two parallel tracks here, you kind of touched on both of them. So one we have the London episode, somehow information made it from the Australian government to the FBI. We believe that went through London and somehow went to the Obama state department but then ended up in the justice department. So that's one track, the second track is Christopher Steele. What on earth was Christopher Steele doing meeting with state department officials? Why was the Steele Dossier that supposedly the FBI was trying to get their hands on, why was that also going through the state department? So a lot of people had their hands on the Steele Dossier including many people in the media who knew about the Steele Dossier. And this is really a collapse. What we're having anything to do here as the legislative branch of government, we're having to do the work that the media won't do because there are very few in the media that actually cover this story to try to get to the bottom of it and that's part of what's taking so long. Typically you would have a free and fair and transparent media trying to get to the truth but in this case we haven't had that."

They are the ones who have completely destroyed the FBI and DOJ. How did they do that? They did that by digging up dirt, the Clinton campaign dug up dirt, put it into a dossier, fed into the FBI, and the FBI used our counterintelligence capabilities against a political campaign. That's what happened here. So the Democrats in the House and Senate, they continue to want to obfuscate. They continue to want to cover up. If we'd listened to the Democrats, we would have never even found out that the Democrats and Hillary Clinton paid Christopher Steele to generate this dirt on President Trump. So I tend to ignore everything that they say. We continue to do our work day in and day out to get you the truth, and gradually we are gritty to the truth. And I believe as these hearings take place and testimony is are given to Congress, it will be much needed sunlight in this investigation. I think the American people will begin to see who is telling the truth and who's not telling the truth."

With someone like a Victoria Nuland, other Obama State Department people, and maybe even Joseph Pientka who interviewed Michael Flynn, he could -- sources tell me he could be a potential whistleblower to tell what he actually understood in that interview, namely, reportedly that Michael Flynn did not lie."

He said he wanted to respect the process, didn't get into specifics. But he added that is, and he added this with emphasis, \"My wife, my daughter, and my son have my first loyalty and always will. I put family and country first.\" Nothing there about loyalty to President Trump. In fact, he didn't praise President Trump at all during that 45-minute interview."

Predictably the suggestion that he would not pledge loyalty to the president meant only one thing to the never Trump crowd. He's going to flip. Is that really the case? Let's bring in Dan Bongino, NRA TV host, and Chris Hahn, former aide to senator Chuck Schumer. Dan, we've been hearing that Michael Cohen is going to flip. I think you and I were talking about this last week. He's going to flip, he's going to flip, he's going to flip. So Stephanopoulos sits down, he got the very dramatic photo sitting across from each other with a guy whose basic potential jail time. I don't blame him to be worried about his family. But it has to always be through the prism of, OK, we have more bad news for Donald Trump. What is this?"

We actually had a journalist leave at network today supposedly because of reporting that story in advance. I'm really getting tired of it. You're right, you do have to view this through the prism of the media that just can't stand Donald Trump. We don't know what is going on in Cohen's head. Is he trying to cozy up to the media to get the media on his side to a public pressure campaign. But Laura, the one takeaway from this I think the audience needs to understand is this is clearly now an investigation into a person, not a crime. The investigation is into Donald Trump. They will do anything to get him. This has nothing to do with collusion, we know it because it was referred to the southern district from the special counsel. So they are looking for Trump. They're not looking for a crime."

He's playing games of the American people. If he has information that is damaging to this president, and I know for a fact that he does, then he should come forward and state it and disclose it now. What he's doing is playing games by giving these off-camera interviews, like you saw today."

      "speaker": "CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER",
      "utterance": "I don't know. I don't know what Michael Avenatti was trying to say there. Here is what my takeaway is. Two weeks ago when we were talking about him potentially flipping we were reacting to an ABC News story which had a single byline, George Stephanopoulos. Today, he gave an interview to George Stephanopoulos. So I don't know if those two things are connected, but they might be. So we don't know if they are going to do and what he might have. As for the attorneys leaving, which was a big conversation and him taking on a new attorney, that has been a sign that people are about to make a deal and maybe he is about to make a deal. What he is going to make that deal on, I don't know. But there is nobody in America that knows Donald Trump better than Michael Cohen, at least as far as a lawyer goes. And we know he was the president's fixer. But we already know those things. So we want to know exactly what else the guy has. As far Flynn, Flynn did flip. And next week, he will be in court, and we all know exactly --"

He knows for a fact it's going to be damaging to the president. Going back to Dan's point, this is about Trump. If Mueller sends it down to the southern extract, or Rosenstein sends it down to the southern district after Mueller sends it to Rosenstein, and gets down there, and now you can do things, you can look for information in a new venue with someone, you're right, who is closer to the president."

Whether it's a parking ticket, you want a parking ticket and say I can't wait in line, or a speeding ticket, yes, I need you to handle it. A fixer, meaning fix the situation, I am going to pay you a lot of money per hour for you to fix my problem. So when they say it's a fixer, that is just more spin, more lingo.

That is where we ended up. And I don't think that is where the country ever understood that the special prosecutor to end up through all these side channels, to end up with this southern district.

But they now use this criminal imagery. Trump is jailing babies. They are criminalizing parenthood with the separation of families. The concentration camps, the detention centers are concentration camps. It's all -- it's beyond descriptive. It is descriptive in this criminal, over-the-top, purposely outrageous manner.

Jen Rubin is a person who not only endorsed Mitt Romney and pushed very hard for Mitt Romney. Just a few years ago she was suggesting that Roe v. Wade needed to be overturned. Now she says that any judge who is appointed to the Supreme Court by President Trump cannot want to overturn Roe v. Wade. There's a certain derangement obviously that's set in with a lot of people where they have reversed principles that they supposedly once specifically because they don't like Donald Trump, which I find not only troubling but morally vacuous. And when you look at Jen Rubin saying stuff like Sarah Huckabee Sanders should be made uncomfortable for life and she doesn't have a right to be comfortable in the United States. She does have a right to basically not be mobbed when she goes out to a gas station or when she goes out to eat dinner. The same people who are saying bake the cake to religious bakers are saying that it's a wonderful thing when a restaurant owner decides to deny service to someone based on political affinity. Now, what people are the left have even gone further than that. They are talking about not just about restaurant owners saying they don't want Trump employees in their establishment. They are talking about how it is now Ok for mobs to descend on other people's establishments and drive people out of those establishments. That is what happened to Kirstjen Nielsen.
