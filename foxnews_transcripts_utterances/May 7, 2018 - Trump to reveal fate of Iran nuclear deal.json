I hope everybody he's talking to knows that. But in my opinion what he's doing is inappropriate and he shouldn't be doing it."

      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "I think he explained it pretty well. John Kerry was not negotiating on behalf of the U.S. government, but what he did was inappropriate. But what's interesting, if John Kerry wanted to lobby somebody, he should be lobbying Donald Trump. If he's over in Europe he's talking to people who already agree with him and have failed, although they tried mightily, to convince Donald Trump to stay in the agreement and try to negotiate some other side agreements to address his concerns about Iran's bad behavior."

    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "I certainly haven't gotten any other indicate. But the big questions remain. What happens after we pull out? The sanctions snap back on our end. The Europeans, the other signatories to this deal, say they are not going to put back sanctions. So what does that mean? If European companies keep on doing business with Iran, does Donald Trump sanction those European countries? This I think will be the biggest rift between Trump and our European allies ever, bigger than Paris, bigger than moving the embassy in Jerusalem, bigger than TPP. This is a big split. And you just had Merkel and Macron over here trying everything they could think of to get him to stay in."

      "utterance": "This is a problem with the Iran deal in the first place, how the Obama administration went about it. It should have been a treaty. It should have gone through Congress. Because they did an end run around Congress and tried to call it not a treaty, it can be undone without having to go through Congress. That's a position that everyone is facing right now, and I think there is every indication that Trump is going to pull out as of tomorrow."

      "utterance": "The president has been right to call attention to it. Buy you've got to do that without just throwing the baby out with a bottle water, without scrapping the whole thing. If you do that, you have to answer the question, what next? What if the Iranians do rush for a nuclear weapon. Are we seriously saying that we're going to bomb those facilities at Qom and Fordow and Natanz? Is that really a realistic possibility? Or do we work with what we've got and push back on Iran together."

      "utterance": "Obviously it's a bad deal. And obviously Barack Obama could have gotten a better deal. And one of the things that's very frustrating about it is the U.S. gave a lot at the front end with the hopes that Iran would have more to provide at the backend. So I think Mara is absolutely right here. The question is, you can agree that it's a bad deal, but what happens now? What happens if the U.S. departs but Iran and Europe stay together? Are we going to do secondary sanctions? What is the plan after this? It might be better to have some kind of construct around Iran than no construct, even though I think it's hard to say this is anything other than a very bad deal."

      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "The argument against that is they're not parallel. In other words, Michael Flynn was going to be a U.S. official really soon, so he could act as a shadow diplomats and say just in a matter of weeks here's what we're going to be doing. But John Kerry is not negotiating on behalf of the United States government with anybody. He's over there as a private citizen."

We tell the whole world, America, Europe, the east and the west, we will not negotiate with anyone over our country's weapons and defense. We will build and stockpile weapons, equipment, and missiles as much as our country requires."

They're doing everything they can to try and stay in this deal, and I think that's one of the tells. I'd also just add with John Kerry, if he wants to lobby and he wants to advocate, write an op-ed in the New York Times, send an open letter. But to meet privately with a foreign minister covertly to try and do this, that is unethical. That is inappropriate, as Joe Lieberman said.
