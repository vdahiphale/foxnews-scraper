According to an explosive piece in The Hill, the Russian lawyer entered the country without a visa because the Obama Justice Department cleared her -- it was something about extraordinary circumstances -- just before she suckered Donald Jr. into that weird meeting.

Did the media know about this and ignore it because it didn't fit the story? A mysterious Russian is granted special entry, then pulls a bait and switch on a naive private citizen, a citizen who happens to be a Trump. So, who is colluding now? But it's obvious why the media embraced this latest Russian story, because what that woman did to Donald Jr. is exactly what the media does to the public every day since the election. They bait, then switch. They promise something juicy that when you hear them out, it is emptier than a protester's resume. And when their hysteria is met with public disgust, what does the media do? Rather than admit to their compulsive overselling, they blame those who question them. Suddenly, it is your fault for being skeptical. It is your fault when their mania trumps back, it is your fault for their addiction to re-litigating the past. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They say when you are a hammer everything becomes a nail.
