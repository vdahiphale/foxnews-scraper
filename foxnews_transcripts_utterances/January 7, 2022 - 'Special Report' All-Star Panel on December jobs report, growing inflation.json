The unemployment rate, though, dropping to 3.9 percent from 4.2. Let's bring in our panel, Morgan Ortagus, former State Department spokesperson, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital, and Bill McGurn, columnist for \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Bill, let me start with you. It's clear that people are leaving jobs. Some are saying, the president is saying, others are saying that they are looking for better jobs, and there are jobs that are open. That's the unemployment rate. But what about the state of the U.S. economy? BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes, well, look, there is some good news. There is demand. And there is a lot of jobs to offer. Tight labor market means that some wages are going to go up. But I think we have to put this in perspective. We still have more than 3 million fewer jobs today than in February, 2020. We have a lot of work to do to catch up. And I think looming over this is the prospect of stagflation. I don't think Joe Biden has the slightest idea how to deal with the inflation, and the longer he waits, the worse it's going to get.",

Our unemployment rate at 3.9 percent. The Dow is up almost 20 percent for 2021, the Nasdaq up 21 percent, the S&P 500 up 27 percent. And wages are up. But let's be clear, we still have some inflation worries, real inflation worries. I heard Charles Payne on a little earlier, and I thought he about nailed it in terms of what the challenges are. If I were president, or advising this president, rather, I would have Marty Walsh who for a lot of reasons, I think he is smart and I just like listening to the guy, I'd put him in charge of a task force where we would have daily if not two or three times a week updates on what we are doing to ease the supply chain, because I think that's what is contributing most to inflation. I think the worry amongst economists, they may worry about it differently. Some may think it's transitory, some may think it's more permanent. One thing they all agree upon is that inflation is here. How too we ease that, and how do we ensure that main street can continue to thrive in 22?",

I thought that Justice Alito summed it up best today when talking about the OSHA mandate for private employers. He said the mandate was essentially like trying to squeeze an elephant through a mouse hole. And I thought that was just such an adept way of describing this, what many conservatives believe is a total overreach by the -- by the administration. I thought it was really interesting, because we know that the Supreme Court is hearing two cases. They are hearing about that private employer mandate. But they are also, they separately listened to the case for federal -- for healthcare workers who get federal funding. They seem perhaps maybe to be a little bit more open to that kind of mandate. But what's clear is that so far, at least in what I heard in the arguments today, is that the justices are concerned that Congress did not pass this mandate, that it's being done administratively, and just way too much power at the hands of the executive. I also think that this will be potentially, if they rule the way we think they will based off the questioning today, big win for people fighting for conservative judges to get them in for a long time.

I don't want the courts to have it, but I don't want an unelected administrative agency to have it either. It belongs to Congress. If Congress wants it, Congress should write it explicitly. That's what the Supreme Court said when they threw out the eviction notice that the CDC was having. I think this is a clear question, go back to the -- go back to Congress if you think this is right.
