And we want to make certain that we shore Israel up, that we also provide provisions in this legislation for Jordan, who is a key regional ally, vitally important, as we look at the Middle East. And what we have seen from the Democrats is just obstruction. They have voted against this twice.

I think it is appropriate to say that the military is looking at a systematic, stable process of withdrawing troops from Syria, but also of the U.S. maintaining this leadership, moving toward stability in the Middle East. And you will see that continue. Secretary Pompeo, you also have John Bolton who is working on these issues. And, Maria, what we want to make certain is that, as our military moves forward, they have the tools, the training, the equipment that they need to do their job, that we are listening to the commanders that are on the ground there, and, whether it is the diplomatic or the military side, that we are working in a -- in a coordinated and cohesive way to make certain that we protect Americans."

We know that the majority of Americans are opposing the border wall, 54 percent, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. But those numbers, this gap is actually lessening here. So it looks like the American people are recognizing that a border security is of the utmost importance. Let me ask you, should the president declare a national emergency here?"

More Americans are looking at this, and they are saying -- I hear it from Tennesseans every single day -- look, stop the drug traffickers, the human traffickers, the gangs from coming in this country, because, until that southern border is secure, you are going to have every state a border state and every town a border town. And they want to get this issue resolved, securing that border. And, Maria, it's important to realize, walls work. Ask Israel. Walls work. Look at the Border Patrol. They say they need three things. And they tell us this regularly. They need a barrier. They need technology. And they need more border agents and officers that are there on the ground to help with this situation. And trafficking has dropped in areas where there is a border wall. You have less illegal entry. And that is what they're saying that they need. So I think that it is outrageous that they do not want to give the Border Patrol what they need to secure the border and to secure the sovereignty of this nation."

We already have some sort of barrier across 30 percent of the border. To go to 40 percent is a moral issue? It just tells me this is politics. And the disappointing thing is, the country -- the best interests of the country do not seem to be the first consideration. It's all about political positioning."

And for the Democratic leadership to say, absolutely not, we will not negotiate, is unfair to them. And I will tell you something else, Maria. If I were someone who had a dreamer in my family -- and I talked with someone yesterday who's helping a family. Two children are dreamers. Two were born here. And you know what? They were expressing their frustration that the Democratic leadership is not coming to the table, when they know the president and Republicans have said, let's address the dreamer issue. Let's secure the southern border. Let's get government reopened. And I think that more people are becoming frustrated.

Also, Maria, I -- I wanted to talk with him about running the agency, the leadership that he would bring to bear there, which I think is vitally important for the Department of Justice, to have leadership that is seasoned. And he would be a steady hand. And I think that is what you will see. He's been in retirement for 10 years. Basically, he is coming out of retirement to serve President Trump. And I was thinking back through some of the previous attorney generals. And I got to tell you, when you look at William Barr, I think you see somebody who's going to be a 180 or an exact opposite of what Eric Holder was.

And there's a lot out there. Donald Trump's administration has given us a lot to look at. But I'll give you one example. I'll give you two examples. One is foreign. The president tweets that we will be out of Syria in 30 days, no questions asked, right? That's a lot of money. That's a very different way of operating in the Middle East. But now his secretary of state and the national security adviser, John Bolton, are saying, no, we're going to be there until every last Iranian boot is out. Those are two contradictory statements coming from the same administration. The representatives of the people and the people in this country who pay for those missions have a right to know what the truth is. And then you have got Scott Pruitt at the EPA.

I don't think anybody wants a repeat of what happened in Iraq. I wouldn't have done it the way that President Trump did. I think we have got to protect our Kurdish allies. I do think we have got to be in a position to push back against the Iranians and the Russians.

We have four or five senior Trump administration and campaign officials who are going to jail for lying about their contacts with Russia. And we learned in the last 48 hours, of course, that the FBI was concerned that the president might have actually been working, wittingly or unwittingly, for the Russians.

We know that Hillary Clinton worked with Russians in terms of that dossier. Are you going to pursue that circumstantial evidence, the way you have -- you say you have this circumstantial evidence? I only bring this up, Congressman, because this has been a circus of this constant talk of collusion in the zeitgeist, and we still have yet to see any real evidence.

The president calling it the most insulting article that he's ever seen and been written about him. Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is Republican Congressman from Ohio Jim Jordan. He is the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee. He serves also on the Judiciary Committee. Good to see you, Congressman. Thanks very much for joining us."

    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, you were exactly right about the dossier. When the dossier was taken to the court, they didn't tell the court that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee had paid for it. They had some footnote with some convoluted candidate A, campaign B. It was the most convoluted way you could ever try to describe anything. No one got it. The judge didn't get it. They didn't -- they were not clear with FISA court that one party's campaign had paid for this dossier, put this dossier together, opposition research. They dressed it up, make it look like legitimate intelligence, took it to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on the other campaign. That wasn't clearing in the dossier. So that was the first thing that I think he was wrong on and you were right about."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "It seems to me that this whole thing has been set up so neatly, where Jim Comey gets a special counsel in place. It's an active investigation. Robert Mueller is doing this investigation. And you can't question anything about the behavior of that cabal of people at the top of the FBI in 2016 and their behavior, because it's all under the auspices of, oh, it's an active investigation."

We have had I don't know how many depositions where we have had key people in there, Jim Baker, Lisa Page and others, that we have deposed in our investigation in the Congress. And time and time again, we will ask the question. Oh, no, no, no, can't ask that, might interfere with the Mueller investigation. And yet think about this. Their first big hearing, their first big hearing, they're bringing in a convicted felon who's the star witness in the Mueller investigation. And yet they're going to have him in an open -- open hearing environment answering questions, Michael Cohen, which I think is strange."

Their first big hearing, they're bringing in a convicted felon. You know what one of the things Michael Cohen was convicted of? He's going to prison in two months. Lying to Congress. And your first big hearing, you're bringing in a guy in front of Congress who's going to prison for lying to Congress. So that's where the Democrats are. The other thing in the Himes interview is, this idea, the dossier was never verified. James Comey said salacious, unverified."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Of course, the FBI opened an inquiry into whether Trump was secretly working on behalf of Russia. What prompted this? Your reaction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Well, the firing of Comey is what prompted it. Think about -- you got to remember who's involved here and when it happened. The who are Andy McCabe, deputy director of the FBI, who lied three times under oath and has been fired, Lisa Page, who was demoted at the FBI and then left, and Peter Strzok, the deputy head of counterintelligence, who was demoted and then fired from the FBI. These are the people who were -- who are saying that they launched a counterintelligence investigation into the president. When did they do it? Right after their good buddy Jim Comey was fired. So, this critical eight-day period between May 9, 2017, when Comey is fired, and May 17, 2017, when Robert Mueller is named special counsel, that's when all this was going on. And, Maria, the other key thing that was going on this time, this is when Rod Rosenstein is alleged to have told subordinates at the Justice Department he was thinking about wearing a wire to record the president of the United States and contemplating -- these people were contemplating invoking the 25th Amendment and going after the president. This is when all of this happened. So the who, all these people with a deep bias against the president. And the when, right after Comey is fired is when all this took place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So where does this go now? Nothing came out of that investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "There's nothing new. Yes, there's nothing. These are the same people, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. We know they had this bias. Here -- oh, here's the other interesting thing. On May 18, there's a text message that Peter Strzok sends to Lisa Page where he's contemplating whether he's going to go on the Mueller team, where he says, there's no there there. So, even up to that point, they knew there was nothing there, because there's been no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. And there never was. So he knew that. And when he sends that text message, that just underscores the fact that this is the same information and the same people with this deep animus, deep bias against the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So how is it possible then that we haven't seen anything from the Robert Mueller investigation? Can this go on limitless?"

    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "I mean, you would have to ask Robert Mueller. All I know is, a year-and-a-half now, not one bit of evidence to show any type of coordination, collusion, conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to impact the election."

Rod Rosenstein has yet and it's been three-and-a-half months ago now that The New York Times reported that he's alleged to have said these things. When we interviewed Jim Baker -- this is the other name that's important -- Jim Baker, former chief counsel at the FBI, before he was demoted and then left, former chief counsel -- he testified to us that he believes what was alleged that Mr. Rosenstein said, he believes it happened. He believes Rod Rosenstein was in fact talking about wearing a wire, was in fact talking about invoking the 25th Amendment.

We hope that happens soon, because, again, we haven't -- we haven't seen any type of coordination at all there yet. And I don't think we will, because I don't think there was any. But I think -- I think he's -- he should be in charge. He's the attorney general. And I think he's told the senators that he will let the Mueller investigation wind down."

I mean, we have a constitutional duty to provide oversight, to make sure Americans' tax dollars are being used the way they're supposed to be in the executive branch of our federal government. Our job is the truth. But I will tell you this. I'm going to defend the president every time I think he's getting a raw deal. And it sure looks like he's getting a raw deal on this whole FBI investigation and what -- what's played out, what the FBI did. Never forget what happened at the top levels of the FBI, James Comey fired, Andy McCabe, deputy director, fired, James Baker, chief counsel, demoted, then left, Lisa Page, FBI counsel, demoted, then left, and Peter Strzok, deputy head of counterintelligence, demoted, then fired.

Obviously, a lot of tough questions will be coming both from Republicans, because there are some tough issues, challenges for the attorney general, for the Department of Justice these days. And, obviously, the Democrats will be very curious, most curious about Bill Barr's policies. I think, on criminal justice, he's known as a very tough law and order kind of person. And, obviously, with the passage of the new crime bill, perhaps there's a different -- there's a shift in thinking about criminal justice. And, obviously, there will be a lot of questions about Bill Barr's view about the Mueller investigation, allowing the investigation go forward. As has been reported already, he's talked to -- he's reassured members, certain members of Congress, that he believes investigation should continue. And so -- but there will still be a lot of questions about that and also about the scope of presidential power. Today, we're talking a lot about emergency power, the declaration -- the ability of a president to declare an emergency. And so I'm sure he's going to get a lot of questions about the scope of presidential power vis-a-vis the role of Congress in terms of oversight. So these are the kinds of questions I think Bill Barr is going to be asked about."

      "utterance": "Should there -- well, typically, it's the Department of -- the head of the Department of Justice who provides oversight. And, of course, Bob Mueller then provides a report that goes to the attorney general, provide it to the White House. And there will have to be a decision made as to whether or not that report is provided to Congress. And, if so, is it going to be redacted? Will there be a summary? So these are the kinds of decisions that will happen. But, yes, there's -- there's an oversight -- there should be oversight on every executive branch official. As a practical matter and, ideally, that oversight is provided by the head of the Department of Justice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So that would be -- that would be, you would expect, William Barr. Will William Barr, do you think, be forced to recuse himself from the Mueller investigation for any way? I know that that has been an argument out there, certainly on the left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GONZALES",
      "utterance": "Well, he obviously wrote this -- this memo to the department questioning the authority of the special counsel to investigate the president with respect to obstruction. And so that creates a possible -- an appearance of possible bias and prejudice. And so, if I'm Bill Barr, I'm going to have a conversation with the career ethics officials at the Department of Justice and get their advice. And then he will have to make a decision as to whether or not to follow that advice. I think, as a practical matter, you take a political hit sometimes if you do not follow the advice from career officials. But, again, every -- every attorney general is different. Every situation is different. And that will be a decision that people will want -- will watch very carefully."

      "speaker": "GONZALES",
      "utterance": "Well, there will be an oversight by some Senate-confirmed individual. There will be -- I suspect there will be a designation or they will follow the chain of command. So it would flow to the next in the line of command, which would be the deputy attorney general or the acting deputy attorney general. It would then flow to the solicitor general. So someone would have oversight. It -- you cannot have an executive branch official operating without someone conducting oversight over that official."

      "utterance": "Your reaction to John Bolton asking the Pentagon for options to strike Iran?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIEBERMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, to me, it was a very reasonable and rational thing for John Bolton to do. Think about it. Iranian-backed militias, extremists fired mortars in the vicinity of our embassy in Baghdad and our consulate in Basra, Iraq. I mean, that's -- that's a sort of declaration of war. But let's not go that far. It was a hostile act. And if you let a country like Iran get away with it, they will do it again. And next time, they will hit our embassy or our consulate. So I think what John Bolton did, in asking for military options for the president, who always will make the decision in the end, was rational. It's just what I would guess the Obama administration did even in the midst of negotiating the nuclear deal, which I thought was terrible, that they had military fallbacks in case the negotiations didn't work, and Iran broke out and started to build a nuclear weapon."
