      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. So much drama, you can't say we're not learning a lot, though. And one topic we've learned a lot about over the last year is Russia and the reason we've learned about it is because Russia is Joe Biden's number one favorite topic of conversation. Joe Biden can talk about Russia forever, meaning in his case for up to four minutes at a time, which at this stage is Joe Biden's version of a filibuster. You may have asked yourself, when will Joe Biden ever stop talking about Russia? Well, very soon actually, in fact, he seems to be losing his train of thought right now. But don't worry, he'll be back to it. Russia is a very comfortable topic for Joe Biden. He enjoys talking about it much more than talking about say inflation, or crime, or fentanyl deaths, or about how half the population of Haiti appears to be showing up in Florida in leaky boats. Those topics may interest you since you live in this country, but not Joe Biden. Despite appearances, Biden doesn't actually live here. In his head, Joe Biden is floating high above the Sea of Azov, swooping in over southeastern Ukraine like a Botox superhero, just to make sure everything is okay with his little buddies, the Ukrainians. Joe Biden is their protector that way. But he's also at the same time a scholar and a teacher, not a credentialed educator like the doctor he is married to, Joe Biden didn't go to Community College in Delaware for a Doctorate in Diversity Studies. He's just a civilian. But Biden can still lecture with the best of him. If you signed up for his intro to Russia is bad class this semester, you will not be disappointed. Professor Biden knows that material cold. So, what have we learned so far? Well, first and foremost, Russia is bad. That's the name of the course. It's the entire syllabus actually. It may be the only fact you will come away with after months of heavy coursework. Russia is bad. Learn that and you will ace the exam. Now, to be clear, we're talking about Russia here. We're not talking about the Soviet Union. There's a difference and Joe Biden has been around long enough to know what that difference is. He has seen it firsthand. The Soviets wanted peace. Joe Biden told us that repeatedly in the 70s and 80s. Russia, by contrast, just wants war. The Russians are warlike people, it is inherent. Russians are driven by bloodlust. They have tiny brains. Their breath smells like herring. They're always drunk often on aftershave or household cleaning products. On Sunday mornings, when good people are still asleep at home with their families, your average Russian will still be lurking through the dark streets, leering through bloodshot eyes, trying to subvert somebody else's democracy or conquer a peace-loving neighbor. It's just who Russians are, it's what they do. But if there's one thing you absolutely must know about Russia, if you're going to navigate this world, that thing is that on February 16, 2022, Vladimir Putin is going to invade our closest ally in the world, Ukraine. So write that down -- February 16, 2022, Ukraine invasion begins. That's the day. Joe Biden has been very clear about that, so were the Intel agencies and of course, their stenographers in the news media. As Politico put it, quote, \"Russia will start a physical assault on Ukraine as soon as February 16, multiple U.S. officials confirmed.\" A physical assault. But this won't be your typical physical assault like the kind you've experienced in the New York City subway, no. According to POLITICO, this physical assault quote, \"Could be preceded by a barrage of missile strikes and cyberattacks.\" So these aren't just gang members, they're Russians. \"The Daily Mail\" confirmed POLITICO's reporting, quote, \"Putin has decided to invade Ukraine on Wednesday,\" read the headline, \"Brits and Americans told to get out now.\" That same day, \"The Mirror\" in London let us know they had seen Vladimir Putin's planning documents and Operation Snuff Out Ukrainian Democracy was already in motion, quote, \"Russian invasion of Ukraine set for 3:00 AM tomorrow with missiles and tank attack.\" So February 16, 2022 was definitely the day the music was going to die in Ukraine. Everybody knew that. But weirdly, nobody thought to tell the President of Ukraine who is an obedient puppet of the Biden State Department, you might think would have heard the news, but no, he hadn't. He was baffled by it. He said this quote: \"We are told that February 16th will be the day of the attack. We will make it a Day of Unity. The relevant decree has already been signed. On this day, we will hang national flags, wear blue and yellow ribbons and show the world our unity.\" That was President Zelensky. Now keep in mind that in addition to being a puppet of the Biden administration, President Zelensky of Ukraine was also at one point, a low grade comic of some kind. So he was kidding, that was a joke. But in the American news media, there are no jokes. Humor has been banned for several years now. In fact, at this point, you're more likely to hear a joke on a Russian news broadcast than on American television, which is pretty amazing if you think about it. Things have changed. In any case, the readers of teleprompter on our TV channels did not get this joke at all, so here's the coverage they produced.",

Doddering old Joe Biden, who even before he was senile was widely considered a moron in Washington, has been played by Vladimir Putin, who may be evil but definitely is not stupid. If Putin bluffed an invasion of Ukraine to make Biden look ridiculous, it worked. Maybe there was something else going on. Maybe Putin still plans to invade Ukraine. It's hard to know. But as you just heard, Joe Biden doesn't know because he refuses to talk to the Russians. The Russians are too immoral for Joe Biden. That's saying a lot coming from a former credit card lobbyist who helped run America's most corrupt state. But according to Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin is not someone you can ever talk to because he put bounties on the lives of American troops in Afghanistan. How does Joe Biden know that happened? Well, he got it from the very same people who spent all last month telling us that Putin was going to invade Ukraine on February 16th. Here they are.",

We weren't achieving anything, obviously. The second we left, the Taliban took over and became one of the best armed militaries in the entire region. So what we were doing wasn't working, but they didn't want us to leave. In fact, they were willing to lie to keep us there. Why?

It's a client state of the Biden administration. It's a place in which opposition media and opposition political candidates are completely shut down by the government, it is not a democracy at all, and it is insulting they would suggest otherwise. But people like that, and many people in Washington are pushing Ukraine toward war. So we are sending them weapons, and then making it very easy for them to use them.

But yet for months now, they told us Russia is definitely going to manufacture a pretext for a Ukraine invasion. So finally, a lone AP reporter bravely asked, how do you know this? And they immediately accused him of working for Putin. He's pretty much the only reporter who asked a question like that. And there's a depressing irony to that. Matt Taibbi put it very nicely this morning in a piece on \"Substack.\" Quote: \"A big reason we're supposed to be an improvement over Putin's Russia,\" Taibbi wrote, \"... is that we don't use the news media is an instrument of information warfare.\" At least Russian reporters don't have much choice in being conscripted for this duty. What's the excuse of Westerners who broadcast C.I.A. gibberish on command? Well, that's a very good question, and the answer is they have no excuse.

Remember last week when a GoFundMe account supported the truckers and it raised $9 million and then was quickly suspended? Well, those donors decided to fund the protest using cryptocurrency, so the Canadian government is now using anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financial rules to crack down on cryptocurrency, ordering financial firms to freeze 34 crypto wallets linked to the truckers. So far, they've frozen $870,000.00 on top of the $9 million already locked up.

I really think -- I'm not even being crazy about this -- I think Hillary is going to be the choice. In fact, Tucker, Hillary is so excited about getting this opportunity in 2024, that she is already kicking herself that she didn't bail out the BLM attempted murder in Louisville herself, right? I mean, and if you look at what's going on right now, they're already stifling stories about her on Facebook. You can't share the FOX News story about the Durham investigation that effectively appears that it is going to prove that Hillary Clinton's campaign was actually spying on Donald Trump, just like you couldn't share all of the Hunter Biden stories from \"The New York Post\" and FOX and everywhere else, even though we now know that that's true. And so when you analyze this situation, I think they're going to toss Hillary out there. And I think she's going to get destroyed, because here's the real question, Tucker, and I'd love to hear you think about how the Democrats are going to spin this. If Biden doesn't run, it is sexist and racist by the Democratic Party's own standards if Kamala Harris isn't the nominee, so at least if they go with Hillary, they can cross off the sexist part, it'll still be racist, but she'll only be half wrong and half worthy of condemnation.",

Well, there's a website called REAL News Michiana, and it turns out according to their reporting, Buttigieg does not a very good track record when it comes to fixing roads. His so-called keystone traffic initiative that he put into place as Mayor of South Bend reportedly led to the death of an 11-year-old boy. That initiative deactivated a non-essential traffic light, and the boy was struck by a truck. Casey Hendrickson is the host of \"The Burning Truth\" in South Bend, Indiana, and we're happy to have him join us tonight. Casey, thanks so much for coming on. And I wish we had talked to you earlier before Joe Biden made this guy in charge of all of our infrastructure, but what kind of a job did he do running the infrastructure of South Bend? CASEY HENDRICKSON, HOST, \"THE BURNING TRUTH\": Well, first of all, I would like to say that we're not going to apologize for him because I tried to warn everybody about this. When he was being considered for Ambassador to China. That made sense, Tucker, but when he was made the Transportation Secretary, I think we laughed collectively in my studio for about an hour, because he has zero success in infrastructure planning in South Bend at all. Everything he touched, that dealt with transportation was a miserable failure, including smart streets, which got Tristan killed, and he was warned about that. He was told that there was serious issues with there being no lights and people going to that bus depot at seven in the morning. It doesn't get light until around eight o'clock in South Bend in the wintertime. So you can't see children crossing the street, and people have been hit at these roundabouts, especially in front of the hospital for a long time and this is supposed to be the pedestrian friendly revamping of downtown South Bend.",

      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. So much drama, you can't say we're not learning a lot, though. And one topic we've learned a lot about over the last year is Russia and the reason we've learned about it is because Russia is Joe Biden's number one favorite topic of conversation. Joe Biden can talk about Russia forever, meaning in his case for up to four minutes at a time, which at this stage is Joe Biden's version of a filibuster. You may have asked yourself, when will Joe Biden ever stop talking about Russia? Well, very soon actually, in fact, he seems to be losing his train of thought right now. But don't worry, he'll be back to it. Russia is a very comfortable topic for Joe Biden. He enjoys talking about it much more than talking about say inflation, or crime, or fentanyl deaths, or about how half the population of Haiti appears to be showing up in Florida in leaky boats. Those topics may interest you since you live in this country, but not Joe Biden. Despite appearances, Biden doesn't actually live here. In his head, Joe Biden is floating high above the Sea of Azov, swooping in over southeastern Ukraine like a Botox superhero, just to make sure everything is okay with his little buddies, the Ukrainians. Joe Biden is their protector that way. But he's also at the same time a scholar and a teacher, not a credentialed educator like the doctor he is married to, Joe Biden didn't go to Community College in Delaware for a Doctorate in Diversity Studies. He's just a civilian. But Biden can still lecture with the best of him. If you signed up for his intro to Russia is bad class this semester, you will not be disappointed. Professor Biden knows that material cold. So, what have we learned so far? Well, first and foremost, Russia is bad. That's the name of the course. It's the entire syllabus actually. It may be the only fact you will come away with after months of heavy coursework. Russia is bad. Learn that and you will ace the exam. Now, to be clear, we're talking about Russia here. We're not talking about the Soviet Union. There's a difference and Joe Biden has been around long enough to know what that difference is. He has seen it firsthand. The Soviets wanted peace. Joe Biden told us that repeatedly in the 70s and 80s. Russia, by contrast, just wants war. The Russians are warlike people, it is inherent. Russians are driven by bloodlust. They have tiny brains. Their breath smells like herring. They're always drunk often on aftershave or household cleaning products. On Sunday mornings, when good people are still asleep at home with their families, your average Russian will still be lurking through the dark streets, leering through bloodshot eyes, trying to subvert somebody else's democracy or conquer a peace-loving neighbor. It's just who Russians are, it's what they do. But if there's one thing you absolutely must know about Russia, if you're going to navigate this world, that thing is that on February 16, 2022, Vladimir Putin is going to invade our closest ally in the world, Ukraine. So write that down -- February 16, 2022, Ukraine invasion begins. That's the day. Joe Biden has been very clear about that, so were the Intel agencies and of course, their stenographers in the news media. As Politico put it, quote, \"Russia will start a physical assault on Ukraine as soon as February 16, multiple U.S. officials confirmed.\" A physical assault. But this won't be your typical physical assault like the kind you've experienced in the New York City subway, no. According to POLITICO, this physical assault quote, \"Could be preceded by a barrage of missile strikes and cyberattacks.\" So these aren't just gang members, they're Russians. \"The Daily Mail\" confirmed POLITICO's reporting, quote, \"Putin has decided to invade Ukraine on Wednesday,\" read the headline, \"Brits and Americans told to get out now.\" That same day, \"The Mirror\" in London let us know they had seen Vladimir Putin's planning documents and Operation Snuff Out Ukrainian Democracy was already in motion, quote, \"Russian invasion of Ukraine set for 3:00 AM tomorrow with missiles and tank attack.\" So February 16, 2022 was definitely the day the music was going to die in Ukraine. Everybody knew that. But weirdly, nobody thought to tell the President of Ukraine who is an obedient puppet of the Biden State Department, you might think would have heard the news, but no, he hadn't. He was baffled by it."

      "speaker": "He said this quote",
      "utterance": "\"We are told that February 16th will be the day of the attack. We will make it a Day of Unity. The relevant decree has already been signed. On this day, we will hang national flags, wear blue and yellow ribbons and show the world our unity.\" That was President Zelensky. Now keep in mind that in addition to being a puppet of the Biden administration, President Zelensky of Ukraine was also at one point, a low grade comic of some kind. So he was kidding, that was a joke. But in the American news media, there are no jokes. Humor has been banned for several years now. In fact, at this point, you're more likely to hear a joke on a Russian news broadcast than on American television, which is pretty amazing if you think about it. Things have changed. In any case, the readers of teleprompter on our TV channels did not get this joke at all, so here's the coverage they produced."

So some news outlets had to update their reporting, but they were clearly annoyed with Zelensky quote, \"Ukrainian leader makes confusing joke about Russian invasion.\" Harrumphed \"New York\" Magazine. But here's the funniest part of all. There was no invasion. February 16th, 2022 was yesterday. Nothing happened. Vladimir Putin did not invade Ukraine. Now, if Joe Biden noticed the lack of an invasion, he didn't acknowledge that. He didn't say a word. Today, he was back on television assuring us once again, the invasion is coming."

Doddering old Joe Biden, who even before he was senile was widely considered a moron in Washington, has been played by Vladimir Putin, who may be evil but definitely is not stupid. If Putin bluffed an invasion of Ukraine to make Biden look ridiculous, it worked. Maybe there was something else going on. Maybe Putin still plans to invade Ukraine. It's hard to know. But as you just heard, Joe Biden doesn't know because he refuses to talk to the Russians. The Russians are too immoral for Joe Biden. That's saying a lot coming from a former credit card lobbyist who helped run America's most corrupt state. But according to Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin is not someone you can ever talk to because he put bounties on the lives of American troops in Afghanistan. How does Joe Biden know that happened? Well, he got it from the very same people who spent all last month telling us that Putin was going to invade Ukraine on February 16th. Here they are."

Everything that he has told you turned out to be untrue. They were lying. Why were they lying about that? Well, of course, to keep us in Afghanistan forever. Why would they want to do that, you ask? We weren't achieving anything, obviously. The second we left, the Taliban took over and became one of the best armed militaries in the entire region. So what we were doing wasn't working, but they didn't want us to leave. In fact, they were willing to lie to keep us there. Why? Well, we don't have any special intel, but we're thinking maybe the defense industry, profligate campaign donors may have had something to do with it.

And of course, they're promoting war, not to maintain the democracy that is Ukraine. Ukraine is not a democracy, it has never been a democracy in its history, and it is not now. It's a client state of the Biden administration. It's a place in which opposition media and opposition political candidates are completely shut down by the government, it is not a democracy at all, and it is insulting they would suggest otherwise. But people like that, and many people in Washington are pushing Ukraine toward war. So we are sending them weapons, and then making it very easy for them to use them. They told us now for months that any preemptive attack by Ukraine, actually isn't real. Have you seem Ukraine using these weapons? No, says Tony Blinken. That's not aggression. It's a false flag attack by Russia."

It could be a fabricated so- called terrorist bombing inside Russia. The invented discovery of the mass grave, a stage drone strike against civilians, or a fake, even a real attack using chemical weapons."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So they're going to use chemical weapons, but it won't actually be them. It'll be those diabolical Russians. Drunk on aftershave. Once again, there is zero evidence that any of this is true. This is clearly some sort of Intel op that's being filtered through the State Department and the media. But yet for months now, they told us Russia is definitely going to manufacture a pretext for a Ukraine invasion. So finally, a lone AP reporter bravely asked, how do you know this? And they immediately accused him of working for Putin. He's pretty much the only reporter who asked a question like that. And there's a depressing irony to that. Matt Taibbi put it very nicely this morning in a piece on \"Substack.\" Quote: \"A big reason we're supposed to be an improvement over Putin's Russia,\" Taibbi wrote, \"... is that we don't use the news media is an instrument of information warfare.\" At least Russian reporters don't have much choice in being conscripted for this duty. What's the excuse of Westerners who broadcast C.I.A. gibberish on command? Well, that's a very good question, and the answer is they have no excuse. Joe Kent has lived with the sad consequences of lies like these. He's a former member of the Army Special Forces. He's also running for Congress in Washington State. And of course, we're rooting for him. He joins us tonight. Joe Kent, thanks so much for coming on.

So just thank God right now we have independent journalists, we have social media, we have the work that you're doing, and we can call these people out and call them out for their lies.

For the first time ever, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau implemented the Emergencies Act giving him control over travel, the right to assemble, and now ordering banks to freeze the accounts of the Freedom Convoy, no due process, no warrants, no nothing. Remember last week when a GoFundMe account supported the truckers and it raised $9 million and then was quickly suspended? Well, those donors decided to fund the protest using cryptocurrency, so the Canadian government is now using anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financial rules to crack down on cryptocurrency, ordering financial firms to freeze 34 crypto wallets linked to the truckers. So far, they've frozen $870,000.00 on top of the $9 million already locked up. Finally, it's worth noting the Biden administration is also targeting digital currency by appointing a crypto czar and having the F.B.I. form a Digital Currency Unit. The hope is to target cyberattacks and ransomware groups that demand their fees in Bitcoin -- Tucker."

So in the name of promoting Hillary Clinton's next candidacy for President, we want to show you some excerpts of her speech today. Here's Hillary Clinton making some highly original points about voter suppression and insurrection. Watch."

      "speaker": "HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "When the Republican Party officially embraces violent insurrection as legitimate political discourse; when storming the Capitol, assaulting police officers, trying to overturn an election are being normalized we are in uncharted territory. Republicans are defending coup plotters. They're curbing voting rights at precisely the moment when democracy needs champions, when we should be standing together against autocracies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So it really was, as she put it, it was an attack on our democracy. It was an attack on our norms. Give that lady a daytime MSNBC show, but should she be the Democratic Party's presidential nominee once again? Maybe you're not fully convinced. We're going to show you a few more clips. Hillary Clinton has spent her last five years off honing her speaking skills. Here's Hillary Clinton responding to the news that her campaign spied on Donald Trump in the White House. Watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLINTON",
      "utterance": "And we can't get distracted whether it's by the latest culture war nonsense, or some new right-wing lie on FOX or Facebook. By the way, they've been coming after me again lately, in case you might have noticed. It's funny, the more trouble Trump gets into, the wilder the charges and conspiracy theories about me seem to get."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So as you can see, Facebook and FOX News are picking on the girl again. It's called misogyny. Will she break the glass ceiling? Of course, we're rooting for her. To our dismay, she did not commit to running in 2024, but she did promise to help the Democratic Party as much as she has in the past."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLINTON",
      "utterance": "They will do nothing to invest in our schools or make college more affordable. They'll ban books, but do nothing about guns. They'll make it harder for people to vote, but easier for big corporations to bust unions. They'll let polluters trash our environment and let Donald Trump trash our democracy. That's why I intend to work my heart out to elect Democrats up and down the ticket this November."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So what you're watching really is a triumph of emerging technology, that entire speech. In fact, everything inside Hillary Clinton's brain is a product of artificial intelligence. That was written by AI software. Maybe that's why you may have heard some of it before. Will it work? Now, Clay Travis is the man to ask. He was once an active Democrat, even volunteered for Bill Clinton's re-election campaign. We're going to mark him down as undecided for Hillary. He's the founder of Outkick, the host of \"The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show,\" he joins us tonight. So are you rooting for her, Clay Travis?"

      "speaker": "CLAY TRAVIS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think it's a sign of how bad things are for Democrats right now, Tucker, that Hillary really might be their best option in 2024. Now, she's going to get crushed, but she might be their best option. I mean, think about it. You've got Joe Biden, who would be 82 years old, and he's almost incapable of speech now. I can't imagine in three years how he is even going to be on the campaign trail. You've got Kamala Harris, who maybe is the least popular politician in the history of the world, which is saying something."

    {
      "speaker": "TRAVIS",
      "utterance": "You've got Mayor Pete who I think is still on paternity leave, Tucker. But if he's off paternity leave right now, by the way, he's also incapable of getting any Black support, and no one wants to talk about it. Remember, he went down to South Carolina, in the primary and got like two or three percent of the vote when Joe Biden, they decided -- Jim Clyburn did -- to make him the nominee, who else do they have? I really think -- I'm not even being crazy about this -- I think Hillary is going to be the choice. In fact, Tucker, Hillary is so excited about getting this opportunity in 2024, that she is already kicking herself that she didn't bail out the BLM attempted murder in Louisville herself, right? I mean, and if you look at what's going on right now, they're already stifling stories about her on Facebook. You can't share the FOX News story about the Durham investigation that effectively appears that it is going to prove that Hillary Clinton's campaign was actually spying on Donald Trump, just like you couldn't share all of the Hunter Biden stories from \"The New York Post\" and FOX and everywhere else, even though we now know that that's true. And so when you analyze this situation, I think they're going to toss Hillary out there. And I think she's going to get destroyed, because here's the real question, Tucker, and I'd love to hear you think about how the Democrats are going to spin this. If Biden doesn't run, it is sexist and racist by the Democratic Party's own standards if Kamala Harris isn't the nominee, so at least if they go with Hillary, they can cross off the sexist part, it'll still be racist, but she'll only be half wrong and half worthy of condemnation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I think that's an incisive point. I guess, my one disagreement would be on Hillary herself. Maybe when voters discover how oppressed she's been? I mean, she seems obviously like this sinister, entitled, you know, rich lady, who's had everything handed to her. She got a Senate seat because her husband was President, but when people learn that everyone's picking on her because she's a girl, don't you think like Oprah, she'll become very popular."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRAVIS",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I mean, that's her calling card, right? But she's going to get beaten in the oppression Olympics by Kamala Harris."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Good point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRAVIS",
      "utterance": "Kamala Harris has got race, right? I mean, if you have the pyramid of victimization lined up, which defines everything in the Democratic Party right now, Kamala Harris is at the apex, right? I mean, she is the ultimate victim as a Black woman, and if she is not allowed to be the nominee after being Vice President, then Hillary Clinton will be racist. Now, again, she can slide on the sexism angle, but I don't see how she gets past being racist under Democratic Party ideology right now. So I think, look, as much as I think Hillary would be the candidate, I think that Kamala Harris is going to racism her to death, and there's just no way for her to be the nominee. I don't know how she pulls it off."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Racist bridges. Now, we wanted to hear more from Pete Buttigieg. He's the Transportation Secretary now. He's breastfeeding today, so he couldn't join us. But we did want to know what his record on infrastructure was while Mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Well, there's a website called REAL News Michiana, and it turns out according to their reporting, Buttigieg does not a very good track record when it comes to fixing roads. His so-called keystone traffic initiative that he put into place as Mayor of South Bend reportedly led to the death of an 11-year-old boy. That initiative deactivated a non-essential traffic light, and the boy was struck by a truck. Casey Hendrickson is the host of \"The Burning Truth\" in South Bend, Indiana, and we're happy to have him join us tonight. Casey, thanks so much for coming on. And I wish we had talked to you earlier before Joe Biden made this guy in charge of all of our infrastructure, but what kind of a job did he do running the infrastructure of South Bend? CASEY HENDRICKSON, HOST, \"THE BURNING TRUTH\": Well, first of all, I would like to say that we're not going to apologize for him because I tried to warn everybody about this. When he was being considered for Ambassador to China. That made sense, Tucker, but when he was made the Transportation Secretary, I think we laughed collectively in my studio for about an hour, because he has zero success in infrastructure planning in South Bend at all. Everything he touched, that dealt with transportation was a miserable failure, including smart streets, which got Tristan killed, and he was warned about that. He was told that there was serious issues with there being no lights and people going to that bus depot at seven in the morning. It doesn't get light until around eight o'clock in South Bend in the wintertime. So you can't see children crossing the street, and people have been hit at these roundabouts, especially in front of the hospital for a long time and this is supposed to be the pedestrian friendly revamping of downtown South Bend."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So look, this is a new show, so we want both sides. We want to be fair, so I just have to ask you the question. Did he make the roads less racist, though? He obviously made them more dangerous, but did they become more equity oriented as mayor?"

    {
      "speaker": "HENDRICKSON",
      "utterance": "I suppose that's a great question. He's increased people's commute by about 13 minutes or so, and I would say to you probably made it more racist considering the demographic surrounding downtown South Bend, Tucker, because what he did is he effectively increased response time from first responders and there is some high crime areas around there that would primarily affect minorities in South Bend and he has actually made it a lot worse for them to get aid from first responders than before."

      "speaker": "HENDRICKSON",
      "utterance": "Go figure. Who knew? It's weird. Here's the thing. Tucker, Pete Buttigieg and his party have been talking about how South Bend has been systemically racist for as long as I've been here. There hasn't been a Republican mayor since before I was born, that had kept -- South Bend Common Council is dominated by Democrats. If South Bend is a systemically racist city, it is because the Democratic Party made it that way."

We're in charge now. Speaking of Justin Trudeau, tomorrow, a new precedent has been set in Canada. If the government doesn't like your political opinions, they can just seize your bank account. What does this mean for the West's financial system? It means something, that's for sure. In the meantime, we're out of time, we'll be back tomorrow night at eight and every weeknight. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and especially groupthink. Have the best night with the ones you love. Here is the Great Sean Hannity."
