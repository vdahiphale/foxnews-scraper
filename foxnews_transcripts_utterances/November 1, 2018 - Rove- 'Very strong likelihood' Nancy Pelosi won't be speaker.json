This time, the mother had apparently been in contact with her daughters in early October and knew they were in New York City, but the day before their bodies were found, the Associated Press says the mother told New York police detective that she got a call from the Saudi embassy in D.C. requesting the family leave the U.S. because the daughters had applied for asylum.

While some say, 5,000 troops, that the border is overkill, he now says he may send 10,000. And as critics claim that he can't overturn the birthright rule, he says he can.

It looks like the president's popularity is increasing in the Senate states where there are a lot of tight races. And basically, we've seen upward movement for the Republican candidate in Arizona, in both the Senate and governor's race. Missouri, Tennessee, North Dakota -- North Dakota House race and Senate race. Indiana is the only one that sort of breaks that trend. Which ones are you most focused on when you look at these new numbers tonight, Karl?"

The president's fav-unfav in approve-disapprove in North Dakota is 61-36. The closest to the states that you mentioned is Arizona where it's 52 percent approved, 46 percent disapprove. And that says significantly above his national average. So, where the president is doing well, 58-39 fave on fave, prove-disapprove in Tennessee. Our Republican candidates are doing well there as well."

    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yes. And look, I've been watching -- I've written about this tomorrow of my Wall Street Journal column. I've been looking at the early vote numbers. In Arizona, there 465,000 Republicans who've cast early ballots. 356,000 Democrats. 253,000 Independents. If you compare that to four years ago, the Republicans between the Republican's doing better than they did two years ago, excuse me. And Democrats doing worse than they did two years ago, the Republicans have a swing of 5.4 percent. Now, remember, they won one Arizona by about 3 1/2 percent last time around. So, if you've now suddenly got a five percent better Republican vote out of the early vote, that points to good -- to goodnight for Governor Ducey, and potentially for Martha McSally. Her issue is that she's doing extremely well among the base, she's got some soft Republicans who are sitting and out there trying to figure out should they vote for her, or send a protest vote. She -- and in once a strong campaign a message, but it's going to be along night, I think in Arizona."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, you know, until we said that there is some reporting tonight that the president is -- you know, really not happy with what he sees in terms of the momentum in the House races and he feels like some of these awful stories that we've had over the last week has hurt some of that momentum from a purely political perspective. So he's really focused on these themes of immigration, the caravan, the border, the 14th Amendment. Do you think that's a wise move politically for some of these races that are on the fence?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think -- I think, it is better than what we have been talking about, which is the IEDs in Pittsburgh. Both of those did not help the president. The caravan and immigration do help him, but he's got to be careful. Because, remember that the people that we're talking about here in a lot of these House districts are nominal Republicans, college-educated women. These are districts that were largely carried by Hillary Clinton that are at risk. They'd like to vote for a Republican, but he's got to be careful in pushing them away by going overboard on this. They are -- they are concerned. I looked at a poll in one of the battleground Senate states of Tennessee, where Bredesen has been dismissive of the caravan. By march of 6,227 people in his state are concerned about the caravan."

      "speaker": "ROVE",

I think the president would be better to be talking about what he would like to do without sentences -- without saying I want the Ways and Means Committee to do this."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, I mean, obviously there's so many numbers out there.  So many pollsters that are sort of taking a look at all of this. The Cook Report is estimating between 25 and 40 House seats go to Democrats. They need 23 to take over control. How does that number sound to you based on the numbers that you're seeing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's the most likely outcome. But it may not be the only outcome. And, there's an interesting story embedded, and let's assume for a moment, the Cook is right, you open the program by talking about Nancy Pelosi becoming speaker again. 46 Democratic candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives have said they will not support her. 11 members -- sitting members, current members of the Democratic caucus who are likely to comeback have said they will not support her for speaker. 40 Democratic candidates for Congress are on record, saying, \"I don't want to talk about it right now.\" So, if they get a 25 seat margin, I mean, (INAUDIBLE) they win 25 seats, so they got 220 votes, had -- and they need 218 to elect the speaker. What happens when you got 11 sitting Democrats who say, \"I'm not voting for.\"  And how many of those 46 Democrats who say I won't vote for if I get elected. How many of them get elected? I think it is highly, I think there's a very strong likelihood that Nancy Pelosi is not Speaker of the House if even if the Democrats take control of the House."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, our Fox News poll has a substantial lead for Donnelly. That's not what the rest of the public polls say, they say that this is a horse race and a majority of the recent polls have brought ahead. And then, I'm looking at the data from American Crossroads Senate Leadership Fund. And I, I think Braun is been improving his position and is slightly ahead today, and I think he's going to win."

    {
      "speaker": "BLAKE",
      "utterance": "Well, when we think about what's happening, clearly, momentum is on the Democratic side. Pretty much the only thing I agree with what Karl said is that it is likely that Democrats will take the House in this manner. It was quite ironic and comical that when they talked about how Republicans were doing well in the Fox polls, then they were great polls. But you look at the Indiana poll, all of a sudden that one can't be accurate in that manner. So, let's break down the numbers itself."
    },

      "utterance": "It's always, you know, yes. Happy Halloween, right? So, you know, we need 23 net pickups, there are 25 districts that Secretary Clinton defeated. Donald Trump has a Republican in it. There are 119 districts that are more competitive than the Khan Alam seat that we won before. The number one issue around the country is on health care and Medicaid expansion. So, we are very confident and what quite frankly, Martha, when we see what's happening with Donald Trump, all that we're seeing is a racist discriminatory distraction when talking about a caravan. I come from a military family background, my brother has -- Marc, you can shake your head all you want. My brother served to this country for 29 years. The notion of talking about 15,000 troops going down for a caravan, I won't be here for months, it's purely a deploy, and a stunt, into the distraction is disrespectful to all of those served in this country."

So, I've been through -- I've been to this rodeo before. But I don't think she should be setting off the fireworks. Just yet, that's a very confident statement. That was just made, but the reality is this there are -- there are -- to the Republicans do have an uphill battle in the in the House. There are 29 swing districts that are going to decide this election that control the House one way, other and 28 of those are Republicans who are -- who are -- who are fighting to keep their seats. The Democrats need to win 23 in order to pick it up. So, the Republicans really have to sweep those swing -- those swing states that are -- that are battlegrounds. But that doesn't mean they can't do it because those are Republican-leaning district, where the Republicans should have the advantage."

So, for Donnelly to your example in question, Martha, when saying but, he's making the point very clearly. Yes, this is a person of color. Yes, there's obviously capable and excellence that happens in that manner in that way. I was in Indiana. I was out there to support and campaign for Joe Donnelly in that manner.

This is just an opinion of some U.N. bureaucrats. It is essentially a correct opinion and it's even an opinion with which the president has agreed. You stand on line and when we get to you, you make your asylum claim. I don't think the President is going to stop that. If he did he'd be violating the law.

All of that is understandable reason to want to come to the United States, however, it does not fall under the definition of asylum.

Police originally thought they had followed through on a suicide pact and jumped off the George Washington Bridge. Bodies of previous jumpers have also washed up along that part of the Hudson. But the sisters' bodies were not decomposed, meaning, they hadn't been in the water very long, and showed no signs of the obvious injuries that would have resulted from a jump that high. We know that Rotan and Tala Farea moved with their mother from Saudi Arabia to Fairfax, Virginia in 2015, and the sisters had a history of running away. In fact, the mother reported they're missing last December but went police located them, they asked for protection and were placed in a shelter. This time, the mother had apparently been in contact with her daughters in early October and knew they were in New York City, but the day before their bodies were found, the Associated Press says the mother told New York police detective that she got a call from the Saudi embassy in D.C. requesting the family leave the U.S. because the daughters had applied for asylum.

Any terrorist who was held in Guantanamo is essentially a celebrity in Jihadist world, they're inspiring more attacks. And for the tens of thousands of Americans that are in 60 to 70 countries including Afghanistan as we speak keeping us safe, I think this is just awful all around. And you know, Martha, if I can make another point, we have hostages, American citizens, journalists, aid workers, held by terrorists and rogue regimes all over the world and this deal violated decades of precedent that America doesn't negotiate with terrorists. Ans so, guess what? Whether they are ISIS or the Iran regime or you name it, they now want their deal like President Obama gave the Taliban, and it just make -- it's making it harder. This is a terrible deal for everyone and I just think it's outrageous that they are now free."

That I understand that these people, and I sympathize, that are leaving a terrible life and they want a better life in America, but we are a nation of borders, we are a nation of laws. I sponsored an Afghan soldier who fought with us to come over here. He waited five years to get that special immigrant visa. And he is now here. He started his own business with his family. But his cousins and his cousin's entire family were executed for fighting with us. There is over 50,000 of them on a waiting list that deserve to be here. Not through a lottery system or not through somebody who just walks over our border, and you won't find anyone that's more outraged about illegal immigration than immigrants who did it legally. We have to uphold those laws."

But I just don't think politically, it's terribly helpful for the Republican Party to have a Republican president and a Republican speaker sort of sniping at each other publicly in a disagreement over an issue that just came up from a reporter's question two days ago in the final week of an election. So, I understand the arguments on both sides of the birthright citizenship question, I actually think they are reasonable questions about whether or not we ought to change our policy as a country, I do agree with the speaker that cannot be accomplished by a mere executive order. I think a lot of us have a lot to say about the abuse of executive power under the previous president, and this I think is well beyond that scope, but for now, I just don't think it is terribly edifying for Republicans who are trying to come together and win some really important elections to be engaged in this sort of back and forth."

But Paul Ryan is focused on a House map where they need to win in his swing districts, they need to hold onto some seats where there are a lot of independents and there are a lot of people that don't like this hardcore, hardline immigration talking point from the president.
