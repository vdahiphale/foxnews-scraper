      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a Fox News Alert, major breaking news tonight. Jay Sekulow, Laura Ingraham, Monica Crowley, Geraldo River, Sara Carter from Circa.com and Carrie Prejean will all join us. Now, before I get to my \"Opening Monologue\" tonight, I have a message for those who work in that house, the White House. Enough with the self- serving leaks. Now, since day one of the administration, there have been dozens and dozens of leaks to the press coming from inside the White House. An article from Politico last week included, quote, 31 sources.\" The New York Times had, like, 13. And tonight, The Washington Post is even reporting that current and former U.S. officials are saying that President Trump revealed classified information to Russian officials who were in the White House last week. Who would know that? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If you have the honor and privilege of working in the White House, you should realize that you were there for a reason and one reason only, to serve the American people. And you do that by serving the president in his attempt to keep his promises that he made and enacting his agenda in terms of what he made in terms of promises to the American people. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No White House can sustain these types of constant leaks. So if you are in the White House and you are doing this, if you are not there to serve your country and all you're doing is hurting the country, well, then you might want to get out of the way. We'll have much more on that tonight in my mini monologue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, in light of the worst liberal media freezing frenzy in American history, it is time for a reality check about why James Comey had to be fired. The media won't tell you. That's tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, so after the firing of James Comey, the destroy Trump propaganda media, destroy Trump Democrats, never-Trumpers who have been seething in the dark, along with weak Republicans, and of course, the deep state -- these groups are now working themselves into a feeding frenzy and clearly are now out for blood. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But tonight, it's time for a reality check: Why James Comey deserved and need to be fired, something they're not talking about, something the destroy Trump media won't tell you because they have their own agenda. We know that. As we've been highlighting on this show, James Comey was a complete and utter failure. He disrespected the U.S. Constitution. He didn't care about the rule of law. He didn't care about equal justice under the law for every American. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He did nothing about the violation of 4th Amendment privacy rights, and of course, leaking of classified information, which is a crime, including the unmasking of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn and then releasing that publicly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He created in this case a two-tier justice system -- that's right, one for Hillary and Bill Clinton and one for the rest of us. So tonight, we're going to go back to July, 2016, James Comey's press conference, where we thought he was laying out a strong case for the indictment of Hillary Clinton. Now, we're going to go point by point through his statements and then show you specifically laws that were broken based on his own words.

Now, this is only the tip of the iceberg. All of these are serious, prosecutable crimes, which Comey ignored. And by the way, there's a former Navy machinist, his name is Christian Saucier.

Let's talk about the Uranium One deal. Where was James Comey on this? Now, our friend Peter Schweizer, who wrote the book \"Clinton Cash,\" he did all the legwork for the FBI on this one. All Comey had to do was follow through and check out the facts for himself. In this deal, Hillary Clinton signed off on giving 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin, to the Russians. And in exchange, investors who profited from this deal gave or pledged up to $145 million to the Clinton Foundation! And in 2010, oh, Bill Clinton -- remember, she was secretary of state -- he was paid a half a million dollars for a speech in Moscow -- twice his normal speaking fee -- by a Russian bank that had ties to the Kremlin and that had a buy rating on Uranium One stock! if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, where's the outrage from the destroy Trump media? Where's the outrage from the destroy Trump Democrats over this? They barely even talked about this massive scandal despite mountains of evidence and obvious wrongdoing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, if Comey cared even a little bit about the rule of law, the Constitution, he would have launched an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. But he didn't do that because he was too busy playing politics. Then there's the egregious violation of our 4th Amendment privacy rights. Did he care about that? Unreasonable search and seizure, and the Obama administration surveilling, unmasking the identity of American citizens and then leaking their names? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Their identities are supposed to be protected through a process. Number one, first you need a warrant, and then if, in fact, you are incidentally surveilled, they're supposed to do minimization, a process by which they minimize what they learn about what the American's saying. But as we saw in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, well, he was incidentally surveilled, unmasked, and then that information was leaked to the press, which is a crime, a violation of the Espionage Act. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, in this entire Russia conspiracy bizarre world we're now living in, the only crime that we know for sure that was committed for certain was against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. Once again, Comey didn't seem to care or even be concerned with what happened. So to all the members of the destroy Trump media, the destroy Trump Democrats -- now never-Trumpers are excited. \"We were right!\" They want relevance again. Well, that's the truth that James Comey got what he deserved! He needed to be fired. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But make no mistake, the desire by the media, the D.C. deep state swamp, Democrats, weak establishment Republicans that never supported the president or then candidate Trump, and never-Trumpers -- they're now -- they're now out there thinking they're back in the game. Now, in many, many ways, they have created this alliance, and that's a clear and present danger, I'm arguing, to the president. They smell blood in the water. They're pushing bizarre conspiracies. They're not standing up for the rule of law, equal justice under the law. Very dangerous time we're living in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining us now from the American Center for Law and Justice, their chief counsel, Jay Sekulow. Why don't I just get your response. Is there anything as a lawyer legally that I'm saying here based on Comey's own words that's not true? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And as you pointed out, the one crime we do know of, and that was the unmasking and then the disclosure and leak to the press, was not prosecuted, not investigated, and nothing happened. But there's something deeper. And what you said I think is absolutely correct, Sean, and that is you had James Clapper this weekend alleging that the president -- the president of the United States, President Trump -- is interfering with institutions inside the United States because he fired the then FBI director James Comey. But James Clapper, with respect to the office, I think he is way off base here. The idea that the executive, the president can fire an executive member, staff member, the FBI director, isn't some constitutional mischief.

That is the violation of the institutions! It is the FBI, after all, that responds and reports to the Department of Justice. So Sean, unfortunately for Jim Comey, he brought this upon himself. He's confirmed it and made it worse, and then him not testifying before the Senate. He would only do what he said in an open hearing. He wouldn't do it in a private hearing. I'll tell you why. In a private hearing, he would actually have to answer the question when -- he couldn't just say, It's classified, I can't discuss it, because in a private closed hearing, he can discuss it. He didn't want to give the answers!",

So in a sense, the entire investigation was a fake, a faux investigation into the whole Clinton matter because remember -- and you said there are other statutes -- each one of those felony statutes has a component that is, in fact, when you are in a conspiracy with other people to do this.

Week after week, we see the liberal media using White House press briefings to cause confusion and controversy and chaos. I think it's time to restructure it, these daily briefings, so that all members of the press corps end up serving you, the American people, and not themselves. Tonight's mini monologue. All right, so daily White House press briefings have turned into nothing more than a dog and pony show and are no longer serving the country. Instead, with few exceptions, we see liberal so-called journalists trying to make a name for themselves with their big gotcha questions and other combative, attention-seeking behavior. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, as we've said many times on this show, the president, he doesn't need biased traditional media to reach you, the American people. We now have Facebook, and he has over 50 million followers on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. The president is in a position, a unique position to communicate daily and directly with the country without using the press as his messenger. Now, in order to benefit the American public, if these daily briefings do continue, I would argue they need to be restructured. First, the White House press team should regularly develop a list of the top and most important 15, 20, 25 issues of the day. Next, the media, well, they should be able to submit questions about these issues in writing, give the White House time to respond with clarity and specificity. And if Sean Spicer then wants to take a couple of questions from the briefing room podium, that's fine, but only on those specific topics, and he should also follow up in writing on any other questions they may have. Also, what about taking questions from you, the American people, on Facebook? Now, if the White House follows this plan, I think the destroy Trump propaganda media will have a much harder time distorting, misrepresenting the Trump administration's positions, and you, the American people, will be better served. Isn't it really about the better -- the better serving of the American people? Isn't it about just getting to the truth, not gotcha?

And I couldn't help, Sean, but to just a smile and to just feel so much hope for our future and our future generations that finally we as women, not only was a big night for Kara, but it was a big night for women in general and all Americans that freedom of speech does in fact still exist in this country and you shouldn't be punished for it. And you can still in fact, win Miss USA.",

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a Fox News Alert, major breaking news tonight. Jay Sekulow, Laura Ingraham, Monica Crowley, Geraldo River, Sara Carter from Circa.com and Carrie Prejean will all join us. Now, before I get to my \"Opening Monologue\" tonight, I have a message for those who work in that house, the White House. Enough with the self- serving leaks. Now, since day one of the administration, there have been dozens and dozens of leaks to the press coming from inside the White House. An article from Politico last week included, quote, 31 sources.\" The New York Times had, like, 13. And tonight, The Washington Post is even reporting that current and former U.S. officials are saying that President Trump revealed classified information to Russian officials who were in the White House last week. Who would know that? If you have the honor and privilege of working in the White House, you should realize that you were there for a reason and one reason only, to serve the American people. And you do that by serving the president in his attempt to keep his promises that he made and enacting his agenda in terms of what he made in terms of promises to the American people. No White House can sustain these types of constant leaks. So if you are in the White House and you are doing this, if you are not there to serve your country and all you're doing is hurting the country, well, then you might want to get out of the way. We'll have much more on that tonight in my mini monologue. But first, in light of the worst liberal media freezing frenzy in American history, it is time for a reality check about why James Comey had to be fired. The media won't tell you. That's tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, so after the firing of James Comey, the destroy Trump propaganda media, destroy Trump Democrats, never-Trumpers who have been seething in the dark, along with weak Republicans, and of course, the deep state -- these groups are now working themselves into a feeding frenzy and clearly are now out for blood."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But tonight, it's time for a reality check",
      "utterance": "Why James Comey deserved and need to be fired, something they're not talking about, something the destroy Trump media won't tell you because they have their own agenda. We know that. As we've been highlighting on this show, James Comey was a complete and utter failure. He disrespected the U.S. Constitution. He didn't care about the rule of law. He didn't care about equal justice under the law for every American. He did nothing about the violation of 4th Amendment privacy rights, and of course, leaking of classified information, which is a crime, including the unmasking of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn and then releasing that publicly. He created in this case a two-tier justice system -- that's right, one for Hillary and Bill Clinton and one for the rest of us. So tonight, we're going to go back to July, 2016, James Comey's press conference, where we thought he was laying out a strong case for the indictment of Hillary Clinton. Now, we're going to go point by point through his statements and then show you specifically laws that were broken based on his own words. Let's start here."

Eight of those chains contained information that was top secret at the time they were sent. Thirty-six of those chains contained secret information at the time, and eight contained confidential information at the time. That's the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional emails were up-classified to make them confidential. Those emails had not been classified at the time that they were sent..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, the FBI director is basically saying there Clinton broke the law. What law? 18 US Code 1924. What is that? The unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents and material. Let's continue. Let's watch Comey say this."

    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "The FBI also discovered several thousand work-related emails that were not among the group of 30,000 emails returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014. We found those emails in a variety of ways. Some had been deleted over the years and we found traces of them on servers or devices that had been connected to the private email domain."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right, what is he saying? What law comes into play here that Clinton violated? 18 U.S. Code 793, gathering, transmitting or losing Defense information, which we know with 99 percent certainty that, in fact, five foreign intelligence agencies were able to get a hold of. Here's the next part."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Extremely careless, but the law states gross negligence. What's the difference? Here the laws that were violated here, 18 U.S. Code 793, again, gathering, transmitting or losing defense information and 18 U.S. Code 1905, disclosure of confidential information generally. OK? Let's go to Comey's next statement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Seven email chains concern matters that were classified at the top-secret, special access program at the time they were sent and received. Those chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending emails about those matters and receiving emails about those same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about those matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Ah. Amazing. Here are the laws that apply here -- 18 U.S. Code 798, disclosure of classified information, again 18 U.S. Code 792, gathering, transmitting, losing Defense information, 18 U.S. Code 1905, disclosure of confidential information generally. Now, this is only the tip of the iceberg. All of these are serious, prosecutable crimes, which Comey ignored. And by the way, there's a former Navy machinist, his name is Christian Saucier. He's sitting behind bars tonight. He's serving a year sentence for taking six pictures of the submarine that he worked on. Hillary Clinton? She got to walk free. Now, there's also the fact that James Comey had no business ever holding that press conference in the first place and determining whether or not there was enough evidence to recommend charges against Hillary Clinton. Now, that right exclusively belongs to the attorney general of the United States, not James Comey! And he was supposed to do -- all he was supposed to so is present evidence and not exercise any sort of prosecutorial power. Now, if the destroy Trump media -- they want to talk about a real Russian collusion scandal, not some bizarre tinfoil hat conspiracy theory like the one they've been pushing for the last eight-plus months without any evidence -- let's talk about the Clinton Foundation. Let's talk about the Uranium One deal. Where was James Comey on this? Now, our friend Peter Schweizer, who wrote the book \"Clinton Cash,\" he did all the legwork for the FBI on this one. All Comey had to do was follow through and check out the facts for himself. In this deal, Hillary Clinton signed off on giving 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin, to the Russians. And in exchange, investors who profited from this deal gave or pledged up to $145 million to the Clinton Foundation! And in 2010, oh, Bill Clinton -- remember, she was secretary of state -- he was paid a half a million dollars for a speech in Moscow -- twice his normal speaking fee -- by a Russian bank that had ties to the Kremlin and that had a buy rating on Uranium One stock! Now, where's the outrage from the destroy Trump media? Where's the outrage from the destroy Trump Democrats over this? They barely even talked about this massive scandal despite mountains of evidence and obvious wrongdoing. Now, if Comey cared even a little bit about the rule of law, the Constitution, he would have launched an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. But he didn't do that because he was too busy playing politics. Then there's the egregious violation of our 4th Amendment privacy rights. Did he care about that? Unreasonable search and seizure, and the Obama administration surveilling, unmasking the identity of American citizens and then leaking their names? Their identities are supposed to be protected through a process. Number one, first you need a warrant, and then if, in fact, you are incidentally surveilled, they're supposed to do minimization, a process by which they minimize what they learn about what the American's saying. But as we saw in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, well, he was incidentally surveilled, unmasked, and then that information was leaked to the press, which is a crime, a violation of the Espionage Act. Now, in this entire Russia conspiracy bizarre world we're now living in, the only crime that we know for sure that was committed for certain was against Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. Once again, Comey didn't seem to care or even be concerned with what happened. So to all the members of the destroy Trump media, the destroy Trump Democrats -- now never-Trumpers are excited. \"We were right!\" They want relevance again. Well, that's the truth that James Comey got what he deserved! He needed to be fired. But make no mistake, the desire by the media, the D.C. deep state swamp, Democrats, weak establishment Republicans that never supported the president or then candidate Trump, and never-Trumpers -- they're now -- they're now out there thinking they're back in the game. Now, in many, many ways, they have created this alliance, and that's a clear and present danger, I'm arguing, to the president. They smell blood in the water. They're pushing bizarre conspiracies. They're not standing up for the rule of law, equal justice under the law. Very dangerous time we're living in. Joining us now from the American Center for Law and Justice, their chief counsel, Jay Sekulow. Why don't I just get your response. Is there anything as a lawyer legally that I'm saying here based on Comey's own words that's not true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE",
      "utterance": "No, you laid it out exactly correct. The problem for James Comey started on July 5th and it was compounded each and every time he went to the podium to speak. And as you pointed out, the one crime we do know of, and that was the unmasking and then the disclosure and leak to the press, was not prosecuted, not investigated, and nothing happened. But there's something deeper. And what you said I think is absolutely correct, Sean, and that is you had James Clapper this weekend alleging that the president -- the president of the United States, President Trump -- is interfering with institutions inside the United States because he fired the then FBI director James Comey. But James Clapper, with respect to the office, I think he is way off base here. The idea that the executive, the president can fire an executive member, staff member, the FBI director, isn't some constitutional mischief. That's exactly what the Constitution allows! So where I think the left and the media is getting into this entire Trump, you know, attacking the institutions of government -- it is the left that's saying, We will not put in place an FBI director, no matter who it is, until a special prosecutor, independent prosecutor is put in place. That is the violation of the institutions! It is the FBI, after all, that responds and reports to the Department of Justice. So Sean, unfortunately for Jim Comey, he brought this upon himself. He's confirmed it and made it worse, and then him not testifying before the Senate. He would only do what he said in an open hearing. He wouldn't do it in a private hearing. I'll tell you why. In a private hearing, he would actually have to answer the question when -- he couldn't just say, It's classified, I can't discuss it, because in a private closed hearing, he can discuss it. He didn't want to give the answers!"

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I think that's a pretty profound insight. Are there any other laws potentially that you see that Hillary Clinton violated? You know, everybody is acting so sanctimonious and they're so concerned about Russia collusion. James Clapper -- I'll play it if you want -- he said there is no evidence. The same thing with Admiral Rogers. There is no evidence. I'm open, if you got it. Show it to me, but after all these months, it's now lie and innuendo and -- and -- and frankly bordering on just slander this point. But why would the media ignore all of these crimes that we now know Hillary committed? The evidence is overwhelming, incontrovertible. Do you agree with me that in many ways, there's a two-tiered justice system created by Comey, that Comey had to be fired..."

    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Well, Sean, could you imagine if James Comey would've come out -- do you think he would have had that hearing, that press conference on July 5th and said, I'm going to recommend that she be charged? How would -- what would the reaction have been then? So this was cooked up from the beginning. So in a sense, the entire investigation was a fake, a faux investigation into the whole Clinton matter because remember -- and you said there are other statutes -- each one of those felony statutes has a component that is, in fact, when you are in a conspiracy with other people to do this. Now, was Huma Abedin criminally prosecuted here or brought before a grand jury? Not as far as we can tell. Cheryl Mills -- not as far as we can tell. In fact, Cheryl Mills was allowed to be Hillary Clinton's lawyer in all this, which is beyond bizarre! So I think the reality was from the outset this was never going to happen. That's why James Comey put himself in the situation, and that's why the president of the United States exercised not an institutional attack, but a constitutional right as president to terminate his employment."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And welcome back to \"Hannity.\" So the destroy Trump propaganda media -- they're going to stop at nothing to malign President Trump and members of his administration! Week after week, we see the liberal media using White House press briefings to cause confusion and controversy and chaos. I think it's time to restructure it, these daily briefings, so that all members of the press corps end up serving you, the American people, and not themselves. Tonight's mini monologue. All right, so daily White House press briefings have turned into nothing more than a dog and pony show and are no longer serving the country. Instead, with few exceptions, we see liberal so-called journalists trying to make a name for themselves with their big gotcha questions and other combative, attention-seeking behavior. Now, as we've said many times on this show, the president, he doesn't need biased traditional media to reach you, the American people. We now have Facebook, and he has over 50 million followers on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. The president is in a position, a unique position to communicate daily and directly with the country without using the press as his messenger. Now, in order to benefit the American public, if these daily briefings do continue, I would argue they need to be restructured. First, the White House press team should regularly develop a list of the top and most important 15, 20, 25 issues of the day. Next, the media, well, they should be able to submit questions about these issues in writing, give the White House time to respond with clarity and specificity. And if Sean Spicer then wants to take a couple of questions from the briefing room podium, that's fine, but only on those specific topics, and he should also follow up in writing on any other questions they may have. Also, what about taking questions from you, the American people, on Facebook? Now, if the White House follows this plan, I think the destroy Trump propaganda media will have a much harder time distorting, misrepresenting the Trump administration's positions, and you, the American people, will be better served. Isn't it really about the better -- the better serving of the American people? Isn't it about just getting to the truth, not gotcha?

They can do these gaggles in the morning with members of the press and Sean or Sarah or both of them can, you know, share thoughts on the president's schedule with reporters at that time, and then do much shorter, more succinct interactions with the press on a regular basis. I think -- I've always thought that's what they should do. There's nothing written in stone on a tablet held up on some mountaintop that says you have to do a press briefing every day. Why?"

Do you really need all these reporters at the White House sitting around all day, hoping that they get a crumb thrown to them about what's happening on the inside? I think it's all too much. I think they should continue the rotating questions from reporters who are outside Washington. But there's no need to do these every day. It should only be on an as-needed basis."

Then the reporters feel like they're characters in the ongoing drama. So you have Glenn Thrush, you know, with his hat. He becomes a character. Jake Tapper becomes a character.

And I think the concern is that it went far beyond a Susan Rice and that Susan Rice although be it a very important player, we don't have all the information out yet, I know that right now they haven't seen all of the reports from the NSA with regards to the unmasking and that people are still going through that. But there is concern that it went far beyond her to other high-level officials and that it wasn't solely focused on Russia. And this has to be the question -- why were they unmasking these conversations, these intelligence reports, unmasking Americans, if they didn't have anything to do with Russia? What was the national security concern here? And this is why people need to be brought forth before the House and before the intelligence community to answer questions."

We know that when they released the name of Michael Flynn, and remember, Sean, this is a small group of people. It isn't like it was spread across the entire intelligence community. That's what we were led to believe. The original people who saw those reports in the DOJ and the FBI, those folks who had access to those reports were the ones who actually release the information. It wouldn't be that difficult to find out. I know this from talking to people within the community. So yes, releasing the name is illegal. But remember, they also changed the law so that they could unmask more and more Americans with very little explanation. All they could say is, look, I need this for national security. This is the reason why I need to unmask this, and they would be given permission. And remember it also changed to very high level officials. So you've got to ask yourself, Susan Rice, Clapper, Brennan, others in the DOJ, if they were requesting these unmaskings of Americans, why were they doing it?"

      "utterance": "You know, she seems to have a pretty good head on her shoulders. I think she is tough. I think she's extremely smart. She works for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, so they can't call her dumb, Sean. That's a good thing. They can't call her a dumb blonde. So that's one advantage that she had over me. So I think that she is going to hold her own, and I wish her the best of luck, and I think that she is going to be an amazing, amazing Miss USA."
