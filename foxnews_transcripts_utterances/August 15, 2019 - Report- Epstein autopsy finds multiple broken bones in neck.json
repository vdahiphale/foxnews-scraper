That's in Bristol, Tennessee near the North Carolina border. If you don't know the area, we are talking about halfway between Charlotte and Knoxville. The plane, by the way, if you see the pictures of the smoke, the plane had about a thousand gallons of fuel on board. And authorities say a significant amount of that leaked. And you can see right there from the fire. As bad as that fire looks, we are being told right now that Dale Earnhardt, Jr., his wife and young daughter and all the passengers suffered only minor injuries. There was some video showing Dale Earnhardt, Jr. laying on the ground after getting out of the plane. They were putting a neck brace around his neck, but it appeared that he was lifting his head on his own. His sister, who is also his business partner, Kelly Earnhardt tweeted the following, quoting here, \"I can confirm Dale, Amy, Isla, along with his two pilots, were involved in a crash in Bristol, Tennessee this afternoon. Everyone is safe and has been taken to the hospital for further evaluation. We have no further information at this time. Thank you for understanding.\" Of course, he's been taken to Johnson Hospital. We do not know the severity of the injuries, but we do know that everybody who was on the plane got off the plane. Those who don't know, of course, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., 18-year career, won two Daytona 500's. He went on to win 26 cup races, which places him like 40th of all time in NASCAR. He's working for NBC now as an analyst and the reason he was flying to Bristol was to cover this weekend's races in Bristol, Tennessee. Again, with his wife and his one-year-old daughter and the latest reports are that they all got off the plane and there are only minor injuries. And when you see the smoke like that and if you saw other pictures of the plane itself, which came in and rolled off the end of the runway, you would be surprised that anybody walked away from that. We'll have much more breaking information on the crash of Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s plane. Remember his father died in a crash at the DAYTONA 500 back in 2001.

And we had a rise in agency -- we had a rise in police officers -- becoming police officers for 16 years. And then in three years, we lost 23,000, and in recruitment and retention, all over the place. And I think that level of stress we are seeing in all aspects of it, and just yesterday, we lost an NYPD officer to suicide. And that is the ninth this year.

How would gun control stop this at all? The guy is a felon. He's not even allowed to have a weapon. And the one charge he got for the federal beef, he'd scratched out the serial number to another gun. So, it's not like he'd go to a licensed arms dealer in north Philadelphia and pass a background check. If you bend (ph) certain rifles, that's just going to make sure that guys that use them for sport can't use them. The bad guys are still going to get them. But the law enforcement did a great job. It's the D.A. and it's the judge that totally fell flat on their face. If you have a guy with 30 charges in 10 years -- attempted murder, escaped from prison, drugs and weapons, and that's not even including his juvenile record. And everything gets plowed down. He doesn't spend a lot of time. He gets probation and all that. You think, what are they doing there? And one of the reasons people are upset is because the new D.A., Larry Krasner, ha downgraded a lot of these hardcore charges. He got $1.7 million from George Soros. He is a restorative justice kind of guy. And what kind of deals is he making with these judges where the guy gets like really no hard time? It's sickening and it's irresponsible. And arms charges, guys that do that have a very high rate of recidivism, almost as high as child molesters. If you do it once, you're probably going to do it again. And the fact that these police officers were out there literally saving babies from a day care center, and then you have the community throwing things and heckling. It was totally, it was sad, that's what it was. It was sad. And you don't like to see that."

They should be going after that guy and not the people that are protecting them from that guy. And I'm really surprised that a hardened violent criminal is ignoring gun laws. Next you're going to tell me he doesn't own an alpaca. But the story to your point, Emily, is about how useless it is to arrest people if you don't keep them in jail. That's what's that point. It's now a revolving door. And I think, you know, we talk about prison reform, prisons do serve a purpose. You put people away there that shouldn't be on the street, you know.

The tariffs have really bitten into China. They haven't bitten into us at all except for the reporters who want to make it look that way, but they don't understand what's happening. The tariffs, we've taken in close to $60 billion in tariff money, and the consumer has not paid for it. Now, at some point, they might have to pay something, but they understand that and who really understands that is our great farmer. The farmers of this country really understand that they know we had to do something about China and we are doing something about China. With that being said, I think we are having very good discussions with China. They very much want to make a deal. We'll see what happens. We had a deal and they decided not to make it. Now, I think that they would like to have had that opportunity again because I think they really would - - I think they really missed a great opportunity. I think they feel that they made a missed a great opportunity. But China very much wants to make a deal. We're talking to them. We'll see what happens. Yes."

So, I did absolutely put out a very strong statement. I think if you look at their language, if you look at what they've said, if I ever said it, it would be a horrible -- it would be a horrible month, to put it mildly.

He did quantitative tightening. That was a big mistake -- $50 billion a month. And it put us in a position, and interestingly, even with normalized interest rates, President Obama was paying nothing and we have a much better economy. And you have to look at our economy, also, from the day after my election because we picked up tremendous steam the day after the election. That's not attributable to President Obama. They only did that because of us. So when somebody says from January 20th, it's not from January 20th. It's from November 9th, the day after the election. We picked up. The fact that I won lifted our economy greatly. And if I didn't win, it would go down. And frankly, if, for some reason that happened in the 2020 election, you'll see this economy go down the tubes.

I mean, I can tell you, in New York, they closed a lot of them. And the people went out. They went out onto the streets and it's a terrible thing.

That's in Bristol, Tennessee near the North Carolina border. If you don't know the area, we are talking about halfway between Charlotte and Knoxville.

His sister, who is also his business partner, Kelly Earnhardt tweeted the following, quoting here, \"I can confirm Dale, Amy, Isla, along with his two pilots, were involved in a crash in Bristol, Tennessee this afternoon. Everyone is safe and has been taken to the hospital for further evaluation. We have no further information at this time. Thank you for understanding.\" Of course, he's been taken to Johnson Hospital. We do not know the severity of the injuries, but we do know that everybody who was on the plane got off the plane. Those who don't know, of course, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., 18-year career, won two Daytona 500's. He went on to win 26 cup races, which places him like 40th of all time in NASCAR. He's working for NBC now as an analyst and the reason he was flying to Bristol was to cover this weekend's races in Bristol, Tennessee. Again, with his wife and his one-year-old daughter and the latest reports are that they all got off the plane and there are only minor injuries. And when you see the smoke like that and if you saw other pictures of the plane itself, which came in and rolled off the end of the runway, you would be surprised that anybody walked away from that. We'll have much more breaking information on the crash of Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s plane. Remember his father died in a crash at the DAYTONA 500 back in 2001. Much more on the breaking news as it comes in."

I think you have various people who want to get something done about the rapidly rising number of people who are living not only in Los Angeles, but as you point out Emily, Seattle. We see it here in New York. I see it in D.C. and Baltimore. So, but to me there is a political agenda here in which, which scares me is not being - I've been on Skid Row that does scare, what scares me is you demonize a very vulnerable population instead of saying I'm an exterminator and I want to use this poison that may be killing some Mountain Lions, but I want to use it.
