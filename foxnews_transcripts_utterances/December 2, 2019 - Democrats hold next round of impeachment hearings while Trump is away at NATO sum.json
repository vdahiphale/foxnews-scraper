Ken Starr says that President Trump is right to refuse to participate in the next phase of impeachment. He’s here to explain this in moments. All you left wing crazies have been going nuts about this all day long. Plus, disgraced former FBI lawyer Lisa Page granted her first interview to a member of the resistance media and she wants you to feel sorry for her. Do you? John Solomon and Lee Smith are here to explain why you shouldn’t. And they’ll also respond to a breaking statement from the DOJ that just dropped moments ago about Michael Horowitz’s new IG report about to come out. Plus, Joe Biden’s [laughs] “No More Malarkey” bus tour. Have you seen this thing? Well, a few potholes hit along the way in its inaugural weekend. Governor Mike Huckabee walks us through some of the dips in the pavement. But first, impeaching to the choir. That’s the focus of tonight’s angle. Now, for as long as I can remember, Democrats have claimed a vigorous support for international alliances. And since Trump took the oath of office, they warned that his America First approach would isolate us and do more irreparable harm to NATO."

But all of this hyperbole about what Trump was going to do to NATO, chock that up to the experts being wrong again. The truth is Trump actually got NATO members to spend more on defense, $100 billion more, to be exact. He didn’t do this like some other presidents would by bilking the American taxpayer. He got countries like Germany, the U.K. and France to pay more. It’s about time. Now, President Obama could have demanded an end to the free riding, but he didn’t. That might be one reason why they liked him so much. “Hey, you didn’t pay your dues? No problem.” But as President Trump touched down late this afternoon in London, he commands NATO members’ attention because they know that he’ll hold them to their financial obligations and not just blow him off. Now, one would think that Congress, regardless of party affiliation, would want the president at this important meeting focused on the issues at hand. There are a lot of big issues facing the alliance. And that they would want him there unencumbered by extraneous partisan maters, right? Well, not a chance."

      "utterance": " So, why the need to fast track this? They couldn’t wait until after the NATO summit for their pointless impeachment exercise? No. And House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler tried to add insult to injury just six days ago by so magnanimously inviting the White House to participate in the hearing during the NATO meeting. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone rightly dismissed the invite -- it’s a great letter, by the way -- citing a complete lack of due process and fundamental fairness. His blistering letter also exposed Nadler’s absurd attempt to try to rely on the Clinton impeachment as precedent, saying, “President Clinton was allowed to call 14 witnesses. Here, with the hearings before the committee set to begin a mere five days from the date of your latest letter, it still remains unclear whether the Judiciary Committee actually intends to permit the president or your Republican colleagues to call witnesses at all. And also, that during the Clinton impeachment process, it allowed those questioning the witnesses two and a half weeks notice to prepare and it scheduled the hearing on a date suggested by the president’s attorneys. Today, by contrast, you’ve afforded no scheduling input, no meaningful information, and so little time to prepare that you’ve effectively denied the administration a fair opportunity to participate.” While Democrats hold vigils and pro bono work to defend the due process rights of murderers, yet they run roughshod over the president’s same rights. It’s absurd. But they’re so blinded by their Trump hatred that they won’t even agree to support policies at this point that will help their own constituents. Forget America at large. Case in point, the USMCA, which includes trade concessions from Canada and Mexico the Democrats said they long desired. The New York Times, of all places, is reporting that House Democrats returned to Washington on Monday, today, facing a difficult choice: should they hand President Trump a victory in the midst of a heated impeachment battle, or walk away from one of the most progressive trade pacts ever negotiated by either party? Wow. The pressure is on. Yet instead of allowing this obvious win for American workers, Pelosi and her whacked out caucus are on a vengeful high. They’re tripping on a Ukraine hallucinogenic, impeaching to their own choir of radicals. The rest of America, though, is busy at work, preparing for exams or for the holidays. They’re enjoying the fruits of perhaps the greatest American economy of the past half-century."

They’ve tried to just distract you from the results of this presidency: a booming economy -- a booming economy, record-high stock markets, record-low unemployment, and growing wages. Plus, of course, the massive pro-growth deregulation Trump has done and forcing Mexico and Central America to finally help curb illegal immigration. It’s about time. But what do the Democrats have to show for themselves? That’s about all they’ve got. Nothing. Beyond impeachment, they don’t have anything, just proposals like the Green Raw Deal that will cost trillions, higher taxes for pretty much everybody, the mass release of criminals that will make you more unsafe, and government-run health care that’s free for anyone who crosses the border illegally. This week, President Trump may find -- after everything I’ve told you tonight, everything he’s seen since he took that oath of office -- he may just find that working with Macron and Merkel is easier than working with his fellow Americans across the aisle. How about that? And that’s the angle. Joining me now, Ken Starr, former independent counsel and a FOX News contributor, and Bob Barr, Clinton impeachment manager and former federal prosecutor and Georgia congressman. Ken, let’s go to you first. You say it’s wise for the White House to refuse to cooperate with the House Judiciary Committee. Why do you think that? All day long on the resistance media we’ve been hearing it’s a sign of weakness, an administration who doesn’t have a case to make."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ken Starr",
      "utterance": " Well, that’s the potential downside politically, but in my view -- and you laid these out in quoting from Pat Cipollone’s letter -- the impeachment inquiry just got off on the wrong track when Nancy Pelosi, I believe -- I’m usually more careful with my words -- abused her power by unilaterally declaring an impeachment inquiry as opposed to -- and we talked about this weeks ago, but it’s still the infection that continues to make this whole process very ill. At every step, there is some dimension of procedural unfairness. There’s a violation of traditions, a violation of history, and those things count in the people’s House. But she has the raw power; the House of Representatives has the raw power. They are abusing their power by the way in which they are conducting the specifics of this inquiry, and they should be ashamed of themselves. And if it’s going to be a fundamentally unfair -- call it whatever you will; use whatever pejorative term you will -- then it is certainly a reasonable response by the president as articulated by Pat Cipollone in, I think, a very hard-hitting but brilliant and lawyer-like letter.  “We are not going to participate with this kind of profoundly unfair proceeding.”"

So, you’re watching this thing unfold, and Nancy Pelosi just -- yeah, this was several months ago; I think it was back in late winter, early winter -- made a comment that I think has largely gone unnoticed, but our intrepid producer found this today.

It lacks of any sort of leadership; it lacks of anything of substance, and it’s turning into the gift that keeps on giving. I mean, the more that the Democrats pursue this track, the less credibility they have, and as Judge Starr noted, the letter that the president’s counsel sent to the chairman, Nadler, the man who never smiles, the other day, not only is hard-hitting, I thought it was actually too nice. I mean, he could have summed it up in one sentence, you know -- “Go fly a kite” -- because this is absolutely absurd. And the problem is what they’re -- the damage here really, Laura, is that they are playing around with a very sacred power that the American people have to remove a leader for just cause, and they are undermining that very, very significant provision in our Constitution."

That is such a wonderful opportunity for us with our partners, with Canada and Mexico, to move a move forward. It helps everyone, so get it done. But it doesn't -- but this is the impeachment culture that has been created, and the Democrats are driving the culture, they're expanding that culture. They simply want to remove this president, period. It simply shows again the wisdom very briefly of Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 65. If we re-read those few paragraphs in Federalist 65 about impeachment, we will say, “Colonel Hamilton, you were spot on in what is happening right now.” People are just lining up. Now, let's hope that cooler heads -- the 31 Democrats or whomever -- will prevail and say, “No, this does not merit impeachment.” Whatever you think about that phone call, whatever you think about the temporary hold on aid, it is not an impeachable kind of offense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": " It’s not even close. And by the way, just so our viewers tonight understand, on Wednesday -- if you thought the previous impeachment hearings were boring, on Wednesday you get to hear from law professors. Okay, as someone who sat along in a lot of law professors’ lectures, one of them is now Noah Feldman. Okay, he's a Harvard law professor, and he's one of the four witnesses who are going to testify on Wednesday. Now, this constitutional scholar -- he's already declared a lot of stuff to be impeachable on the part of Trump. Okay, here is the list. Trump's pardoning of Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio; that was impeachable. Trump's tweet about the Obama administration wiretapping the phones of his campaign; that's impeachable. Number three, the now-debunked Buzzfeed story claiming Trump directed Cohen to lie under oath; he said that was impeachable. And number four, an advertisement for Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort that appeared on a government website; that was impeachable. So, Bob, you managed the Clinton impeachment. What do you make of the lineup? You’ve got him; yo’ve got Pam Karlan -- she taught law when I was at University of Virginia, well-respected liberal, worked in the Obama administration. You’ve got Jonathan Turley; he’s kind of a middle-of-the-road guy, pretty fair-minded. But some of these other characters are pretty out there."

They had credibility; they knew what they were talking about. They weren't right, but they knew what they were talking about. These folks nowadays, Laura, I mean, they have no substance, they have no credibility, and they're just going to go up there on Wednesday and babble and babble and babble, and the Democrats’ case will sink lower and lower and lower."

But as far as the American people are concerned, they're not here to get continuing legal education at the hands of Nadler, right [laughs]?

They told us that in the Clinton era. We don't. We must have public support. We don't. This is the first time we've done it in the modern era that we've done it with a first-term president. Andrew Johnson over 150 years ago probably wouldn't have run for re-election but this is new, Laura, because we're basically saying we're not going to wait for a year.
