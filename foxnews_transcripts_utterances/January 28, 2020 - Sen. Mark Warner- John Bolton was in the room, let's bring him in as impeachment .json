It's all about the math, and that's what people have to figure out about Friday. Once they get through this question-and-answer period, this is how it will work. You will have the Republicans pose a series of questions. Then you will have the Democrats pose a series of questions.

Remember that some Republicans have wanted to make Adam Schiff a witness in this case. That's not going to happen, necessarily, unless they vote on that Friday or Saturday.

Same for a lot of bars and restaurants, who are now offering specials, like the subpoena colada, MAGA margaritas, and impeachment punch.

This is his district. And, remember, he is the Democrat who opposed impeachment, and a few weeks ago defected from the Democratic Party and joined the Republicans. I just spoke to some folks that are here at tonight's rally with the Trump campaign who say they believe that Congressman Van Drew really personifies a lot of Democrats in the country, who have become disillusioned with their party over impeachment.

Right now, the Senate Republicans are meeting behind closed doors talking about etching out their questions for those two eight-hour sessions on Wednesday and Thursday that they will pose to the House managers and the defense counsel here, also discussing witnesses. That is issue A number one, because you have, depending on how you calculate it, two to three senators on the Republican side of the aisle seriously considering witnesses. Lindsey Graham is also somebody who's talking about this as well, but, in particular, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah have said that they are for witnesses. Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, says she might want to hear more specifically from John Bolton, the former national security adviser. Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, said that John Bolton is central to this case."

Adam Schiff during this press conference a few minutes ago said -- quote -- \"If they want a one for one,\" meaning they're going to call Bolton, maybe somebody on the other side, he said, call Mick Mulvaney. You know, what this raises, Neil, is the specter of a potential tie vote on witnesses. The Constitution and the Senate impeachment rules are kind of vague about how you would address that. If you were operating under normal procedure in the Senate, the vice president would break ties. There were three ties back in the Senate impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868. And Salmon P. Chase, who was the chief justice at the time, he broke two of the three. But I'm told that because the Senate rule is, if a tie vote would fail automatically here, that Chief Justice John Roberts wouldn't weigh in. So if you're looking at those three senators who I mentioned in particular, Murkowski, Collins and Romney, you can see where a tie vote fails. It's all about the math, and that's what people have to figure out about Friday. Once they get through this question-and-answer period, this is how it will work. You will have the Republicans pose a series of questions. Then you will have the Democrats pose a series of questions. They will toggle back and forth hour by hour. Chief Justice John Roberts told everyone, he said, I want to keep these answers limited to five minutes. And already some of the Republicans are teeing up their questions here. Josh Hawley, the Republican senator from Missouri, indicates that he wants to ask specific questions to Adam Schiff about potential contacts with his staff and the whistle-blower, and also questions about the Bidens and Burisma. Remember that some Republicans have wanted to make Adam Schiff a witness in this case. That's not going to happen, necessarily, unless they vote on that Friday or Saturday. But they could make him a de facto witness during this Q&A period on Wednesday and Thursday, Neil."

So maybe they eat up all that time. It just depends how productive they want to be. Again, they are allotted 16 hours.

He is scheduled to leave the White House to go to a campaign rally in Southern New Jersey down around the Cape May area for Jeff Van Drew, who you will remember was a Democrat, changed to a Republican, and was one of two and three votes against the articles of impeachment. But, clearly, what is -- this coincidentally timed disclosure of what John Bolton is talking about is hitting home and causing some consternation here at the White House. The president tweeting yesterday that it's the job of the House, not the -- well, that's not the tweet. Let's hold off on that for a second. The president talking yesterday that it's the job of the House, and not the Senate, to call witnesses such as John Bolton. But you can bet, Neil, that if John Bolton were to be called, or least there was a push to call John Bolton as a witness, that the gloves are going to come off, and it's going to be a free-for-all in terms of calling Hunter Biden and Joe Biden and everybody else."

Almost everyone says yes.\" Earlier today, the president doing the business of the nation, hosting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, as the president outlined his long-awaited Middle East peace plan, at the same time that one of his attorneys, Jay Sekulow, was up there on Capitol Hill suggesting all this was political, pointing to the fact that Nancy Pelosi held onto the articles of impeachment for a month before handing them over to the Senate.

Dershowitz saying -- quote -- \"If Warren knew anything about criminal law, she would understand the distinction between motives, which are not elements of crime, and intent, which is. It's the responsibility of presidential candidates to have a better understanding of the law\" Questions tomorrow, possible push for impeachment -- sorry -- possible push for subpoenas to call witnesses.

What I don't understand, and I didn't hear from the president's lawyers today, is, John Bolton -- and I have disagreed with most of John Bolton's policy positions for the last 30 years. But no one would question his solid conservative credentials and bona fides. Why wouldn't we have him, since he was in the room? And I know the president's lawyer said the manuscript, hearsay, or whatever. Well, let's bring him in the room. And if the president wants to also bring his own chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, in, and he will take an oath to swear to tell the truth, and he can exculp -- and clear the president, let's hear from him or other political appointees that still work for this president.

I mean, if they -- if Mitch McConnell thinks he's got 51 of his 53 senators that will vote to call in Hunter Biden -- and I guess they don't even have to make the case of how that's -- has anything directly to do with the case that's posed against President Trump, but if they vote that way, I can't say, only call my witnesses, but don't call what the majority want."

But with John Bolton, I don't think anybody denies that he was not in the room, that he wasn't very aware of what was going on. And I think we ought to not just bring in Bolton. If the president wants to bring in Mr. Mulvaney, who is his chief of staff, who was intimately involved as well, the other political appointees who were involved, I mean, that's the way I think most Americans, whether you're a supporter of the president or not, knows how trials operate.

So, yes, I think he's angry he was fired. He spent his entire adult life arguing for a strong executive power and for expansive executive privilege, where the conversations between a president and their national security adviser would be protected by executive privilege. His whole life's work, he's argued for that. Now he's going to argue that, no, no, no, now that I have a book deal for a couple million bucks, that it's OK for me to say and spill the beans on everything the president said to me privately. So I think it should be taken with a grain of salt. Whether or not he's a disinterested or neutral party, I think he's motivated by his own self- interest.

But now that his book is completed, he's arguing the opposite. And that should just be taken into consideration. I do think that Professor Dershowitz hit it pretty well last night when he said that, even if what John Bolton is now alleging is true, this is a policy difference, and not something that rises to the level of an impeachment. And this has been the whole problem throughout this thing. Look, President Obama withheld aid to both Egypt and then also to Ukraine against the will of Congress, and nobody talked about impeaching him. Now that President Trump does something they don't like, a policy they don't like, all of a sudden, they're up in arms and he should be impeached. It needs to be the same standard, whether you're Republican or a Democrat, or no matter which way we're looking at impeachment. All of the managers that were arguing against Clinton's impeachment because it was partisan, their arguments were used against them today. In fact, there were titters running throughout the crowd as Chuck Schumer was adamant that you shouldn't be able to go after someone who -- that isn't in a high crime or a misdemeanor."

That -- those are facts. Chuck Schumer just threw out, well, what about the president? Maybe his kids are making money. It's like, he threw out something that's an accusation, an ad hominem, a scurrilous attack on a president and his family, without any evidence. If he has evidence of that, that's fine. But his argument was, we just need to keep investigating until we find it, because, eventually, we will find out that this might be true. That, to me, is defamation of character.

We know that he's written for decades saying that the executive should have broad, expansive war powers.

Our national policy is extremely, extremely serious and is extremely critical to the defense and well-being of the United States of America and our position in the world. And with that, you can't have a rogue proxy, such as a Rudy Giuliani or anyone else, going out there, even though they're saying that, I'm here for -- as a private citizen, but I'm representing the most powerful person in the world, or a senator, or any of us.

They were very compelling. And they did a good job of presenting it. And then you have to make a decision. But you need to have all the evidence for it. And here's the hard thing I have a hard time explaining back home, the hypocrisy. If you start seeing basically all the clips from 20 years ago, whether it be the House managers, the prosecution now, the statements that they made, or Professor Dershowitz, or Ken Starr, or Chuck Schumer, or Mitch McConnell, they have all reversed their position 180 degrees. Now, I'm sure the framers, the brilliant people that they were, didn't have that much wiggle room, and you could change your position in a 10- or 20- year period, Neil, for something they wrote that's been holding for over 220 or 230 years.

      "speaker": "CORNYN",
      "utterance": "Well, what I read in The New York Times that reportedly Mr. Bolton has said in his book doesn't really change the facts as we know them. Well, we know that there were discussions about investigations and corruption, including Burisma, where Hunter Biden worked. We know there were some discussions about meetings between President Trump and President Zelensky. But, eventually, the aid that was promised to Ukraine flowed, was paid by the end of the fiscal year, and the meeting that President Zelensky want occurred -- wanted did occur. So, the question is, does that rise to the level of high crime and misdemeanor? And I think it doesn't. We don't need Mr. Bolton to come in and to extend this -- this show longer, along with any other witnesses people might want, and occupy all of our time here in the Senate for the next few weeks, maybe even months."

But if the president did tell John Bolton that, indeed, there was a relationship between getting that information on the Bidens and aid to the country, that wouldn't be enough for you to say, let's look into this more?"

It's unlike any other court in American jurisprudence, because we're the judges of the facts and the law. And I think senators are sort of digesting this information and trying to come up with their best answer. But, for me, I have argued that we basically know what the facts are. That's what the House managers said. They said the facts are uncontested. The conclusions that people draw or the inferences they draw from that evidence are different. But, here again, I don't think, as Professor Dershowitz pointed out, that these kind of policy differences, these sort of temporary pauses in foreign aid, rise to the level of an impeachable offense, or else we're going to end up impeaching every president hereafter."

They want to bar him from being on the ballot in 2020. That's what this impeachment trial is all about. That, to me, is a real threat to the American people's right to be heard at the ballot box, particularly here, nine months before the election."

You could have litigated privilege in court, rather than the Senate having to decide legal issues.

And it's not even clear that those numbers are high enough. There's a real shortage of some of the testing kits in China. So, the actual numbers could be even higher. You really get a sense that the health care system is strapped and they are scrambling. They're trying to build some pop-up hospitals to treat some of those infected within one week. So there's a sense of desperation, as there are urgent pleas for safety-ware for the medical personnel, goggles and protective suits. Now, China is doing extraordinary things to try to contain this virus. They have quarantined a number of entire cities, more than 55 million people under quarantine. It's really unprecedented historically. But there's a question about how effective it will be.

I mean, this is -- this is the Jersey Shore in January, which is usually a ghost town, and yet thousands, literally thousands of people camped out overnight in the cold and in the wind. Remember, this is right off the ocean. Camped out overnight to be sure that they got in tonight to hear President Trump speak at his first ever rally in New Jersey. Hotels normally closed for the winter have reopened and are our sold out. Same for a lot of bars and restaurants, who are now offering specials, like the subpoena colada, MAGA margaritas, and impeachment punch. And a lot of folks are enjoying those today, as we saw that in full effect. But the main reason that President Trump is coming here is to help Congressman Jeff Van Drew win reelection. This is his district. And, remember, he is the Democrat who opposed impeachment, and a few weeks ago defected from the Democratic Party and joined the Republicans. I just spoke to some folks that are here at tonight's rally with the Trump campaign who say they believe that Congressman Van Drew really personifies a lot of Democrats in the country, who have become disillusioned with their party over impeachment. So, Neil, tonight, expect President Trump to really try to reach out and talk to some of those Democrats who perhaps might be convinced to cross parties. And, also, he's going to try to convince his supporters, the hundreds and thousands of them that are in this room, to vote for Van Drew in November -- Neil."
