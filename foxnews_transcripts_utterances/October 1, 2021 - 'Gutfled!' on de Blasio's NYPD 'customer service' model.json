Dog the Bounty Hunter has joined the search for fugitive Brian Laundrie. Police consider his help crucial as they believe Laundrie may be hiding inside a mullet. Good news a New York Post headline reports McDonald's McRib is McBack. The bad news is so is my McDiarrhea. According to new research, scientists say three masks protect you the most. Well I can't wait to hear the results of their condom study. Same principle. Amazon unveiled the new household robot for 999 bucks, but if I'm paying two grand for a robot made I better be able to have sex with it. They'll call it the Schwarzenegger. And number seven, U.S. Airlines are now considering weight limits for passengers. And other news Brian Stelter I hope you like trains. And that's Greg's seven jokes. All right.

You couldn't ruin a big city faster if you were Mothra. De Blasio is turned a once great city into a cesspool of chaos, which is a lot like her all those hot tub. And like -- and like Geraldo's hot tub NYC is filled with half-naked crazy people and it's prone to flooding. So the police is now customer service. That's great. It's no longer to protect and serve, it's let me help you return that defective garden hose to Home Depot. At least after you get mugged you can stay on the line and update your car warranty. Meanwhile, the mugger has already been released and onto his next victim while you're on hold listening to Air Supply. So as crime explodes the mayor wants community guides. Community guides to greet visitors at City police stations. This is because you heard that the police were gruff and dismisses -- dismissive. Well, Mayor so are the muggers and the rapists. Well, you just described everybody who lives in New York, the only New Yorkers who aren't gruff are dead. Thank you, Andrew Cuomo. Gruffness. That's the problem here. Not murder or assault. So now we turn cops into Wal-Mart greeters. That's the problem with cities run by leftists. They conflate law and order with brutality. So the solution is emasculation whereas we're not even calling crime crime anymore. See, this is in crime. It's reallocations of goods.",

Meanwhile, as we excuse the criminals who are the real threats, parents, the National School Boards Association, which represents over 90,000 school officials beg Joe Biden on Wednesday to protect them from angry mobs of parents upset over vaccine and mask mandates that are forced upon their kids. Saying the parents should be treated as domestic terrorism by extremist hate organizations. You have to these buffoons, a 28-year-old single mom looking out for a kids is the same as a one-eyed monster with a hook for a hand. So they implored Biden to mobilize the FBI and Secret Service to guard school officials. The sad part is, so probably listen. The Teachers Unions realize that the worst thing about COVID is parents realizing how bad the Teachers Unions are. And now that parents are taking a more active role in protecting their kids from these idiots. They're now considered a threat. But these days anyone who disagrees with these Craven self- righteous sanctimonious a-holes can be considered a threat. Remember the soldier who spoke up about the Afghanistan debacle? He's still in the brig. And how about that U.S. Marine who rescued a baby in Kabul during that bus withdrawal?

Now, the kid who wrote, \"Hope all black people die,\" among other racist crap, faces severe disciplinary action, an internship with Joy Reid. Look, teens do dumb stuff all the time, like trying to escape from my basement. But as usual, it's the adults involved who come off looking just as idiotic. That's because the school district superintendent wrote to parents that even though it was all a hoax, \"This does not diminish the hurt he caused or the negative impact it has had on our entire community. More work is needed to ensure our school is safe for each student regardless of their race.\" So, with that logic, there's also work to be done to keep their schools safe from Hobbits and Bigfoot. Actually, it sounds like more work is needed to recognize a hoax when we see one because they happen all the time. And the hurt still exists for the suspicion falsely directed at white students.

So, no matter how bad your life is going, there's someone on the Internet who has it worse, and is being very open about that. I have a few friends on Facebook that always just blow it up my feed with most depressing stuff in the world. Like, guess it's just another night alone. Watching T.V. by myself. In case somebody wants to call me, but they won't because no one ever. So, like, that's because you've made it very clear that you suck. No one is going to invite you to their party if they're worried you are going to sob violently at it. So, on Facebook, you pretend everything's going amazing. Make everyone think things are going better than they actually are. It is like a padded bra for your life. The Internet can make you sad sometimes too, though, because well there's a lot of very hot people on there. I clip fake hair into my actual hair every day. Because I feel like I have to keep up with the Kardashians, right? But I'm not sure how much it really matters because in all of my experiences with men, I know men cannot tell if a woman has good hair. They don't know. I've never seen guys at a bar pointing at a girl, like did you see that girl Brian's talking to? Her hair has like no volume, bro. Should have seen the hair on the girl I was with last night, the sheen, bro, the sheen. Women we are way too insecure for no reason. I do not mean that in the body positivity way because the body positivity they make it those people everything worse, right? Do you remember the Dove's soap normal bodies campaign, right? The women in the ads were like: we are bodies normal in our underwear by are soap. Really? OK, OK cool. Cool. How is that supposed to make anyone feel any better, right? Saying your body is normal is not a compliment. The John Mayer song was like, Your body is normal. Normal body no.\" Don't think it would have been as big of a hit, right? My husband told me I looked normal once. I cried so hard, my fake eyelashes fell off. You might have heard about that because I did post about on Facebook. Nobody invited me to their parties that week. Great. Thank you, guys. Bye.",

It's incurable. They still had to rush Kamala Harris, far away from the studio. It was pretty easy. They just told her it was the southern border. Yes. Dog the Bounty Hunter has joined the search for fugitive Brian Laundrie. Police consider his help crucial as they believe Laundrie may be hiding inside a mullet. Good news a New York Post headline reports McDonald's McRib is McBack. The bad news is so is my McDiarrhea. According to new research, scientists say three masks protect you the most. Well I can't wait to hear the results of their condom study. Same principle. Amazon unveiled the new household robot for 999 bucks, but if I'm paying two grand for a robot made I better be able to have sex with it. They'll call it the Schwarzenegger. And number seven, U.S. Airlines are now considering weight limits for passengers. And other news Brian Stelter I hope you like trains. And that's Greg's seven jokes. All right. Back to the screaming hells cape called Manhattan. Did you hear as kids get shot, junkies take over and the elderly get mugged by gangs of thugs? Also known as Democrats.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "It is. I'm still wondering how did a festering Lincoln log become mayor? What is it with Democrat leaders once they win? Do they take a secret oath to destroy everything? You couldn't ruin a big city faster if you were Mothra. De Blasio is turned a once great city into a cesspool of chaos, which is a lot like her all those hot tub. And like -- and like Geraldo's hot tub NYC is filled with half-naked crazy people and it's prone to flooding. So the police is now customer service. That's great. It's no longer to protect and serve, it's let me help you return that defective garden hose to Home Depot. At least after you get mugged you can stay on the line and update your car warranty. Meanwhile, the mugger has already been released and onto his next victim while you're on hold listening to Air Supply. So as crime explodes the mayor wants community guides. Community guides to greet visitors at City police stations. This is because you heard that the police were gruff and dismisses -- dismissive. Well, Mayor so are the muggers and the rapists. Well, you just described everybody who lives in New York, the only New Yorkers who aren't gruff are dead. Thank you, Andrew Cuomo. Gruffness. That's the problem here. Not murder or assault. So now we turn cops into Wal-Mart greeters. That's the problem with cities run by leftists. They conflate law and order with brutality. So the solution is emasculation whereas we're not even calling crime crime anymore. See, this is in crime. It's reallocations of goods."

Meanwhile, as we excuse the criminals who are the real threats, parents, the National School Boards Association, which represents over 90,000 school officials beg Joe Biden on Wednesday to protect them from angry mobs of parents upset over vaccine and mask mandates that are forced upon their kids. Saying the parents should be treated as domestic terrorism by extremist hate organizations. You have to these buffoons, a 28-year-old single mom looking out for a kids is the same as a one-eyed monster with a hook for a hand. So they implored Biden to mobilize the FBI and Secret Service to guard school officials. The sad part is, so probably listen. The Teachers Unions realize that the worst thing about COVID is parents realizing how bad the Teachers Unions are. And now that parents are taking a more active role in protecting their kids from these idiots. They're now considered a threat. But these days anyone who disagrees with these Craven self- righteous sanctimonious a-holes can be considered a threat. Remember the soldier who spoke up about the Afghanistan debacle? He's still in the brig. And how about that U.S. Marine who rescued a baby in Kabul during that bus withdrawal?

Now, the kid who wrote, \"Hope all black people die,\" among other racist crap, faces severe disciplinary action, an internship with Joy Reid. Look, teens do dumb stuff all the time, like trying to escape from my basement. But as usual, it's the adults involved who come off looking just as idiotic. That's because the school district superintendent wrote to parents that even though it was all a hoax, \"This does not diminish the hurt he caused or the negative impact it has had on our entire community. More work is needed to ensure our school is safe for each student regardless of their race.\" So, with that logic, there's also work to be done to keep their schools safe from Hobbits and Bigfoot. Actually, it sounds like more work is needed to recognize a hoax when we see one because they happen all the time. And the hurt still exists for the suspicion falsely directed at white students.

So, no matter how bad your life is going, there's someone on the Internet who has it worse, and is being very open about that. I have a few friends on Facebook that always just blow it up my feed with most depressing stuff in the world. Like, guess it's just another night alone. Watching T.V. by myself. In case somebody wants to call me, but they won't because no one ever. So, like, that's because you've made it very clear that you suck. No one is going to invite you to their party if they're worried you are going to sob violently at it. So, on Facebook, you pretend everything's going amazing. Make everyone think things are going better than they actually are. It is like a padded bra for your life. The Internet can make you sad sometimes too, though, because well there's a lot of very hot people on there. I clip fake hair into my actual hair every day. Because I feel like I have to keep up with the Kardashians, right? But I'm not sure how much it really matters because in all of my experiences with men, I know men cannot tell if a woman has good hair. They don't know. I've never seen guys at a bar pointing at a girl, like did you see that girl Brian's talking to? Her hair has like no volume, bro. Should have seen the hair on the girl I was with last night, the sheen, bro, the sheen. Women we are way too insecure for no reason. I do not mean that in the body positivity way because the body positivity they make it those people everything worse, right? Do you remember the Dove's soap normal bodies campaign, right? The women in the ads were like: we are bodies normal in our underwear by are soap. Really? OK, OK cool. Cool. How is that supposed to make anyone feel any better, right? Saying your body is normal is not a compliment. The John Mayer song was like, Your body is normal. Normal body no.\" Don't think it would have been as big of a hit, right? My husband told me I looked normal once. I cried so hard, my fake eyelashes fell off. You might have heard about that because I did post about on Facebook. Nobody invited me to their parties that week. Great. Thank you, guys. Bye."
