      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. For months now, privately, we've been searching for a meaningful definition of the word \"equity.\" We've consulted linguists, we've dusted off moldering reference books, and we've scoured the four corners of God's own internet, all in an effort to figure out what equity is. We've done this not for pleasure, we have hobbies, but because we feel it's our duty as a news program. Equity is now the organizing principle of the United States of America. On the very day he was inaugurated, Joe Biden signed Executive Order 13985. That Order makes equity mandatory across the Federal government in all the agencies. And yet strangely, neither Joe Biden nor anyone else in the administration has ever defined the word. So what is equity? Well, tonight, finally we know what it is. Equity, it turns out is racism. It's as simple as that. Equity is racism. And to be clear, we don't mean racism in the sense that ice cream and Shakespeare and math are all now supposedly racist, or that Dr. Seuss is now considered an exalted Cyclops in the Ku Klux Klan. We're not talking about the Ilhan Omar \"Atlantic\" Magazine definition of racism, which by the way isn't actually language, but just another blunt political weapon. No, we mean racism in the literal sense in the way that Martin Luther King defined the term, which is the act of hurting some people and helping others purely on the basis of their respective races. Bigotry, in other words, prejudice, hatred. That's what equity is. We know this thanks to Lori Lightfoot, Mayor of Chicago. Earlier today, Lightfoot released a two-page Manifesto defining equity, quote: \"Equity and inclusion are the North Stars of this administration.\" Lightfoot explained. Then, she got specific about it, quote: \"On the occasion of the two-year anniversary of my inauguration as mayor of this great city, I will be exclusively providing one-on-one interviews with journalists of color.\" So in the name of equity, Lori Lightfoot is refusing to grant interviews to white people. Lightfoot took pains to explain she doesn't mean that personally. In fact, you can see that some of the white reporters who cover City Hall in Chicago are talented and hardworking. But unfortunately, they are, Lightfoot said quote, \"white nonetheless.\" So there it is, as plainly as anyone has ever said it out loud. White people are disqualified because they are white, not because of anything they have done or said or think, Lori Lightfoot doesn't care about that. She says so. Lightfoot is not interested in what these white people might be like as individuals, as people. She doesn't even care what kind of white they are. Their ancestors could be from Italy or Luxembourg or Finland or Spain. They could be members of the British Royal Family. They could be penniless Romanian immigrants living in a box on the sidewalk on Michigan Avenue. Rich or poor, it doesn't matter to Lori Lightfoot. To Lori Lightfoot, all that matters is the fact they are white because all white people are the same. They are entirely defined by the color of their skin. You can see how this makes life a little easier for Lori Lightfoot. She knows who to hate just by looking at them. If someday, the Chicago Police rounded up the entire population of the city, Lori Lightfoot would have no trouble pulling the right ones out of line for punishment. By the way, in case you're wondering, yes, that was a Nazi reference. It was deserved. Lori Lightfoot is a monster. Any society that allows politicians to talk like this has a very ugly future ahead -- very ugly. But of course, no one said much at all about what Lori Lightfoot said in her Manifesto, even Chicago reporters, some of them could no longer do their jobs purely because of how they were born, offered only tepid complaints. Listen to this person from NBC.",

      "sentences": "What? Can this be real? What you just heard was confusion, but not outrage. And yet there's nothing confusing about who Lori Lightfoot is. Lori Lightfoot is a dangerous bigot. Lori Lightfoot is hurting other people because of their race. That's the crime, but of course, it's the one thing nobody wants to say out loud. Here's the response from a reporter at \"The Chicago Tribune,\" quote: \"I'm a Latino reporter whose interview request was granted for today. However, I asked the Mayor's Office to lift its condition on others and when they said no, we respectfully canceled. Politicians don't get to choose who covers them.\" End quote. Talk about missing the point completely. And by the way, of course, politicians can choose who they talk to. All of us have that right, thank God. What politicians cannot do under any circumstances, is attack an entire group of citizens on the basis of their skin color. Again, to restate the obvious, that is racism. It is immoral. It is also illegal under countless State and Federal laws. We are not supposed to allow behavior like that from our government. We are all equal in the eyes of law, we are all citizens. We've got an entire granite monument on the National Mall in Washington promising that we will never behave that way again, we will never allow it. But because we've embraced equity, we're not simply allowing it, we are encouraging it. Meanwhile, how is Chicago? The City of Chicago under Lori Lightfoot is crumbling. Murders last year jumped to 50 percent. Hundreds more dead, many of them young people, children, most of them black. Is that social justice? No, it's not. It's no one's definition of social justice. Not surprisingly, Lori Lightfoot doesn't want to talk about it. There are 50 members of the City Council in Chicago. They're called aldermen. One of them, an alderman called Raymond Lopez has repeatedly pressed Lori Lightfoot to explain what she is doing to the city. You should know that Raymond Lopez is not a right winger. He's a Democrat. He represents the 15th Ward, which is overwhelmingly non-white; in some places it is impoverished. But Raymond Lopez cares a lot about his constituents. So in January, he raised an obvious point with the mayor. Maybe crime is shooting up in Chicago because Chicago as a sanctuary city, is not enforcing Federal law. How did Lori Lightfoot respond to this? She called him a racist.",

Her abrasive style has been seen not only with the media, not only with members of the City Council or even her own departments, but now she is trying to pit communities and people of the city against each other with these kinds of discussions and these kind of tweets. And more importantly, she has spent an entire day trying to defend, articulate and define what she meant yesterday. Meanwhile, just on my way to the studio, I've had two shootings in my ward alone in the last hour. Shootings continue in every neighborhood. On Michigan Avenue yesterday, someone was shot.

Even the Director General of the World Health Organization went against his own team and said China needs to provide answers.

When she was hired, they knew that she had a pretrial intervention program in Louisiana that had wiped away four misdemeanors including assaulting a police officer. They knew she had a deferred prosecution in Florida. And as her behavior got worse and worse within the department, they kept her around. They took her off the dashboard, but they reallocated her. They didn't fire her. It was only when things got untenable that the department fired her, and as a thanks for that, she started lying about them in public, and then she illegally accessed their computer information and downloaded the personal information of 19,000 State employees.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. For months now, privately, we've been searching for a meaningful definition of the word \"equity.\" We've consulted linguists, we've dusted off moldering reference books, and we've scoured the four corners of God's own internet, all in an effort to figure out what equity is. We've done this not for pleasure, we have hobbies, but because we feel it's our duty as a news program. Equity is now the organizing principle of the United States of America. On the very day he was inaugurated, Joe Biden signed Executive Order 13985. That Order makes equity mandatory across the Federal government in all the agencies. And yet strangely, neither Joe Biden nor anyone else in the administration has ever defined the word. So what is equity? Well, tonight, finally we know what it is. Equity, it turns out is racism. It's as simple as that. Equity is racism. And to be clear, we don't mean racism in the sense that ice cream and Shakespeare and math are all now supposedly racist, or that Dr. Seuss is now considered an exalted Cyclops in the Ku Klux Klan. We're not talking about the Ilhan Omar \"Atlantic\" Magazine definition of racism, which by the way isn't actually language, but just another blunt political weapon. No, we mean racism in the literal sense in the way that Martin Luther King defined the term, which is the act of hurting some people and helping others purely on the basis of their respective races. Bigotry, in other words, prejudice, hatred. That's what equity is. We know this thanks to Lori Lightfoot, Mayor of Chicago."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Earlier today, Lightfoot released a two-page Manifesto defining equity, quote",
      "utterance": "\"Equity and inclusion are the North Stars of this administration.\" Lightfoot explained. Then, she got specific about it, quote: \"On the occasion of the two-year anniversary of my inauguration as mayor of this great city, I will be exclusively providing one-on-one interviews with journalists of color.\" So in the name of equity, Lori Lightfoot is refusing to grant interviews to white people. Lightfoot took pains to explain she doesn't mean that personally. In fact, you can see that some of the white reporters who cover City Hall in Chicago are talented and hardworking. But unfortunately, they are, Lightfoot said quote, \"white nonetheless.\" So there it is, as plainly as anyone has ever said it out loud. White people are disqualified because they are white, not because of anything they have done or said or think, Lori Lightfoot doesn't care about that. She says so. Lightfoot is not interested in what these white people might be like as individuals, as people. She doesn't even care what kind of white they are. Their ancestors could be from Italy or Luxembourg or Finland or Spain. They could be members of the British Royal Family. They could be penniless Romanian immigrants living in a box on the sidewalk on Michigan Avenue. Rich or poor, it doesn't matter to Lori Lightfoot. To Lori Lightfoot, all that matters is the fact they are white because all white people are the same. They are entirely defined by the color of their skin. You can see how this makes life a little easier for Lori Lightfoot. She knows who to hate just by looking at them. If someday, the Chicago Police rounded up the entire population of the city, Lori Lightfoot would have no trouble pulling the right ones out of line for punishment. By the way, in case you're wondering, yes, that was a Nazi reference. It was deserved. Lori Lightfoot is a monster. Any society that allows politicians to talk like this has a very ugly future ahead -- very ugly. But of course, no one said much at all about what Lori Lightfoot said in her Manifesto, even Chicago reporters, some of them could no longer do their jobs purely because of how they were born, offered only tepid complaints. Listen to this person from NBC."

And so I reached out to the communications director, Kate Lefurgy, and she texted me back and said, \"Yes, that's true.\" She said, white reporters have been in the room for the majority of the year and it's time to hear from other people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "What? Can this be real? What you just heard was confusion, but not outrage. And yet there's nothing confusing about who Lori Lightfoot is. Lori Lightfoot is a dangerous bigot. Lori Lightfoot is hurting other people because of their race. That's the crime, but of course, it's the one thing nobody wants to say out loud. Here's the response from a reporter at \"The Chicago Tribune,\" quote: \"I'm a Latino reporter whose interview request was granted for today. However, I asked the Mayor's Office to lift its condition on others and when they said no, we respectfully canceled. Politicians don't get to choose who covers them.\" End quote. Talk about missing the point completely. And by the way, of course, politicians can choose who they talk to. All of us have that right, thank God. What politicians cannot do under any circumstances, is attack an entire group of citizens on the basis of their skin color. Again, to restate the obvious, that is racism. It is immoral. It is also illegal under countless State and Federal laws. We are not supposed to allow behavior like that from our government. We are all equal in the eyes of law, we are all citizens. We've got an entire granite monument on the National Mall in Washington promising that we will never behave that way again, we will never allow it. But because we've embraced equity, we're not simply allowing it, we are encouraging it. Meanwhile, how is Chicago? The City of Chicago under Lori Lightfoot is crumbling. Murders last year jumped to 50 percent. Hundreds more dead, many of them young people, children, most of them black. Is that social justice? No, it's not. It's no one's definition of social justice. Not surprisingly, Lori Lightfoot doesn't want to talk about it. There are 50 members of the City Council in Chicago. They're called aldermen. One of them, an alderman called Raymond Lopez has repeatedly pressed Lori Lightfoot to explain what she is doing to the city. You should know that Raymond Lopez is not a right winger. He's a Democrat. He represents the 15th Ward, which is overwhelmingly non-white; in some places it is impoverished. But Raymond Lopez cares a lot about his constituents. So in January, he raised an obvious point with the mayor. Maybe crime is shooting up in Chicago because Chicago as a sanctuary city, is not enforcing Federal law. How did Lori Lightfoot respond to this? She called him a racist."

Here are the consequences of your doing this, she whips around makes it a racial issue and dodges the question. Am I imagining this pattern?"

And whatever her point was, and trying to highlight the need for diversity in media, may be honorable, but it got totally lost in her messaging, in the way she was handling this showing a clear disconnect between thought and action. And that has been the highlight of her two years, and I think it's very telling that she is discussing two years in office, the ability to think and act has eluded her this entire time, as is evidenced by the controversy that she herself created yesterday."

Granted, she has had to deal with a pandemic, but we've all been in this together. We've all been trying to work together and she has failed at every turn to bring people in and to unite people. Her abrasive style has been seen not only with the media, not only with members of the City Council or even her own departments, but now she is trying to pit communities and people of the city against each other with these kinds of discussions and these kind of tweets. And more importantly, she has spent an entire day trying to defend, articulate and define what she meant yesterday. Meanwhile, just on my way to the studio, I've had two shootings in my ward alone in the last hour. Shootings continue in every neighborhood. On Michigan Avenue yesterday, someone was shot. Another carjacking. None of that is part of the discussion, except for the racist whiteness of Chicago media."

And recently we saw with her e- mails being leaked, that she clearly is not aware of what is going on in the communities. And whenever people try to pierce her reality with the truth, she questions their motives. She questions what the angle is, she questions why she is being told these things that she has never heard before. And it comes off in the way she does her policy because nothing she produces or suggests has any impact in improving the quality of life that we have in our city."

Director Robert Redfield all said the evidence was compelling and should be investigated. Even the Director General of the World Health Organization went against his own team and said China needs to provide answers. And breaking today, Republicans in the House Intel Committee say there is significant circumstantial evidence that the virus came from a lab in Wuhan including that in the fall of 2019, several lab workers got sick with COVID-like symptoms. Bottom line here, Tucker, the Wuhan lab theory is gaining steam and gaining supporters -- Tucker."

They are not the only ones who lied though, we know that Andrew Cuomo lied about nursing home deaths in the State of New York. That's come out, too. Media organizations didn't cover that story. Instead, they accused the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis who they worry could run for President of manipulating his state's coronavirus data, and they had evidence to prove it. Various news outlets cited the supposed whistleblower who had previously worked at the Florida Department of Health. It was a woman called Rebekah Jones.

It's not a question of whether you like Ron DeSantis or you like Florida or you think he got it right. As you said Rebekah Jones made a clear claim, an objective claim, a claim that can be falsified, and that is that she was told by Dr. Shamarial Roberson, who is the Deputy Secretary of Health in Florida, is a chronic disease epidemiologist, to fudge the numbers, to edit the raw data. Now, if that were true, that would be an enormous scandal. But it's not. First, it didn't happen. There's no evidence that it happened. But suppose for the sake of argument it had, Rebekah Jones was not in a permission -- a position to do what she said she was asked to do. She didn't have the permissions. She's not an epidemiologist. She's not a scientist. She's not a politician. She was a dashboard manager. Her job was to manage the public facing dashboard with the numbers on it. She got copies of the data in Excel format. She could not write the Merlin database, which is what Florida uses, she could not have done that. The story is false."

And again, I hope that our viewers will read it because it's -- it really made my afternoon one day, but what's amazing is you verified this, you put a lot of work into this piece, but you'd think that Andrew Cuomo's brother could have called over there and said, hey, did this lady actually have the ability to do what she says? Nobody did that so far as I can tell."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COOKE",
      "utterance": "Well, that's another key point. The documents that are used and they are all referenced throughout the piece, they're all linked on the online version of the piece are public information, all of them. The criminal records are public information, the labor file is public information. These have all been in the public domain for months, maybe longer. Anyone could have looked them up and read them. And when you read them, what you find is that this is somebody who was indulged by the Florida Department of Health, not targeted -- indulged. When she was hired, they knew that she had a pretrial intervention program in Louisiana that had wiped away four misdemeanors including assaulting a police officer. They knew she had a deferred prosecution in Florida. And as her behavior got worse and worse within the department, they kept her around. They took her off the dashboard, but they reallocated her. They didn't fire her. It was only when things got untenable that the department fired her, and as a thanks for that, she started lying about them in public, and then she illegally accessed their computer information and downloaded the personal information of 19,000 State employees. So yes, this is somebody who has a history."

I just started watching certain things in the world. Like I wanted it simple things. I'm not, you know, a rocket scientist, I was like, I want people to have jobs. I want people to have, you know, I'd like gas to cost less money. I'd like people to have good schools -- and just really commonsense kind of things. So when I was listening to Trump say what he was going to do. I thought, well, you're saying you're going to do it, I think we should, too. He's not like Mr. Drug Drugged. Do you know what I mean?"

I don't want to put words in his mouth. But it's not like -- it's not like depression doesn't exist. It's not like postpartum doesn't exist. It's not like anxiety doesn't exist.

Well, we learned this week on Sunday that UFOs have entered airspace restricted by the U.S. military every day for years. So, there's a big story here. We're going to speak to the man who made all of this information possible, really, the person who's driven transparency on UFOs more than any other person. The one who ran The Pentagon's UFO unit. Lue Elizondo joins us now."

That is the consensus all of a sudden. \"60 Minutes\" did a long piece on it on Sunday night. This, after decades of mocking anybody who suggested maybe there's something to this. The consensus has changed. And more than any other person, Lue Elizondo is responsible for that. More than any other person, he is the reason we're having this conversation tonight. Elizondo spent nearly two decades in military intelligence before he was named Director of The Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. And ever since he's been pushing for transparency on this issue. We're honored to have him on tonight. Lue, thanks so much for coming. So we are getting --"

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELIZONDO",
      "utterance": "Well, what we should learn is exactly that, what the U.S. government knows about this topic and has known for a while. It is a threat assessment that's supposed to be conducted at the unclassified level and then provided to Congress, which is a report that is expected to be comprehensive and certainly, that's a report that Congress deserves. Unfortunately, what we might get is something that is much more watered down, and I think from my perspective, that's probably the most concerning part of this. The last thing we need is more obfuscation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That's for sure. It's infuriating even to think after 70 years of lying they would continue to lie. So two questions: one, why? Why all the lying at this point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELIZONDO",
      "utterance": "Yes, well first of all, why all the lying? Probably because certain elements in The Pentagon have backed themselves in a corner. They've spent such a long time and amount of energy trying to obfuscate the truth from the American people, that they backed themselves into a corner and they really don't know how to get out of it. And I think the more that we shine a spotlight onto this topic, the more people are going to realize that there really is something there. I think with the announcement of the new I.G. -- Inspector General evaluation into this into this topic and more importantly, the last three years of Pentagon obfuscation, hopefully, the those elements of resistance in The Pentagon will realize that that type of resistance at this point is rather futile."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "You worked for the U.S. government for decades, when we learned Sunday night that maybe pilots had seen these objects, unidentified flying objects every day for two years in restricted airspace, the obvious response was, well, didn't that raise alarms? Wouldn't that scare the hell out of The Pentagon? That their airspace was being violated? Why didn't -- yes."

      "utterance": "And this is part of my frustration."
    },

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "What's the posture here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELIZONDO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I saw the reports and there were times where you'd look at a monthly report, and there were 25 to 26 incidents occurring in a 30-day time period and the question is really, you know, what the hell is wrong with you? How can you not -- how can you not realize that this is an issue? Let's take away for a moment the source of what this possibly could be. And let's just pretend to see the Russian or Chinese. Either way, it's not a good scenario. Someone with some sort of technology that we don't have is encroaching into controlled U.S. airspace on a regular and routine basis and no one wants to do a darn thing about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So one of the reasons we're having this -- I mean, you're the reason we are having this conversation, you, I think more than anybody really pushed hard to bring this stuff to the public, to bring it to light. If this report that we get next month is watered down, redacted to the point of pointlessness, do you think that whistleblowers internally will continue to leak the truth to the public?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELIZONDO",
      "utterance": "Tucker, I do and also, let me just say, for the record, I appreciate the compliment towards me as being part of this. But I also have to give a lot of that credit to folks like you and people in the media that were brave enough, three years ago to cover this topic when nobody else in your industry wanted to cover it and it turns out that you were right. So first of all, thank you for doing what you do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Of course."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELIZONDO",
      "utterance": "And then secondly, yes, I do. I think there's more and more people that are going to come out. We saw Alex Dietrich and Dave Fravor this weekend coming out for the record, and these people have a lot to lose. Alex Dietrich is still in the United States military. There's a lot at risk here. And by the way, for every one of those brave Americans that are coming out having this conversation, there's dozens more in the shadows waiting to tell their story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "We keep hearing whispers that there is physical evidence of the existence of these objects that might tell us what they are. Do you believe that's true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELIZONDO",
      "utterance": "I do believe it's true. And I think we should be looking at this and I think we should be more transparent with the American people. And the last thing we need to do is lie to the American people. I'll tell you one thing, Tucker, from my perspective, you know that type of position where you continue to lie to the American people and obfuscate is the reasons why people like me decide one day to run for Congress. And I can tell you, the last thing DoD wants right now is someone like me in Congress. But that's what happens when you're not -- when you're not when you're not honest and open and fair with people, you know, we pay for it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Amen. I agree with that completely. Is there debris, do you believe from any of these vehicles, whatever they are?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELIZONDO",
      "utterance": "Tucker, you know that the United States government is in possession of exotic material, and I'll leave it at that. More analysis needs to be done. There's enough uniqueness about it where it demands additional analysis, additional expertise. And thankfully, there are pockets in the U.S. government that are willing to have the conversation and conduct the analysis. I'm not going to say those right now what those elements are, because I'm worried, frankly for the same type of reprisal that I'm facing currently. But there are pockets of people that are willing to do the right thing. And fortunately, these individuals are patriotic and willing to do the job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Amen. It's also crazy and amazing. Lue Elizondo, thank you so much. I will see you again."
