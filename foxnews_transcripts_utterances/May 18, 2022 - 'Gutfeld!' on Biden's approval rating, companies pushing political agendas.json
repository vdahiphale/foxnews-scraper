      "sentences": "So let's get into Joy Biden's popularity is like his teeth at night. Underwater. If he sunk any deeper, he'd have crabs. Because he'd be in the sea. That's where the crabs live. To remind out of the gutter. His approval ratings at 39 percent even after the Roe vs. Wade leak, which was designed to breathe life into his unconscious presidency. It was one Biden leak that didn't demand a change of pants. But it still didn't work. In fact, thanks to idiots heading to the justices' houses like they were invited to a barbecue. It quickly turned into a freak show but with more bearded ladies. Underrated by the way. When you saw the protests, you probably like me wish their mommies had been as pro abortion as their offspring. Why not? That's how you support them. You also were reminded that pro choice doesn't always mean choosing soap and water. The worst stat of all this jaw dropping one from NBC News. 75 percent of the population thinks this country is going in the wrong direction. That's astounding. You couldn't get more agreement from a room of children if you yelled who wants ice cream and no homework. Meanwhile, 60 percent think the country is headed in the right direction, which raises the question, who the hell is this 60 percent?",

      "sentences": "Just as I suspected. A CNN production meeting. So we live in polarizing times we're told, and the polarization is driven by the media that does all it can to keep us at each other's throats. They see everything through the lens of identity politics, and everywhere they look except in the mirror is proof of racism. I thought that would destroy America. But instead, it's destroying the Democratic Party. And places like CNN and MSNBC, they're losing viewers. And it's created unity. A near unanimous belief that the country is going in the wrong direction. So congrats to Sleepy Joe for bringing the country together on something other than a desire to take away his car keys. So when you have nearly 80 percent saying we're going off a cliff, that's not polarization. That's a realization that we're heading no place good. Seriously, when your car is barreling toward the Grand Canyon, you don't argue about changing the radio station. Well, unless it's playing Maroon Five, then you might speed up. See? The party in charge suffers from a weird flaw. It's a lack of imagination. They can't see ahead of themselves. The problems we experience are obvious, high crime, high inflation, high illegal immigration. And yet these problems don't exist until they become political ones. They simply do not exist until they create a risk for losing power, but then it's too late. So they scream racism. What does this do to the party in power? Well, it makes them ill equipped to prevent or solve an actual problem. Those muscles have atrophied from disuse, and take crime. Apparently it doesn't exist until effects polling or their own personal safety, not yours. Then the Democratic Party acts like my stomach when I have dairy. Yes. Once you do it, you no longer have time to deal with it. It's disgusting. Their goal is to win elections, not to stop crime, shouting defund the police can win big city voters. But when -- what do you tell the same voters after the election when their neighborhood's burning like that rash I got from sharing Jesse's gym towel. As long as the election is far away, then crime can continue. Anything bad could continue. The Dems being in the majority, Joe's presidency, the Seth Meyers show, he's on late night if you don't know who he is. And then suddenly, as the midterms loom, they panic. Crime matters. So does gas prices, so does getting food on the table, then they mimic Republicans. Hey, we're anti-crime too, we need more cops. They're like the mob dev guy who breaks all the windows in your neighborhood and then just happens to be the owner of the new glass shop that opens around the corner. You get this because you're not a politician. You have a real job. When faced with a problem that needs fixing you fix it right away, because you have a boss. You have deadlines, job reviews and pride. You don't have the luxury of a political machine that makes sure you can keep your job every two or every four years. For Democrats they only work when they are campaigning. And winning an election is a reminder that it's time to relax and do nothing. Just when you roll up your sleeves, they roll theirs back down. What's Joe got to say?",

And keep in mind the rest of the 78 plus percent of the country who feel the same way I do represent the lowest marks in Biden's his -- in Biden's tenure thus far, right? But the number that stands out to me is that 65 percent of Americans think that their level of income is falling behind the cost of living. And the most important thing to them right now is the cost of living followed by the economy and jobs. It's not spelling women with an X, like Michelle Obama would have you know, right? It's not putting CRT in the school curriculum like Pelosi would have you think. So to me, the real Americans whose priorities are liberty and faith and family and freedom and being able to earn your living unencumbered by this bloated government or the Cryptkeeper that runs it, then yes, believe it salvageable. Absolutely. But hopefully because of the red wave in the fall, because what these numbers represent to me is that the cluster, the last time it was this bad was in 2008. And that's when Raiders had a five and 11 record. And therefore, there's only way to go up but it makes sense in my head.",

The Democrats are after the children of America, whether it's CRT or whether it's this gender confusion. They're trying to create a country where we forget who we are. I mean, we talk a lot about making America great again but you got to ask yourself what made this country great to start with? The things that made this country great, I call it the three C's, Greg. It's our -- it's our constitution, it's capitalism and Christianity for religious liberty -- for religious liberties. That's the reason this country is great. That's why we have one million people that immigrate to this country illegally and 2.5 million are trying to get here illegally. I mean, just remember, a few months ago, we saw people literally grasping onto the wings of airplanes to get to this country. We saw mothers handing their babies to a newborn -- a newborn child to a soldier who had an M16 on his hip. She didn't know that man. She didn't know anything about him. The only thing she knew was, he had the old red, white and blue on his shoulder. And that was enough for her to know if her kid could just get here. It'd be pretty spectacular. But the Democrats are trying to rewrite our history. That's why they're trying to destroy our history because they want to remake us into this socialist agenda about looking more like Europe. And we're not, that's not who America has ever been. That's who we're not going to be as long as we have people that are running from the right to do the right thing.",

That's because Americans want relief from companies that drone on about their beliefs. A new survey, my favorite kind, finds that most American voters think I'm better looking than Jared Leto. But they also want companies to quit pushing political agendas. It's true. A whopping 87.1 percent say they're likely to stop using a product or service of a company that openly advocates for a political agenda that they disagree with. The remaining 12 percent were this. And it holds true across party lines. A majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents all said they drop a company if they didn't cut it with the political crap. That's the highest bipartisan consensus since we all agreed I'm better looking to Jared Leto. Now these are timely insights. Considering that in recent years, companies have been pressured by their own employees in many cases to take political stances, and some of these companies are worse at staying in their lane than a Kennedy. I don't know. Some of them can drive. `From Disney to Coca- Cola and professional sports leagues, hundreds of companies have taken sides on many stupid issues. They're sticking their nose where it doesn't belong, which is how Pinocchio ended up doing porn. Thank you. But it looks like customers have had enough.

New stance until Thursday but it's already, already creating more buzz than a large vibrator in an emergency room. Took forever to remove. Yumi, Yumi says she's proud to champion body and race diversity, fine, but psychologist, Jordan Peterson, dare to criticize tweeting: \"Sorry, not beautiful and no amount of authoritarian tolerance is going to change that.\" Peterson has since quit Twitter after all the backlash which raises the question: aren't we entitled to an opinion especially if it's a publicly consumed a product designed for generating opinions and controversy? Or is it better to say nothing than take a risk and say what a lot of people are thinking, like Peterson did? The cover does meet one goal: it punishes straight men who prefer completely unrealistic, as opposed to unhealthy body types.

I don't fit in any of the charts. But I would never put upon my children to gain weight. I wouldn't -- if my kids were eating chocolate cakes every day, and saying, daddy, I want to be big and strong like you, I'd be like, no, that's bad for you. It's not good for you. Because I'm at my best when I'm under 350 pounds. When you're heavy, you don't feel good. And I guarantee that if any one of the people in the struggles with being overweight, could really tell the truth. Besides when you're in the mirror, or every time you sit on a couch, you find a small pillow and you put it right here, they would say they're not happy to. But because we're living in a time where if a doctor asks you your weight, he's wrong. No, he's a doctor. And when you have someone who's a physical trainer who was for a biscuit away for 400 pounds, because they spend their whole days doing selfies like this to make themselves look skinnier. There's a reason why the all the pictures are like this because they're not happy and this is saying like it's, it is OK. So, there's two sides of this: good for her for wearing that, but to promote it is not -- I don't agree with it. I agree, I'm going to go with Dr. Peterson on this one.",

You know, when a husband looks around the house for things to do; and passive responsibility when a guy is available to help it waits for someone to tell them what needs to be done.

The country is a mess, man, I'm married 16 years this summer it's a milestone and it's screwing up our lives like the supply chain is screwing up our lives. My wife, for Mother's Day, she wanted one of those like digital assistants that answers all your questions like an Amazon Alexa, but the supply chain so screwed up they sent one of these knockoffs that doesn't take questions called a Kamala. Oh, it's terrible, man. The GPS doesn't know how to get to the southern border. It's a whole mess. My friends stick up for her because New York they're all liberal. They're like, don't make fun of Kamala, she's not that dumb. You know, Kamala is so dumb, she studied for a COVID test. Like stop it. But 16 years, man, and it's really awkward for my wife and I because we keep running into my high school girlfriend at the grocery store. But it's going to change. She's going to graduate in a couple of weeks. And you guys, I'm Jimmy Failla. Thank you for this, Greg. Have a great night, you guys.",

To remind out of the gutter. His approval ratings at 39 percent even after the Roe vs. Wade leak, which was designed to breathe life into his unconscious presidency. It was one Biden leak that didn't demand a change of pants. But it still didn't work. In fact, thanks to idiots heading to the justices' houses like they were invited to a barbecue. It quickly turned into a freak show but with more bearded ladies. Underrated by the way. When you saw the protests, you probably like me wish their mommies had been as pro abortion as their offspring. Why not? That's how you support them. You also were reminded that pro choice doesn't always mean choosing soap and water. The worst stat of all this jaw dropping one from NBC News. 75 percent of the population thinks this country is going in the wrong direction. That's astounding. You couldn't get more agreement from a room of children if you yelled who wants ice cream and no homework. Meanwhile, 60 percent think the country is headed in the right direction, which raises the question, who the hell is this 60 percent?"

      "utterance": "Just as I suspected. A CNN production meeting. So we live in polarizing times we're told, and the polarization is driven by the media that does all it can to keep us at each other's throats. They see everything through the lens of identity politics, and everywhere they look except in the mirror is proof of racism. I thought that would destroy America. But instead, it's destroying the Democratic Party. And places like CNN and MSNBC, they're losing viewers. And it's created unity. A near unanimous belief that the country is going in the wrong direction. So congrats to Sleepy Joe for bringing the country together on something other than a desire to take away his car keys. So when you have nearly 80 percent saying we're going off a cliff, that's not polarization. That's a realization that we're heading no place good. Seriously, when your car is barreling toward the Grand Canyon, you don't argue about changing the radio station. Well, unless it's playing Maroon Five, then you might speed up. See? The party in charge suffers from a weird flaw. It's a lack of imagination. They can't see ahead of themselves. The problems we experience are obvious, high crime, high inflation, high illegal immigration. And yet these problems don't exist until they become political ones. They simply do not exist until they create a risk for losing power, but then it's too late. So they scream racism. What does this do to the party in power? Well, it makes them ill equipped to prevent or solve an actual problem. Those muscles have atrophied from disuse, and take crime. Apparently it doesn't exist until effects polling or their own personal safety, not yours. Then the Democratic Party acts like my stomach when I have dairy. Yes. Once you do it, you no longer have time to deal with it. It's disgusting. Their goal is to win elections, not to stop crime, shouting defund the police can win big city voters. But when -- what do you tell the same voters after the election when their neighborhood's burning like that rash I got from sharing Jesse's gym towel. As long as the election is far away, then crime can continue. Anything bad could continue. The Dems being in the majority, Joe's presidency, the Seth Meyers show, he's on late night if you don't know who he is. And then suddenly, as the midterms loom, they panic. Crime matters. So does gas prices, so does getting food on the table, then they mimic Republicans. Hey, we're anti-crime too, we need more cops. They're like the mob dev guy who breaks all the windows in your neighborhood and then just happens to be the owner of the new glass shop that opens around the corner. You get this because you're not a politician. You have a real job. When faced with a problem that needs fixing you fix it right away, because you have a boss. You have deadlines, job reviews and pride. You don't have the luxury of a political machine that makes sure you can keep your job every two or every four years. For Democrats they only work when they are campaigning. And winning an election is a reminder that it's time to relax and do nothing. Just when you roll up your sleeves, they roll theirs back down. What's Joe got to say?"

And keep in mind the rest of the 78 plus percent of the country who feel the same way I do represent the lowest marks in Biden's his -- in Biden's tenure thus far, right? But the number that stands out to me is that 65 percent of Americans think that their level of income is falling behind the cost of living. And the most important thing to them right now is the cost of living followed by the economy and jobs. It's not spelling women with an X, like Michelle Obama would have you know, right? It's not putting CRT in the school curriculum like Pelosi would have you think. So to me, the real Americans whose priorities are liberty and faith and family and freedom and being able to earn your living unencumbered by this bloated government or the Cryptkeeper that runs it, then yes, believe it salvageable. Absolutely. But hopefully because of the red wave in the fall, because what these numbers represent to me is that the cluster, the last time it was this bad was in 2008.

And what we figured out is they have one mission, and that is they are going after our children. The Democrats are after the children of America, whether it's CRT or whether it's this gender confusion. They're trying to create a country where we forget who we are. I mean, we talk a lot about making America great again but you got to ask yourself what made this country great to start with? The things that made this country great, I call it the three C's, Greg. It's our -- it's our constitution, it's capitalism and Christianity for religious liberty -- for religious liberties. That's the reason this country is great. That's why we have one million people that immigrate to this country illegally and 2.5 million are trying to get here illegally. I mean, just remember, a few months ago, we saw people literally grasping onto the wings of airplanes to get to this country. We saw mothers handing their babies to a newborn -- a newborn child to a soldier who had an M16 on his hip. She didn't know that man. She didn't know anything about him. The only thing she knew was, he had the old red, white and blue on his shoulder. And that was enough for her to know if her kid could just get here. It'd be pretty spectacular. But the Democrats are trying to rewrite our history. That's why they're trying to destroy our history because they want to remake us into this socialist agenda about looking more like Europe. And we're not, that's not who America has ever been. That's who we're not going to be as long as we have people that are running from the right to do the right thing."

That's because Americans want relief from companies that drone on about their beliefs. A new survey, my favorite kind, finds that most American voters think I'm better looking than Jared Leto. But they also want companies to quit pushing political agendas. It's true. A whopping 87.1 percent say they're likely to stop using a product or service of a company that openly advocates for a political agenda that they disagree with. The remaining 12 percent were this. And it holds true across party lines. A majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents all said they drop a company if they didn't cut it with the political crap. That's the highest bipartisan consensus since we all agreed I'm better looking to Jared Leto. Now these are timely insights. Considering that in recent years, companies have been pressured by their own employees in many cases to take political stances, and some of these companies are worse at staying in their lane than a Kennedy. I don't know. Some of them can drive. `From Disney to Coca- Cola and professional sports leagues, hundreds of companies have taken sides on many stupid issues. They're sticking their nose where it doesn't belong, which is how Pinocchio ended up doing porn. Thank you. But it looks like customers have had enough.

I wouldn't -- if my kids were eating chocolate cakes every day, and saying, daddy, I want to be big and strong like you, I'd be like, no, that's bad for you. It's not good for you. Because I'm at my best when I'm under 350 pounds. When you're heavy, you don't feel good. And I guarantee that if any one of the people in the struggles with being overweight, could really tell the truth. Besides when you're in the mirror, or every time you sit on a couch, you find a small pillow and you put it right here, they would say they're not happy to. But because we're living in a time where if a doctor asks you your weight, he's wrong. No, he's a doctor. And when you have someone who's a physical trainer who was for a biscuit away for 400 pounds, because they spend their whole days doing selfies like this to make themselves look skinnier. There's a reason why the all the pictures are like this because they're not happy and this is saying like it's, it is OK. So, there's two sides of this: good for her for wearing that, but to promote it is not -- I don't agree with it. I agree, I'm going to go with Dr. Peterson on this one."

A viral TikTok video, an app that destroys more brain cells than lead paint, a marriage therapist shared the most common complaints women have about their husbands other than them not being as handsome as me. According to her, wives complained about husbands you wait to be told what needs to be done. She also breaks down the difference between active responsibility. You know, when a husband looks around the house for things to do; and passive responsibility when a guy is available to help it waits for someone to tell them what needs to be done. So, once again, it's up to men to figure out what they did wrong before they did anything wrong. Now, that never happens around my house. My wife deals with our gardener, Manuel, herself. From what my neighbor is telling me, he's there every day while I'm at the office. Talk about a work ethic. He'll even water the plants in our bedroom, which has to explain all the grass stains on our sheets."

I actually saw a deer run up to a hunter, like shoot me (BLEEP) right here, I can't take this. You know, you're driving through Pennsylvania and you see those dead deer on the side of the highway. Those aren't accidents. Those are suicides, people. Every one of those deer has a little note on to the body. Like, I'm bored, you know. But New York is great. They're like, yes, that's the greatest energy in the world. You wonder why it's because everybody here is on the verge of snapping at any minute. Oh, it's so competitive, it makes you nut. You ever drive here? It's the only city in the world where you signal after you've already made it into the next lane. Anywhere else in the world, you want to go left you put on your blinker like, hey, I'm going left; but if you do that here they block you. So, instead, you have to go left then you put on your blinker like ha-ha, (BLEEP) you, I made it. Nuts! The country is a mess, man, I'm married 16 years this summer it's a milestone and it's screwing up our lives like the supply chain is screwing up our lives. My wife, for Mother's Day, she wanted one of those like digital assistants that answers all your questions like an Amazon Alexa, but the supply chain so screwed up they sent one of these knockoffs that doesn't take questions called a Kamala. Oh, it's terrible, man. The GPS doesn't know how to get to the southern border. It's a whole mess. My friends stick up for her because New York they're all liberal. They're like, don't make fun of Kamala, she's not that dumb. You know, Kamala is so dumb, she studied for a COVID test. Like stop it. But 16 years, man, and it's really awkward for my wife and I because we keep running into my high school girlfriend at the grocery store. But it's going to change. She's going to graduate in a couple of weeks. And you guys, I'm Jimmy Failla. Thank you for this, Greg. Have a great night, you guys."
