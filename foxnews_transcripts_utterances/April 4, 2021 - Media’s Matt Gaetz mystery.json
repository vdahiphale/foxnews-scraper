Meaning that our job is to turn a light not on powerless people, those who we're supposed to be defending but on the corruption of power centers, governments, security states, large corporations. And what this USA Today story like so many other recent stories over the last couple of years did was exactly the opposite. It targeted private citizens, people who are indigent and who are charged with very serious crimes by the Justice Department in connection with the January 6 riot. Some of whom are charged with committing violence. Most of whom are not but all of them are entitled to a vigorous defense and they were trying to raise money online so that they could defend themselves with good criminal lawyers against the full weight of the Justice Department crashing down on them.

I understood that sentiment working two blocks from the building but it was a big mistake. On Friday, as you know, a man rammed his car into two Capitol police officers, killing 18-year veteran Billy Evans and wounding the other officer. NBC's Pete Williams reported the attacker was a white male but that was a serious blunder. In fact, he was a Black man and an avid follower of anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan in the nation of Islam and was killed when he came at the officers with a knife. Not that his ideology should matter in deciphering this act of insanity. What matters is another Capitol police officer is dead and our condolences to our Billy Evan's family. What matters is our republic remains under threat from inflamed and unbalanced attackers of all stripes. What matters is we must protect our people and our institutions from the scourge of politically-motivated violence. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is MEDIA BUZZ. Ahead, we'll talk to former White House spokesman Hogan Gidley and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald.

But I think that there's a business aspect to it, even other than the one that Liz mentioned as well, which is, of course, you know, the economic boom that having an All-Star Game in a specific city really brings that city, right? I saw this in an editorial in National Review and also in Fox Business, pointing out last year, in 2020, in Los Angeles, brought the city almost $90 million in economic activity. So I think these are all complicated issues. You know, people can get lost in them. And I really think that I'm not surprised, as Liz said, people are talking about them. But there are always a lot of different externalities to anything when you talk about something that isn't just political but is a business thing on many different levels."

Liz, Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp said on Fox that this was cancel culture, that this was based on a bunch of liberal lies about the voting law. Donald Trump, as we all know, routinely weighed in on sports controversies, particularly the NFL anthem protest. You have Biden weighing in on the players' side in this controversy. Is this the new normal? Are sports and politics now sort of melded together forever?"

When you look at sort of the meaning of it, you know, if you're looking at sort of the pinnacle of baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, Chevrolet, it is baseball that is very much the American past time, and by association, you're looking at the All-Star Game. So I'm not surprised. But again, if you look at what position that some of these Georgia politicians are in, Stacey Abrams, who is a big voter advocate, is unhappy that this is being moved out of Georgia. She says it will financially hurt the state. You've got Keisha Bottoms, the mayor of Atlanta, who is also saying she's disappointed about it. And it is a lot of money. But again, past the money, you've got to figure this is looking through the political prism, whether it's for business or for politicians. But they've got to get the story right. As Kat mentioned, it was not us, it's The Washington Post that pointed out that people are looking at old versions of this bill and they're not looking at the final version and some of the details which in some cases, not all, but some cases, expand voter rights."

And look, I think that a lot of people -- what is missing from a lot of coverage is that you can believe multiple things at once, you can believe that this is a real illness, that it's serious, that it's potentially deadly to many people, but you can also believe that, look, it's been a year and we're all being asked to live in a way that's counter to our basic biology as human beings. We're social creatures. That's important not just to our mental health but our physical health as well. I wish we could just see some more nuance.

Yes, nobody is exempt from criticism here, whether it is President Trump or Fauci or Birx. You know, both sides are trying to fight back here. Nobody should be surprised that President Trump is punching back. That's what he does. That's what he always said he would do. Birx and Fauci are -- certainly both doctors working very hard to say, you know what, yeah, I got certain things wrong, but listen, we really want to make sure that we get the story right.

So, again, you know, Operation Warp Speed deserves so much credit because we are now, of course, coming out with so many vaccinations, millions and millions.

That is according to unnamed sources who said the probe begun toward the end of the Trump administration.

But now, on Friday, you started to see that there may be receipts involving Apple pay. And look, as it becomes more detailed and we don't have those details yet, just as Tucker mentioned, but even Tucker looked confused by this interview because Matt Gaetz have come out proactively to defend himself. There becomes a point where if there's more credence to it, then Matt Gaetz's shelf life as a representative of the U.S. Congress is going to be very attenuated. That said, paying for women when you're not a married man expensive gifts is not illegal. We need to bear this out and see more details as they become available, Howie."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

But The Washington Examiner first obtained documents showing in fact that his father, former state Senator Don Gaetz, had been told in a written proposal that his son's future legal and political problems would go away if they put up $25 million to help free an American hostage in Iran. Not clear how they have the influence to stop a DOJ probe. And so this adds to the aura of ambiguity around the whole mess."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yeah, absolutely. I think a lot of that had to do with Gaetz himself, right? We all remember the tweet where he said, my father has been wearing a wire. He said to Tucker that he did wear a wire. It means the guy is continuing to wear a wire. Of course, mine and many people's first thought was, boy, if I ever wear a wire for anybody and you tweet about it, I'll be very upset. But look, right -- and Liz is right. This story does have everything. It got sex. It got drugs. It has Matt Gaetz who is a very polarizing figure. He's a very staunch supporter of Donald Trump, so people either really love him or they really hate him. But I think it's been really interesting, if it is, you know, buying expensive gifts for women and sleeping with them, it is not -- that's isn't illegal. We certainly need to figure out exactly -- there are receipts coming in. We still need to figure out more about what happened. But it's been interesting to see some in the media on the left who normally wouldn't be so puritanical about something like that, being very puritanical and not just look at following the facts of it which, again, it is bizarre, so it is hard to know what those are."
    },

And when he came out and specifically said it's verifiably false that I have travelled with a 17- year-old woman, of course the media is going to try and tease out legalese in here. Number one -- is he just denying that he travelled with her and why do you call a 17-year-old who is a minor a woman? But putting all of that aside, he went out there to defend himself. Again, we have to wait for these details. I would simply say that you've got a very, as Kat said, a polarizing figure right now who has gone out there and is now exposed in certain cases of -- there are two things that make this certainly legitimate, Howie, as a news story. Number one, it came not from Biden's attorney general but from Donald Trump's attorney general. If Donald Trump is batman, Matt Gaetz has been his robin."

Quickly."

But it is that nine minutes and 29 seconds that really moved everybody when they relived that and that is really why it is such an uphill battle, if you will, for defense attorney, Eric Nelson, who is going to make the case, has made the case in opening statements this week, that it's about more than just the videos of Floyd's slow death but that parade of witnesses ranging from age nine to age 61, many of them breaking down on the stand, very powerful.

      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly, and it's important to remember that the general public watching this emotional trial and it continues this coming week do not have the same challenges that the actual jurors do or responsibilities to look at the letter of the law. I remember in covering the trials of all six officers in the Freddie Gray trials in Baltimore, it was very different in what you may perceive is what happened to what the jurors had to look at, and that is simply why defense attorney Nelson is going to argue that Chauvin did indeed follow his training and that his actions were legal when obviously that video leaves one thinking anything but."

Yet I'm not seeing a lot of commentators go on the air and saying, you know what, Derek Chauvin is getting a bad deal and being charged with second degree murder and manslaughter. It doesn't seem to have moved the media a needle much if at all."

Donald Trump said in various statements that this is a globalist betrayal, that it is a cruel and heartless attack on the American dream, that our economy will be destroyed.

But the media want these types of policies implemented in this country. They don't care that the infrastructure package doesn't address roads and bridges. And in fact, most of the roads and bridges are up to the states to fix and maintain and build. That's why they have taxes at the local level to do that. This is a federalization of that project. Joe Biden has been talking about this now for a long time. So have Democrats. We know under Barack Obama there were all these shovel ready jobs that weren't actually shovel ready. They didn't do anything to prop up the American economy. This won't either. Think of it this way. All President Trump's border policies were reversed under Joe Biden. So, we have a different result. People flooding into the country, you now have incentives for people to expand the drug trade, human traffic, child smuggle. That's what happens under Joe Biden versus Donald Trump."

Because as you know President Biden strongly supporting the move by Major League Baseball to move the all-star game out of Atlanta to protest the Georgia voting law. I'm sure you disagree with that. But Donald Trump again is calling for a boycott, not just of baseball but of Coke, Delta, Citigroup and other of big corporations that are supporting either the Georgia law or similar state proposals. He says in a statement with a rigged and stole our 2020 presidential election which we won by a landslide, why go there, weigh in on baseball, but why go there?"

This woke ideology is very problematic for this country, for so many reasons. And this is kind of the culmination of that, You have a vocal minority out there crying racism every single time Republicans put forth a policy. In this particular instance in Georgia, what part of this bill do Democrats dislike? The expansion of voting on the weekend? More days to vote absentee? Voting on Sunday, for example? Or the drop boxes that other states controlled by Democrats like Joe Biden's Delaware do not have. The fact is, Georgia opened up its voting and the Atlanta Journal Constitution put forth an incredible correction this week in which it basically said none of the things in this bill curtail voting. In fact, it kind of expands voting. My question is --"

These leftists in the mainstream media just lap up whatever Democrats say and post it and a week later they're coming out with all of these corrections. That's a problem. Because now it's already engrained into the American people's mind. They did that on purpose. This bill is not racist.

Joining us now from Brazil, Glenn Greenwald, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who now writes on Substack. He is the author of the forthcoming book \"Securing Democracy: My Fight for Press Freedom and Justice.\" And Glenn, what's your main objection to this USA Today story, the people who are charged here raising money, they're not charged with violent acts but breaching security at the capitol. And tell us a little about the blowback you got for the criticism."

      "utterance": "Sure. So, it's really based on my idea of journalism and not just my idiosyncratic idea but one commonly accepted in the profession for decades. There's an old saying in journalism often cited by the Pulitzer committee when they award Pulitzer Prizes, which is that the role of the journalist is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. Meaning that our job is to turn a light not on powerless people, those who we're supposed to be defending but on the corruption of power centers, governments, security states, large corporations. And what this USA Today story like so many other recent stories over the last couple of years did was exactly the opposite. It targeted private citizens, people who are indigent and who are charged with very serious crimes by the Justice Department in connection with the January 6 riot. Some of whom are charged with committing violence. Most of whom are not but all of them are entitled to a vigorous defense and they were trying to raise money online so that they could defend themselves with good criminal lawyers against the full weight of the Justice Department crashing down on them. And the point of this USA Today article explicitly was to prevent them from doing that. In fact, they went to a lot of these companies that were being used to fund raise --"

The primary target of the Trump era media has become private citizens and people who wield no power, yet who these media outlets believe must have their lives ruined because they have adopted the wrong political ideology. So, you see this as ideologically based?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. You know, one of the examples I cited was a couple of years ago, CNN went to the front yard of an elderly woman in Florida to confront her because she had posted a pro-Trump rally on her Facebook page that CNN claimed was actually engineered by the Russians, and tried to basically confront her whether she was some kind of Kremlin operative, this 75-year-old woman. They dox people all the time if you make a pro-Trump meme or an anti-media meme. They dox you all the time. And then in this case what they did, and this is what they always do, Howie, that's even more disturbing, is if you criticize them, I'm talking about major journalists from the second largest newspaper in the country which is USA Today, I criticized them, others did. They then turn around and make themselves the victim. They say by criticizing us as journalists you're inciting hatred against us, you're inciting harassment. They've completely reversed the dynamic. They attack marginalized powerless people but then pretend that marginalized, powerless vulnerable ones are themselves so that it's illegitimate to criticize it. So many elements --"

And NBC's Ben Collins called you a member of the extreme right. Other people said that you were bullying Brenna Taylor, this fragile young woman. A female NBC journalist tweeted, it seemed some powerful men are determined to go after female tech journalist. Your response?"

    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "It's so ironic. Because the whole point of feminism, the feminist movement which I've always supported and still support is to say that women are as strong as men and are as capable as men of doing professional jobs. There's obviously a lot of strong women in journalism. And what they're doing is reversing that. They're saying no. Women are too fragile, we need to treat them like these China dolls who cannot be criticized, who cannot be critiqued in any way because if you do, you're somehow harming them. It's a really regressive kind of sexist trope that they're using to place themselves off limits from criticism even though they wield a lot of power."

You tweeted people in the liberal sector of the media have not come to terms with how widely and intensely hated they are. Hate is a strong word. Hated by who? Hated by the right?"

If you look at not just the trends in digital media where these digital media outlets are completely failing, huge layoffs or even closure, but even polling data from Axios at the beginning of the year showing trust and faith among American citizens in the media is at an all-time low. It's a crisis in journalism and they refuse to take any responsibility or even ask whether anything that they're doing is responsible."

      "utterance": "CBS' Tracy Smith asked the question several more times in there. Glenn Greenwald, should the press accept Hunter Biden's response that he doesn't know if a laptop filled with his e-mails is his, maybe it is, maybe it isn't?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "It's totally irrelevant, Howie, because there's no doubt then, there wasn't then and there's certainly isn't now that those documents are authentic. Nobody from the Biden family ever claimed that a word of those e-mails or documents that were published are anything but authentic. There are people who were on the e-mail chains. Witnesses who have said I have these e-mails and they're all real. If you're somebody like Hunter Biden and the press organization publishes e-mails in your name that are fake, the first thing you do is say they're fake. But he still won't say it because those documents were authentic and always were."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "On that point, NPR ran a rather belated correction, it says a previous version of the story said U.S. intelligence had discredited the laptop story. U.S. intelligence officials have not made a statement to that effect. What about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "You know, I really think we haven't sufficiently appreciated how serious and grave this attack was on our right to have the dissemination of information. What happened before the election when Facebook and Twitter that wield enormous influence censored these stories, refused to allow the stories, this reporting from the oldest newspaper in the country, The New York Post, even to be circulated because they accepted a lie from ex-CIA officials like John Brennan that this information was Russian disinformation. There's been no evidence that Russia had any role. And we know now it wasn't disinformation, the documents are real. It was not just widespread censorship weeks before an election but based on lies from the intelligence community that prevented millions of American citizens from hearing about relevant information about the leading presidential frontrunner. And I think it's an incredible scandal that we ought to revisit in light of this interview."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, I was highly critical of it at the time. And Twitter's Jack Dorsey has later admitted now this was a big mistake. Look, Hunter Biden writes in this book beautiful things about smoking crack every 15 hints, the drinking problems, his father -- visiting his father and then his dad chasing him into the driveway and when he left the house and saying I don't know what to do about your addiction coverage. Is the coverage and the interviews he's doing starting to generate Some sympathy for him as a person since obviously addiction is an awful thing to deal with?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "Well, I never have regarded his addiction struggles as newsworthy, nor his consensual sexual adult relationships which were part of these documents. So, talking about that is, if it's his choice, is a noble thing to do. What I considered newsworthy and what was censored were the parts of the documents showing that he was peddling influence with Joe Biden's brother in China and Ukraine that raised real questions about the extent to which Joe Biden knew about it and was participating in it. So, if they want to focus on his addiction problems, I support Hunter Biden and anyone else struggling with addiction. But the real story was corruption and influence peddling in countries in which Joe Biden, then the vice president, had a lot of influence and power and we shouldn't let anyone distract from what the real story was."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, obviously, Hunter Biden's motivation in writing this book beside the reported $2 million advance, was to show and paint a more sympathetic portion of himself. But you think now he has opened the door for us to revisit these questions about Ukraine and Burisma, you know, some of which got an awful lot of attention during the first impeachment. I've got about half a minute."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, we should be revisiting it regardless because the real story was not just what that document -- those documents showed about Biden and China and Ukraine but also the use -- the abuse of power by Facebook and the Democrats to censor a major story right before an election. It was incredible interference and manipulation of the right to vote and the right to be heard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. And so, therefore, the question you would ask is could this happen again, in other words it's not just old news. A few seconds left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, it was a template that's very dangerous and very disturbing which is why we need to denounce it now."
