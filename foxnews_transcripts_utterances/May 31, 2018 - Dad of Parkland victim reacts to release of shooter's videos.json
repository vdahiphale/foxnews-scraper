My exclusive interview with Conservative film maker Dinesh D'Souza. His first comments after the President announced his full pardon. And in tonight's Angle I will examine what that pardon says about the left's purely political prosecutions. Plus the media leaks a disgraced FBI official's claim that the President obstructed justice by firing Comey. The President is firing back. Also the prosecutor's release chilling videos by the Florida school shooting suspect Nicholas Cruz, raising questions, why now and what good does it do? And house majority leader Kevin McCarthy is here to react to Google's description of the GOP's ideology, you will not believe what Google is saying. But first, fir the left it's suddenly open season on women Trump's family. What a series of vile and vulgar attacks the Trump women have endured in the last 24 hours alone.

She apologized today on Twitter for the insanity saying, \"I crossed a line and I deeply regret it\". But she did not apologize for the sexually suggestive remark. Her network TBS also apologized but did not indicate whether Bee or her show would suffer any consequences. In fact TBS is gloating that Bee is getting a big Hollywood award tonight from the group that hands out the Emmy's but guess what, they've closed the event tonight to the press. We'll talk about that later. The network wrote that on May 31st, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee will be recognized social change by the television academy. Social change? Is that what Hollywood called lewd and obscene character assassination? Nice. And the lefties are not happy about Bee's apology. Look at the reaction from Oscar winner Sally Field who tweeted, \"I like Samantha Bee a lot but she is flat wrong to call Ivanka a c-word. C-words are powerful, beautiful, nurturing and honest\". Stay classy Sally. And Ivanka is not the only Trump woman under attack. Let's discuss with Fox News Contributor Rachel Campos- Duffy, author and Hill columnist Kristin Tate, and Erica Thomas, member of the Georgia State Legislature. Let's go to you first Ms Campos-Duffy and ask you about how we've gotten to this place where a comedian would say something like that about the first daughter after she posts a picture of herself and her son.

I don't think they care about racism or sexism because if they did they wouldn't say those things or they would come out en masse and be outraged by it, instead they are celebrating Samantha Lee. Racism and sexism are tools for power and politics for them. They want to use it as a hammer to get us to agree or acquiesce to their political aims.

So I will view all of this in that same context. Here's the thing about the word \"Russia.\" We have gotten to the point where people are no longer being precise, everything is so vague. The word \"Russia\" to a Democrat equals automatic guilt for Donald Trump, automatic collusion, and now potentially automatic obstruction. The word \"Russia\" can also mean that President Trump was frustrated with James Comey because James Comey would never say in public what he said in private, that Trump is not under investigation in the Russia investigation. And I think that is a very understandable sentiment for the president to have. If you are innocent and you're told you are not under investigation and you are a public figure, of course you want that out.

My exclusive interview with Conservative film maker Dinesh D'Souza. His first comments after the President announced his full pardon. And in tonight's Angle I will examine what that pardon says about the left's purely political prosecutions. Plus the media leaks a disgraced FBI official's claim that the President obstructed justice by firing Comey. The President is firing back. Also the prosecutor's release chilling videos by the Florida school shooting suspect Nicholas Cruz, raising questions, why now and what good does it do? And house majority leader Kevin McCarthy is here to react to Google's description of the GOP's ideology, you will not believe what Google is saying. But first, fir the left it's suddenly open season on women Trump's family. What a series of vile and vulgar attacks the Trump women have endured in the last 24 hours alone. First up Samantha Bee's obscene assault on First Daughter Ivanka Trump on her TBS how last night."

She apologized today on Twitter for the insanity saying, \"I crossed a line and I deeply regret it\". But she did not apologize for the sexually suggestive remark. Her network TBS also apologized but did not indicate whether Bee or her show would suffer any consequences. In fact TBS is gloating that Bee is getting a big Hollywood award tonight from the group that hands out the Emmy's but guess what, they've closed the event tonight to the press. We'll talk about that later. The network wrote that on May 31st, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee will be recognized social change by the television academy. Social change? Is that what Hollywood called lewd and obscene character assassination? Nice. And the lefties are not happy about Bee's apology. Look at the reaction from Oscar winner Sally Field who tweeted, \"I like Samantha Bee a lot but she is flat wrong to call Ivanka a c-word. C-words are powerful, beautiful, nurturing and honest\". Stay classy Sally. And Ivanka is not the only Trump woman under attack. Let's discuss with Fox News Contributor Rachel Campos- Duffy, author and Hill columnist Kristin Tate, and Erica Thomas, member of the Georgia State Legislature. Let's go to you first Ms Campos-Duffy and ask you about how we've gotten to this place where a comedian would say something like that about the first daughter after she posts a picture of herself and her son.

But the hypocrisy I think Conservatives are finally getting sick and tired of. We know exactly what would have happened to Samantha Bee if she had said that about Sasha, Malia or Chelsea Clinton. And that's what's really I think getting the Conservatives fighting back and are calling it out for what it is. I think what it does is expose the left. I don't think they care about racism or sexism because if they did they wouldn't say those things or they would come out en masse and be outraged by it, instead they are celebrating Samantha Lee. Racism and sexism are tools for power and politics for them. They want to use it as a hammer to get us to agree or acquiesce to their political aims.

I wonder who wrote that Melania tweet the headline asks. This followed a series of digs like this one from CNN, \"Melania Trump hasn't appeared in public for 20 days\". And then there's this from the AP, \"Where's Melania? First Lady not seen in public for three weeks\".

If Samantha Bee had said that about Chelsea Clinton she would not be at a Hollywood event right now being celebrated, being acclaimed as a hero.

We can go through all the anti-religious things that she said, bigoted statements about people of faith that are so foul I don't even want to repeat.

He has made horrible comments about Conservative women, the hosts of the view I mean these men made so many comments I can't even count them. But here's another very important point. The media would point women to the Trump administration as shining examples for young girls if those women were not Conservatives. Look at Ivanka Trump, Melania Trump, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, these are strong, independent women.

And by the way, you will not want miss my exclusive interview with film maker Dinesh D'Souza, his very first comments since getting word of his pardoned by President Trump. Stay right there. Runaway prosecutors and politicised law enforcement. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. A lot of us grew up to have a romanticised view of federal prosecutors and law enforcement. They were all like Eliot Ness and the Untouchables. Truth, justice and the American way. It was about locking up bad guys and protecting the rest of us. And there are many dedicated men and women across the country serving as Assistant US Attorneys who are doing just that. But sadly we've also seen egregious examples in recent years of prosecutions of prominent figures that seem to have been politically motivated. Prosecutions that resulted in huge miscarriages of justice. One such case was that of Conservative film maker, author and old college friend Dinesh D'Souza who was pardoned today by President Trump for a conviction stemming from a $20,000 bundled campaign contribution to 2012 senate campaign of friend Wendy Long. Obama's US Attorney Preet Bhahara went for broke against D'Souza in a case that could have easily been disposed of in a fine and should have been. This is D'Souza whom I spoke with exclusively on radio today."

And I think Bhahara's ambition was to prove that by getting a fellow Indian he would endear himself to the Obama Team. It was a move of ambition as I understand it but would have to be filed into the `Karma is a --- department'. Preet Bhahara got fired by Trump and I got pardoned."

He called it a failed attempt at re-education. When Republican members of Congress who suspected political motivations push for the release of D'Souza's FBI files, the department balked. When they finally turned over the file, or at least made access to the file, they found out that his political affiliation and work critical of Obama had indeed been referenced. From the FBI reports seen by a Republican member of Congress, it said the following, \"D'Souza is likely an ultra- conservative right wing author and creator of a documentary critical of the Obama administration. Because of D'Souza's purported political beliefs it is likely that D'Souza orchestrated the excess contribution\". The agent's name who wrote this contribution was redacted.

It's all so incestuous. Now Fitzgerald is a wealthy partner at my old Law Firm Scadden Arps and is representing whom? Jim Comey in his dealings with special counsel Bob Mueller. That brings us to today where many of these same figures who have celebrated by media elites are back at work using their position and their pedigree in an ongoing effort to purge the country of President Donald J. Trump. What started as concerns about Russian collusion had morphed into an ever changing obstruction of justice narrative, all because Trump fired someone who he was constitutionally permitted to fire for any reason. In federal investigations, the government has limitless budgets, subpoena power and an army of prosecutors on its side, let's not forget. So targets should not be chosen or eliminated on the basis of their political views. Nor because they are considered big fish whose prosecutions could pay big time and big career dividends down the road. This is neither just nor enforcement of the law.

The idea that pardoning Martha Stewart would send a message. Martha Stewart was, again, Jim Comey was the southern district of New York U.S. attorney at the time. She was a big fish get for Comey.

And it would absolutely be just for him to pardon her and others who have been unjustly which hunted for the purposes of their own careers. Nobody today can doubt that James Comey and also Patrick Fitzgerald, who was a two-timer there with the Scooter Libby situation as well, acted in their own self-interest and not in the interest of the country or certainly in the interest of justice. They should not be allowed to abuse their positions to do this, and I and other democratic and other Americans would applaud the president for righting those wrongs. And I hope he does that."

Trump tweeting \"I never fired Comey because of Russia. The corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true.\" The DOJ's inspector general report on the FBI and DOJ's handling of the Clinton email probe will be released imminently. So could that be why we are suddenly seeing these leaked stories, leaked stories favorable to Comey and McCabe? Let's put that to former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer and former Whitewater deputy independent counsel Sol Wisenberg. A lot to unpack, guys, but you get the sense that this is all swirling around the obstructionist issue, Sol, and the fact that the McCabe memo suddenly is out there. It seems like McCabe is getting ready for himself perhaps to be prosecuted. But why do you think that is out there now?"

But also keep in mind any story that is really sourced by McCabe or that has to do with a memo written by McCabe, you are not talking about a very credible source according to the latest I.G. report. So I wouldn't worry about it too much. The big thing to keep in mind is that the president has the constitutional authority to fire Comey as he had to fire McCabe. Absent something extra like paying hush money to somebody or lying to a government investigator it just simply is not obstruction. I would ask everybody who comments on the other networks and acts like it is obstruction to read the Arthur Andersen case where the Supreme Court in a nine to nothing vote talked about what was needed for something to be corrupt."

But this is what \"The New York Times\" reporter on this issue of McCabe and this memo, what they said. Let's watch. MATT APUZZO, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTER: McCabe goes into this meeting of the Justice Department. It's a crowded meeting, and Rosenstein is telling his version of the story, and he says, as a matter of fact the president originally asked me to mention Russia in the memo. But I didn't think that was a good idea and I didn't do that. So to McCabe, as we understand it, the memo was there to write down like, hey, this may not have actually been about Hillary Clinton. There may have been some Russia interests going on here."

And so any time there would be something bad looming, coming out in the press, the inspector general's report, for example, that's about to come out from the FBI, that's the time you go into overdrive to get your story out ahead of time to preempt the bad stories that you know are coming. So I will view all of this in that same context. Here's the thing about the word \"Russia.\" We have gotten to the point where people are no longer being precise, everything is so vague. The word \"Russia\" to a Democrat equals automatic guilt for Donald Trump, automatic collusion, and now potentially automatic obstruction. The word \"Russia\" can also mean that President Trump was frustrated with James Comey because James Comey would never say in public what he said in private, that Trump is not under investigation in the Russia investigation. And I think that is a very understandable sentiment for the president to have. If you are innocent and you're told you are not under investigation and you are a public figure, of course you want that out. It's not an unreasonable request to a subordinate, and Comey wouldn't do it. I think that's why Trump fired Comey."

But again, if you want to talk about obstruction, and I'm not talking about-- you can impeach somebody for anything. If you want to talk about obstruction as a matter of criminal law, I'd say let's say for the purposes of argument, let's assume the worst about President Trump. Let's assume that he was guilty of some underlying crime and that he fired Comey because he didn't want a Comey to get to the bottom of it. If that's all they have, that's not criminal obstruction of justice. I don't know of one Supreme Court case that would support that interpretation. There are a handful, as you know, and I mean just a handful of appellate courts cases over the last 20 or 30 years."

Prosecutors shouldn't have much difficulty making their case against him and these videos don't really provide any new information or answers. But do they raise some questions? Why release them? Media wanted them. Media were making all sorts of Freedom of Information Act requests. And let's get some answers from retired LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman and Andrew Pollack, whose 18-year-old daughter Meadow was killed in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February. And Andrew, you are on radio today and it was so moving. You've done so much already to bring sanity to this conversation about school safety and so forth, and our viewers -- our heart goes out to you, and thank you for being with us tonight.

But what bothered me was the fame aspect of it, how he knew he was going to be glorified in the news. And I think that is a big problem in this country with the media using their names and showing their pictures on the media throughout the country. So I think that we could learn a lot from this in this country and not really show their names or their faces in the media. I think it would make a difference."

The media at large request because of Florida law of discovery, once discovery is made they can ask pretty much anything that the defense attorney and the prosecutor have. So they do that, but they obviously showed no responsibility by releasing this because this information now in front of every juror in the country, not just Florida, is seeing something that makes a death penalty case very difficult for the prosecutors because now when you go into that courtroom, the jurors have all seen this. Not only does he show premeditation but he really kind of argues against a mental defect. He seems completely in control of his planning, completely in control of the motive, and this is his manifesto."

Now, I got wind of this, so I went to see are they pulling it from Wikipedia. And I went over to Wikipedia for the California Republicans, it did not say Nazism. And so it concerns me greatly, because this isn't the only situation. The bias that is happening here, if you searched on Instagram for Donald Trump Jr. this weekend, you know what it told you? They warned you that his site could cause you harm or even death. Then Amazon kicked off the alliance for defending freedom to give their charity program, Amazon Smile where if you are conservative and you're purchasing something there you could send some charity money to a nonprofit.
