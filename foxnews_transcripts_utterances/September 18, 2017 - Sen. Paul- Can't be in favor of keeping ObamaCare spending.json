      "sentences": "A judge's decision to acquit a former police officer who shot and killed a man is what set all of this off. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. And \"The Story\" begins with a live look tonight at St. Louis, now about an hour from sunset there. Last night, the peaceful protests did turn violent, when some of the protesters began assaulting police officers. Now, they arrested more than 80 people in St. Louis last night, all of this, of course, goes back to 2011 and the shooting death of Anthony Lamar-Smith by Officer Jason Stockley. Officer Stockley and his partner said that they saw Smith orchestrate a drug deal at a fast food parking lot. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Dashcam footage shows Stockley trying to corner Smith. Smith drives away, nearly hitting the officers. Stockley fires several shots to the car before a high-speed chase. You can you see all of it as it plays out here. So, Smith's car then finally slowed down. Stockley tells his partner to hit Smith and the SUV slams into Smith's car. Stockley then drew his gun and fired five shots into the car, killing Smith. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Officer Stockley says he only fired when Smith reached along the seat where a gun was later found. The prosecutors argued that Stockley had planted the gun, which was found to have Stockley's DNA, but not Smith's. In 2012, a U.S. attorney ruled there was not enough evidence to prosecute Stockley. Four years later, the St. Louis circuit attorney said she had new evidence and she charged Stockley with first-degree murder. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } After a bench trial, a judge found Stockley not guilty, and that is where we are now. Fox's Mike Tobin, live on the streets of St. Louis, where this has been percolating over the last several days, and now we are on night four. Hi, Mike.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Martha. And the work that's going on behind me right now is the preemptive boarding up of windows because another demonstration is coming and it is Del Mar Loop neighborhood. If you can look at the salt and smoke restaurant, they're over in the corner, you can see they've got most of the windows boarded up in advance of the demonstrations. Some of those were boarded up because on Saturday night, they were broken out by these demonstrators. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Demonstrators are supposed to be here in the next half-hour, and the trend thus far has been that you have a largely lawful demonstration, given the fact that they block traffic. It's largely lawful. Then, the people who organized the demonstration will declare that the march is over. Some young people will hang around. Now, these are the young people that law enforcement says are determined to either have a conflict with police or vandalize things. They went off and march in direction; tensions built for a period of time. And eventually, what we saw last night, we saw them start blocking the roads, and they knocked over planters, they broke up concrete in the planters and took smaller pieces and threw them through the window to the restaurants downtown St. Louis. They ran down the street, 120 businesses now that sustained some kind of destruction. We've got an updated number from police as far as the number of arrests that they made when the police came in force and swarmed in on these particular demonstrators. 123 people were picked up last night. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, as we go into the evening's demonstration, there is some optimism. Now, police were able to arrest so many of these vandals, that there won't be enough to come out on the street and start trouble. The other factor we're looking at tonight is thunderstorms are expected and when it rains, for these kids that want to just smoke pots and break things, it's just not as much fun.

I mean, it's easy to say, oh, we need less use of force in the community. But what we should be teaching is how citizens deal with police, because everyone is saying police should de-escalate, right? But no one's teaching people things like compliance. It's easy to say that police are just swarming the Black communities. But when you look at a city like Baltimore that has 96 square miles but there are 504 crimes per square mile, is it really racial profiling, or is it a crime? When I was in the Black communities, patrolling the Black communities, the projects of East Nashville, it definitely wasn't because I wanted to have issues with my fellow Black man, it's because that's where the crime was occurring, that's where police were getting called. And I've said this time and time again and I'll say it again on your program: crime brings police, not color.

They're telling me they're still trying to get a handle on what all of these means for Robert Mueller's investigation. One thing we know for sure tonight is that it's putting more pressure on Paul Manafort because this is pretty aggressive in terms of how Mueller's team is going after him. The other point, though, that I should mention is that someone close to the president just mentioned to me that they believe the second wiretap of Manafort that came after the election may be connected to the dossier that targeted President Trump that has been discredited, and that may be raising alarm bells inside the government in terms of how the court order was obtained to continue the wiretapping base on -- potentially a dossier that has been discredited. Very quickly, this is coming amid, you know, a very interesting leak today in the New York Times as well, before all of this about Manafort, about some tensions in the president's legal team. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Specifically, the New York Times is reporting that one of their reporters basically sat a few days ago right near two members of legal team. You see him right there. John Dowd and Ty Cobb, when they were having lunch in Washington at a steak house, and this reporter, basically, overheard them talking about concerns that Ty Cobb, specifically, had about the president's counsel inside the White House, Don McGahn. You see John Dowd there on the left. He's the outside attorney for the president legal team in this Russia probe. Ty Cobb on the right is also helping the president's legal team, but from inside the White House. And what was overheard allegedly by this New York Times reporter was Ty Cobb there on the right raising questions about the chief White House counsel, Don McGahn, and whether or not he was turning over enough documents to Robert Mueller. You see Don McGahn there on the left, Robert Mueller on the right. McGahn's position, basically, Martha, is that they have to be careful about turning over too much information to Mueller because that could have an impact on the institution of the presidency, of the executive branch, long- term, in terms of executive power. But what Ty Cobb and others are privately saying is they want to turn over as much e-mails and other documents to Robert Mueller as possible because they simply do not believe an obstruction of justice charge can be brought against this president. And so, Ty Cobb and others in the president's legal team, I'm told, believe that the sooner they can get this information to Robert Mueller, Paul Manafort, General Flynn, others may be facing legal jeopardy, but they simply don't think the president will face anything like that, so they want to turn over as much as possible, Martha.",

He looks at the soft ratings for awards shows, the movie business, the impact of political stance taken at ESPN, or during the national anthem, and he rights this, quote, movies, cable and broadcast television, and music, this tune out isn't entirely about cord cutting. This is something broader. Any attempts to divorce politics from the public's waning interest in entertainment cannot compel without addressing the ubiquity of liberal political messaging permeating the products artist produce. Of course, no one can tell them to compel an artist to sacrifice their values for commercial viability. Nor, however, can you force consumers to endure a scolding that they would rather avoid. I did it. I got it in. I'm almost out of time. Good to have you with us tonight. Food for thought, right? We'll see you back here at 7:00. Tucker Carlson up next.

And \"The Story\" begins with a live look tonight at St. Louis, now about an hour from sunset there. Last night, the peaceful protests did turn violent, when some of the protesters began assaulting police officers. Now, they arrested more than 80 people in St. Louis last night, all of this, of course, goes back to 2011 and the shooting death of Anthony Lamar-Smith by Officer Jason Stockley. Officer Stockley and his partner said that they saw Smith orchestrate a drug deal at a fast food parking lot. Dashcam footage shows Stockley trying to corner Smith. Smith drives away, nearly hitting the officers. Stockley fires several shots to the car before a high-speed chase. You can you see all of it as it plays out here. So, Smith's car then finally slowed down. Stockley tells his partner to hit Smith and the SUV slams into Smith's car. Stockley then drew his gun and fired five shots into the car, killing Smith. Officer Stockley says he only fired when Smith reached along the seat where a gun was later found. The prosecutors argued that Stockley had planted the gun, which was found to have Stockley's DNA, but not Smith's. In 2012, a U.S. attorney ruled there was not enough evidence to prosecute Stockley. Four years later, the St. Louis circuit attorney said she had new evidence and she charged Stockley with first-degree murder. After a bench trial, a judge found Stockley not guilty, and that is where we are now. Fox's Mike Tobin, live on the streets of St. Louis, where this has been percolating over the last several days, and now we are on night four. Hi, Mike."

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. And the work that's going on behind me right now is the preemptive boarding up of windows because another demonstration is coming and it is Del Mar Loop neighborhood. If you can look at the salt and smoke restaurant, they're over in the corner, you can see they've got most of the windows boarded up in advance of the demonstrations. Some of those were boarded up because on Saturday night, they were broken out by these demonstrators. Demonstrators are supposed to be here in the next half-hour, and the trend thus far has been that you have a largely lawful demonstration, given the fact that they block traffic. It's largely lawful. Then, the people who organized the demonstration will declare that the march is over. Some young people will hang around. Now, these are the young people that law enforcement says are determined to either have a conflict with police or vandalize things. They went off and march in direction; tensions built for a period of time. And eventually, what we saw last night, we saw them start blocking the roads, and they knocked over planters, they broke up concrete in the planters and took smaller pieces and threw them through the window to the restaurants downtown St. Louis. They ran down the street, 120 businesses now that sustained some kind of destruction. We've got an updated number from police as far as the number of arrests that they made when the police came in force and swarmed in on these particular demonstrators. 123 people were picked up last night. So, as we go into the evening's demonstration, there is some optimism. Now, police were able to arrest so many of these vandals, that there won't be enough to come out on the street and start trouble. The other factor we're looking at tonight is thunderstorms are expected and when it rains, for these kids that want to just smoke pots and break things, it's just not as much fun. Martha."

But on the basis of the evidence that was presented to him, he found that there was a defense of self-defense. Meaning the officer's perception that the guy in the car, Smith, was -- did have a gun and was going to use it, was a reasonable perception. There is a lot of countervailing evidence. But I can tell you from having tried cases, I can't second-guess this judge because I wasn't in the courtroom. In the courtroom, you have the feel for the evidence. You have as an experienced judge, as this judge is, a sixth sense as to whether or not you should believe a particular witness. This judge believed that the defendant, and the defense witnesses, and rejected the government's witnesses. This is the cop's own bosses, who are prosecuting him and the judge rejected their testimony."

Today, the Justice Department removed those monitors. So, as Donald Trump promised he would, whether he agrees with us or not, he's doing what he said he would do -- it's hands off local police. It's the federal government not telling local police how to maintain safety in the streets. It's police not being afraid of a monkey on their back from Washington, D.C., and being unleashed to do what they were charged to do, which is maintain safety. It's police not being afraid to go into the most dangerous neighborhoods for fear of what Washington, D.C. will say to criticize them."

When I think about what was happening over the Obama administration, I think the key component was: how do we build trust between communities, usually communities of color and law enforcement officials? You know, I think it is so important for us to break down the kind of silos that say: somehow, law enforcement isn't a part of the community. Obviously, they are. And the way you build trust so that you can have effective policing and get rid of bias and do things to eliminate excessive force is you work together. The program that the judge mentioned was completely voluntary. It was a just collaborative program."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But unfortunately, one of the outcomes that we saw from that, and Vincent, I want to weigh in on this is that some officers around the country felt afraid to go do their job. They're afraid that they're going to get in trouble. And what we're hearing from people who live in some of these inner cities is that they want the police to be able to -- to be there. They want them to be in their corner and they don't want them to feel like they're going to be unjustly targeted. Vincent Hill, what do you think about that?"

      "utterance": "Yes, Martha, you're absolutely right. And I couldn't agree more with the decision that was handed down by the A.G. I mean, at the end of the day, the initiative itself, I think, in theory had good points that it wanted to get across, but people began to use it as a witch hunt, finger pointing issue against police. I mean, it's easy to say, oh, we need less use of force in the community. But what we should be teaching is how citizens deal with police, because everyone is saying police should de-escalate, right? But no one's teaching people things like compliance. It's easy to say that police are just swarming the Black communities. But when you look at a city like Baltimore that has 96 square miles but there are 504 crimes per square mile, is it really racial profiling, or is it a crime? When I was in the Black communities, patrolling the Black communities, the projects of East Nashville, it definitely wasn't because I wanted to have issues with my fellow Black man, it's because that's where the crime was occurring, that's where police were getting called. And I've said this time and time again and I'll say it again on your program: crime brings police, not color. And until we start having these conversations, the real conversations, like crime reform, instead of everyone saying that police are the bad guy, we're going to always be in this situation we're in right now."

What we have found and the Department of Justice, working with local law enforcement, identified particularly in the community of St. Louis that there were excessive tactics that were happening that did not merit those behaviors, and additionally, did nothing but erode trust in those communities. The way you move forward together can't be let me isolate people based on what they look like or where they live.

He met with a number of key allies, such as Emmanuel Macron of France, on the left; and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, on the right. Those are some of the meetings that happened today. The big show is expected tomorrow morning. He will address the U.N. for the very first time as president in a speech that is expected to focus on a number of things, but including and most importantly, perhaps, North Korea and Iran. President Trump has long criticized the United Nations and earlier today, he and Ambassador Nikki Haley reiterated that the U.N. needs reforming. Watch."

But it meant that the other countries started stepping up in putting more than they should've been putting in. And I hope that he will have that kind of honesty because the U.N. needs it. They need to be shaken out of what has become almost a worthless organization. So, let him go and make that kind of Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall speech. Because we remember that Reagan's people around him said, don't say that Mr. President and they kept taping it out of the speech, he kept putting it back in -- one of the most important things ever said.

The U.N. has not been bold in speaking out against human rights violations, whether it's China or Saudis when it comes to women's rights. And this is an organization that, instead, has condemned Israel -- which is about the only bright spot of freedom and democracy between the African and Asian continents.

But the bigger question is whether he's going to be saying to the U.N., I respect this institution, I want it reformed or I want to tear it down, and we don't know yet exactly which direction he's going to take.

This keeps the Obamacare spending, keeps well over 90 percent of the spending and the taxes, and then what it does is it reshuffles the money and it takes it from Democrat states and gives it to Republican states. I think it's going to end up looking, once people look at this bill, like a petty partisan bill that doesn't really fix the problem. Because, really, what we're doing is or what they want to do is reshuffle the money, redistribute it from Republican to Democrats states, but basically keep all of the Obamacare money and taxes in place.

I'll give you an example: the national restaurant association, there are two million fast food restaurants, 15 million workers, many of them don't have insurance. Under my plan, which costs zero federal dollars, we would allow them to come together as a group and buy insurance altogether in one group, they will get the leverage to lower prices and be protected against preexisting conditions.

And new report from CNN claims that U.S. investigators wiretap former Trump campaign aide, Paul Manafort, under secret court orders before and after the election. The New York Times reporting the special prosecutor, Robert Muller, told Paul Manafort that he should prepare to be indicted. Chief national correspondent, Ed Henry, live in Washington with the breaking news on this. Ed, what do we know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Martha, good to see you. This is something that is surprising, I can tell you. Some people close to the president that I've spoken to who were not expecting these two leaks this evening. The first one that you mentioned about Paul Manafort in the New York Times suggesting that he and his legal team were tipped off by Robert Mueller's investigators, that he's likely to be indicted. In and of itself, that's not shocking to President Trump's legal team because they have believed for a long time that Paul Manafort was facing trouble. But when it's connected to this CNN report breaking tonight, as you mentioned, that Paul Manafort was wire tapped by the government before the election, and then after the election as well, this is catching some people close to the president off-guard. They're telling me they're still trying to get a handle on what all of these means for Robert Mueller's investigation. One thing we know for sure tonight is that it's putting more pressure on Paul Manafort because this is pretty aggressive in terms of how Mueller's team is going after him. The other point, though, that I should mention is that someone close to the president just mentioned to me that they believe the second wiretap of Manafort that came after the election may be connected to the dossier that targeted President Trump that has been discredited, and that may be raising alarm bells inside the government in terms of how the court order was obtained to continue the wiretapping base on -- potentially a dossier that has been discredited. Very quickly, this is coming amid, you know, a very interesting leak today in the New York Times as well, before all of this about Manafort, about some tensions in the president's legal team. Specifically, the New York Times is reporting that one of their reporters basically sat a few days ago right near two members of legal team. You see him right there. John Dowd and Ty Cobb, when they were having lunch in Washington at a steak house, and this reporter, basically, overheard them talking about concerns that Ty Cobb, specifically, had about the president's counsel inside the White House, Don McGahn. You see John Dowd there on the left. He's the outside attorney for the president legal team in this Russia probe. Ty Cobb on the right is also helping the president's legal team, but from inside the White House. And what was overheard allegedly by this New York Times reporter was Ty Cobb there on the right raising questions about the chief White House counsel, Don McGahn, and whether or not he was turning over enough documents to Robert Mueller. You see Don McGahn there on the left, Robert Mueller on the right. McGahn's position, basically, Martha, is that they have to be careful about turning over too much information to Mueller because that could have an impact on the institution of the presidency, of the executive branch, long- term, in terms of executive power. But what Ty Cobb and others are privately saying is they want to turn over as much e-mails and other documents to Robert Mueller as possible because they simply do not believe an obstruction of justice charge can be brought against this president. And so, Ty Cobb and others in the president's legal team, I'm told, believe that the sooner they can get this information to Robert Mueller, Paul Manafort, General Flynn, others may be facing legal jeopardy, but they simply don't think the president will face anything like that, so they want to turn over as much as possible, Martha."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTIE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a complicated issue. You know, I was a U.S. attorney for seven years, and so I've had these conversations with defense lawyers many times, but not one like this, where the defense lawyer is representing the president of the United States, and have to be concerned about what precedent they set for future White Houses. So I think, listen, I've always that this Russia collusion allegation was very, very dubious. And so I understand Ty's position, which is let everything go, because there's nothing there. But I think Don McGahn, remember, he's not the president's lawyer. He's the White House counsel. He represents the institution. Now, he wants to make sure that they're not doing anything that will hurt presidents in the future. So that's the balance. And there should be a good, vigorous debate, and ultimately they'll make the recommendation to the president."

The likelihood that this is going to hang over the administration throughout the course of the entire first term is very large, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTIE",
      "utterance": "Sure. Sure. I mean, listen, I said at the time, you know, I was very reluctant to see a special prosecutor appointed, because it becomes like a cottage industry. And they have to go and find something, even if what they initially looked into. Remember, Bill Clinton didn't meet Monica Lewinsky until 19 months after the special prosecutor was appointed, didn't meet her for 19 months afterwards that turned out to be all the works, so I think it's very reluctant. But let me just say this, Steve Bannon was also in the White House at the time that they gave the president all kinds of advice that turned out not to be that good, so I think we shouldn't be wasting too much time listening to Steve Bannon."

And she acted appalled. Remember, it's un-American what he's saying. But all of a sudden now it's not un- American what she's saying. I think what people have understood about Hillary Clinton is two things, hypocrisy is her specialty. And she's a sore loser. I mean, you know, she's a sore loser. You lost. You clearly lost by a clear number in the Electoral College. Let this investigation do whatever it's going to do, but no one has alleged that it changed the course of the election."

But I think, you know, folks like Congresswoman Pelosi have stoked this kind conduct, and now the conduct is coming back on to them. And they don't like it too much. They would love it when that stuff is happening to President Trump. But they don't like it when it's happening to them. I don't think it's acceptable for anybody. I think if you're public official, you have the right to go out there and speak your mind. People can protest, but they have to sit and listen. I think the biggest problem in politics right now, Martha, is no one is listening to each other. You know, we're supposed to have a civil society. That's not civility. And the folks are yelling and screaming like that. Putting aside whether you agree with them or you don't, that's not the way we should conduct ourselves in public life."

Just because you operate in our state and you're good corporate citizen, generally, if you did something wrong, then you need to be held to account for it. I've believe it as a prosecutor and I believe it as governor. Right now, our attorney general is handling that. And I've great confidence in him. And I think he'll do a good job and make sure justice is done. But we've also have to look at the physicians, Martha, because the physicians are the ones writing these prescriptions over and over and over again. You know, in 2015, we wrote enough opioid prescriptions in this country for every adult in America to have a 30 day bottle of pills."

      "speaker": "CHRISTIE",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, two things. No party, neither, the Democrats or the Republicans have gotten three terms in a row in the governorship in New Jersey in 55 years. So it would be pretty typical that our state does not go for either party."

Is she didn't win it would be pretty typical with what history has been in our state. If she does win, it would show just how popular we've been because we're breaking 55 years of history. So I have confidence in lieutenant governor. I've endorsed her. I'm working for her, and I hope she's victorious in November. It is absolutely wrong to say that if what happens for the last 55 years happens again now, that somehow that's a reflection on us or our administration. In fact, we have a state that's got 850,000 more Democratic than Republicans. We have not elected a Republican to the United State senate since 1972, the longest streak in America. This is a very blue state as you know, Martha. And the fact is -- the fact that we won 61 percent of the vote in 2013 is miraculous. And we're hoping that we're going to be able to repeat with a victory in November. But if we're not, it will be typical New Jersey history for the last 55 years."

I knew a had a good chance to win in 2012, but I knew I wasn't ready. And I think the right thing to do for your country is not worry about -- yourself, but doing what you think is right based upon what you know at the time.

But Hurricane Maria is the other one, and it is now a massive and extremely dangerous category four storm. And it's on track now to tear through the Caribbean over the next 48 hours. This storm has been strengthening in intensity throughout the course of the day. I mean, you know, you can just hit replay on this with a different name. It's unbelievable what has been coming down the pike for the last three weeks and the untold story about this. We've covered Texas and we've covered Florida, obviously, a great deal. But these islands and the people who live on them have had their lives devastated in many cases. And now this one seems to be heading towards Puerto Rico, which has already been hit, so we're going to be watching that very closely. You've got a state of emergency that has been declared as a result of that. We're going to stay on top of Maria. And we'll watch as it goes through the next 48 hours, very, very important with regard to those islands. So we'll be watching that very closely. So for years Americans have had a fascination and a growing obsession, we can all admit with our smart phones. Along the way they have taken over our lives in many ways, you know they have. Companies like Google and Facebook and Amazon robbing us of our individuality. Are they telling us what to think politically and are they helping us choose our circle of friends? It is scary. But can you honestly say that you haven't lost some of your independence to these organizations? Here now, Franklin Foer, who came up with all of those ideas in many ways. He's the author of a new book, World without Mind, the existential threat of big tech. Franklin, a lot of us have been reading this and we are fascinated by it. We had a quote of the night from you the other night. So you say we spent too long marveling at new technologies and it's time to consider the consequences."

It's incredible that you can download every television show that you want, when you want it, and our lives are better because of this. But we need to just get past the magic a little bit. But we need to be skeptical and consider the dark side. These technologies can be amazing, but they can also be problematic. And we should be able in our minds to be able to accommodate both of these thoughts simultaneously. But the dark sides are real. And the consequences are such that our privacy is diminishing, which I think we all kind of grasp, right? They know everything about us. They've amassed these incredibly intimate portraits of our psyches. They know all of our habits and they can predict things as a consequence of that. And so, they've engineered their product to be addictive. The addiction is not an accident. The fact that you spend -- you check your phone 200 times a day, which is not."

      "utterance": "Right. Well, there are a couple of differences. One is that these guys want to be completely intertwined into our lives. It's not just sitting in front of a TV. Instead, they want to become our personal assistants. They're giving us technologies that we wear on our arms that are extensions of our bodies. We've all become a little bit cyborg. And eventually these things are going to be implanted within us. I mean, that doesn't seem like a stretch to say. The second thing is this data. And you're tracked all the time. They know what you read. They know where you go. And this is not just something that they -- they take this information and they use it to shape your behavior. We're all in a way guinea pigs in this experiment."

I want my phone to be able -- I want to be able to hit Google maps in a second and I want them to know where I am, so that they can tell me where I'm going. We have sort of done this kind of scary transaction."

    {
      "speaker": "FOER",
      "utterance": "Of course. I mean, some of it is -- that we just -- it's kind of bureaucratic. And so, we see a terms of service agreement and we just click because we want the free goodies on the other side. And that's kind of -- that's a little bit on us and a little bit on them. But I think that the problem really is that we just don't know what we're getting into. And so, as a Society, I think it's important to say, all right, let's just apply some skepticism to these forces and ask really certain questions."

      "utterance": "Well, I mean, do they have a political bent? I mean, they're basically giving everybody what they want. I mean, we talk about the filter bubble all the time. And if you look at Facebook, if our politics in this country is extremely polarized, let's say we have two tribes, Facebook has done a lot to nurture that, that they give you what you want. But the difference is, so if I watch Fox News I'm getting -- not me, especially, but there are a lot of people who are getting what they want by watching Fox News, and they're making a choice to do that."

So just in from our National Hurricane Center moments ago, hurricane hunter aircraft has just updated this one to a category 5 while we were talking. So there are the measurements on it. The Caribbean Islands, again, in the path of this massive storm. It is a story, obviously, we're going to stay on top throughout the evening. We'll be right back. Oh, also, a final note tonight, our quote of the night is from writer Noah Rothman in a piece called the great tune out. He looks at the soft ratings for awards shows, the movie business, the impact of political stance taken at ESPN, or during the national anthem, and he rights this, quote, movies, cable and broadcast television, and music, this tune out isn't entirely about cord cutting. This is something broader. Any attempts to divorce politics from the public's waning interest in entertainment cannot compel without addressing the ubiquity of liberal political messaging permeating the products artist produce. Of course, no one can tell them to compel an artist to sacrifice their values for commercial viability. Nor, however, can you force consumers to endure a scolding that they would rather avoid. I did it. I got it in. I'm almost out of time. Good to have you with us tonight. Food for thought, right? We'll see you back here at 7:00. Tucker Carlson up next.
