I mean, if you think about it, you know, here you have Putin is grooming a Russian spy, first to join the American military, right? And then after that Russian spy is in the military, then you run for Congress, OK, in Hawaii. And then you decide to run for president as a Democrat only to leave and then go independent in order to ensure that Donald Trump is president. The Russians must have been genius to predict that Trump would be president in 2020 to pull this off. She is so delusional, it's comical.",

Hillary Clinton is taking Russia hysteria to a new extreme as she continues the blame game for her 2016 loss against Trump. She's now speculating that the Kremlin is grooming one of the 2020 Democratic women as a spoiler third party candidate. Listen to this."

They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. And that's assuming Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because she's also a Russian asset. Yeah, she's a Russian asset. I mean, totally. And so, they know they can't win without a third party candidate."

Thank you, Hillary Clinton, you, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why? Now we know. It was always you. Through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose, it's now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly. Greg, this is exactly what you wanted to have happen on a Friday."

She's different than everybody up there. She sounds like, in many ways, a traditional liberal. She's not a hard leftist. She's not into identity politics. She thinks her own way and that bothers her. But, when you read this, you said they were obviously talking about Tulsi Gabbard. The reason why -- this is the other thing I didn't like about it that Hillary didn't mention her. But it was obvious it was Tulsi because CNN, they had a talking bot on CNN, saying she was a Russian asset and also the New York Times. So you could see that she was merely saying and echoing what you hear in the media. So, again, they're working from the same script. But maybe, Hillary is right. I mean, if you think about it, you know, here you have Putin is grooming a Russian spy, first to join the American military, right? And then after that Russian spy is in the military, then you run for Congress, OK, in Hawaii. And then you decide to run for president as a Democrat only to leave and then go independent in order to ensure that Donald Trump is president. The Russians must have been genius to predict that Trump would be president in 2020 to pull this off. She is so delusional, it's comical."

They truly believe that. So now, Jill Stein is not on the scene anymore. Tulsi Gabbard has been having these accusations about her for a long time. And, like, to us it sounds like crazy town conspiratorial. Believe me, there are a lot of people who actually believe this. Tulsi Gabbard will have a press conference at 6:30 tonight where she will be able to be like, OK, great, thank you, Hillary Clinton, for now making me the actual star of the week. I don't think the primary is not between her and Hillary by any means.

She says, well, no. I assumed Hillary was going to win. You know what? I voted for Jill Stein. I said are you crazy? In North Carolina? North Carolina was won by Trump by I think 3 percentage points.

Misogyny, and Jim Comey, and the FBI, the bankruptcy, et cetera. And for all of her complaints about what she calls those things to be an intervening event, why is she then doing that now to Tulsi? And I think it's because, fundamentally, that, yes, she has a disdain for her because she's different. And we heard it on the Project Veritas' tapes from CNN who said they don't like her because she's unconventional. That's the point. There's an absolute intolerance from the left and, especially, from Hillary for anyone that thinks differently from her and, obviously, that's the reason why fundamentally she didn't connect with anyone and lost the election. Final point, for the former secretary of state to be throwing around the term asset, knowing full well what it means, is so reprehensible, to me. And I hope that CNN airs Tulsi's response at 6:30."

And that's why the Democrats have decided Mitch McConnell is public enemy number one because he's not able to get their agenda done. They had a choice. They didn't have to do impeachment. And Nancy Pelosi held off for a long time so that she would be able to protect her members that became unsustainable. So, no, I don't think -- you can pass a ton of bills in the House.

That way they can go back to them over and over again. Get out the vote. Make sure that those people's neighbors are getting out to vote. The energy is incredible. I think the Democrats are still -- they're having a debate about impeachment and they're also exceedingly worried about electability. If you're still talking on electability they don't have anybody that is like ginning up any enthusiasm.

And what they do is they cover an event where both face names, you know, tell speeches written by other people. That was the news. The news was Mattis roasting Trump at an event where people roast each other. That, to them, was more preferable than seeing what's happening on the ground in Dallas where America's cab driver, Donald Trump, is speaking their language and saying what everybody, the majority of Americans have felt about the Middle East forever. That there are different groups of people killing each other, and maybe it's time we move away and let them settle it themselves. By the way, Trump isn't a politician. He's a drug, and he gives people different experiences. So his supporters get a dopamine rush when they're there because they know what he's doing. He speaks to them directly. Meanwhile, the never-Trumpers, they also get a dopamine rush from what he says and what he does. Oh, my word, he says this. Oh, I can't believe it. They're getting high on the hate of him. But the bottom line is, he's closer to the ground than any of the Democratic politicians. That drives Joe Scarborough and the people like him nuts who now have to resort to calling everybody stupid, which is what Scarborough does when he talks about the rallies. He said these people are just stupid. And it's like, no, you just can't understand what's going on in America. You're stupid."

In fact, a lot of conservative media does quite well on social media. Not just Facebook, but with the others as well. But, look, I mean, California is an overwhelmingly left leaning place.

He said the services are -- you know, there's no data supporting the conservative bias. But that's parsing language, right? We knew that in a Lincoln Tower survey, 90 percent of his employees said that if they were conservative they were unsafe at work or felt unsafe at work to talk about it. That's why Facebook conducted that internal audit, right? We had 100 Facebook employees report that they would be attacked by their colleagues. And I just, you know, just conceptually talking about this, I can't help but think that it gets baked into the software, because the whole point is that the data is difficult to qualify, obviously."

And I agree that a lot of conservative people do have success online. But when it comes to banning or shadow banning a Dave Rubin, Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager, the list goes on and on. Diamond and silk our favorite ladies. You know, you wind up, you turn your computer on, and the next thing you know you get one view on a video when you had 55,000 the last couple of weeks.

It was the first all-female spacewalk. It's been 54 years since humans first walked in space. This comes a few months after NASA canceled an all-female spacewalk because they didn't have enough suits that fit women. Now, women have been out on spacewalks before. Keep that in mind. But only with male colleagues. So, this was a first. The two Americans, Christina Koch, Jessica Meir are the 14th and 15th women ever to walk in space. All but one of the others are retired. And as you can see from these pictures, they're at there, having a ball. Americans just want to have fun."

It's just around $100 for four people at night and they are doing it like to the end degree, decorated in true fashion bases of just rose stem, you rang Bell. How awesome is that, by the way? I thought it was real. Just a pop up. But it's the next best thing. And also, I couldn't find my Halloween picture of me and like, age 10 or 11 when I was (inaudible). Drop the mic."
