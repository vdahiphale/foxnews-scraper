You wrote a book about a decade ago that I read about a decade ago. And in doing this program, I started to think about it, and I said, \"I think it's important that we have this discussion about science, evolution, progressivism,\" and I want to start where you started. Let me read you one paragraph, \"I'm a secular Jew,\" you write. \"My religious education did not take. I can barely remember a word of Hebrew, I cannot pray. I've spent more years than I care to remember in studying Mathematics and writing about the Sciences.\" Yet, as you wrote in the preface of this book, the book that follows is in some sense a defense of religious thought and sentiment.\" \"Biblical verses are the least of it. A defense is needed because none has been forthcoming. The discussion has been ceded to men who regard religious belief with frivolous contempt. The books have poured from every press and although differing widely in their style, they are identical in their message because scientific theories are true, religious beliefs must be false.\" From your book \"The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and Scientific Pretensions.\" And that is the thesis -- that is the foundational point of your book.

In the 1950s and the 60s, the position that was academically tolerated. It was a kind of cheerful agnosticism with respect to religious tradition of mankind. It could be with respect to God's existence, maybe, maybe not, but this isn't an issue that vexes us profoundly as members of the scientific community. That all changed. Now, we are kind of very, very vociferous and dogmatic. Atheism has become obligatory in the scientific community. There are exceptions. There are always going to be exceptions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For all I know, some distinguished physicist may be plotting jihad, I have no idea.

It is relatively new, I think it started around 1980-1985, but become an accelerating force in intellectual life. If you are minded to be a serious Christian or extremely devout and orthodox Jew, or even a serious Muslim, better not go into the scientific community and tell your fraternity brothers that that is what you are, best to keep your mouth closed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I think that's generally true.

I don't mean some preexisting stuff. I mean nothing. Well, that's not the world we live in. How come? It's a good question. What's your answer? And when you actually look at the physicists or the biologist or the chemist, their answer is, we know how it happened. We open our eyes, too. There's something, and we can explain the origin of all that by appealing to some preexisting something. Are you satisfied with that? If not, well, you're not scientifically literate.

What is the origin of individual species? How did life emerge from inorganic matter? And what are the dynamic laws that change one species into another, if there is such a thing as a change of species?

Over vast periods of time, these small variations accumulate. They converge on a different structure and various different structures in turn converge on a new body, plant, a new organism, a new species, a new entry in the vast pharmacopeia of life.

Not the Darwinian rhetoric, but it's just the evidence of your own eyes. One is that all life is related. There's no question about that. Biochemistry is the same throughout life. All life has very, very many of its properties in common. There's one living system on the face of the planet. Not a multitude of species, one living system. That's the first thing you'd notice. The second thing you'd notice, if you are honest is that there is a vast inseparable distinction between two kinds of living systems -- human beings and all the rest. That is something that's rarely noticed, rarely emphasized. The distance between a human being and our nearest chimpanzee-like ancestors, common ancestors is much, much, much greater than the difference between a chimpanzee and a flower.

That's the first step towards some sort of system of reconciliation because it prompts the inevitable question. \"Hey, how come? Why are human beings so different? Why do they organize themselves differently? Why do they have mathematics, literature? Why do they speak to one another? Why do they have creative thoughts? A chimpanzee is probably a lovable animal, but nobody ever asked the chimpanzee a question that was possible for the chimpanzee to answer.

You received your PhD in Philosophy from Princeton University, later a Post Doctoral Fellow in Mathematics and Molecular Biology at Columbia University. I am glad I didn't take any of those courses. Senior Fellow in the Discovery Institute Center for Science and Culture. You've you taught Philosophy, Mathematics, English at Stanford, Rutgers, City University of New York and in Paris and you're now the editor of \"Inference: International Review of Science.\" Let's get started. You wrote a book about a decade ago that I read about a decade ago. And in doing this program, I started to think about it, and I said, \"I think it's important that we have this discussion about science, evolution, progressivism,\" and I want to start where you started. Let me read you one paragraph, \"I'm a secular Jew,\" you write. \"My religious education did not take. I can barely remember a word of Hebrew, I cannot pray. I've spent more years than I care to remember in studying Mathematics and writing about the Sciences.\" Yet, as you wrote in the preface of this book, the book that follows is in some sense a defense of religious thought and sentiment.\" \"Biblical verses are the least of it. A defense is needed because none has been forthcoming. The discussion has been ceded to men who regard religious belief with frivolous contempt. The books have poured from every press and although differing widely in their style, they are identical in their message because scientific theories are true, religious beliefs must be false.\" From your book \"The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and Scientific Pretensions.\" And that is the thesis -- that is the foundational point of your book. Can you can expand on that?"

In the 1950s and the 60s, the position that was academically tolerated. It was a kind of cheerful agnosticism with respect to religious tradition of mankind. It could be with respect to God's existence, maybe, maybe not, but this isn't an issue that vexes us profoundly as members of the scientific community. That all changed. Now, we are kind of very, very vociferous and dogmatic. Atheism has become obligatory in the scientific community. There are exceptions. There are always going to be exceptions. For all I know, some distinguished physicist may be plotting jihad, I have no idea. But by and large, atheism has replaced any kind of tolerant and forbearing agnosticism as the de facto standard in Anglo-American scientific intellectual life. And as a result, the religious tradition that is a very, very long 5,000- year-old tradition has been made into an object of faint derision among sophisticated men and women much to the consternation of people who deeply, deeply admire that tradition, and that, I think, is a change in the diapason of life that we need to pay attention to. It is relatively new, I think it started around 1980-1985, but become an accelerating force in intellectual life. If you are minded to be a serious Christian or extremely devout and orthodox Jew, or even a serious Muslim, better not go into the scientific community and tell your fraternity brothers that that is what you are, best to keep your mouth closed. And I think that's generally true. It's among the various topics about which it is not a particularly good idea to make broadcast your views."

There's something, and we can explain the origin of all that by appealing to some preexisting something. Are you satisfied with that? If not, well, you're not scientifically literate.

In 1859, he published what is arguably his masterpiece, \"The Origin of Species\" and the question that Darwin asked himself is a question that all of the 19th century biologists were asking, what is the nature of life? What is the origin of individual species? How did life emerge from inorganic matter? And what are the dynamic laws that change one species into another, if there is such a thing as a change of species? Don't forget Alchemy promoted a very similar thesis when it said base metals could be transmuted into gold. It was an argument for transmutation of elements. Darwin provided an alchemical explanation for biology. Species could be transformed into other species. Well, how can this come about? We don't see it every day. It comes about because there are small variations within each species and these variations are seized upon by the mechanism of natural selection which simply means some survive, some don't survive. Over vast periods of time, these small variations accumulate. They converge on a different structure and various different structures in turn converge on a new body, plant, a new organism, a new species, a new entry in the vast pharmacopeia of life. That's Darwinism and it's a position which is being increasingly held as a secular doctrine. Comparable -- comparable to the Book of Genesis."

Well, he wanted to reach the trees on the top. Well how come other animals didn't develop the long neck? Well, they didn't want to reach the trees on the top. How come certain kinds of European eels have to swim across the Atlantic in order to mate? Other kinds of eels are perfectly happy fornicating close to home. Well, it worked for one eel, it didn't work for the other. Why aren't women born with tails like cats? Well, women don't seem to need the tails, even though it would make them even more alluring than they are.

You come to the Earth and you listen to a long lecture about Darwin, the immense importance of Darwinian biology, but then, you open your own eyes, say you're from Mars, you open your eyes. What are the two things that would most strike you about living systems on the face of the Earth? Not the Darwinian rhetoric, but it's just the evidence of your own eyes. One is that all life is related. There's no question about that. Biochemistry is the same throughout life. All life has very, very many of its properties in common. There's one living system on the face of the planet. Not a multitude of species, one living system. That's the first thing you'd notice. The second thing you'd notice, if you are honest is that there is a vast inseparable distinction between two kinds of living systems -- human beings and all the rest. That is something that's rarely noticed, rarely emphasized. The distance between a human being and our nearest chimpanzee-like ancestors, common ancestors is much, much, much greater than the difference between a chimpanzee and a flower. We're talking about a bifurcation in the manifold of Biology. Human beings on one side, the rest of the animal kingdom or the plant kingdom on the other. These are facts that I think that any untroubled observer, and by untroubled, I mean someone who is not previously adhered to any kind of ideology such as Darwinism. Would it once recognize life is connected? It's in some sense one living system, but profoundly divided between human beings and all the rest. That's the first step towards some sort of system of reconciliation because it prompts the inevitable question. \"Hey, how come? Why are human beings so different? Why do they organize themselves differently? Why do they have mathematics, literature? Why do they speak to one another? Why do they have creative thoughts? A chimpanzee is probably a lovable animal, but nobody ever asked the chimpanzee a question that was possible for the chimpanzee to answer. So, these are I would say, orthogonal to the main axis of ideology."

But, of course, it's like everything else, it's changing. It's undergoing change because of the intense intellectual pressure that's being brought on any scientific theory dealing with these profound questions. For example, we know perfectly well that questions about the origins of life from the standpoint of 2018 are hopeless. We do not understand how life emerged from whatever muck it did emerge. We are simply unable to make a coherent chemical account. Jim Tour, a very good synthetic chemist at Rice University has written about this, for \"Inference,\" the journal that I am editing. And he says, it's time to call for a moratorium in our origins of life research. It's not going anywhere. That's one thing. And then as inevitably happens, Darwinian biologists by calling attention to themselves so very flamboyantly have called in to question the very structure of the theories they're defending, because the physicists have said, \"Hey, you know, that's interesting, the kind of claims you guys are making, it's all nonsense, but we physicists can handle it a lot better.\" So, you get somebody, for example, I think his first name is Donald Fisher at Stanford. A topnotch physicist and I have seen a preprint of his, and he said, \"Well, you know, Darwin has a very, very interesting theory, but it has no quantitative properties. It's not like a theory in Physics,\" and there is a kind of collective heart attack among the Darwinian biologists, not like Physics, not like gravity, say it isn't so, but it isn't so.

And of course, for somebody like me, it's just a joy to watch."

      "utterance": "Well, to the extent that Marx offers a substitute for religion, you would not expect the dogmatic or an orthodox communist to say, \"Yes, the scientific system of society is what Marx has given us as a tool of analysis, but it all is contingent upon the whims of the deity.\" That doesn't fit very well with communism or with Marxism. It seems an irrelevant postulate. But there are plenty of rotten guys on the conservative side, for example, the Nazis, you don't think of the Nazis in terms of radical atheism..."

    {
      "speaker": "BERLINSKI",
      "utterance": "They were pretty lousy. They were pretty lousy. But so what? I mean, with respect to the Nazis, even if the SS executioners took communion after murdering a lot of elderly Jewish men, who cares?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "When we come back, what I am trying to expose, I think, and you may disagree is that Hegel, Marx, Russo, this whole collective philosophy with their differences and so forth, they have to reject religion. They have to reject traditions. They have to reject customs or their philosophies don't make any sense. We'll discuss that more broadly when we return. So, Dr. Berlinski, we have these various philosophers, ideologues, their progeny, various intellectuals in the turn of the last century pushing this agenda of human sciences they call them, behavioral sciences, political sciences, and they're built on this notion of science, and yet they also embrace, you were saying, you know, Russo, Hegel, Marx, this sort of thing, who really do insist that basically have to destroy the existing society in order to get to the promise land for a variety of reasons, materialism or whatever it is."

The modern incarnation of this, of this attitude of this belief system, the progressives, the so-called democratic socialists, isn't this where they're dragging countries or maybe not dragging them, where people want to go in these various countries in Europe and the United States?"

    },

      "speaker": "BERLINSKI",
      "utterance": "Yes, but that's not really my problem. And there, you've touched on a crucial point. These usufructs destroy the bonds of solidarity, don't they? You cannot endlessly profit from a state subsidized system and spend a lot of time worrying about your obligations to other people in the same situation. You can spend a lot of time talking about your obligations, but worrying about them, that's quite different."

      "utterance": "But isn't that the point, when you are unmoored from these principles, when you're unmoored from values, belief systems or faith, where everyone believes they come from. That's what it comes down to. I got what I want. He didn't get it, that's his problem. Aren't societies developing more and more in that direction, unfortunately?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERLINSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, secular societies tend to atomize very frequently. They dissolve into individual constituents and the social sciences that used to be called methodological individualism. That unit of analysis is always the individual, but the unit of agency is also the individual, and I think that is a feature of a secular society and seems to be a feature of secular society that is deeply desired by the inhabitants of the secular society. One thing we have to understand and accept however reluctantly is something like the second law of thermodynamics works in the social science."

      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "There has got to be another law."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERLINSKI",
      "utterance": "As far as I know, that is it. Things go from bad to worse. Look at us. It goes in one direction, we were young ones and getting old now, right? I am only speaking the truth. Speak truths to power. The second law of thermodynamics embodies the most ancient part of human wisdom -- things go from bad to worse."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERLINSKI",
      "utterance": "No, but new societies from. After all, every human birth is an achievement in violating the second law of thermodynamics, isn't it? Every time a flower buds, we have a violation. So, it's not all bad. Societies do change very radically and they generally change in one way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "The only problem is what takes place when they change? If it is a violent change then we have a problem on our hands. I want to thank you. I could have done this for five hours with you. It's been a great pleasure."
