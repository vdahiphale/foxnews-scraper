Police say the suspect used a pump action shotgun to blast through a glass entrance before killing four journalists and a sales assistant. Earlier today, the states district attorney describing the scene inside the newsroom. It was chilling. Ramos has a long standing dispute with the Capital Gazette. It started back in 2011, now that's when a columnist published a column that talked about a criminal harassment case against Ramos. He later sued the columnist and the editor and publisher for defamation, but the case was dismissed. Now, the Capital says the former editor who is a defendant in the defamation suit said, quote, I remember telling our attorneys this is a guy who is going to come and shoot us.

They're an open borders party at this point. It's front and center. I think the second ranking Democrat in the house, Keith Ellison, wore a t- shirt that said I don't believe in borders. So, it is what it is. This is the Democratic Party now. And socialist Democrats are now taking action against ICE centers across the country. Michelle Malkin documented some of it. They rushed through the property on the west side, shut it down, and actually prevented illegals from getting a hearing in front of the judge.

I think they've just rescued 57 illegal immigrants, men, women and children on the border. They've been abandoned by the smuggler. And it was about 108 degrees. They rescued another pregnant illegal alien female crossing the Rio Grande. Saved her life. And they don't just do that apprehension at the border. I mean, they go after drug hitmen. They go after child smugglers, narcotics traffickers. On their ICE most wanted list, MS-13 members, criminal alien fugitives wanted for homicide. So, you know, politically, I think this is a real cancer in their caucus. It's going to hurt them. And it's going to backfire.

But I want to go back to what Hillary Clinton said about what is more uncivil than taking children away from parents? She then, of course, is putting the responsibility not on the parents who choose to separate their children from their families back in their home countries and taking them to this dangerous journey over the border. She's holding America responsible instead of the people who are actually doing it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the second thing I'm trying to figure out is following this logic to its end conclusion. Because if she does think that it is uncivil to take children away from parents, well, does that standard then apply to the way that we enforce laws across the country for American citizens? Because children are taken all the time from parents in America when their parents commit crimes and go to prison, when they are deemed unfit to be safe caretakers of their children. So logically, this argument either applies to illegal aliens and applies to everybody and would result in complete breakdown of a lawful society, because they're giving a free pass to parents who commit crimes, simply because they have children and don't want to separate them.

This is the most tragic accident. It's the most tragic assault on American journalism in recent history. Police say the suspect used a pump action shotgun to blast through a glass entrance before killing four journalists and a sales assistant. Earlier today, the states district attorney describing the scene inside the newsroom. It was chilling. Ramos has a long standing dispute with the Capital Gazette. It started back in 2011, now that's when a columnist published a column that talked about a criminal harassment case against Ramos. He later sued the columnist and the editor and publisher for defamation, but the case was dismissed. Now, the Capital says the former editor who is a defendant in the defamation suit said, quote, I remember telling our attorneys this is a guy who is going to come and shoot us. An employee at another business inside that same building describes the moment it all started. Take a listen."

But at least they're being honest about how they feel. I have to give them that. I mean, they don't want the wall. They don't want zero tolerance. They don't want ICE. They're an open borders party at this point. It's front and center. I think the second ranking Democrat in the house, Keith Ellison, wore a t- shirt that said I don't believe in borders. So, it is what it is. This is the Democratic Party now. And socialist Democrats are now taking action against ICE centers across the country. Michelle Malkin documented some of it. They rushed through the property on the west side, shut it down, and actually prevented illegals from getting a hearing in front of the judge. Now, the illegals have to be detained for an extra six weeks. So, it's just back firing. And it's just astounding because the ICE agents do so many good things. I think they've just rescued 57 illegal immigrants, men, women and children on the border. They've been abandoned by the smuggler. And it was about 108 degrees. They rescued another pregnant illegal alien female crossing the Rio Grande. Saved her life. And they don't just do that apprehension at the border. I mean, they go after drug hitmen. They go after child smugglers, narcotics traffickers. On their ICE most wanted list, MS-13 members, criminal alien fugitives wanted for homicide. So, you know, politically, I think this is a real cancer in their caucus. It's going to hurt them. And it's going to backfire. And it just reaffirms everything Donald Trump has been saying about securing the border, and we need law and order in this country."

Obviously, people want to be compassionate about children, about families. But is it fair to put the whole onus and the blame on ICE to demonize, and then to just sort of -- in sort of a knee-jerk reaction, without much thought or deliberation say to abolish it."

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Look, this far left mob that was organized by the extremist radical women's rights -- sorry, women's march yesterday that descended on the Senate Hart Building, they're not interested in protecting children. What they're interested in is abolishing ICE and declaring that entering this country illegally is not a crime. That is what they want. Linda Sarsour, yesterday, who has ties to Louis Farrakhan, by the way, who leads the women's march said when one woman is not free in this country, none of us are free in this country. That is about sovereignty. And if you get rid of ICE you're eliminating an extremely important tool that we have in this country to defend our sovereignty. When it comes to what ICE does, yes, immigration enforcement is important. The federal government has very few responsibilities. Immigration enforcement, border security is one of those responsibilities. They also deal with child exploitation, human trafficking, terrorism prevention. They're not just immigration outlet even though that is an extremely important part of what they do. And moving forward on this issue, if Democrats want to decide that this is something they're going to make mainstream as they have with Senator Gillibrand, Senator Elizabeth Warren jumping into this mob yesterday, then they need to own it because so far they've tried to say that this is far left thing. This is not the mainstream of the Democratic Party. It absolutely is. I think voters are going to take notice of that."

The reality is that ICE is just, I think, 15 years old. It was started, created, of course, after 9/11. And what you get is a situation where it's grown wildly beyond anybody's expectation. And now, not so much involved with what we intended, which was stopping international terrorists from entering the country and the like in the aftermath of 9/11. Now they're involved with things like forcibly separating children from parents, these kinds of raids that have scared people throughout the country. I thought conservatives were the ones who came up with a phrase jack booted thugs to describe government agencies going overboard, not respecting individual rights in this country. So, now you see people standing up and saying, hey, this isn't right. We just had the man who was the spokesman for ICE out in San Francisco resign, 17 years in the government, Kimberly."

And it's not advancing the ball if one side is saying only the other side is doing it. There are certainly people on both sides that are guilty of this. But you cannot, in good conscience, tell me that the left is not also doing it. So, I think it's about personal responsibility. It's how you individually conduct yourself. I think we can lead by example. We have civil discourse here. And people appreciate it. That's why we have different viewpoints. OK?

Because we know that the Democratic Party is all about engaging and profiting off of grievances and have for many, many decades. But I want to go back to what Hillary Clinton said about what is more uncivil than taking children away from parents? She then, of course, is putting the responsibility not on the parents who choose to separate their children from their families back in their home countries and taking them to this dangerous journey over the border. She's holding America responsible instead of the people who are actually doing it. And the second thing I'm trying to figure out is following this logic to its end conclusion. Because if she does think that it is uncivil to take children away from parents, well, does that standard then apply to the way that we enforce laws across the country for American citizens? Because children are taken all the time from parents in America when their parents commit crimes and go to prison, when they are deemed unfit to be safe caretakers of their children. So logically, this argument either applies to illegal aliens and applies to everybody and would result in complete breakdown of a lawful society, because they're giving a free pass to parents who commit crimes, simply because they have children and don't want to separate them. Due to their own actions and the consequences of their actions being there happens to be a separation due to them breaking the law."

And it shows deaf and blind Brazil supporters Carlos following the team's match against Costa Rica with the help of two friends. His sign language instructor and another friend use touch sign language and a model soccer field, which they guided his hand through to show him where the ball was and what was happening. So it's very cool. So after Brazil's thrilling win over Costa Rica, the friends celebrated by breaking out the drums. All right. I like it a lot."
