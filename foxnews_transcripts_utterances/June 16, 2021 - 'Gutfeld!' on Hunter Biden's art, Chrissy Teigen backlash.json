His new life as a full time painter. I can't blame him. No one can say he isn't qualified to paint what looks like hobo vomit. Now, they won't allow us to show the actual paintings. But trust me, it looks like hobo vomit. I live in New York. I know what hobo vomit looks like. It looks like Hunter Biden paintings. But I get the new occupation fully. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Paying a guy a fortune for a job he has no qualifications in is harder to explain than buying hobo vomit from a Chinese businessman. I don't think I'm going to say hobo vomit again. But rather than focus on that stuff, Artnet assesses him as a controversial figure who has been vilified by the right and uncomfortably ignored by the left which absolves him of any culpability. This is not about his crimes, the guns or drugs and strippers, the smears he made against others. No, Hunter just wants to talk about the art. And Jeffrey Dahmer really preferred questions about his poetry. It really could rhyme. Because as Artnet says it's art and for Biden, everything is connected. Except of course his laptop. But that is the word, connected. Hunter is Joe's son connected to a lifelong Democrat who knows how to grease the wheels of influence and the tracks on his Acorn Stairlift. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's a little too close to home, isn't it, audience? I mean, forget Hunter's N-words for a moment. Though it's hard. The guy thinks he's the love child of Eazy-E and Michael Scott. The real racist act was when Hunter referred to two Mexican grocery store workers as \"prolly illegal.\" He was prolly too hammered to pronounce probably. While being questioned about a missing gun that was dumped in a trash can near that store, Hunter tried to shift the attention on to two innocent people referring to their immigration status. If this was any more racist, it would be a segregated water fountain. But it's Hunter who gets more free passes than a losing gambler at a casino buffet. And now he's on a personal quest for universal truth. Well, here's the truth. Up until recently, Hunter had been living in a $5.4 million house who knew crack addicts could be so successful. I got in the wrong line of work. But he moved claiming he was being harassed by evil right wingers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But that could be pissed off strippers looking for child support. Often they look alike. His artwork is set to go from 75-grand to half a million dollars a pop. I heard he gave a landscape painting to his dad. And Joe is convinced it's another window in his bedroom. That's funny. Anyway, that amount of money can buy a lot of straws, which by the way, is how Hunter paints blowing through a straw. It's -- I'm not joking. It's a great excuse when the cops show up. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Sorry, officer. Those are paintings of snow covered mountains. So, why should you care? Well, today we are inundated with endless examples of racism. It's in our cartoons, our foods, our clothing, even our denials of racism is racist. There's a bigot under every bed. Three if you sleep on a king size, it's a great distraction. If you focus on the guy in the MAGA then you're less likely to hit Joe Biden for his corrupt nepotism. See the red hat, ignore the corrupt brat. To save his son he'll throw an entire country under the bus using the phrase systematically racist. And so we're in the middle of an unholy collaboration between whacked out activists and a whacked out president. Nitro meat glycerin. You see this with corporations, the new woke extremism keeps everyone busy. You know, you're less likely to point out that corporations do business with countries that tie 12 year olds to work benches for 14 hours when you're getting paid by that corporation to teach anti-racism to the workforce. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } See how it works? Places like North Face can continue to make stuff out of petroleum, Shake Shack and buy slaughtered cattle for meat. The CIA could still operate under cover ops, but as long as you fly that pride flag or that BLM flag, well, most likely made in China by the way. You're good. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Corporate virtue signaling is like a bullfighter's cape.

She told me that my career was over and that all my doors will be shut from there on.

Your career is over. Just watch.\" Wait, that doesn't sound like her at all. So far, Chrissy hasn't challenged these new allegations. But to what extent is social media to blame? Should the permanence of the internet make it impossible to free yourself and pass down comments? Not so much for Teigen who's an awful, awful creep. But for the millions of idiot kids who deserve not to have old posts, follow them into adulthood. By the way, that's why I avoid making dumb comments online and save them for this show. You know, it's like my uncle used to say to me when I was a kid, when I was working on the farm. Greg, that's not what the goats are for. I don't know why everybody's laughing at that. All right.

This week, the White House unveiled the plan to combat domestic terrorism, it involves spending $100 million next year to add more bodies at the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, and at Biden's request, the Department of Ice Cream. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, a guy walked into a Walgreens with his bike filled up a bag of stuff and then calmly rode away, of course, in San Fran he's more likely to get arrested for the bag being plastic. Now, there's video of it, but I guess the person who shot it had second thoughts about letting T.V. shows broadcast it. So, we hired a very expensive artists to create a rendering of the incident. Here it is. Here you go. I know what you're thinking, but it's still better than Hunter Biden's paintings. That's going for $85,000. Thanks, Joe. So, Walgreens has closed 17 of its stores due to rampant stealing, CVS has called the city one of the epicenters of organized retail crime. Meanwhile, in Atlanta, residents of the suburb Buckhead push for separate police forces as crime rages. So, as Biden stresses domestic terror, we should remind him, it's not white terror groups plaguing the cities in poor neighborhoods and causing stores all over to close, leaving the non-white elderly and others to fend for themselves. And don't you think it's odd that we know the name MS-13, as well as ISIS and al-Qaeda, but we don't know the names of these white terror groups that are more dangerous according to our president than those other ones.

      "utterance": "Yes. Nothing like laughing at somebody suffering. Wow. And Kat's back after her supervised probation. As the police said she's OK to return to work just hide all the hand sanitizer. It's been said some cats have nine lives. But when your dad is a Democrat supported by the press, multiply that by a thousand and you have Hunter Biden. Fresh off tossing the N-word around like one of his empty crack pipes. What does the media choose to focus on? His new life as a full time painter. I can't blame him. No one can say he isn't qualified to paint what looks like hobo vomit. Now, they won't allow us to show the actual paintings. But trust me, it looks like hobo vomit. I live in New York. I know what hobo vomit looks like. It looks like Hunter Biden paintings. But I get the new occupation fully. Paying a guy a fortune for a job he has no qualifications in is harder to explain than buying hobo vomit from a Chinese businessman. I don't think I'm going to say hobo vomit again. But rather than focus on that stuff, Artnet assesses him as a controversial figure who has been vilified by the right and uncomfortably ignored by the left which absolves him of any culpability. This is not about his crimes, the guns or drugs and strippers, the smears he made against others. No, Hunter just wants to talk about the art. And Jeffrey Dahmer really preferred questions about his poetry. It really could rhyme. Because as Artnet says it's art and for Biden, everything is connected. Except of course his laptop. But that is the word, connected. Hunter is Joe's son connected to a lifelong Democrat who knows how to grease the wheels of influence and the tracks on his Acorn Stairlift. It's a little too close to home, isn't it, audience? I mean, forget Hunter's N-words for a moment. Though it's hard. The guy thinks he's the love child of Eazy-E and Michael Scott. The real racist act was when Hunter referred to two Mexican grocery store workers as \"prolly illegal.\" He was prolly too hammered to pronounce probably. While being questioned about a missing gun that was dumped in a trash can near that store, Hunter tried to shift the attention on to two innocent people referring to their immigration status. If this was any more racist, it would be a segregated water fountain. But it's Hunter who gets more free passes than a losing gambler at a casino buffet. And now he's on a personal quest for universal truth. Well, here's the truth. Up until recently, Hunter had been living in a $5.4 million house who knew crack addicts could be so successful. I got in the wrong line of work. But he moved claiming he was being harassed by evil right wingers. But that could be pissed off strippers looking for child support. Often they look alike. His artwork is set to go from 75-grand to half a million dollars a pop. I heard he gave a landscape painting to his dad. And Joe is convinced it's another window in his bedroom. That's funny. Anyway, that amount of money can buy a lot of straws, which by the way, is how Hunter paints blowing through a straw. It's -- I'm not joking. It's a great excuse when the cops show up. Sorry, officer. Those are paintings of snow covered mountains. So, why should you care? Well, today we are inundated with endless examples of racism. It's in our cartoons, our foods, our clothing, even our denials of racism is racist. There's a bigot under every bed. Three if you sleep on a king size, it's a great distraction. If you focus on the guy in the MAGA then you're less likely to hit Joe Biden for his corrupt nepotism. See the red hat, ignore the corrupt brat. To save his son he'll throw an entire country under the bus using the phrase systematically racist. And so we're in the middle of an unholy collaboration between whacked out activists and a whacked out president. Nitro meat glycerin. You see this with corporations, the new woke extremism keeps everyone busy. You know, you're less likely to point out that corporations do business with countries that tie 12 year olds to work benches for 14 hours when you're getting paid by that corporation to teach anti-racism to the workforce. See how it works? Places like North Face can continue to make stuff out of petroleum, Shake Shack and buy slaughtered cattle for meat. The CIA could still operate under cover ops, but as long as you fly that pride flag or that BLM flag, well, most likely made in China by the way. You're good. Corporate virtue signaling is like a bullfighter's cape. While you look at the twirling cape, he stabs you. I wonder what the angry white male has to say."

So, I foresee this guy having a ton of Chinese buyers or maybe just one for millions of dollars. And of course, the media is fawning all over him. So like the press that he's been getting, like he described his whole day, it was like he gets up at 5:00 and has a cup of coffee before his son wakes up. And then he stares at a blank canvas. I'm like, yes, because he sucks. A real artist probably wouldn't sit there staring at the blank canvas. It's like he's never had formal training in his life. But he's been making art since he was three. That's what you call childhood. It took him two years, they said to do a self-portrait because he was busy at the strip clubs and avoiding child support.

Writing \"She apparently formed her own opinion of me based on a photoshopped comment floating around the internet, which has now been proven to be false by Instagram and since taken down. She told me that my career was over and that all my doors will be shut from there on. I didn't see the point of living.\" Costello also shared a direct message purportedly from Teigen where she told him \"Racist people like you deserve to suffer and die. You might as well be dead. Your career is over. Just watch.\" Wait, that doesn't sound like her at all. So far, Chrissy hasn't challenged these new allegations. But to what extent is social media to blame? Should the permanence of the internet make it impossible to free yourself and pass down comments? Not so much for Teigen who's an awful, awful creep. But for the millions of idiot kids who deserve not to have old posts, follow them into adulthood. By the way, that's why I avoid making dumb comments online and save them for this show. You know, it's like my uncle used to say to me when I was a kid, when I was working on the farm. Greg, that's not what the goats are for. I don't know why everybody's laughing at that. All right. So, again, I always -- I always go to you Diana because you are the scientist. This is somebody who already has high status. She's married to a famous singer. She was a famous model.

      "utterance": "Is Biden's anti-terror action merely a convenient distraction? This week, the White House unveiled the plan to combat domestic terrorism, it involves spending $100 million next year to add more bodies at the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, and at Biden's request, the Department of Ice Cream. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, a guy walked into a Walgreens with his bike filled up a bag of stuff and then calmly rode away, of course, in San Fran he's more likely to get arrested for the bag being plastic. Now, there's video of it, but I guess the person who shot it had second thoughts about letting T.V. shows broadcast it. So, we hired a very expensive artists to create a rendering of the incident. Here it is. Here you go. I know what you're thinking, but it's still better than Hunter Biden's paintings. That's going for $85,000. Thanks, Joe. So, Walgreens has closed 17 of its stores due to rampant stealing, CVS has called the city one of the epicenters of organized retail crime. Meanwhile, in Atlanta, residents of the suburb Buckhead push for separate police forces as crime rages. So, as Biden stresses domestic terror, we should remind him, it's not white terror groups plaguing the cities in poor neighborhoods and causing stores all over to close, leaving the non-white elderly and others to fend for themselves. And don't you think it's odd that we know the name MS-13, as well as ISIS and al-Qaeda, but we don't know the names of these white terror groups that are more dangerous according to our president than those other ones. If I wasn't such a gullible person, I think this is a distraction from the social disintegration of our cities under the Democrats' watch. Can I get a period?"

In Brazil, they have these huge favelas that are totally unplanned. They steal electricity and water and they live basically off the grid. And generally what happens is, families they live in private compounds, they have their own security, and you better believe it that private security is not as sensitive about who they ruff up as the police are. And so, that's partly why my family left because we were afraid that they were afraid when I was a baby, I was getting kidnapped if we stayed in Brazil."

Gascon in L.A. failing to pursue any type of enhancements. Chesa Boudin there in San Francisco. This guy was elected with less than 3000 votes, he had never prosecuted a day in his life, raised by Weather Underground founders, a commitment to essentially eradicating the entire system of justice in any type of law and order and he came out to the spike in crime when a female police officer was attacked by a homeless person because her partner was defunded. And he said, oh, it's all the police unions fault. And I quote, \"It's because they don't want to do their job.\" He blamed the cops for this surge in crimes, in crimes when they are the ones that are dying by suicide at spiking rates and getting shot at and assaulted and the like, and his budget is, is, has been defunded. And so, none of them can even work anymore. And so the audacity to me is that the, as the community is being left unprotected, as they're headed toward private security. Because that's the only way that they can try to protect themselves, the entire system is falling apart because to your point, what's a crime if it's not prosecuted? What's the prosecution if there's no jail time? Where's the deterrent consequences for that? And it goes down the chain. So, without the elected officials supporting them in the places that they should in the positions that they should, we're all screwed. I feel like that was a really negative --"
