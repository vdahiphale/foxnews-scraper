The lawyer and the banker are 11 and eight years older. Next up Jesse. Jesse's sister is Elisa. She's a professor at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. And here's Dana and her younger sister Angie. Angie lives in Colorado, has four cats, but she still loves Jasper. And of course, I learned today she loves the Cookie Monster. And here are Emily and her older sisters, Natalie and Julie. Julie is a child psychologist, Natalie, a travel writer. And finally, we got Greg. Yes. Greg said he had a great picture of his three sisters. Here they are. Yes, indeed.

The White House Coronavirus Task Force met earlier today as though global death toll from COVID-19 reaching over 100,000 people. But President Trump says the U.S. is headed to a death toll substantially under 100,000, thanks to an aggressive strategy of social distancing. Here's the president on that."

We are going to be announcing it on Tuesday. I call it the opening our country task force. Or the opening our country council. I'm going to have to make a decision and I only hope to God that it's the right decision. But I would say without question it's the biggest decision I have ever had to make.

But as we close the week on this Good Friday, the president, the commander in chief who is also the decider in chief now able to lift his gaze and look out ahead to where do we go from here."

It's just kind of your heart rate goes up and it goes down, one day they're very optimistic, and one day it's incredibly sobering. But you're right. They made some accurate calls. If you think about the president just a couple of weeks ago, he pinpointed Easter as a possible peak day. That's looking like it might be it. People are saying today is the peak day. We heard as you mentioned on Monday they were talking about the week of death. It's been eye-popping the amount of death that's come out this week. Hopefully, and we can only pray it gets better after this. But it does look according to Birx who is the expert modeler like we are on the downswing. That does not mean that you've gone it out of a speed track. You still got to keep it under the speed limit. And that's what we have to do at least until May 1st. You know, we talk about and we joke about, you know, Trump only hires the best people, duh, duh, duh, and you kind of smile. But in this case, this task force, these are the best people. Fauci, Birx, Pence, the surgeon general, the FDA leader. You get up there and you listen to them and they really inspire a lot of confidence. So, the president remains flexible when he wants to open this thing up, and I don't think anybody envies that decision that he has to make. You open it up to you soon, and to get a second wave. You wait too long, and it just kills more jobs and opportunities. So, I just hope the media can understand what we're all going through and that people can be a little bit more patient, but, you know, Easter, it's going to be a tough time."

You know, I think, Dana, if this is a matter of the left/right divide and the left is saying, let's go slow, and the right is saying no, we need to open more quickly, I think then it becomes more, you know, of the old polarized politics in America, and I think it leads us down a bad path, because if half of the country says I'm listening, and half of the country says I'm not listening, I'm not going to practice social distancing, I'm not going to be aggressive about washing hands and all the rest, I think it sinks us all.

But I think the point that unites all of us is that we've all made mistakes based on the information that was had at the time. That was either coming from China or coming from the World Health Organization. Information is like mushrooms. There is good information, there is toxic information, and then there is the information that will make you see things. And I think our entire lives are based on -- are based on evolving information. And in order to get the right information, we have to ask some really serious questions. And sometimes no serious questions, we are scared to ask, because people will come after you if you talk about, you know, shutting down borders, they will call you racist. If you said -- if you say, should we, what are the number of cases are we willing to risk in order to restart the community? They might call you a murderer. If you start talking about risk factors like obesity, they will say, are you criticizing a certain behavior and linking it to some kind of race? These are things that the media does."

      "utterance": "I think that's a great step forward, and it's great that yes, he is either listening to us or others that have the same thoughts and ideas. And just to address anther challenge right now that small business owners and operators are facing, banks. Large and small right now are having to close their application acceptance, because they are absolutely inundated with underwriting. How can the federal government not exclude unaffected taxpayers from this application process? Because of course the banks are going to avoid discrimination. Right? They are going to avoid discriminating, so it ties their hands. They can't choose a needy or borrower over one that applied first. And likely, the ones that applied first are those that didn't have that thinned-out workforce and have the stuff to apply. And I want to address something that Greg, the appeal that Greg has been making to those that on the other side of this can help stimulate and support the economy. And I want to echo it. As we navigate this greater demand on our government, I think it's important to manage expectations that there is not going to be a great recovery to look forward to. Pandemics are not like wars. There is no loss of machines and infrastructure to rebuild. And following wars, there are higher real interest rates, right? There's a growing economy that we have to control, but after pandemics, the economy is sluggish. There are lower rates, because people are afraid and have a tendency to save. There is no shortage of capital that we have to pump up right after. And for all of those family, the small businesses, that are families who have experience all of this unemployment, the millions of Americans or a huge loss in revenue and income, no matter their positive intention, they will be disinclined to consume. They will want to save, because this whole thing has been really traumatic. And so, I think, you know, it's a collective trauma we have all been going through. And as Peter Atwater said, you don't recover from trauma, you adapt to it. So, I think moving forward, those that can support the economy absolutely have to. Because the rest of us, there is a lot of shared trauma that results in reduced bandwidth in this collective stress."

Now Dr. Tedros had been praised in the past by somebody like Dr. Fauci, so they've known each other for years, maybe there is not a lot to see here, but it is suspicious, and especially because you looked back to those cholera epidemics that you mentioned the other day, Jesse, that happen in Ethiopia, and there are questions about that. And a friend of mine who is former intelligence told me that he is super suspicious of all of this. I think that the president is a little bit like the boss who calls you on a Friday and says, make sure you come to my office at 10 a.m. Monday, I have something really important for you to talk about and then you worry about it all weekend. Because what the president did right before the clip that he showed, is he said we're thinking about this, and next week we're going to make an announcement. And next week we're going to talk about what we are going to do with the funding for the WHO. And you just know that that is going to ruin their weekend. And they are going to be worried about it all week. Here's one thing I would recommend. I think the you look at a global pandemic and you realize it's super important to have something like the World Health Organization so they were all communicating with each other, stamping things out as soon as they involve. But we can't just be involved with the money, we have to have a much more heavy hand involvement with western societies and the United States. So, I wouldn't necessarily cut back the funding. I would push ahead and make sure the United States has more influence."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, I think first of all you don't want to politicize a pandemic. And I think WHO plays an important role as we are trying to get an international cooperation in dealing with this. We can't stop at one corner and pretend, you know, it' over because if you have it all over the world, Jesse, you got to deal with it all over the world. And that's why you need a World Health Organization. I do think that China told lies. And I think that in some cases they lied to the WHO, and the WHO then echoed those lies. So, do I blame the WHO, to some extent, yes, but most of all I blame China. And when you think about the WHO and the role that it performed, you know, I think things like the use of masks, even our experts here in the U.S. have changed their position on it. But the WHO said very clearly when they declared there was a global pandemic, we, you know, in this country, our president was saying, we can handle this, we got this under control. So, you see, I think there is all kinds of finger-pointing and blame games. As I've said to you on other topics, I'm not sure this is helpful as we try to come to terms with things.

And so, they are the public relation flacks who smoothed over the oil spill, right, or the accidental food poisoning, or the escaped virus, right? They are those catastrophic public relations agencies that are working on behalf of China. Now we have no reason to doubt what they were doing, because, hey, it's the World Health Organization, anything with the world as a prefix has to be good, right? World music, can't stand it. Anyway, so the solution for me, and again, it has nothing to do with picking on them. It's a construct -- constructive solution is to take all the involuntary funding. I think there's -- I don't know how much it is. I know there is voluntary funding from private people. But take the other, give it to the people that are suffering, the small business. So, because the people that are being harmed by China and by relationship who, you know, you can sue China or you can just take that money and funnel it to America's bar tab. Because that's what this is about. We need to pay America's bar tab when people come back so that they spend more money. That doesn't assign any blame, it just shifts some of the money over to the victims who could really use it. That's my solution."

I think the question that President Trump and the other world leaders are facing right now is how do we compel China ever to play by the same rules as everybody else? This is only one example of like 50 concurrent elements right now. Where their history of subversion and a lack of transparency has resulted in global negative results. And given their current issues with environment and trade and wildlife, it's not as if this might not happen in the future again. And so, I think moving forward, there needs to be some type of global consensus where there is a zero tolerance for them. So at least now there is sort of a conversation about it."

What we see now is that Biden is coming out with a plan to expand Medicare eligibility, and secondly, to forgive some student loan debts. Both ideas put forward by Sanders. Biden says he'll do these things if he's elected president. And Biden better at quickly because a new poll from Fox News shows President Trump virtually tied with Biden at 42 percent support apiece. Jessie, let me come to you and ask, given what Joe Biden is doing is a little bit of a surprise to me because politicians after the primaries, they usually move to the center, but now we see Joe Biden moving to the left. How do you interpret this?"

Anybody to the right of Bernie, he basically said was like a capitalist pig that was you know, business as usual. So I don't think that's going to do Biden any good to flirt with the Bernie Bros are making these types of overtures. They have a big problem. His base is cracked. He's probably going to lose maybe 10 to 15 percent of the Bernie Bros. And the fact that a Fox News poll which hasn't been that favorable to President Trump has the President tied with Joe Biden this far out in a presidential election, I think it's very good news for the President."

And when you watch that, you put Joe in that place, and you know that he gets easily frustrated over simple sentences. So, here's my talking point. The question on everyone's mind right now is could President Trump be the most caring president we've ever had in the history of the country? Because the evidence is clear. He is willing to put his economic achievements in jeopardy to save lives. He's willing to pay up his own business to save lives. He's willing to lose reelection to save lives. Put that on top of his revulsion over military intervention and his deep desire to get troops out of harm's way, this guy makes Florence Nightingale look like Lizzie Borden.

But I just think to myself, if you're on the -- on the Joe Biden camp, and you say to the Biden -- to the Bernie Sanders supporters, hey, who do you want to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Well, I just shocked them and say, sorry, I was just playing around. Of course, I'm going to vote for Joe Biden."

It's like really -- that's really good. But here -- you know to the victor should go the spoils, but that's only for a confident conqueror. And Joe Biden is a weak nominee. He's hobbled. And now he's in the middle of trying to deal with this during a pandemic. And instead of being victorious, and as you said, like moved to the center and say, I can be the president for all Americans, he's putting out policy proposals that probably would have helped him in New Hampshire primary, not now.

And you know, I think short of ventriloquism, this delicate balancing act is not going to work. I don't think he can have it both ways. And what I mean by that is right now we see him capitulating to those Bernie Bros, right? He's talking about climate policy, income inequality, college and university tuition forgiveness, all of that stuff that they love. But at the same time, he can't have his cake and eat it too, with the independence and the moderates that he needs to actually win the general election. And so moving forward, he needs to make that call is what would actually benefit him. Because at the end of the day, as Jesse pointed out, those Bernie Bros care about authenticity. So if he chooses another establishment V.P. candidate and then thinks that just by talking that talk, he will have them on his side will be sorely disappointed."

The cat will be -- isn't this amazing? Look at that really, really impressive. I got to admit, it's impressive. But in this era, where people have no toilet paper, what are these people doing with all of these rolls of toilet paper doing tricks with their cat when people have nothing to wipe their bottoms with? This is like a rapper, you know, showing up a wad of bills, you know, in a very poor part of town. I'm very disgusted by this, but I can't stop watching. That's it."

And now you can get some of these masks for yourself. It's called the victory mask. And it's kind of generated from the victory gardens that people use to grow to fight food shortages during the World Wars. And if you go online, you get it for six bucks. They don't even take a profit on that. They just plow that money right back into donating more masks. So go to Rhoback.com and check that out. Also, go to \"WATTERS' WORLD\" Saturday 8:00 p.m. Eastern. We have Dr. Fauci in my world. There he is."
