There wasn't really one chief of staff. Now, they will be under General Kelly. So I think it was difficult for, I mean by to really get the White House under control to make sure there was one person in charge to restore order to make sure that things weren't happening. I think Scaramucci came in thinking he might be the one to do that. Now, what we have on Friday (INAUDIBLE) no, General Kelly is now in charge and I doubt he has very little patience for the drama and the chaos and hopefully moving forward we'll see more order restored to the White House."

And you had the Boy Scouts, the Pentagon and the police departments because of tweets or things President Trump said in speeches, push back against the president. It points to the problem here. You can change the chief of staff, but it still gets down to the communications problem. It may not have been Reince Priebus, it may not have been Sean Spicer --"
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

I don't think that's going to change all that much. Look, the media have been going absolutely nuts over Anthony Scaramucci sort of coming on like gang busters. Is that in part because it's good TV?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETTYPIECE",
      "utterance": "I mean, some it is just remarkable, the things that a communications director, the person in charge of communications and messaging and to just point communication messaging. There were good things that happened this week for the president's agenda. The Foxconn announcement on jobs, heroes week, you know, a Boy Scout, giving the recognition to the police officers who were at the Scalise shooting. But the communications director took them off of that communications message. And the media, you know, when you have someone that is high profile going out there, the media follows that story and that became the story and Scaramucci became the news rather than other things happening in the White House. So, to exactly that point, having Kelly to try to get the messaging back on straight, they have to keep to their messaging and I don't know if Kelly will be able to control Scaramucci. I don't know if he'll be control the president's tweets. To that point, it's going to be sort of more of the same of the distractions and the off-topic messaging."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

Is he right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",

It's not all bad leaking. And for Scaramucci then to come out to accuse his colleagues of leaking I think lead to the response from some people saying the White House is out of control, I'm actually fearing for my safety to come into work tomorrow. It's not a great environment to walk into when he's trying to build a new team and he himself has said I'm willing to fire anyone and everyone in this White House including you start over if we can't get to the bottom of this. And so in terms of the leaking, we'll have to see if it stops but I'm not convinced it's not coming from people at the top of the White House to simply get a story right out."

      "speaker": "TRIPPI",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

He put Reince Priebus' name in this tweet. \"Politco\" says which \"Politico\" have reported the story got a publicly available financial disclosure form. It didn't have to rely on any leak while, you know, the move (INAUDIBLE) back down and I've seen an interview, but you say leaking in this White House, leaking in every White House, haven't you been in all the campaigns where you have calling the person who shared things you didn't want attributed to you?"
    },

      "speaker": "TRIPPI",

I mean, there are factions in the campaigns that I was in that wanted me out, right. OK, they got a leak on and vice versa. I'm not denying that. I'm just saying that in this White House because of the way President Trump set this thing up with all the different factions, it becomes really impossible for any communications director or the chief of staff to maintain any kind of unanimity because of that."

All right, another sort of a spectacular thing that happened this week was having to do with Jeff Sessions, the president continuing his campaign on twitter against his own attorney general. He's put up a couple tweets. Number one, \"Attorney General Jeff Sessions, says the president, has taken a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are e-mails and DNC server) and intel leakers!\" Another tweet from the president, \"So why aren't the committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into croked Hillary's crimes and Russia relations. And them Margaret Taleve of Bloomberg asked the president a question in a news conference saying do you actually want Jeff Sessions to resign. Why are you letting him twist in the wind? The president disputed that and then he said this."

So, that's what -- I think that's sort of what the media was responding to. And also then seeing the Republicans on the Hill come to a very concerted defense of him, there is also response to that."

Many groups like the Tea Party Patriots came out and said, look, the Obama administration destroyed the Justice Department, made it corrupt. Jeff Sessions is coming in, cleaning it out and making sure the rule of law is restored. And if you look at the things that happened last week in terms of that MS- 13 announcement, there were hundreds of members charged in El Salvador as Jeff Sessions visited. He's getting results and it was baffling to people from across the board, from conservatives to liberals why the president would be attacking Jeff Sessions for a number of reasons, not just on the recusal."

Sessions in a conversation with Tucker Carlson defended the recusal from the Russia investigation as he'd been part of the campaign, and he said the president tweets were hurtful but he didn't go much farther and that he clearly wants to get some peace. Joe, on your side, liberal commentators, a number of them saying very nice things about the very conservative former senator from Alabama, telling him not to resign, so suddenly he's worthy of defending because President Trump who they probably dislike even more wants him out?"

He resigns on Thursday night. It's forced out on Friday and he's forced to drive home alone away from the motorcade and then awkwardly does interviews from the White House Friday night.

What this was about was a single tweet by The New Yorker's Ryan Liza about a White House dinner that Scaramucci attended with the president with Sean Hannity, with Kimberly Guilfoyle, with former Fox Ness co-president Bill Shine and obviously Scaramucci didn't want that to become public.

Reince Priebus, other White House officials were constantly leaking to the press that he was struggling in his job, that he wasn't able to excise any authority, that he was on his way out. He got little respect. Do you think he was treated unfairly?"

He wasn't set up to fail, but he wasn't set up to succeed from the get-go. And I think that gave him a difficult set of circumstances to try to navigate and I think General Kelly will now come in and be a commander of that White House. He will --"

So even if you want to give them that, Congress has had nine months to get it right on top of the seven years that they ran election cycle after election cycle of repeal and replace ObamaCare. We won the House. We won the Senate. We won dozens and dozens of seats over that issue, raised money on that issue, to get those people elected. And now they can't do anything.

      "speaker": "EMILY JASHINSKY, WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "Right, and that makes you think that it must have been strategic because this president understands media so he must have had a reason that he did it. But it's interesting that he did it without having a fresh strategy from the Department of Defense and from the Pentagon."

      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Exactly, which I think exacerbated the fact that it blew up into a massive story on a day frankly where healthcare was probably at foremost on the minds of most voters around the country. This impacted a lot of people and that's probably what they were wondering about that day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Francesca, you also have the spectacle of reporters asking Sarah Huckabee-Sanders at the briefing whether this meant for example that the thousands of transgender people already serving in the military would be expelled and she hadn't been given the information to answer these questions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, DAILYMAIL.COM",
      "utterance": "Well that's right, and that's what makes this so fascinating with the fact that the Department of Defense didn't seem to know about this or whether it was happening. Then you have Sarah Huckabee-Sanders who was unable to say when this policy would take place. How long we could expect for it to be implemented. And I think that was what made this such a media interest story, was once again, the disconnect between the president and one of his cabinet secretaries."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, there seemed to be a lot more energy in the media on this on the left. So by our count, CNN on days it was announced in 36 segments. MSNBC to 29 segments. Fox News did eight. So, there's just a lot of outrage that the president would even go there, reversing this Obama administration rule or attempting to on twitter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think a lot of these mainstream newsrooms are dominated by people in social progressive cities who have some more background and for them this is a priority and a way that it's not and they don't think they understand that and the rest of the country. People are so very deeply hesitant about transgenderism and people are still, you know, in some areas just plain ambivalent and probably more concerned about healthcare that they are about this issue which of course is very important to the people it affects, but healthcare was affecting a lot of people, too, on a different scale."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Do you agree with that about reasons mostly being staffed by progressive people who would naturally feel that this is the wrong move?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that part of the reason that people are asking a out it and covering it was because there was a lot of interest in it. There was a lot of interest in it from people in America in this particular story and whether they are on the left or whether you're on the right. But also on that day, another thing that was happening in there and what I asked about in that same press briefing, was what in the heck was going on with Jeff Sessions in this very public fight between Jeff Sessions. So it's not necessarily that they would have just been talking about healthcare if he hadn't done that that day. They would have also had to take more questions on Jared Kushners testimony before lawmakers on the Russia collusions story. There would have been additional questions probably on Jeff Sessions. There was also Rex Tillerson and his little break that he was taking."

      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "Right now, there was a lot of other things -- there was a lot of other things that were going on at that time so it's not necessarily true that there would have been a conversation about healthcare and some legal policies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Agree but that's what's interesting to me, is that when you're going to different news websites on that day, this was the headline. So, this headline --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "This was the news story until that day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Exactly, and that's why it's interesting to me because all of it were very substantive news that impacted I think a wider swath of people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The policy not yet taking effect according to the Pentagon until there's a formal order. So meanwhile, you know, there has been -- this is a good example, lots' of media criticism about the, let's just say unorthodox way that the president makes and announces decisions or announces a new chief of staff, tweets, speeches, sometimes seemingly out of hand, because he's throwing off a traditional (INAUDIBLE) as we saw in the campaign, that the media keep acting shocked that this president does things differently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Right. I mean, that Trump sending a tweet is I think is no surprise. He's done this time and again with policies. I think it's wrong but it shouldn't be probably at this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Why is it wrong?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think especially to do it when this impact -- this policy had basically invited people in the military to make very personal psychological decisions over the course of the past year which you can agree with or not but they're very personal and psychological and to tweet it I think sort of down plays that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So you're saying that he shouldn't have twitted it because there wasn't enough information or that he shouldn't use twitter to announce presidential decisions. I mean, why not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "I think in this instance when you have people who made the decision to come out in the military, these are people who are serving their country, putting their lives on the line. You can agree with the decision or not that they've made personally, but either way, it is very personal, and to do it abruptly on twitter with little information I think was wrong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "We have less than a minute, I mean, this even extends to the staff shakeup that we've all been talking about. Ordinarily, you would have a nice photo-op at the White House. The president would thank Reince Priebus. He would welcome General Kelly. Each man would say a few words, same thing with Sean Spicer leaving. Instead, it's a late Friday tweet and the media don't like that. They have a grudge about this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "Well constantly in this administration if you want to know what the president is thinking, you can just go directly to the president or you can go directly to his twitter and find out exactly that because often he's moving so fast, as he said that the staff just can't keep up with what is going on. And so the power is very concentrated with the executive in this administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's a social media presidency. He's a 21st century presidency. Francesca Chambers and Emily Jashisnsky, thanks very much for stopping by this Sunday. After the break, more on the Scaramucci storm. If a White House official delivers an x-rated rant that he assumes is off the record, so journalists have any obligation to clarify that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Anthony Scaramucci's rather crude tirade to the \"New Yorker's\" Ryan Lizza raises some basic journalistic questions. We're back with White House correspondent Shannon Pettypiece. So, Lizza says Scaramucci never explicitly put the call off the record so he's entitled to publish it. Fair point. Scaramucci believed there was an implicit understanding in the way he was talking and the language that he used that it was off the record. He later tweeted, \"I made a mistake in trusting a reporter. It won't happen again.\" So, did Ryan Lizza, who is a good reporter, also a liberal voice in The New Yorker and CNN, burn him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETTYPIECE",
      "utterance": "I don't know really the details of how that conversation took place. Traditionally, the way I operate as a reporter, if someone calls me, they're not used to dealing with reporters. They're not familiar with on the record, off the record. They're sort of the layman in this area. I give people the benefit of the doubt that they're talking to me something personally one-on-one. I think what makes it different here though is that this is the communications director, someone in charge of communications and again, I mean, they've talked to the media for years, even has his own TV program. He knows how the media works. When you call up, if you got something to say that you don't want on the record as a spokesman, you got to make that clear. You got to say that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That was a misstep. No question about that, but I've gotten dozens of calls over the years from politicians and operatives who have ranted and raved and cursed in a way they wouldn't want published and I would jump in. I will say, OK, are we talking here, we're on the record here. Do you want this attributed to you because otherwise it feels to me like a bit of gotcha, like they're trusting me enough to unload and not carefully weigh every word and I say, oh, you didn't say the magic words, off the record. I'm going to now use this, but it's a judgment call."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETTYPIECE",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I would imagine there is a lot of discussion and debate about this in the newsroom. You know, the question too, is there news value to this. What news value do we have? You know, how does this help advance the story if we use this on the record even if they didn't say off the record. I don't know if they went back to him and try to discuss any of this at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "There was a follow-up call in which was it says Scaramucci conceded that he didn't take it any further off the record. But again, he clearly was disappointed. And there was news value in that conversation beyond --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETTYPIECE",
      "utterance": "Great. It was very clear he was thinking about a lot of these issues."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Beyond the F bombs and so forth. Last question, so, with reporters covering Scaramucci's crusade against White House leakers is what this is all about, many reporters are also the recipient of these leaks. So, is there too much self-interest here to treat this issue fairly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETTYPIECE",
      "utterance": "Once this leak story or once leaks really became a priority of the president and the attorney general, that's when, I mean, our felt our organization really started following this leak story and it became a news story because it was a priority of the president. It was an issue about the president. We write about what's important to the president and what the president is doing and --"
    },

In fact, the author of this piece, Stephen Roderick, whose wife is Canadian says the prime minister reminds him of Obama. I'm sure Obama. So, let's look at the last sentence. \"Justin Trudeau's Canada looks like a beautiful place to ride out an American storm.\" Well, I'm sure \"Rolling Stone\" could find a very nice office there.
