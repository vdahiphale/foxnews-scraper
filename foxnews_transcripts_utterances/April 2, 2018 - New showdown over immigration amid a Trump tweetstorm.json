And the president says these people are trying to take advantage of the dreamers. Well, they can't apply for a dreamers status. There's no relationship. But he makes it as if it's one.

Nobody is trying to, like, step on anybody's dreams or hopes or ability to get into this country. What people are against is illegal entry. And let me tell you something, the president was giving the Democrats, and they missed a great opportunity here to take advantage of this positioning, and of what he wanted was to get the 25 billion for his enhanced border wall. And instead, they went ahead and passed on it for political reasons, which is a disservice to everyone. Because, really, it was 80 percent of what they want, OK. And he's just was saying, listen, we've got to, like, slow it down about this in terms of chain migration and this lottery system, and put some more specific standards and practices. Little bit more structure to make sure that the right people are getting in and it's properly background vetted, etcetera. That's not an unreasonable request. What's unreasonable is the obstructionists on both sides, to be quite frank, because people acted like political party pigs and they wanted everything they wanted on their plate without an ability or reason to compromise. And now, this is what we have. So, the president didn't kill DACA. I mean, I think the Democrats killed it.

They deported tens of thousands of Hondurans. And yet, this is, hey, come on through. So, again, it validates -- and then, back to the point about DACA, who killed DACA.

And the Democrats, obviously, want open borders because it means more votes and more amnesty. Meanwhile, the middle-class American workers are getting hosed, and the body politic suffers from this. And our national security suffers because you have no idea who's coming in the country. Like Greg said in Honduras, that border with Mexico, they've had a fence on that border too, about 500 miles. And we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars sending it to Honduras and Mexico to make sure they secure that border, and make sure that they root out the corruption and try to help their economy, because right now it's such a disaster, it's spilling over. And no matter what we spend, we're still getting -- I think in 2016, we stopped 200,000 Central American illegal immigrants crossing through Mexico into the United States. That is a lot of people."

So, I think on that level, you know, like, let's really help people is what he says is the purpose of government, and he things that we're not doing that job. And I guess that means, by extension, since Trump is president, Trump isn't doing it. But I thought what really struck me was, on some level, you know, we're in the midst of, again, culture wars. And nobody goes to Charles Barkley for political expertise. He was endorsing Doug Jones down in Alabama. As a guy who, at one point, thought about running for governor in Alabama as a Republican. So, I think people say, well, it's Charles Barkley, a celebrity. We like to hear what our celebrities say. But why we take it, like, to heart as, oh, boy, this is big news, I don't know. But he is much more than a basketball player or former basketball player at this point. I think he is, may be, the preeminent basketball analyst in the country.

And personally, I don't believe that gun-control is the best idea. Everyone has the right to have their own opinion, and I believe that our right should have just been expressed. In the beginning, it was a very big risk to step up and do this. It took a lot of fight with our school to get them to approve it and support us. But in the end, they did support us."

People that come forth and say, isn't it great that teenagers are going out there and they care about something? That's good. Well, if that's the case, then he should have equal praise for this. If you're independent of ideology, you should say there are kids out there talking about gun control. There kids out there talking about gun rights. Isn't it great that all these kids are out there? But I don't think you're going to see that in the media. On a personal note, I am very, very skeptical of all teenage activism because I was one. I worked on the nuclear freeze. When I was in high school, I did it for extra credit. I got signatures to ban nuclear weapons from being transported in California. I know that I wasn't thinking about it clearly.

You know, they had to persuade them based on some sort of logic to be able to do that. What I would recommend is that the debating association, they choose a new topic every semester for students for the high school debate teams. And I think that gun-control or the Second Amendment should be the one that they do next year. And let these kids argue it. But when you are on the debate team, you don't know if you have to argue pro or con. You have to be well-versed in both, and then you can make a decision at the end of the day.

Student during the first walkout, some were actually physically assaulted for holding up signs supporting the Second Amendment. One kid was suspended for staying inside the classroom. Other kids were sent home, because they didn't want to participate. With that said, Scott Israel is the real villain here. We really know why -- and that we've been over it 1,000 times.

Contrast that with the new media campaign that FOX News is doing, which was super sophisticated, very different. And the thing that was really different about it from my perspective is that there was no script. So we went in there not knowing what we were going to be asked or what we were actually going to say.

CNN is threatened by it, because they know that this Sinclair piece was targeting a place like CNN. You know, this brings me back to the Fake News Awards. Let's remind everybody some of these awards. CNN, Don Jr. and WikiLeaks, false. The Mooch story about Russia, falls. The fake Japanese feeding the fish video, false. Brian Ross, ABC tank market. What do all these things have in common? They're all fake news from the liberal mainstream media, and they were all done in order to hurt President Trump.

And I think that was the power here. That this is not independent anymore. Your local news is now under control of somebody who is pro-Trump. And Trump is defending them.

One if not the best and most articulate defender of the president of the United States and is one of, if not the best and most articulate defender of the president. So I don't think she's the leaker. I don't know that for a fact, but I do know if Dana was to leak, she would not leak to you, Juan."
