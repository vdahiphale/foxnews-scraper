Listen, we also know that what happened was, is, the FBI knew that they needed to go out after Russia. And instead of going after Russia, they went after the president of the United States. And that's all going to come out. Actually, I have reviewed some additional documents, Maria, that would indicate that, prior to that first FISA application -- and you're going to have Carter Page on here in just a little bit -- but prior to that first FISA application, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, and others at the FBI knew that Christopher Steele's dossier wasn't credible and they did a rush to make sure that they could actually surveil him. That will come out because there's a cover-up that happened within certain realms at the FBI.",

Joining me exclusively straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" GOP Senator Thom Tillis on President Trump using America 's influence with tariffs to get new commitments from Mexico to help address the crisis at the southern border. Plus, how is China viewing the president's negotiating tactic, as Washington and Beijing break the ice on the trade showdown for the first time since talks broke down? We will also fear from two influential House lawmakers this morning from both sides of the political aisle about this. Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan is co-chair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. And Republican Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina will break news this morning on investigating the investigators when it comes to the origins of the Russia probe. Will we see accountability for those who pushed the false collusion narrative? Plus, foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign Carter Page is with me this morning on the edits and the omissions in the Mueller report raising eyebrows this morning. All that a lot more right now, right here, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And President Trump announcing on Twitter, of course, a signed border deal with Mexico, and dropping his threat to slap new tariffs on Mexico tomorrow on our southern neighbor. The deal influencing and including plans to return migrants seeking asylum to Mexico, where they will remain until their claims can be processed. Joining me right now in an exclusive interview is North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Judiciary, Armed Services and Banking committees. Senator, it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much for joining us."

      "utterance": "Well, last week, when Chuck Schumer said that it was a bluff, I said that probably a week from now he would be eating his words, and next week, this week, he will. The president used what I think was a very important tool to convince Mexico that securing their southern border and working with us is in all of our best interests. And I'm glad to see it. We have the potential for eliminating the flow of 60,000 or more people who are coming across our border every month from places other than Mexico. So I think this is a great first step. We have got a lot more work to do, but I'm happy with the president's action and happy with the result."

Griff Jenkins, Fox News, this morning reporting that, as of yesterday, ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, says that they have released more than 200,000 individuals claiming to be part of a family since the end of December. Experts tell me that 25 percent of the apprehensions are fake families. They're just renting kids in Central America and bringing them here. Your reaction to these numbers, which are the worst we have seen so far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TILLIS",
      "utterance": "Well, it's very concerning. If we can stop the future flows, which is what this agreement with Mexican will do, now we have got to go back and figure out how to clear the backlog of -- and in the last year, about 850,000 people have crossed the border illegally. That is roughly the population of the city of Charlotte. And now we have got to process the asylum claims. And in many cases, because they're not going to have a valid asylum claim, we have got to get them back to their country of origin. And we have got to step up internal enforcement, so that we can secure our communities and secure a number of Hispanic communities that are at risk by having these folks go into the community without any way to track them, and actually putting those communities at risk."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

Also, ICE is telling Fox News that they are accelerating the interior enforcement operations, pointing to existing overstays by 98 percent of migrants who came here in 2017 from Central America. They're overstaying, because we know that, once you are apprehended, you may or may not be able to get a hearing for five, six, seven, eight months. We're showing you video of when I went to the border about a month ago. We took the show to the border, and we watched these children being put in just terrible positions because they're being rented."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TILLIS",
      "utterance": "Well, that's exactly right, Maria. We have seen instances, hundreds, if not thousands of instances, where somebody just teams up with children. They are taking advantage of them. And, sadly, many of these children and young women are being trafficked after they crossed the border. The Democrats need to understand there's a humanitarian crisis at the border and in this country that can only be solved through stepped-up enforcement, for the good of those very people that they pretend to be protecting. It's not protecting them. They're being harmed in the thousands, not to mention the illicit drugs and all of the other problems that are coming from their lack, the Democrats' lack, of support for securing the border and providing Homeland Security with the resources that they need to secure our homeland."

      "speaker": "TILLIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I have no doubt that he has the support in the Senate. And I believe that Speaker Pelosi will ultimately have to support it. This is good for American workers. I know that organized labor has stated that they support the agreement. Now that we have gotten the threat of tariffs out of the way, I hope that Speaker Pelosi will put that on the House floor. It will pass if she puts it on the floor. And then we will pass it in the Senate. And that will even greater -- create a greater partnership with Mexico while we set about solving the border crisis."
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And then there's China. Let me ask you about that, because the G20 meeting happening in two weeks, there is an expectation the president will have a meeting with President Xi Jinping at the G20 meeting on the sidelines. What are you expecting from that, knowing that the China tariffs and the Mexico situation are two very different stories?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TILLIS",
      "utterance": "Well, if I'm China, I'm worried about the progress we're making with Mexico, the passage of the USMCA. Getting that partnership together here in North America allows the president to take the same sort of strategy to China. China is stealing our intellectual property. They're not playing on a level playing field in terms of trade. And, again, I think that our members, our Republican members need to provide the president with a lot of leeway, because he's proven with Mexico and with Canada that if we give him maybe even some unorthodox options for negotiating trade agreements, that America wins and it's good for American workers. I know it's good for workers here in North Carolina."

This is Steven Mnuchin meeting with China's Central Bank governor. What's your take away from that? Do you think we're going to be able to move the needle on China, knowing that theft of intellectual property and forced transfer of technology has really been a culture in China? Do you really think they are going to change that behavior?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TILLIS",
      "utterance": "I do, Maria. I think, as long as Congress makes it very clear that we're standing behind the president, we're going to do things differently. Past administrations, Democrat and Republican, have failed to actually use the capabilities, the might of the American economy, to get China to play by the rules. China came close to having an agreement. They went back, talked with their leaders. They stepped away from an agreement in principle. And a lot of that had to do with enforcement. It's one thing to get an agreement. One thing I know about this president, if they cheat and if they don't live up to it, there's going to be a consequence. And that's the only thing that China responds to. China would like to wait out President Trump. He would like to wait out this Congress. We're not going to let them do that. And that's why we have got to move quickly. We can't -- this can't be a matter of years. This has to be a matter of months to get an agreement that we think is fair for American workers and workers here in North Carolina."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, but China is already escalating what has been an already spiraling issue over Huawei. The Chinese now are creating their own black list of unreliable foreigners, basically trying to hit back at the U.S. for banning Huawei."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TILLIS",
      "utterance": "Well, that may work, but I doubt it. At the end of the day, they know that America's economy is vital to their continued success. And if we have to take some hits in the near term for the long-term good of the United States and the free world, I think it's something that we have to be prepared to do. It's very different. We have never had a president who has had the courage to use all of the tools in his toolbox. And I think that we actually have to be there to support him."

    {
      "speaker": "TILLIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think one is I think my colleague Mark Meadows is speaking later on the show. The American people, people in North Carolina are tired of them reprosecuting a settled matter, no collusion, no obstruction. What we're going to be talking about as we move forward to the summer session is confirming more conservative judges, trying to get our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work on regulatory reforms that make sense. We're working with the administration. A lot of the things that we will do will be supporting the administration as they continue a great track record on regulatory reform, taking cost out of doing the business in the United States and attracting foreign investment, which is a key driver to our GDP growth."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINGELL",
      "utterance": "So, I have yet to hear what the details are on what the tweaks -- I have always been one of the Democrats that has said we need to do something. I call it NAFTA 2.0, as you well know. And, actually, the president threw a grenade into the middle of those talks in the last week on the tariffs, total panic back here in Michigan with both the workers and the companies. I mean, one of the things -- one of my biggest problems with the president is the lack of certainty. Companies and workers need certainty. So he threw a grenade into the middle of all of this. I will say that I think the discussions on tariffs, and talking about what the economic impact would be on the auto industry, show people why we do need a new NAFTA, that 80 percent of the goods being made in Mexico are coming into the United States. But here is the reality. The Blazer plant that General Motors announced that they were putting in Mexico last August is paying $1.50 an hour. We need more enforceable labor provisions. I keep saying that. And as soon as -- I have talked to the -- Ambassador Lighthizer, the trade representative. He knows how strongly we feel. I think he's doing a good job in trying to get us there. And we need to get that done before I can vote for this. And the other thing is that there's a provision in there that raises prescription drug prices, which we have got to address. So I wish we had more certainty. We need these tweaks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know that it -- I don't know that it automatically raises prescription drug prices, as you say. What it does is keep a 10-year period for companies to not face generic competition. It doesn't automatically raise prescription drug prices. You know that, Congresswoman."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINGELL",
      "utterance": "But a likely -- a likely fallout of that is, instead of being able to bring our consumers lower prices, which we get in generic drugs, many of the pharmaceutical companies keep doing these changes that keep the prices high, instead of being able to go to lower-cost generic drugs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINGELL",
      "utterance": "I'm not questioning anybody. I want to work with everybody, because it's not just prescription drugs. I'm now hearing more and more when I'm out there the cost of out-of-pocket expenses for people. We got to work together. It's a real issue that I hear every single day I'm home in the district."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, if you -- are you willing to sign USMCA in the House before the August recess, or do you want this to linger, and then come back and deal with this in the fall?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINGELL",
      "utterance": "I do not want it to linger, but I need labor provisions that ensure us that Mexico is going to make those changes, so that we are not competing with a $1.50-an-hour wage. Now, the provisions aren't tough enough. Now, I know the ambassador is working on this. I know the speaker is working on this. But so changes have to happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, one thing that is part of this immigration deal that the president just did with Mexico is that the U.S. will review the effectiveness of Mexico's immigration policies after 90 days. So it's anybody's guess about whether or not the president has said forget about these tariffs. He may very well come back with the threat, if he doesn't think that the work being done at the border is sufficient. So there are enforcements mechanisms in this, as well as in USMCA. What specific more of an enforcement mechanism do you want to see? Because there are already enforcement mechanisms in there to ensure that U.S. workers get paid -- in fact, paid higher than you would expect, because they are being forced to make changes, just what you said, because of labor laws in Mexico? That's already in this bill."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINGELL",
      "utterance": "It's not. The provisions in this bill do not, at this time -- or it's not a bill. Actually, it's an agreement, the trade agreement. We need to see Mexico do more to ensure that there is enforcement, that there is accountability for the enforcement. When we have that accountability, when we know that they're going to enforce it, then this bill becomes OK."

Here we are with a deal that has unprecedented scope, unprecedented commitment on behalf of the Mexican government to help us at the border, and we're getting more cooperation from the Mexican government than we are the Democrats on Capitol Hill. And yet what we see is this president is serious about securing our border, but he's also serious about doing a trade deal with Mexico and Canada. I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail, and I think that a vote before August is critical if we're going to get this done."

And I can tell you there are a number of us that are committed to making sure that U.S. trade and the American worker are protected. And Debbie Dingell is a very thoughtful member of Congress. Hopefully, we will be able to get together and make sure that that happens in the latter part of July."

There's actually a multistep process, but that has been set in motion, was just a week or so ago, prior to the president leaving. So, hopefully, we will be able to see that as we all come together here in the next six weeks."

There are now new questions about misrepresentations in the Mueller report. You have reported there's certain individuals that are named in the Mueller report in fact had no connection to Russia. What can you tell us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what we're starting to see is, the deeper the dive we take, Maria, into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions and actually some of the facts that they put forth in there are a misrepresentation of what we actually know. John Solomon did some reporting recently that would suggest that part of the Mueller report indicated one individual had a connection with Russia, when indeed they didn't. I think you will find others in there where all - - it seems like all roads lead to Russia in the Mueller report. And, actually, what we're seeing in the evidence doesn't suggest that. Listen, we also know that what happened was, is, the FBI knew that they needed to go out after Russia. And instead of going after Russia, they went after the president of the United States. And that's all going to come out. Actually, I have reviewed some additional documents, Maria, that would indicate that, prior to that first FISA application -- and you're going to have Carter Page on here in just a little bit -- but prior to that first FISA application, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, and others at the FBI knew that Christopher Steele's dossier wasn't credible and they did a rush to make sure that they could actually surveil him. That will come out because there's a cover-up that happened within certain realms at the FBI."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And that's going to come out sooner, rather than later. We're facing a big week in terms of the revelation of some of this stuff. I know that the president has announced or said that he will declassify certain documents. He has given the authority to the A.G., Bill Barr, to declassify. Some of those documents will be revealed this upcoming week, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, as we start to look at some of these documents, Maria, Bill Barr, the attorney general, has been dead set about making sure that transparency is there for all Americans to view. We have had one narrative. The Democrats had their best day when Robert Mueller actually did his press conference as he was leaving the Department of Justice. I can tell you, the more evidence that we see, the more that the American people can judge for themselves, they will start to understand why this president has been so upset and why he's called it, you know, a hoax, because, indeed, in many ways, it was. So we will start to see some additional documents come out this week. Whether it's the declassified documents or not, I'm not sure. But I can tell you that I have looked at documents at the Department of Justice, as has Jim Jordan. And what we saw was a very clear indication of severe credibility issues as it relates to the dossier and Christopher Steele's credibility."

      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, if the Bureau is going to send an informant in, the informant is going to be wired. And if the Bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there's going to be a transcript of that. And some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven't been made public. And I think one in particular is going -- it has the potential to actually persuade people. Very little on this Russia probe, I'm afraid, is going to persuade people who hate Trump or who love Trump, but there is some information in these transcripts that I think has the potential to be a game-changer, if it's ever made public."

And, Mr. Chairman, you just said a minute ago that one of the documents that we -- that Trey Gowdy perhaps was referring to was a document where George Papadopoulos, who was surveilled by the FBI, was talking with one of the intel sources. And I think it's an informant that came at him. And that was, of course, Halper in the U.K."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Yes. When we look at all of this, the fine work that actually Devin Nunes, John Ratcliffe, Jim Jordan, Matt Gaetz, and Trey Gowdy have done on this particular issue, actually will only be authenticated when we declassify some of these documents. And if indeed there are transcripts of George Papadopoulos indicating that not only was he not colluding with Russia, but that, indeed, he was being surveilled at the time -- you know, here is the interesting thing, Maria. We have Mr. Clapper, John Brennan, all of them saying, well, we can't get rid of sources and methods. And they're right. We need to protect those. But, at the same time, they're saying people weren't spied on. So you wouldn't have to protect sources and methods if indeed Trump associates weren't spied on by our government and others. And so I can think, as we start to put this forward, what -- as the American people will hopefully see, is indeed a lot of bias on behalf of just a few at the FBI."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, especially since what we're reading in the Mueller report are names like Kilimnik was supposed to be a Russian -- a Russian source. Now we find out that that was an agent of the State Department. Or Halper, who has worked with the State Department and the FBI for years, or Alexander Downer, the Australian, all of these people coincidentally, not, reached out to George Papadopoulos, as well as Carter Page, way before the July 16 official -- quote, unquote -- \"start\" of the investigation into Donald Trump. So here is George Papadopoulos with me a couple of weeks ago. When he told the firm that he was working for he wanted to go quit and work for the Trump campaign, they said, wait, before you quit, we want to send you to Rome, so you can meet this individual Joseph Mifsud. And Mifsud actually told him in secrecy that the Russians had Hillary Clinton e-mails. So the question is, was that entrapment? Was he an actual FBI source? Here is George Papadopoulos. Watch this."

      "utterance": "Well, it's the number one question I get asked back home in North Carolina and across the country. Will there be accountability? And I'm here to tell you this morning, the answer is yes. Bill Barr is serious about making sure that we reset and reestablish the reputation of the FBI and the Department of Justice. And I can tell you that, unless someone actually goes to jail, most of the people will think that accountability didn't happen.

Now we're being told maybe it's a little longer than that. What can you tell us, Michael Horowitz's report?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, only Michael Horowitz knows the exact time frame of when it's coming out. Obviously, the attorney general had indicated that he hoped to see it in June. I'm not as optimistic now. And one of the reasons for that is, additional information has been given to the inspector general for them to investigate. I would rather them get it right than get it fast. And I believe their whole team is doing a very good job in making sure that they hold those people accountable, like you just spoke about."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "OK, so it'll be a while, because he's gathering more information. And in terms of Mueller, do you want him to come down and testify? You saw him in his press conference last week. He said, I'm done. The report speaks for itself."

      "speaker": "MEADOWS",

I believe that Andrew Weissmann, who was actually involved in some of the early work at the FBI and DOJ when they were first starting with Peter Strzok and Bruce Ohr and them, you know, he came on. I think his fingerprint is all over this particular Mueller report. And, from my perspective, it's a one-sided report that doesn't give the privilege of a cross-examination. So, if they come, they need to be prepared to be cross-examined with the facts, which would paint a very different picture on behalf of this president, and give credence to why he has been so upset with the ongoing investigation."

But I'm all for transparency. Let's get everything out there. And I believe, at the end of the day, when transparency happens, a number of people will start to understand that this president wasn't only innocent, but he was right in being able to elevate this to the position he has been."

      "utterance": "So, when you spoke with Mr. Kilimnik, for example, or when you spoke with Mr. Halper, for example, were you under the impression that you were getting information for the State Department and the CIA and the FBI at that time? Were you -- you had no idea that you were actually being surveilled? PAGE: Yes, absolutely. To the best of my recollection, I don't think I ever crossed paths with Kilimnik. But I know I had a longstanding relationship with Professor Halper. And we will see. Again, I always believe in innocent until proven guilty. But I -- this was -- my conversations with him intensified right in the month before my illegitimate FISA warrant in September 2016, when all these defamatory articles are being placed by the DNC. And, you know, essentially, all of my relationships with people in the Trump campaign and in the Trump transition team and then early into the first months of the administration were all essentially underground. It was always sort of behind the scenes. And Professor Halper was being very positive. And he was like a -- sort of a Harriet Tubman figure of -- he understands sort of the injustices of my - - or he presented himself as understanding that. And I sort of trusted him. And if this is true, again, I don't -- what -- it's sad about the FBI, because they haven't admitted anything yet. I mean, there are these ridiculous statements that there's no spying, et cetera. But we will have to wait and see."

And, suddenly, somebody puts your name in a Yahoo News article that you are a Trump campaign figure perhaps colluding with these Russian individuals who you were actually getting information for, for the CIA?"

      "utterance": "Welcome back. And we are back with former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign Carter Page. Carter, the reason I'm asking you about these individuals who were named in the Mueller report is because many congressmen have come on this program, lawmakers, have said, once you prove that some of these people who reached out to you were actually assets of the FBI, of the State Department of the CIA, that blows up the whole idea that these were just, you know, coincidences. They came -- I'm talking of people like Stefan Halper. I'm talking of people like Steven Schrage. Steven Schrage is one individual that you haven't really spoken about before. But he invited you to that Cambridge conference, didn't he?"

      "speaker": "PAGE",

      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "... the Democrats in Congress and the Democrats on this fake Mueller commission were sort of pushing this false narrative. And every time we talked about anything dossier-related or anything, you know, U.S. intelligence assets coming after us-related they immediately tried to shift the subject."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Isn't it quite extraordinary that you had so many international friends of the State Department, of the CIA that were actually coming at you and at George Papadopoulos, I mean, Alexander Downer, Stefan Halper, Steven Schrage? These -- I mean, Downer, for example, was from Australia, the others from the U.K. And they're reaching out to you, talking about your consultancy business and how they -- tell me what they said to you."

      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, see, I don't recall ever getting contacted by Downer. I may have crossed paths with him at some point. To me, the bigger issue and the problem is less the fact that I'm having conversations with some people. That's completely benign. To the contrary, as I explained to Professor Halper and so many other people, including members of the FBI counterintelligence team, you know, I was getting these constant death threats or frequent death threats."
