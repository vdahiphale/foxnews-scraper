      "sentences": "All right, breaking tonight, official word now that the deputy national security advisor, Mira Ricardel is out. The first lady's office made it clear yesterday that she was on rocky ground, and we are now learning that John Bolton was in Asia, and unaware that the acts was about to fall on his second in line. And tonight, the homeland security secretary just wrapped up a tour on the border with the defense secretary. There may be an effort underway to keep her in her position. But the rumors are swirling, as they often do. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Sometimes it means the movie is coming, sometimes it doesn't. The president ignoring questions today about all of this at the White House this afternoon, and that is where our correspondent Leland Vittert stands by for us this evening. Hi, Leland. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The rumors about somebody being on the chopping block, or them actually being on the chopping block. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Kirstjen Nielsen, though, clearly is on very much shaky ground tonight.  President Trump speaking to The Daily Caller in an interview today. \"I will be making a decision on homeland,\" meaning, homeland security secretary, \"shortly. I have not made decision, yet. I will be making changes on various things.\" It's widely understood that the president is less than happy with how she is dealing with the caravan. The question remains over how long chief of staff John Kelly will remain in his post. Kelly and Nielsen are very close that same interview, when asked about Kelly, the president quickly responded, \"Always in an administration after the midterms, we make changes.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The leading public contender to replace Kelly is Nick Ayers, who currently serves as the vice president's chief of staff. Unclear what, if any, roll the first lady has playing in the staff shake-up. But despite her unambiguous statement yesterday about Mira Ricardel, of the National Security Council. Here's the statement, \"It is the position of the office of the first lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in the White House.\" Now, a source tells Fox News that the first lady was merely expressing her opinion, not calling on Ricardel to be fired. There was a reported falling out between the first lady's office and Ricardel over Mrs. Trump's recent trip to Africa. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The statement from the first lady's office came out while Ricardel's boss, national security advisor John Bolton, was out of the country. Adding to the chaos of such an unprecedented statement from the East Wing. From the West Wing this evening, in the past 45 minutes, \"Mira Ricardel will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the administration. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Martha, unclear what that role is going to be, and this has you wondering whose job at the White House is safe?

He then allegedly wrapped their bodies in tarps and place them under the porch before scrubbing the murder scene. The 6-foot 2, 280 pounds suspect has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors believe that recordings from an Amazon Echo inside the house may provide further clues about the killing. The court documents say there is probable cause, the recordings may include, quote, \"the attack and possible removal of the body from the kitchen.\" Police seized the Echo device when they secure the crime scene, but all of the recordings are stored on Amazon servers, so now New Hampshire judge has ordered Amazon to turn over two days of recordings, along with any information about cell phones that may have been linked to the smart speaker during that time period. Initially, Amazon pushed back, releasing a statement, saying, quote, \"Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand, properly served on us. Amazon objects to overboard or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.\" But because New Hampshire doesn't provide electronic access to court records, it remains unclear if the search warrant on Amazon has been served, or if Amazon complied. We can tell you, a few years ago, Amazon was also asked to turn over data from an Echo device found at a murder scene in Arkansas after first refusing, the company later agreed.

In a statement through his attorney, Avenatti is calling the claims bogus, quote, \"I've never been physically abusive in my life, nor was I last night. Any accusation to the contrary are fabricated, and meant to do harm to my reputation. I look forward to being fully exonerated,\" he says. Here now for Wednesday with Watters, Jesse Watters, co-host of \"The Five\" and host of \"Watters' World.\" He finds himself, Jesse, in a difficult position here tonight having given these kinds charges lots of airtime to other people, with the president, in particular, with regard to Stormy Daniels.

The first lady's office made it clear yesterday that she was on rocky ground, and we are now learning that John Bolton was in Asia, and unaware that the acts was about to fall on his second in line. And tonight, the homeland security secretary just wrapped up a tour on the border with the defense secretary. There may be an effort underway to keep her in her position. But the rumors are swirling, as they often do. Sometimes it means the movie is coming, sometimes it doesn't. The president ignoring questions today about all of this at the White House this afternoon, and that is where our correspondent Leland Vittert stands by for us this evening. Hi, Leland."

      "utterance": "Hey, Martha, as pointed out, oftentimes, it is so difficult to tell which comes first. The rumors about somebody being on the chopping block, or them actually being on the chopping block. Kirstjen Nielsen, though, clearly is on very much shaky ground tonight.  President Trump speaking to The Daily Caller in an interview today. \"I will be making a decision on homeland,\" meaning, homeland security secretary, \"shortly. I have not made decision, yet. I will be making changes on various things.\" It's widely understood that the president is less than happy with how she is dealing with the caravan. The question remains over how long chief of staff John Kelly will remain in his post. Kelly and Nielsen are very close that same interview, when asked about Kelly, the president quickly responded, \"Always in an administration after the midterms, we make changes.\" The leading public contender to replace Kelly is Nick Ayers, who currently serves as the vice president's chief of staff. Unclear what, if any, roll the first lady has playing in the staff shake-up. But despite her unambiguous statement yesterday about Mira Ricardel, of the National Security Council. Here's the statement, \"It is the position of the office of the first lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in the White House.\" Now, a source tells Fox News that the first lady was merely expressing her opinion, not calling on Ricardel to be fired. There was a reported falling out between the first lady's office and Ricardel over Mrs. Trump's recent trip to Africa. The statement from the first lady's office came out while Ricardel's boss, national security advisor John Bolton, was out of the country. Adding to the chaos of such an unprecedented statement from the East Wing. From the West Wing this evening, in the past 45 minutes, \"Mira Ricardel will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the administration. Martha, unclear what that role is going to be, and this has you wondering whose job at the White House is safe? You are not alone among those even who work in the West Wing."

It tells me she went to the president, he didn't do it, and yet, she still had to go public. That's chaotic."

I think it also is very telling that this comes roughly a month after she took this trip into Africa. And it may be more about the aftermath. I mean, they may be squabbling about a seat on an airplane, it was one of the reports. But, how that went down, and what did and did not happen? If somebody wasn't truthful or if somebody was maybe exaggerating what happened, or changing their story, you -- very quickly, in a small office like the West Wing, you start to understand that maybe that gets out of the skin of somebody. So, I, I think Melania Trump, I think she has earned the trust of so many of us because she does speak so infrequently to make this hard stand. And make such a statement is very compelling, and I think it's probably best, that they separate and go in different ways."

And as Leland rightly pointed out in his intro here, sometimes there are stories that get out there because other people want other people to be fired. So they start saying nasty things about them, and you know, time will tell."

And to Jason's point, we don't really know what happened aboard that flight or on that two-week trip. But obviously, the first lady was extremely displeased with her interactions with this woman. Bloomberg is also reporting this evening that she had a bad reputation for being inflexible within the West Wing. And when you think about how chaotic and kind of fly by the seat of their pants this administration is, her kind of more George Bush type approach to working in the West Wing that is where she came from originally a few years back with Ari, I guess. It might not have fit in with the vibe of this White House generally. And not -- it not just been a problem that Melania had with her."

And in Washington, the vacuum was filled by nothing but nastiness and negativity. But if you announce X is out Y is in. You've now created debate over the qualifications of Y.  Typically that's a stronger better debate for you to be involved in. So, make whatever moves you want to make.

To your question that you posed to Jason about what else she could have done, I think that the president has not enjoyed some of her media appearances, like whether our own Chris Wallace, where he really pressured her about the caravan. Talking about the women and the babies who are in there. And the president's language that these are MS-13 members, gang members, there are drug trafficking, they're bringing an infestation, et cetera. She also struggled during the family separation policy, not her first outing, but when she had to come out again and face the press on this issue he apparently refers to her as bushy. He has problems with members of the George W. Bush administration. And I think that he might be looking at someone like a Crisco badge. And if I'm pronouncing that properly, from Kansas, who didn't win his race, someone that's a hardliner on immigration who also shares his point of view about voter fraud which has been debunked. So, I think that he is looking for someone who is more hardline if he is going to be replacing her."

The federal government plans to paint El Chapo as the leader of the feared and infamous Sinaloa Drug Cartel which spanned continents and triggered waves of bloodshed murdering enemies and family members alike.  El Chapo was said to have armed his men with assault rifles while he himself carried a gold-plated AK-47 and a diamond-encrusted handgun. But the defense says Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman was the leader of noting, that his reputation as a drug kingpin is a myth, an urban legend, pointing out that even with Guzman and prison, cocaine continues flooding into the U.S. at impressive levels.

In 2001, while serving a 20-year sentence in Mexico, El Chapo broke out of a prison by hiding in a laundry cart. He was recaptured in 2014 only to escape again in 2015 through a hole in his cell, that led -- that mile-long tunnel you referred to, it just happened to have a motorcycle waiting. Experts say the tunnel took at least a year to build and clearly had inside help, a benefit of having a $14 billion empire.

We now have people that are literally many days drive away, and we have more women incarcerated than ever before, more mothers, so that is, I think, something that almost everyone would agree on. It also has, as he was saying, more opportunities for people, while they are incarcerated, to get training, to get drug and alcohol rehabilitation, to anger management, mental health, all of these things that would give people possibilities for basically redemption, when they get out. Ways to have a job, and hopefully a lot less recidivism.

The fact that the Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed this bill, the sheriff's associations, we have a whole host of law enforcement groups that are behind this bill. Because it makes our system more effective. We do need to free up a bad space for people who are truly violent and who are truly a danger, and we have so many people now that are caught up in these low-level, nonviolent offenses, that are literally serving decades of time.

He then allegedly wrapped their bodies in tarps and place them under the porch before scrubbing the murder scene. The 6-foot 2, 280 pounds suspect has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors believe that recordings from an Amazon Echo inside the house may provide further clues about the killing. The court documents say there is probable cause, the recordings may include, quote, \"the attack and possible removal of the body from the kitchen.\" Police seized the Echo device when they secure the crime scene, but all of the recordings are stored on Amazon servers, so now New Hampshire judge has ordered Amazon to turn over two days of recordings, along with any information about cell phones that may have been linked to the smart speaker during that time period. Initially, Amazon pushed back, releasing a statement, saying, quote, \"Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand, properly served on us. Amazon objects to overboard or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.\" But because New Hampshire doesn't provide electronic access to court records, it remains unclear if the search warrant on Amazon has been served, or if Amazon complied. We can tell you, a few years ago, Amazon was also asked to turn over data from an Echo device found at a murder scene in Arkansas after first refusing, the company later agreed. But experts say it's a fine line, because tech companies want their smart speakers to be helpful assistance, not unwanted sooks. Martha?"

      "utterance": "Because these devices are on in so many homes across America now, and Amazon downloads the information and uses it for advertising purposes. So, they have these recordings of what's been said. Talk to me about the prosecutor's desire to have this one and to have the information uploaded for them."

      "utterance": "I get their desire to want to get it. They need to prove a brutal double homicide case. The problem is, the argument that Amazon is making, well, it's overbroad, it's invasive, it is a violation of privacy. They are on a fishing expedition. And if I'm making the argument on behalf of Amazon, which I'm not, but if I was, I'd say, the only time that the recording kick on is when you say the wake word, Alexa. So what leads prosecutors to believe that at any point, the alleged murderer said Alexa, and then said maybe things like how do you get rid of bloodstains? How do you dispose of bodies? Why do they believe that recordings will provide evidence to prove this double homicide case?"

You know, the difference is that -- how is this different than asking for phone records? Or asking for anything else that could have been relevant? You know, if the phone, I mean, there's a million scenarios that you could go through that, I think would point to the idea that if that -- if it picked up anything, he's pled not guilty, if this picked up anything that could incriminate him, then that's information that the jury really should have, no?"

But this is not about just this guy. This is about potentially his neighbors, it's about us, it's about precedent. Where then, law enforcement, can then take this ruling and then say, you know what, maybe anyone on the block, for some reason, might have something, we want everybody's recording devices. I don't want to give up my recording devices. I don't want to give up my laptop, I don't want to give my phone. That's why Apple--"

He's been arrested. We understand that he could be moments away -- no, I'm sorry, we are waiting for the mug shot to be released. I don't think he is going to be released at this, just moments away, but we are going to bring you the latest on this case. It is an abuse case brought by the prosecutor as a felony charge. Those are the details we know so far. Jesse Watters after the break and more on that."

      "utterance": "A rather shocking development tonight in the Michael Avenatti story, the attorney who who has been all over everything for the past year, I would say, he is the attorney for Stormy Daniels, very out storm outspoken critic of President Trump. The Los Angeles Police Department has confirmed now that he has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. In a statement through his attorney, Avenatti is calling the claims bogus, quote, \"I've never been physically abusive in my life, nor was I last night. Any accusation to the contrary are fabricated, and meant to do harm to my reputation. I look forward to being fully exonerated,\" he says. Here now for Wednesday with Watters, Jesse Watters, co-host of \"The Five\" and host of \"Watters' World.\" He finds himself, Jesse, in a difficult position here tonight having given these kinds charges lots of airtime to other people, with the president, in particular, with regard to Stormy Daniels. And now he finds himself arrested in a Los Angeles police precinct. And we understand, we're waiting for a mugshot to be released, and when that's released, we will put it up for you."

      "utterance": "He is innocent until proven guilty. I'm going to give him more benefit of a doubt than he gave Kavanaugh. If you look at the statement, he said that it's almost the exact same thing that Kavanaugh said, these allegations are totally bogus. But that's not the way that he treated Kavanaugh. He didn't listen to that at all. If you ask me, I believe his 15 minutes are up. I think, at the end of this, if he is guilty, he is either going to be bankrupt or in prison. I mean, he has read in this lawsuit into fame, then parlayed into a presidential run, he's being investigated for lying to the Senate, judge ruled he has millions to his business partners. Now he is in the middle of a felony domestic beef, that he could go away for a long time. He's got a nasty divorce situation, as well. It is all spiraling out of control for him. He has this luxurious lifestyle that he can't handle at this point, and is spread way too thin. I think the world is crumbling beneath him right now. And all of those networks that put him on all year and help to prop him up, they have to feel a little bit icky right now if this is actually true."

      "utterance": "You know, the early suggestion -- great point. The early suggestion was that it was his wife, who you pointed out, he is going through a divorce, but then she came out, because TMZ said it was his wife. She came out and said to a reporter -- that she hasn't seen Michael in months. She says it's a complete fabrication. She said bruises on my face, it's insanity, he wouldn't hit anybody, especially a woman, he's got two daughters. That's according to his ex-wife. And we take him again, to note that this is an accusation, and that's all we have at this point with regard to Michael Avenatti."

His campaign slogan is going to be she hit me first, because that's actually what he said, there is this quote that's been documented that said \"she hit me first.\" I don't if that's TMZ the source. But if any of this is even close to true, and he laid his hands on a woman, he is toast. I mean, that is one of the most despicable things you can do, especially coming from someone that's supposed to empower women. I mean, he has been saying all along that, this porn star Stormy Daniels needs to be believed and supported, and he is helping her. He is not helping anybody when he touches a woman like that. But we're going to have to wait until the facts come out, obviously, and see how it plays out. It could've been a set up, it could have been a misunderstanding, or it could have been true. We don't know."

I don't even think she's got a shot at all. Think about it. Her match up against Donald Trump, all of her weaknesses, the fainting, she is crooked, the lack of sincerity, the lack of charisma, that's all Donald Trump's strength."
