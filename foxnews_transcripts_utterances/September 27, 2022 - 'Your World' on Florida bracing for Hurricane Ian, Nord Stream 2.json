You're looking live at Key West, Florida, where rough surf from Ian has already churned up. Soon, the National Hurricane Center will provide an update on Ian's strength and path. It does seem to be changing. Right now, it's projected to hit Florida as at least a Category 3 storm. Major airports are closing. Tampa International will suspend operations in about an hour. Orlando will be doing the same at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow. And the city of Tampa will be issuing a curfew soon and suspending emergency operations when winds hit at least 40 miles an hour. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor will be here joining us live. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And they are battening down the hatches, as they say, and preparing for the worst, hoping that it won't be that bad. But, right now, this storm, well, it looks very bad. And doesn't Max Gorden know it, of course, from the FOX Weather Center. He's in Saint Petersburg, Florida, with more -- Max.",

All those people need to get out as soon as they can. Right now, we're standing in Evacuation Zone A. So, the scene behind us is expected to change very drastically over the next day or so. Now, all of Florida is under a state of emergency, all 67 counties. And thousands of National Guard members are here in the state ready to respond when this storm makes landfall; 26 school districts have announced school closures across the state. And, in some cases, schools will be used as shelters in the Tampa area. Food, water, generators and pumps are all being staged before landfall. Power outages will be likely when this storm hits. And Governor Ron DeSantis says that restoring power is going to be a top priority. Here in Pinellas County, Duke Energy says they're staging crews. And they updated their power grid with new technology that reroutes power around problem areas to prevent mass outages, though trees falling into lines with high winds and floodwaters are all going to be big concerns. As this storm draws near, people have been scrambling for supplies. Some gas stations have run out of fuel, and drinking water has been snatched off of store shelves. Hardware stores are packed with people buying generators and plywood to board up their homes. And many people told us, after they cover their windows, they are going to get out.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Neil, very small changes, and there's time that there still will likely be some of those small changes. But it's holding steady and holding strong as far as the strength goes, still a Category 3 hurricane, 120-mile-an-hour winds lifting closer and closer up to Florida. You still see the strongest right to the north end of this and off to the northeastern side of the storm, but those outer bands really beginning to fall, yes, across Key West and then lifting into portions of Southern Florida. Those red polygons are tornado warned storms. We got a tornado watch across this entire region. This typically happens on this side of the storm, and this will likely live to the north as the hurricane itself continues to work its way up the coast. Even if you're not right along the western coast, you're going to be dealing with this system. Pretty much the entire state has some sort of tropical storm or hurricane advisory currently in place besides the Panhandle, as this is going to be slowly drifting that direction. Here is our current hurricane track. And what you have noticed is perhaps just a slight drop to the south or to the east with this potential model. There you are Wednesday morning getting close to the shore. And then, by Thursday morning, you certainly have run onshore, bringing some of those very strong winds. You can pay attention to the time stamp in the corner. This is taking to landfall, a little south now of Tampa, again, just a forecast model. But that's getting into tomorrow evening, taking you into tomorrow morning, a lot of really powerful winds there. The system really slows down. So you see those winds for a very long time. Obviously, that's going to take out a ton of power. When you talk about the ground being absolutely saturated, trees fall down a little bit easier. And then I think probably still the biggest concern is going to be the storm surge. And wherever this storm ultimately makes landfall, it's going to be just to the south of that, where the storm surge is at the worst, because those are where the winds are at the strongest. So, currently, we're looking at Naples, Fort Myers, up to Sarasota, perhaps as much as 10 feet of water, Neil, going to be pushed up on shore, and that could very likely be the most devastating impact of this system. Of course, we will be watching it as it makes those little moves to the north or south in the next day.",

About three million Floridians in 10 counties up and down the state are now under a mandatory evacuation. And here in Pass-a-Grille, which is in southern Pinellas County, that's certainly one of the places. This is Zone A right on the Gulf of Mexico. And this is exactly what leaders of the state and the counties want to see, most people heeding the advice, leaving town, heading inland to higher ground for safety. To do that, of course, you do need that gasoline, gold these days. And for the past few days, they have seen a surge of demand at all gas stations, long lines of cars and trucks. And, often, you will find there's no gasoline left at that spot, so you go looking for another one. The governor says, so far, there's been no supply chain issues and fuel trucks are basically driving 24/7 at this point. He's also waived all tolls to encourage people to drive to safety. And as hurricane --hardened Floridians expect to loss power, with everything closed and nothing open, they have been hitting their grocery stores, stocking up on all the essentials, nonperishable foods and plenty of water. The longstanding advice in Florida is have a hurricane kit with enough supplies to last you a week. Utilities like Florida Power and Light are also prepositioning fleets of bucket trucks to restore power as fast as they can. In Pass-a-Grille night and this morning, last-minute shuttering went up here to protect these businesses in this quaint beach town, everyone well aware that today's your last chance before the deluge of rain and winds intensify all day Wednesday.",

The National Hurricane Center is set to provide an update on Ian's strength and path, hasn't really been changed that much, might be pivoting slightly to the right, the reason why Miami-Dade County now is under these emergency orders as well. But, as you can see, it is a massive storm. And Floridians who have not seen something like this since 2017 back with Irma, this is a relatively new sight for them as well, to say nothing of the millions who have come to Florida and made it the third most populous state in the country, certainly behind California and Texas. But those 22 million residents are all under the eye of this -- of this storm. So we will keep you posted on that. Keeping you posted on some developments half-a-world away amid some unusual developments with a pipeline that connects Germany and Russia and a host of other players, the Nord Stream pipeline that some say is spilling a leak, but it might be more. Well, it looks curious, to put it mildly, that it might be sabotage. General Jack Keane joins us right now, what he makes of these developments. Out of nowhere, this gas leak has prompted talk that there was nothing wrong with it until this friction with Russia built over what was shut down and how long it was shut down, and now this. What do you make of it, General?",

But now they're supposedly a couple of leaks, particularly in No. 1 in the Danish and Swedish area. And the people who have looked at it are quite suspicious of it, thinking it may indeed be sabotage. We'd probably be dismissive of something like that if Mr. Putin wasn't a player here. And given he -- the fact that he is, and certainly that he wants to put pressure on Europe as the winter's coming, he wants them to get shut down in terms of energy supplies, and certainly his intent is to sort of break their will somewhat because of the suffering of their people and curb their support for the Ukrainians. That's what this is about. That's why he's brandishing nuclear weapons, likely for the same reason, to reduce and minimize the support that the Ukrainians are receiving from arms and munitions, but also economic support and enforcing the sanctions. He's always -- Putin has always been of the mind, Neil, that, at some point, the Europeans will buckle, their self-interest will prevail, as they have in the past, and they will cut off to some degree the support for Ukraine. He's counting on that to happen. It's part of his strategy. But, listen, surprisingly, the E.U. has held together here, NATO, writ large, has pretty much held together. Of course, the United States and Britain have provided 75 percent of the support word, but, nonetheless, the Europeans have shown some resolve and determination, the exception being the Germans and French.",

He said: \"General, I just want you to know that we're fighting a war, as far as we're concerned, with Russia that we thought we're going to fight a number of years down the road. \"And Ukrainians are doing -- fighting the war, and we're giving them tanks and fighting vehicles from our operational units.

You're looking live at Key West, Florida, where rough surf from Ian has already churned up. Soon, the National Hurricane Center will provide an update on Ian's strength and path. It does seem to be changing. Right now, it's projected to hit Florida as at least a Category 3 storm. Major airports are closing. Tampa International will suspend operations in about an hour. Orlando will be doing the same at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow. And the city of Tampa will be issuing a curfew soon and suspending emergency operations when winds hit at least 40 miles an hour. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor will be here joining us live. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And they are battening down the hatches, as they say, and preparing for the worst, hoping that it won't be that bad. But, right now, this storm, well, it looks very bad.

All those people need to get out as soon as they can. Right now, we're standing in Evacuation Zone A. So, the scene behind us is expected to change very drastically over the next day or so. Now, all of Florida is under a state of emergency, all 67 counties. And thousands of National Guard members are here in the state ready to respond when this storm makes landfall; 26 school districts have announced school closures across the state. And, in some cases, schools will be used as shelters in the Tampa area. Food, water, generators and pumps are all being staged before landfall. Power outages will be likely when this storm hits. And Governor Ron DeSantis says that restoring power is going to be a top priority. Here in Pinellas County, Duke Energy says they're staging crews. And they updated their power grid with new technology that reroutes power around problem areas to prevent mass outages, though trees falling into lines with high winds and floodwaters are all going to be big concerns. As this storm draws near, people have been scrambling for supplies. Some gas stations have run out of fuel, and drinking water has been snatched off of store shelves. Hardware stores are packed with people buying generators and plywood to board up their homes. And many people told us, after they cover their windows, they are going to get out."

      "speaker": "ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, very small changes, and there's time that there still will likely be some of those small changes. But it's holding steady and holding strong as far as the strength goes, still a Category 3 hurricane, 120-mile-an-hour winds lifting closer and closer up to Florida. You still see the strongest right to the north end of this and off to the northeastern side of the storm, but those outer bands really beginning to fall, yes, across Key West and then lifting into portions of Southern Florida. Those red polygons are tornado warned storms. We got a tornado watch across this entire region. This typically happens on this side of the storm, and this will likely live to the north as the hurricane itself continues to work its way up the coast. Even if you're not right along the western coast, you're going to be dealing with this system. Pretty much the entire state has some sort of tropical storm or hurricane advisory currently in place besides the Panhandle, as this is going to be slowly drifting that direction. Here is our current hurricane track. And what you have noticed is perhaps just a slight drop to the south or to the east with this potential model. There you are Wednesday morning getting close to the shore. And then, by Thursday morning, you certainly have run onshore, bringing some of those very strong winds. You can pay attention to the time stamp in the corner. This is taking to landfall, a little south now of Tampa, again, just a forecast model. But that's getting into tomorrow evening, taking you into tomorrow morning, a lot of really powerful winds there. The system really slows down. So you see those winds for a very long time. Obviously, that's going to take out a ton of power. When you talk about the ground being absolutely saturated, trees fall down a little bit easier. And then I think probably still the biggest concern is going to be the storm surge. And wherever this storm ultimately makes landfall, it's going to be just to the south of that, where the storm surge is at the worst, because those are where the winds are at the strongest. So, currently, we're looking at Naples, Fort Myers, up to Sarasota, perhaps as much as 10 feet of water, Neil, going to be pushed up on shore, and that could very likely be the most devastating impact of this system. Of course, we will be watching it as it makes those little moves to the north or south in the next day."

      "utterance": "Absolutely, Neil. I went to two gas stations this morning. One had no gas. The other one fortunately did. About three million Floridians in 10 counties up and down the state are now under a mandatory evacuation. And here in Pass-a-Grille, which is in southern Pinellas County, that's certainly one of the places. This is Zone A right on the Gulf of Mexico. And this is exactly what leaders of the state and the counties want to see, most people heeding the advice, leaving town, heading inland to higher ground for safety. To do that, of course, you do need that gasoline, gold these days. And for the past few days, they have seen a surge of demand at all gas stations, long lines of cars and trucks. And, often, you will find there's no gasoline left at that spot, so you go looking for another one. The governor says, so far, there's been no supply chain issues and fuel trucks are basically driving 24/7 at this point. He's also waived all tolls to encourage people to drive to safety. And as hurricane --hardened Floridians expect to loss power, with everything closed and nothing open, they have been hitting their grocery stores, stocking up on all the essentials, nonperishable foods and plenty of water. The longstanding advice in Florida is have a hurricane kit with enough supplies to last you a week. Utilities like Florida Power and Light are also prepositioning fleets of bucket trucks to restore power as fast as they can. In Pass-a-Grille night and this morning, last-minute shuttering went up here to protect these businesses in this quaint beach town, everyone well aware that today's your last chance before the deluge of rain and winds intensify all day Wednesday."

Discovery Cove is also scheduled to close and will reschedule, refund reservations for those who might have booked online and don't know where they're going to go now.

So, they're following in the footsteps of Tampa's international airport. That's going to close. Less than an hour from now, at 5:00 tonight. And I'm told Jacksonville Airport officials are going to be discussing their next move probably right now. Southwest Florida International Airport and Fort Myers, though, still operating as normal. Meanwhile, on the roads, there's traffic building. When you look around, millions of people in the state are preparing for what's to come. No rain here in Orlando yet, but things will look a lot different in 24 hours. There are mandatory evacuation orders in more than a dozen counties in the state. And people who live in Tampa today waited hours to get some free sandbags to try and help them protect their homes from that floodwater damage we have been talking about.

For example, officials at Clearwater- Saint Petersburg Airport have already shut down operations earlier today, not nearly as big as Tampa, of course. And Port Tampa Bay, of course, a popular shipping destination, already has closed its maritime interest and anything having to do with that. And this is happening as we roll through the state and it prepares for whatever is down the pike.

The National Hurricane Center is set to provide an update on Ian's strength and path, hasn't really been changed that much, might be pivoting slightly to the right, the reason why Miami-Dade County now is under these emergency orders as well. But, as you can see, it is a massive storm. And Floridians who have not seen something like this since 2017 back with Irma, this is a relatively new sight for them as well, to say nothing of the millions who have come to Florida and made it the third most populous state in the country, certainly behind California and Texas. But those 22 million residents are all under the eye of this -- of this storm. So we will keep you posted on that. Keeping you posted on some developments half-a-world away amid some unusual developments with a pipeline that connects Germany and Russia and a host of other players, the Nord Stream pipeline that some say is spilling a leak, but it might be more. Well, it looks curious, to put it mildly, that it might be sabotage. General Jack Keane joins us right now, what he makes of these developments. Out of nowhere, this gas leak has prompted talk that there was nothing wrong with it until this friction with Russia built over what was shut down and how long it was shut down, and now this.

But now they're supposedly a couple of leaks, particularly in No. 1 in the Danish and Swedish area. And the people who have looked at it are quite suspicious of it, thinking it may indeed be sabotage. We'd probably be dismissive of something like that if Mr. Putin wasn't a player here. And given he -- the fact that he is, and certainly that he wants to put pressure on Europe as the winter's coming, he wants them to get shut down in terms of energy supplies, and certainly his intent is to sort of break their will somewhat because of the suffering of their people and curb their support for the Ukrainians. That's what this is about. That's why he's brandishing nuclear weapons, likely for the same reason, to reduce and minimize the support that the Ukrainians are receiving from arms and munitions, but also economic support and enforcing the sanctions. He's always -- Putin has always been of the mind, Neil, that, at some point, the Europeans will buckle, their self-interest will prevail, as they have in the past, and they will cut off to some degree the support for Ukraine. He's counting on that to happen. It's part of his strategy. But, listen, surprisingly, the E.U. has held together here, NATO, writ large, has pretty much held together. Of course, the United States and Britain have provided 75 percent of the support word, but, nonetheless, the Europeans have shown some resolve and determination, the exception being the Germans and French."

You raised a very good point.

We're depleting our units, because we have the opportunity to defeat the Russian army in Ukraine.

But Lee Carter with us right now, Republican pollster, on what happened here, because I know allegiances vary by the day and maybe the polls, Lee, but this is a quick turnaround here, some friction that right now Senator Manchin is getting from both sides.

He is trying to move a little bit more to the middle. And we're seeing with Republicans right now, they're trying to talk more about their Commitment to America. They're putting forward a much more clear plan. I think they're going to try to say -- and one of the things they say is, hold us accountable. They're going to work across the aisle to get things done. So I think there needs to be evidence the they're going to do that with more people than just the one that they have often -- they have often gone to, which is Joe Manchin.

So I think this is just something that people want to see more of, perhaps we're going to see more of. Maybe that's naive of me. But I do think that the Republicans are starting to get the message right now. That's enough talking about how bad the Democrats are. It's time for our people to come together in favor of Americans, rather than against each other. And so perhaps this is the first step, or perhaps it's a big snub to Joe Manchin.

The Senate is a little dicey. Maybe this Kabuki theater around Manchin is a signal of how Republicans plan to play that, but the economy has begun to emerge as a big issue, even these market falls. We were down another 125 points today, Lee, and that, even though the president likes to insist that he doesn't obsess over the markets, even those in his party urge him now and then to give them a peek, and that that is going to be an issue for Democrats to deal with in the midterms.

All around us, no matter what it is, Americans are feeling like the economy is terrible. And 90 percent of Americans are saying they feel it in their pocketbook, and something needs to be done. Now, the flip side of that is, 65 percent of women are concerned about the rights of women, not just because of Roe vs. Wade, but because that has now become one of the mantras. So what is going to galvanize voters? And I think we have got to look at this state by state, because that's really how this is going to be played out in the midterms. We don't really have a huge swoop like we did in 2018. Everybody was rallied around health care as the issue we needed to address. We have a split here. Is it going to be about the pocketbook, or is it going to be about women's rights? And I think the Democrats are trying to make this very much about women's rights. Republicans are trying to make it about the economy, but they are rightfully trying to make it about more than that. They have a four -- they have a four-pronged policy. We're going to see how much that plays out. Is it going to get enough play? And is it going to be enough? Because we're getting close now. We're in the homestretch here, with just a few weeks to go until those midterms happen.

It was coupled by massive amounts of fiscal spending too, particularly by the Biden administration, in the face of all this. That no doubt created inflation. But there's nothing -- listen, if your job is to get rid of inflation and you have a sort of restrictive fiscal policy out of the Biden administration, in the sense that it's raising taxes, trying to raise taxes on rich people, it's spending a ton of money, but, on top of that, it's not really -- it's not loosening up on regulations, there's only one game in town to get rid of inflation.
