Now, the concern about that is somewhat mitigated by what's going on in Europe, where they're literally shutting down portions of France, and you have got curfews in effect in Ireland, where shutdowns are being reimplemented amid the spike in cases there, bars and restaurants in a good part of the United Kingdom also being shuttered, in the face of spikes that are much more severe on a percentage basis than what's going on in this country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, again, an optimistic tone sounded by the CDC and the health and human services sector secretary, Alex Azar, hinting of potential remedies, maybe on a limited basis, by the end of this year. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They also outlined an aggressive rollout of vaccines in the early part of next year.

He's the hospital chairman of medicine there. Doctor, what do you think of what they're stating here?

And following a whirlwind of developments not only on vaccines and potential remedies, but concerns with the virus itself, which, for three days running now in this country has been seeing a spike in cases of more than 60,000 over the last 72 hours per day, on average. Now, the concern about that is somewhat mitigated by what's going on in Europe, where they're literally shutting down portions of France, and you have got curfews in effect in Ireland, where shutdowns are being reimplemented amid the spike in cases there, bars and restaurants in a good part of the United Kingdom also being shuttered, in the face of spikes that are much more severe on a percentage basis than what's going on in this country. But, again, an optimistic tone sounded by the CDC and the health and human services sector secretary, Alex Azar, hinting of potential remedies, maybe on a limited basis, by the end of this year. They also outlined an aggressive rollout of vaccines in the early part of next year. They have committed billions of dollars to this effort, particularly with AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, that could put them in many more than 100 million hands in the early part of next year. Again, the numbers and sort of the data is still a little dicey on this. But they're optimistic something could be had, and soon. The read on all of this from Dr. Bob Lahita of St. Joseph University. He's the hospital chairman of medicine there. Doctor, what do you think of what they're stating here? They're not limiting what or minimizing the threat that remains, warning people, continue wearing marks, do all the proper things, wash your hands, something that you have been saying on and on. But they're hopeful, they're hopeful that something could be coming down the pike, even in a limited use, in emergency use, by the end of the year. Do you think that's true?"

People are fatigued. They're tired. My patients here that I have been seeing are exhausted. They're tired of washing their hands and wearing masks and keeping socially distant. But you know what? The good news is, there's light at the end of the tunnel. I'm really excited about what I just heard from Dr. Redfield and the secretary about our vaccine. And I said it was going to be available hopefully by Christmas, it'd be our big Christmas gift, but maybe a little bit after. But, nevertheless, the first part of 2021, we're all going to line up and get our injections. I'm excited, Neil."

We're later told -- and this is a Bloomberg report -- that that person was not taking the drug. So, it could have been placebo or something else. Do you know anything about it?

And when you have such a large number of people, you're going to have people die, just as you do in a city or town that's got 50,000 people. There are going to be so many deaths per day. So these kinds of deaths are not terribly alarming, provided they're not associated with some side effect of the vaccine. That's number one. Number two, the fact that they're looking very carefully at everybody who succumbs from something like, say, heart disease or that catches a case of pneumonia that has nothing to do with the vaccine, that's good news. Everybody is watching. And we have that case, remember, the AstraZeneca case in the U.K., which was a demyelinating condition, which, again, is expected in a certain number of people when you have such a huge phase three clinical trial -- Neil."

That's the way I interpreted it. What did you make of that?"

      "speaker": "LAHITA",

The vaccine, remember, will contribute greatly to the establishment of herd immunity. We have heard about -- we have heard about herd immunity since I have been talking about this pandemic. And herd immunity can only be achieved in two ways, massive infection, which is a disaster because of the number of deaths involved, or, secondly, the presence of a vaccine. So, yes, they're -- it's not going to cure the -- it's not going to cure the infection in those who already have it. But it is going to prevent the infection and those who do not have it and those who are at risk. And people are fatigued. They want to stop wearing masks, et cetera. This is good news, meaning that you have to keep wearing your mask and washing your hands. Things are going to get better as we go forward. And it's going to happen fast."

Well, there's a lot of stimulus, as you know, that's been addressed around this and a back- and-forth on a new effort right now to secure relief that goes on again, off again. But it looks very much on again, at least in the House. We're told that the talks that Speaker Pelosi had today with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on this relief -- quote -- \"brings us closer to being able to put pen to paper to write legislation.\" That is from the spokesman for Nancy Pelosi. But even if they solve differences there, there's still the matter the United States Senate and where things go there.

The big question now is really whether any money at all may ultimately make it into the pockets of the millions of Americans who are relying on additional stimulus in order to bridge the gap between now and then whenever the pandemic eventually begins to abate. Now, the White House is insisting today there is still action, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows emphasizing all the busywork that's going on behind the scenes. He says they're at $1.9 trillion. But we also know that they were in that neighborhood two weeks ago. He told Bill Hemmer last hour that the president is -- quote -- \"willing to lean into this.\" Now, the White House negotiating team is blaming Speaker Nancy Pelosi. They say she is trying to wait out President Trump. She's unwilling perhaps to hand him a deliverable before November 3. The path to a deal, though, in reality, we know is choked up on the Senate side as well. Republicans there are balking at the finger floated by President Trump himself.

I don't know, Neil, actually, whether the president himself has picked up the phone today. I have not seen any reporting that he has. But I will look into that and get back to you.

You know as well as I do that people in Washington have to be judged by what they do, not by what they say. Why doesn't she want another bill? I can only give you my opinion. She thinks it will help President Trump. She does not like President Trump. She is angry at President Trump. You can only be young once, but you can always be immature. I would like to see the speaker put aside her -- her feelings, fill out a hurt feelings report, and let us pass another bill to try to help the American people. We tried again today."

You have got Joe Biden, who has been studying up at his home in Delaware since Sunday night. His campaign has already called a lid, meaning no public movements, until the debate. And then you compare that to what we're seeing from President Trump. He has been holding rallies almost every single day, multiple campaign events, crisscrossing the country. And that really hasn't stopped since he got the all-clear from his doctors after his bout with COVID. The virus at the top of the list of topics that the moderator for tomorrow night -- the moderator released for tomorrow night's debate. The Trump campaign has been pushing for more of a focus on foreign policy. But if there is not, the president plans to bring it up anyway. He will also likely bring up Hunter Biden. He's really been talking about him at almost every single rally. And even though some Republicans, like Mike Huckabee, think it's a distraction, the White House and the Trump campaign disagree."

A lot of criticism of the president from the first debate, not so much for all the interruptions, and that they didn't work for him, but they robbed him of a chance to expose Biden, who had often some clumsy answers, that, if he were allowed to speak, would have illustrated the president's point.

The expected vote is -- there are some estimates north of 150 million people are going to vote totally. And so this is a huge opportunity; 73 million people tuned in to the first debate. That's just an enormous audience. And so the president is going to be wanting to make his points. And perhaps his advisers are going to prevail upon him to really focus on those points, as opposed to necessarily trying to interrupt Mr. Biden, and the other way around too. There was interruptions going both directions."

Other Republicans have been telling me the same, that the president has a convincing argument to make. How angry he is over all of this stuff, whether justified or not, he would be wasting time on obsessing over during the debate. What do you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUSSEY",
      "utterance": "Well, he's got some pretty good issues to take up with Biden. Biden's now talking his tax policy. It's going to raise taxes on wealthy households, not raise taxes immediately, at least, on middle-class tax -- households. So he could certainly talk that. But he will have some headwinds as well in the debate. The topics that have been chosen include COVID and the management or mismanagement of the national response to COVID, families in general, race, climate, national security, and leadership. So, he's going to face criticism from Biden, certainly, in several of those categories. But the tax issue is front and center now. Biden has put forward his plan. And you would think that the president would want to focus on that, but I'm sure -- I'm sure he's going to also take an opportunity to comment on the e-mails."

And it works into a theme of quiet Trump votes that are not reflected in these polls. Given the fact that some of the battleground states, not all, John, but certainly some, have narrowed a little bit, and that Minnesota could very well be a toss-up, a state that the president barely lost, but could have a chance of winning, what do you think of that, and how that is coming into play?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUSSEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's in play, Neil, because, look, there are some people -- a lot of people have made up their mind already. They made up their mind months ago. But there's always a small portion of the electorate that's busy and doesn't tune into the election until the last couple of weeks. And they figure, look, I'm going to wait until it all settles down after the primaries, after the big speeches, and I'm going to make my decision closer to the election. Well, that could happen here, too, and probably will happen. And it might be a small percentage of the electorate, but it's likely to be a fairly big number because of so many people turning out. So, both candidates -- I think that you're seeing this now with President Trump trying to expand or deepen turnout from his base, from his core base, and Vice President Biden attempting to expand his own base, and both of them, both of them are really sort of issuing the charge to their bases to come and vote, get out and vote. I think you're going to see that in the debate as well, direct camera appeals to voters, one way or another, get to the polls or send in your ballot by mail."

Now, here is the timetable to confirm Amy Coney Barrett as the 115th justice on the High Court. They will jettison her nomination from the Judiciary Committee sometime tomorrow afternoon after 1:00 Eastern time. They will put it on the floor starting on Friday. The Senate will likely be in session on Saturday and Sunday to debate the nomination. There will be a procedural vote to cut off a filibuster sometime on Sunday afternoon.

I'm sure Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell might slightly disagree with that. Congresswoman, very good to have you.

And I think that a lot of our caucus -- I'm one of them -- have been very clear that we have got a lot of people that need help. You know, we passed the first bill five months ago. We passed the second bill three months ago. She's stayed at the table. She's talked to him. The president has sent inconsistent messages about whether he wants a deal or doesn't want to deal. And, last night, when white smoke was coming out, and it looked like they may be close, Mitch McConnell poured water all over it and told the Senate conference yesterday he told the president he didn't want a bill before the election. I don't think any of us should be playing politics with this. I'm home. I'm careful, masked, distant, but listening to a lot of people scared and who need help.

And lower-income people have -- 40 percent of them have lost their jobs. They're worried. We have got a real food insecurity problem. People have a child care issue. They're having a hard time with their kids in school. They're looking to us to help them. And they really don't care about who's bickering with who. They expect us to do something to help."

At this point, I was saying that, totally, that I thought he would win Michigan. And I think that there are a lot of -- look, I'm blunt. I think a lot of people are just a pox on all of your houses. But, on the other hand, I'm also going to tell you that people are tired of drama. They are tired of people being pitted against each other. They want to see us come together.

You don't have a good piece of legislation if we can't get a lot of people to support it, to believe in it. We got to listen to each other.

But I am not happy, though, that the Senate is moving so quickly and not -- has had this double standard from what it did four years ago."

A traditionalist would keep things as they are, nine Supreme Court justices. Is -- in your gut, is that where you err right now? I know you're a congresswoman. And I'm not minimizing that, compared to the Senate, but it would be the Senate that decided something like that. Do you think that would be risky to do?"

And I think, Neil, that we do need to really, instead of float -- throwing -- that's a very fundamental change in our third branch of government, and there would need to be a very serious study about what the ramifications were and what it means. And I think all of us have to do that, all of us. Both parties need to understand what the implications would be."

      "utterance": "All right, now they're bringing in the big guns, former President Barack Obama at a forum right now on racism, going to be at an event later on in Philadelphia helping get his former vice president over the top to become the next president of the United States. All of this at a time when Goldman Sachs, the big brokerage firm, is saying the trend is Joe Biden's friend, predicting an election that could cause a blue wave that would spark a lot more green, economic stimulus through a lot of spending. They say that would -- that is, Goldman -- offset the effect of tax hikes. I don't know how my next guests feel about this, but let's see. Frances Newton Stacy joins us, John Layfield, good market reads, all. John, what do you make of that? Goldman Sachs is saying a blue wave, where Democrats run the table, take over everything, it's going to be stimulus like there is nobody's business, and deficits be damned, it is going to give the economy a major spark? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "It's hard to say. It's hard to quantify that. Joe Biden's campaign says they're going to create 10 million jobs. Moody's, which kind of leans toward Democrat candidate, says they're going to create 8.8 million. You're starting to already see it, say, in lithium and cobalt mining stocks, as far as the E.V. wave that's coming forward in solar stocks. You are going to see a lot of infrastructure spending. Whether that offsets the tax increase, President Biden certainly says so. Moody's says so. I think only time will tell."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Frances, Moody's saying something like that, Moody's has something to gain from a Democratic president, because they do a lot of spending, issue a lot of bonds. That's what they're in, the bond rating business. So, I would take that with a grain of salt. Having said that, though, Frances, I'm curious about the impact, because you raise taxes in any environment, maybe even this one, particularly this when, it could be dicey, no matter how much you're spending. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCES NEWTON STACY, OPTIMAL CAPITAL",
      "utterance": "That's true. And I don't think the Biden tax increases have been fully priced into the markets, as some are suspecting. And the reason for that is, we have no idea what balance sheets are going to look like coming out of COVID. We're not out of the woods yet. But rest assured, Neil, both parties will have no choice but to have a record amount of fiscal stimulus, because we have to paper over those deficits. And that's the way to do it. They're estimating that, in 10 years, Biden will spend $5.6 trillion and Trump will spend 5. That's pretty far apart. When it comes to you and me, that's a big number, but really relatively, over a decade, not as far apart as people think."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "John, the president says you can kiss your 401(k) goodbye if Joe Biden gets in. He's saying that all the tax-friendly environment, the low regulations, that all ends and so does your 401(k). What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAYFIELD",
      "utterance": "I don't agree with that. I think the market is going to be OK. I think the market is going to be OK because of the Fed. I'm not a fan of the tax increases. That's obviously going to hurt business. The spending will probably offset that, as far as how they keeps it economy in the market buoyant. But with the Fed as kind of accommodating as it is right now, I think the market will probably be OK."

      "speaker": "NEWTON STACY",
      "utterance": "Fifteen seconds. The market being OK is determined by how many of those loans in forbearance become defaults in credit markets. Neil, that's very deflationary."

As they were wrapping up here, we're getting word now that Senate Democrats plan to boycott tomorrow's Senate Judiciary vote on Amy Barrett. I don't know what that would mean and whether that would disrupt the vote. All Republicans would be voting, presumably, yes. No Democrats would be part of that process. We will see.
