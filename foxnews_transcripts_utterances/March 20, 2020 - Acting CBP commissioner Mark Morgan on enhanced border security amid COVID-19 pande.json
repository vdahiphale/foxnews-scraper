      "sentences": "Well, first, I have great respect for Doctor Fauci, his sacrifice for the country but when you hear something is just anecdotal, again aside from the clinical terminology, to most people and we're talking to most people in these press conferences, it just doesn't sound too hopeful or too impressive and anecdotal doesn't really describe the findings of the world's top researchers, who just a few days ago published results of their first study on hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. A lot of you probably have taken Z-packs over the years. Well, check out their findings. This is in a long study. Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated, the word significantly there with viral load reduction or disappearance in Covid-19 patients and it's effect is reinforced by azithromycin. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now look at this chart that accompanied the report. The blue line is the control group OK, say they took nothing so bad for them they all have the virus even after 6 days. The red represents those who received hydroxychloroquine so some improvement so only what is it, 40 percent or so still had the virus but look at the yellow line. Now the yellow line represents the patients at the end of day 5 only who were on a protocol that included hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Now the researchers in this study and they're all incredibly prominent epidemiologist and researchers, dozens and dozens. They understood when they undertook this project, they were tasked by the French government to do this. They understood the severity of the global crisis we're all facing and they also understood the risk to millions - millions of people around the world including our health care workers and they concluded as a result of all this thinking and what they looked at the following. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We therefore recommend that Covid-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the world. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, I understand that we want our own data that is a large controlled study, I understand that's necessary. And the Trump administration is 100 percent correct. At the same time and recognizing the benefits already reported in the use of this drug and the drug combo that we just mentioned. Now by the way hydroxychloroquine, lot of people don't understand this but it does not need to be approved by the FDA in order to be administered by doctors for off-label use because as I said before, we don't have to go over it but it's prescribed for anti-malarial use and also for lupus in some cases. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Our physicians are already using it in our major hospitals for Covid patients. They also used it successfully in some cases against SARS which had a higher mortality rate. The president as usual has sharp instincts. He sees things that sometimes the intellectuals and academics, they might get lost in some of the details but he has sharp instincts about things. And he's pushing to get millions of doses now into the United States. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Our doctors and our hospitals need all the ammo they can get to fight this disease. We want fewer people to need ventilators, right?

We need to get people home to quarantine if they're sick then we need after a necessary amount of time, we need to get those people healthy and back to work. As soon as they're medically cleared. Again, I respect all the professionals who are working on this and they're working ridiculous hours and I respect Doctor Fauci, an enormous amount. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I realize in an ideal world, we want everything buttoned up and as perfect as far as randomized trials go but our country needs solutions and hope now.

Hence the reason why hydroxychloroquine, an immunosuppressive agent is beneficial it by two mechanisms. Suppressing the immune response and number two, acting to suppress the replication of the virus. That's why the anti- inflammatory drugs you just mentioned before I came on, is working in China because it's cutting down what we call the cytokine storm, the inflammatory storm that the virus causes in the percentage of people and those are the people who go on to die. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So that's why you see that it's - it's the immune system that's causing most of the deaths. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The reason we are going into a deep recession, the reason why our economy is in free fall is because the communist Chinese regime was more interested in suppressing the truth than suppressing a virus. They - they knew as you pointed out, in December, they knew that there was human to human transmission because medical workers were getting sick but on January 14, the Chinese told the World Health Organization that there was no evidence of human to human transmission when they knew it wasn't true. Couple of days later, they had a banquet in Wuhan. Tens of thousands of families share - had a lunar new year banquet sharing food with each other and then they let 5 million people leave Wuhan province and travel all over China and spread this thing all over the world. So the reason we are in the situation right now, there was an - Axios reported this morning but there's a new study that found that if they had acted just three weeks earlier, 95 percent reduction in the number of cases would have been. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So we need to hold you know, we're about to spend $ 1 trillion to $2 trillion. We need to send the bill to Beijing for that. Donald Trump needs to tell the Chinese, you're paying for the damage to our economy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The Department of Defense, the V.A., Medicare, Medicaid, and others agencies purchase an immense amount of drugs, many of which, unfortunately, originate in China. In a few years, we're going to say that ends. There can be no more drugs from China purchased by the federal government. And second, we're going to give incentives for manufacturers and entrepreneurs to locate pharmaceutical factories here in the United States, for example, by allowing them to mediately expense the cost of building the factories and buying that equipment. And I think that you can produce generic drugs that have been around a long time in places like rural Arkansas just as you can in rural China.

A lot of you probably have taken Z-packs over the years. Well, check out their findings. This is in a long study. Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated, the word significantly there with viral load reduction or disappearance in Covid-19 patients and it's effect is reinforced by azithromycin. Now look at this chart that accompanied the report. The blue line is the control group OK, say they took nothing so bad for them they all have the virus even after 6 days. The red represents those who received hydroxychloroquine so some improvement so only what is it, 40 percent or so still had the virus but look at the yellow line. Now the yellow line represents the patients at the end of day 5 only who were on a protocol that included hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Now the researchers in this study and they're all incredibly prominent epidemiologist and researchers, dozens and dozens. They understood when they undertook this project, they were tasked by the French government to do this. They understood the severity of the global crisis we're all facing and they also understood the risk to millions - millions of people around the world including our health care workers and they concluded as a result of all this thinking and what they looked at the following. We therefore recommend that Covid-19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the world. Now, I understand that we want our own data that is a large controlled study, I understand that's necessary. And the Trump administration is 100 percent correct. At the same time and recognizing the benefits already reported in the use of this drug and the drug combo that we just mentioned. Now by the way hydroxychloroquine, lot of people don't understand this but it does not need to be approved by the FDA in order to be administered by doctors for off-label use because as I said before, we don't have to go over it but it's prescribed for anti-malarial use and also for lupus in some cases. Our physicians are already using it in our major hospitals for Covid patients. They also used it successfully in some cases against SARS which had a higher mortality rate. The president as usual has sharp instincts. He sees things that sometimes the intellectuals and academics, they might get lost in some of the details but he has sharp instincts about things. And he's pushing to get millions of doses now into the United States."

It's an anti-inflammatory prescribed mostly for rheumatoid arthritis. Again an off-label use is being implemented now by the Chinese who are finding that it works very well against Covid-19. Pharmaceutical giants Roche and Sanofi make different versions of this drug. Our doctors and our hospitals need all the ammo they can get to fight this disease. We want fewer people to need ventilators, right? We need to reduce that that absolute necessity to have vents in our ICUs because we have a critical shortage. We need to get people home to quarantine if they're sick then we need after a necessary amount of time, we need to get those people healthy and back to work. As soon as they're medically cleared. Again, I respect all the professionals who are working on this and they're working ridiculous hours and I respect Doctor Fauci, an enormous amount. And I realize in an ideal world, we want everything buttoned up and as perfect as far as randomized trials go but our country needs solutions and hope now. And old bureaucracies have to give way to fast action. The president understands this. We can't stay in our homes for ever. America wants to get back to work. And that's the Angle. All right, joining me now is Doctor William Grace an oncologist at Lenox Hill hospital in New York City. Doctor, what's the best way to keep people - keep infected people away from those with compromised immune systems? Is it the mass shut down that we're seeing or is it a focus on those compromised population?"

They have the more mature immune systems even though their bodies may be weak and their immune systems are actually quite strong and it's the strength of that immunity that causes the damage to the lungs and the deaths in these cases. Hence the reason why hydroxychloroquine, an immunosuppressive agent is beneficial it by two mechanisms. Suppressing the immune response and number two, acting to suppress the replication of the virus. That's why the anti- inflammatory drugs you just mentioned before I came on, is working in China because it's cutting down what we call the cytokine storm, the inflammatory storm that the virus causes in the percentage of people and those are the people who go on to die. So that's why you see that it's - it's the immune system that's causing most of the deaths."

So an older person's response, it's powerful to a foreign agent coming into their body and this is a new foreign agent coming into the body so their immune response goes crazy so you need to drop that down in order to prevent the damage, is that correct?"

CNN in particular. Watch. All right, they're accusing Trump sorry, of peddling false hope with hydroxychloroquine. For the past two days, Trump has said he was dispensing a game changer breakthrough on treatments. It's holding out the promise of hope and optimism to shift attention from the reality of alarming rises in infections, a building economic crisis, a shortage of ventilators, the federal government's botched coronavirus testing rollout, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Is it just false hope or do we have at least, you know, examples in our country right now of this working including in your hospital?"

And the results of those tests that show that hydroxychloroquine alone and the synergism between hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the results of that testing, there was only one chance in 10,000 that that could have happened by chance alone. That's highly significant data. You know we look at data today. We accept one chance in 20 of having it by chance alone as being statistically significant. One chance in 10.000 is huge and the president is exactly right. This is going to help a lot of people. By the way the tension you show of - you saw between Anthony Fauci and the president today, both can have their cake and eat it too because you can take the seriously ill people and treat them off-label with the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and then you can take those people who are not so seriously ill and put them on whatever randomized trial you want. And as many limbs as you want because there'll be plenty of patients out there that will be sick and not so serious than they're in danger of dying."

They knew back in December, probably even earlier that this could be a massive health crisis for the world but instead of just trying to warn the rest of us, they engaged in a massive cover up. Our economy is in terrific shape because of it and if we're not careful China will do even more damage. According to The Washington Post, Beijing is preparing to use the crisis to advance China's economic strategy against the U.S. Several Chinese company agencies and officials are talking publicly about how China can take advantage of being the first country to start recovering from the novel coronavirus to take over the industries of the future. Now we're already way to our line on China in key industries. I've been talking about this only for 20 years on television and poopooed for most of it. Medical supplies, technologies, rare earth material, space weaponry but by the way, they threaten to cut off bio medicines and pharmaceuticals just last week. Nice people. Joining me now is Marc Thiessen former White House speech writer, Fox news contributor who's been doing great work on this. Marc, what do we need to do right now, right now to you know pull off the blinders on China and begin to decouple ourselves from this communist regime? MARC THIESSEN, COLUMNIST, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Well yes, first thing we have to do is we have to get out of this recession and pass the recovery bill so that we can - so that we can get through this and American businesses and American families can get back to the prosperity that they had before the Covid virus was unleashed by China. But when that's done, we've got a look back at who is responsible for the unbelievable economic damage that we're suffering today. The reason we are going into a deep recession, the reason why our economy is in free fall is because the communist Chinese regime was more interested in suppressing the truth than suppressing a virus. They - they knew as you pointed out, in December, they knew that there was human to human transmission because medical workers were getting sick but on January 14, the Chinese told the World Health Organization that there was no evidence of human to human transmission when they knew it wasn't true. Couple of days later, they had a banquet in Wuhan. Tens of thousands of families share - had a lunar new year banquet sharing food with each other and then they let 5 million people leave Wuhan province and travel all over China and spread this thing all over the world. So the reason we are in the situation right now, there was an - Axios reported this morning but there's a new study that found that if they had acted just three weeks earlier, 95 percent reduction in the number of cases would have been. So we need to hold you know, we're about to spend $ 1 trillion to $2 trillion. We need to send the bill to Beijing for that. Donald Trump needs to tell the Chinese, you're paying for the damage to our economy."

In the last week the number of confirmed cases in Mexico quadrupled from about 40 to more than 160 and that's only what the official stats tell us. The Mexican government doesn't seem to care much at all. Why they did close public schools. There are no travel restrictions and only limited screenings of any travelers and large gatherings concerts and so forth are still happening. now what you have here are the ingredients, a lot of the epidemiologists are saying for an epic disaster.

Raymond, we're seeing reports about strains on the Internet in Europe. What would happen here in the United States if families stuck together for all this time started losing their broadband?"

Verizon claims its network usage is up 75 percent. So to lighten the load, YouTube and Netflix have agreed to reduce streaming quality in Europe for 30 days. The U.S. could impose similar limitations if this quarantine drags on. As an example of what you can expect at home, this is how Disney Plus's Mandalorian looks in high definition. Watch."

      "utterance": "Earlier in the show, we laid out why we need to start decoupling ourselves from China. I've been talking about this for many years, but now more than ever, especially when it comes to medicine and medical supplies. My next guest has introduced legislation to bring those industries back home. Joining me now is Senator Tom Cotton from the great state of Arkansas. Senator, how are you going to get those companies to start producing here, because the message from all the globalists is always, then it is going to cost 10 times more, until you have trillions of dollars lost in the economy because of this shut down of the American economy because we can't protect our people. But how do you do it? How do you get them back?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. TOM COTTON, (R-AR)",
      "utterance": "Laura, I think most Americans are shocked when they've learned in recent days that so many of our basic drugs are made in China -- antibiotics, penicillin, ibuprofen, to say nothing of dozens of ingredients that go into finished products. So what we're going to do is both help create supply here and create demand. So the demand is going to come through the federal government's purchasing power. The Department of Defense, the V.A., Medicare, Medicaid, and others agencies purchase an immense amount of drugs, many of which, unfortunately, originate in China. In a few years, we're going to say that ends. There can be no more drugs from China purchased by the federal government. And second, we're going to give incentives for manufacturers and entrepreneurs to locate pharmaceutical factories here in the United States, for example, by allowing them to mediately expense the cost of building the factories and buying that equipment. And I think that you can produce generic drugs that have been around a long time in places like rural Arkansas just as you can in rural China. It's not going to be that much more expensive, and we can see that it is going to make us much safer and much more secure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Senator Cotton, we're going to need jobs. We're going to have an enormous unemployment role if people are really going to be staying in their houses longer than a few weeks. Even with a few weeks we're going to have a lot of damage done. So we need these jobs. And with that having been said, back in 2018, \"The New York Times,\" which is often not too anti-China, to put it lightly, they were reporting on the following. \"For over a year the Chinese government has withheld lab samples of a rapidly evolving influenza virus from the United States -- specimens needed to develop vaccines and treatments. Despite persistent requests from government officials and research institutions, China has not provided samples of the dangerous virus, a type of bird flu call H7N9.\" So shouldn't we have been on notice that you can't really trust the Chinese to give us the information we need about critical points such as these horrible health scares and possible epidemics?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, Laura, we definitely should have been on notice going back decades. It was never a smart idea to outsource our basic industrial productivity to a country like China. We need that in America. And unfortunately, though, it's not just China. China is just in the last two weeks threatened to withhold basic drugs. But other countries, including allied countries in the face of a global pandemic are also withholding basic pharmaceutical ingredients, basic medical supplies and devices. That's why it's so vital that we have that productive capacity here in the United States for our safety and for jobs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Real quick, Senator, this is Governor Cuomo in New York, who has been pretty good in trying to be positive in a very horrific situation in New York given the number of infections and deaths. This is what he said about the N95 mask situation. Watch."

    {
      "speaker": "GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY)",
      "utterance": "If I had a New York state defense production act, I would use it. We need masks. If you're making clothing, figure out if you can make masks. I'll fund it. So I'm doing everything I can to increase the production. That's besides having people all over the globe trying to buy product."

      "speaker": "COTTON",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
