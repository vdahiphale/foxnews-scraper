      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, well, another story. We are now 99 days away from the biggest choice election in our lifetime where you will be the ultimate jury because now more than ever, this country, we're at a tipping point. At a point where we will either go the way of peace and prosperity and, oh, let's see, the greatest standard of living ever created by man, the way of safety, the way of security, or down the road of left-wing lawlessness and total anarchy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The chaos, the carnage, the rampant crime taking place on city streets all across this country, from Seattle to Portland to Austin, Texas, to open to all Omaha, to Los Angeles, to New York City. It is not just a clear and present danger to our country. It is also a preview of coming attractions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, what we are now witnessing in city after city, they all have one thing in common, they've been run by liberal Democrats for decades. Well, that's what will show up on your front door in November if, in fact, Joe Biden and his team of supporters get their way and their radical stated policies are implemented. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is a new, radical, extreme Democratic socialist party of anarchy, amnesty, complete annihilation of everything that has made this country great, including free-market capitalism. It's now a party of socialism and in complete denial about violence that you see on your screen every night gripping major cities. You don't believe me? Well, tonight you will listen to Jerry Nadler. You'll hear Joe Biden in his own words.

Just take a look at this new body cam footage released by the Seattle Police Department. It shows violent agitators throwing rocks, bottles, wood, explosives at police officers during Saturday's protest in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In total, 59 police officers suffered injuries after being hit by the bricks and the rocks on the other debris. While the city council and the summer of love mayor, that, well, dopey mayor, Jenny Durkan, continue to downplay the violence and prevent police literally from doing their job. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Get this: local leaders are now giving police officer zero ability to quell the unrest. They are putting handcuffs on the officers. Just listen to the police chief, Carmen Best. This is a shocking statement. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, well, another story. We are now 99 days away from the biggest choice election in our lifetime where you will be the ultimate jury because now more than ever, this country, we're at a tipping point. At a point where we will either go the way of peace and prosperity and, oh, let's see, the greatest standard of living ever created by man, the way of safety, the way of security, or down the road of left-wing lawlessness and total anarchy. The chaos, the carnage, the rampant crime taking place on city streets all across this country, from Seattle to Portland to Austin, Texas, to open to all Omaha, to Los Angeles, to New York City. It is not just a clear and present danger to our country. It is also a preview of coming attractions. In other words, what we are now witnessing in city after city, they all have one thing in common, they've been run by liberal Democrats for decades. Well, that's what will show up on your front door in November if, in fact, Joe Biden and his team of supporters get their way and their radical stated policies are implemented. This is a new, radical, extreme Democratic socialist party of anarchy, amnesty, complete annihilation of everything that has made this country great, including free-market capitalism. It's now a party of socialism and in complete denial about violence that you see on your screen every night gripping major cities. You don't believe me? Well, tonight you will listen to Jerry Nadler. You'll hear Joe Biden in his own words. These shocking remarks tonight are straight ahead. But, first, we begin tonight out west where another weekend of carnage wreaking havoc in the city of Seattle, demonstrators going more violent, more threatening towards police, the same in Portland. Just take a look at this new body cam footage released by the Seattle Police Department. It shows violent agitators throwing rocks, bottles, wood, explosives at police officers during Saturday's protest in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. In total, 59 police officers suffered injuries after being hit by the bricks and the rocks on the other debris. While the city council and the summer of love mayor, that, well, dopey mayor, Jenny Durkan, continue to downplay the violence and prevent police literally from doing their job."

Yesterday, I sent a letter to city council members that clearly explained the foreseeable impact of this ordinance on upcoming events. I think it's important that you understand that as well. With the city council ordinance, we hear loudly and clearly that the use of these less lethal tools by SPD officers to disperse crowds that have turned violent have been completely banned by the city council."

The police chief now saying that they would love to do their jobs but businesses and residents, you're on your own if more riots ensue. She will not put her officers at risk with handcrafts on. Far left leaders are taking away everything a solitary tool that police departments have to protect themselves and businesses and innocent law- abiding citizens. It's not peaceful, it's anarchy. And it is now the new normal in so many of these liberal-run cities all across the country, like in Portland, Oregon, which suffered yet another weekend of yes, rioting. And more calls against -- violence against the police. Take a look at what \"The Daily Caller\" Shelby Talcott, who's going to join us later, recorded. Take a look at this."

And as the police department explained in the press release, these writers, quote, wear gas masks, they carried shields, hockey sticks, leaf blowers, flags and umbrellas specifically to thwart the police.

Minimum ten years in prison. Don't do it! So far, 18 people have been charged for their roles in the Portland riots. The president is expanding the effort to protect federal property in Portland. Portland is now sending 100 more agents to the riot zones. Again, just to protect federal property. The president has been offering these cities, these mayors and governors help again and again to help them restore order and safety and security. Radical Democrats aiding and abetting more anarchy and violence and in some cases, even marching with the anarchists. But at the same time, like I've been saying, 100 agents, they can't save and protect these cities. They can only protect those buildings unless and until these reckless, you're responsible Democratic mayors and governors step up and do their job. Just accept the help that's being offered to them.

So, they're really a part of what's going on. Then you also have a confluence of events. You have the left-wing Democratic mayors who, A, think that this is a way to push back on President Trump by having this craziness go on in their towns that gets blamed on the president, and also looking to appease the hard left flank. Unfortunately for them, the revolution invariably devours their own children and you're going to see Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, Jenny Whelan (ph) of Seattle and Wheeler of Portland, they are going to put their heads in the political guillotine because they are trying to appease the most radical of their elements, and that's going to end up being a massive problem for them in the country."

When cities and areas have accepted his help, they have restore law and order. They refuse steadfastly to do so, seemingly want to fight the president more than even protect their own citizens."

Ted Wheeler was out the other day on the ground and he was sort of backing these violent protesters, even while the protesters were shouting expletives at him and, you know, I think a water bottle was thrown at him. So, it's really interesting. And these federal officers have been deployed to protect the building and they have said time and time again if the protesters don't touch the fence and don't try to break through, you know, they're not -- they're not going to come outside. And we'll see that. They don't come outside until these protests escalate and night after night, they are escalating."

Safety, security, it is the foundation of the great American dream. If you can't be safe and secure in your own home, how do you pursue happiness, right? Every child, every neighborhood, don't they deserve to be safe and secure? Don't they deserve a good education opportunity? How do you possibly climb the ladder of opportunity living in a free society without those fundamentals? Unfortunately, left-wing mayors, they'd rather play petty politics, even as crime ways cripple their cities. Look at Philadelphia, multiple police cars set ablaze across the city overnight. New York City, the city shootings are 176 percent increase since last year. We're now learning that a second teen has died. A triple shooting in Brooklyn pushing the number of New York City homicides in 24 hours to eight. Where is the mayor? Well, he's out there quoting Mao and Karl Marx. Where is the outrage for this nonstop and less violence destroying communities? In New York, for example, 98, 99 or 100 percent of shooting victims are minorities in New York. The mayor is doing nothing except defund the police department and speaking out on behalf of the anarchists and saying President Trump is a bad person. Well, that's not keeping anybody secure. Tonight, out in Milwaukee, there are calls for a federal investigation, an African-American activist known for carrying pro-Trump sign through the streets fatally shot Thursday afternoon. Milwaukee police tonight they released a photo of the suspect. We are following that story. In Chicago, well, let's see, last weekend it was what, 70. We can before, 64. 59 more people in Chicago shot this weekend and another crime-plagued weekend of violence, including an infant wounded and another senseless act. And, by the way, even amid these daily tragedies in the Windy City, you have Mayor Lightfoot, another genius, still resisting the presence of, what, the 100 federal agents protecting federal buildings that she's not protecting.

What I mean is these morons in charge of these liberal networks, imbeciles may be, morons may be nice, still think we're living in the Walter Cronkite era, where if you don't air Antifa beating the living stuff out of people on TV that it didn't happen, not realizing that 20, 30, 40 million Americans will go to Facebook or somewhere else and watch the video of Antifa beating the snot out of officers, burning down buildings, lasering their eyeballs. Now, Lawrence Jones came on tonight and told you about a 10-month-old shot in Chicago. You know what a bullet does to a 10-month-old. Does the media think -- let me get this straight. If George Costanza over at CNN, Stelter, if he comes on and doesn't report it, it didn't happen and it doesn't matter because he said, don't worry, it's the right wing machine that's making this out be something that's not there. Does he not look at the crime rates? Is he not aware we can do our own homework? Sean, imagine how this looks through the ice of the police officers, being brutally attacked every night, being told by the media machine out there that, oh, don't worry, they are mostly peaceful until they kick you between the legs. That is totally B.S., and their credibility is zero. And this media generation better wake up, the digital era is here. We've figured it out and nobody, nobody trusts you anymore. No one.

Igor Danchenko is his name, former senior research analyst, tick-tock, at the Brookings Institute. Not a Russian-based source as the FBI claimed on their application to the FISA court. In an interview with the FBI in January 2017, Danchenko admitted the information he gave Steele was unreliable, three days of testimony. Also tonight, the Attorney General Bill Barr scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee tomorrow. According to his opening statement, the attorney general will say the chaos we are seeing Portland is not a protest but a, quote, assault on the government of the United States. Here with reaction, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham.

Would you think this information came from? It came from the Russian intelligence service. They played this guy like a fiddle. This was Russian disinformation. Some FBI agents recognized it as such. He told Steele, here's what I found but it's not really reliable because Steele turned it into a Tom Clancy novel. The FBI bought it hook, line, and sinker and got warrants with it.

It's unverifiable. It's now been debunked. They still sign those two, and then even after the sub-source, in other words, Christopher Steele's sources, then they went on to sign two more warrants."

If nobody else will talk to him, I'm going to talk to him and the case agent and asked him as a simple question. When he found out that the Russian sub-source was a Steele employee not based in Russia but based in the United States, and everything in the document was bar talk, hearsay and garbage, did you tell anybody? And I guarantee you they did. But here's what else you're going to find this week I hope. The Congress got suspicious about the sub-source, wanted to know how reliable the person was. In 2018, 2018, ask for a briefing from the FBI about the Russian sub-source because the intel committees were getting suspicious and I found the briefing notes and they lied to Congress, the FBI did, like they lied to the FISA court. What we have over three year period, 16, 17, and 18 is a complete breakdown of the rule of law, manipulations of the system at every turn and is just not a few bad actors unfortunately, it's a system failure."

He' got National Guard troops. He's got PPE. He's got advisors in nine states, all over the hot spots. And then we've got Joe Biden embracing the -- well, defund movement, if you will, Bolshevik Bernie's economic plan, AOC's new Green Deal agenda, Bozo O'Rourke's gun confiscation plan, and Pelosi and Schumer which are both lunatics.

This is still a referendum on President Trump. The president has not yet shifted this and turned it into a choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. I submit to you that's still because of COVID. The president, to his credit, has wisely shifted gears and has really making an August, late July, August focus on COVID which he needs to continue to do. And that way, once he's dealt with that successfully, I submit he'll be able to turn the tables and really go hard against Joe Biden who is a walking, talking vulnerability."

MERCEDES SCHLAPP, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISOR: Yes, and I think it's so important for the American people to wake up to this new reality that there is no such thing as this moderate Democrat presidential candidate. He's made a decision to align himself with the radical left. I mean, I asked you out there to read this unity plan. It is about abolishing immigration detention. It is about ending deportation. It's about open borders. It's about defund the police. It's about abolish ICE. The list goes on and on. It's about tax hikes for Americans which would impact 82 percent of Americans. So, Sean, we are in a new reality with the Democrat Party. Joe Biden knows he's got to pivot to the far left in order to keep his base settled. Even the Bernie people don't like Biden."

You have to remember that the Democrat political advisors are telling Joe Biden to stay in the basement. That's their plan.

You're not forcing customers. You're not dragging them out of their homes and forcing them into the gym. They are choosing to go. My understanding is that you put a lot of PPE, a lot of, you know, sanitation within the place. You're sanitizing everything. People are even wearing masks I understand.

And then we were illegally shut down by the board of health. They change the locks on our doors on May 22nd. We got the doors back up on June 16th. And since June 16th, we have actually done our own contact tracing just to show we proof and actually through midnight last night, we've had 13,009 people show up for business to our facility where we actually have them check into a biometric scanner which takes their temperature. They fill out a health questionnaire which is time stamped and we do a lot of other PPE things around. But the key there is we actually have no positive cases. Nobody sick out of 13,009. And at this point, we truly believe we are being singled out not just as an industry but as, you know, an entity. Governor Murphy has actually listed for some reason, labeled all gyms as equal, and they're not. OK, they don't do any guidance over any protocol. To this day, they still don't have a protocol. They asked for 14 days. It's now day 132. What do they expect us to do? How do they expect us to make a living? As you said, people -- we're not dragging people in.

Look, if you evaluate the challenge more briefly, China birthed this virus on the world through their lies, to their negligence, through their corrupt relationship with the World Health Organization. But through Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration can provide hope within our country, to our business owners and to everyone in the world because we are right now engaged in the fastest development of a vaccine that the world has ever known and we're already putting vaccine candidates in production so that when we finally get over the final hurdle in the regulatory process, we will have tens of millions that are available to bring that vaccine and to bring that hope for a normal life to a neighborhood near you."
