Rex Tillerson was not on the same page with at least two important institutions, one, the president, with whom he disagreed on climate change, the Iran nuclear deal and North Korea.

NAFTA is on the table, this free trade agreement with South Korea. But especially, as the 'Journal' reported this week, there has been a working group developing a whole set of offensives against China. That is a complicated policy set, no matter your ideas are about tariffs. Trump, in a statement about Larry, suggested that he likes debate, a lot of internal conversation, and there's going to be that as this tariff initiative heads forward. To have Larry Kudlow in the center of that, playing that role of trying to arbitrate differences of opinion and hold his own, will be a good thing.",

The lesson is the great-man theory of politics only works for the great man. Which is to say there really is a disconnect in these midterm elections between the presidency and the candidates running. In 2010, Barack Obama lost -- or the Democrats lost 63 seats in the House, a complete wipeout. And Obama said later that he admitted he had not done that much to help Democrats running at that level. I think the same is true of Donald Trump. There were losses in the Virginia gubernatorial, the Alabama special Senate election, and now this. I think President Trump should let the Republicans run these races on their own and stay home in Washington doing his job, raising the attitude toward the presidency. That would help them.",

We begin with the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. President Trump announcing Tillerson's ouster on Twitter Tuesday along with his pick to replace him, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, a Trump ally who the president says shares his foreign-policy vision."
    },

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",

      "utterance": "Joining the panel this week, 'Wall Street Journal' columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, editorial board member, Mary Kissel, and Columnist Bill McGurn. So, Dan, what do you make of the Pompeo-for-Tillerson change. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Paul, I say it is the beginning of President Trump saying he is, indeed, beginning to assemble the cabinet he would feel comfortable with. We want to Mr. Trump to feel comfortable with the people around him. I think, in some ways, the Rex Tillerson issue was unique. As the president himself said, with Mike Pompeo, he is getting someone who is on the same page with him. Rex Tillerson was not on the same page with at least two important institutions, one, the president, with whom he disagreed on climate change, the Iran nuclear deal and North Korea. But also, Mr. Tillerson was to a great extent alienated from his own State Department. This is not a place a secretary of state wants to be. So it is no surprise he is finally leaving the government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's fascinating to me, Mary, often a secretary of state becomes a prisoner of the State Department and is at war with other elements of the administration. In this case, Tillerson was at war with the kind of professional diplomats. So he didn't even have that institution. I always thought that was odd. He decided when he came in he was going to reorganize the State Department, always a high-risk exercise."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER",
      "utterance": "The lesson is, Paul, if you come to Washington with flowcharts, you are usually destined to fail. Unfortunately, Tillerson saw a great exodus of the senior staff. There were not a lot of senior people around him. Then he chose, with his chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin, to isolate himself. I think the larger issue that Tillerson had is that he didn't come in with a coherent view of how to use American power in the world. What was the State Department supposed to do? He saw himself as the, quote, unquote, 'adult in the room' who was there to restrain Trump instead of coming in with a coherent view to say, look, President Trump, this is where we should take North Korean policy or Iran policy. I saw him as more of a break than anything else."

He believed the vanity of the adults in the room. He was quoted as calling the president a bleeping moron. Who thinks you can keep your job when you do that? Compare it to Mike Pompeo, who briefed the president every day. He got to have a relationship, see how it works. He says, I'm much more in tune with Mike Pompeo's views of the world and so forth. But I think also the personal relationship, it is an important thing. For a president, defense secretary, secretary of state, treasury secretary, those are the big ones where you need to have a rapport. And it's underestimated how much personality drives policy in the White House. You're in very --"

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "I'm not sure I would so much see change as I would see emphasis. One thing Mike Pompeo did while he was in Congress was he was one of the most vocal opponents of Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. He and Tom Cotton led some of that opposition. So I expect, since that is what the president wants to focus on, but Secretary Pompeo will be able to give him a lot of directed guidance on Iran. The other issue is North Korea. That is the most imminent threat, the North Korean nuclear threat. Mike Pompeo spent a lot of time on it as director of the CIA. He knows the issue. I suspect he will spend a lot of personal time with the president trying to figure out what to say to Kim Jong-Un if he meets with him, but more importantly, what to do about the nuclear threat."

      "utterance": "Any difference on Russia?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KISSEL",
      "utterance": "Look, Pompeo is a hawk. I'd expect him to be strong on Russia. But I just put another issue on the table that Dan didn't mention in relation to Iran, and that is Syria. Mike Pompeo has gone on record saying, you cannot solve Syria without getting Assad out of power. That isn't the line that President Trump has taken. President Trump has continued Barack Obama's policy of letting Russia and Iran control Syria, prop up Assad. That keeps the terror problem going, the migration problem going. So I would expect Pompeo, hopefully, to maybe convince the president to take a stronger stance in Syria."

And that is important when you have the president out there pushing anti-growth things like the tariffs.

But Larry Kudlow has a skill for working its way through those disputes. And I think one of the jobs he will have with what Donald is attempting to do on trade is there's a lot of internal contradictions. He's been talking about global tariffs on steel and aluminum involving the European Union and the rest of the countries of the world. NAFTA is on the table, this free trade agreement with South Korea. But especially, as the 'Journal' reported this week, there has been a working group developing a whole set of offensives against China. That is a complicated policy set, no matter your ideas are about tariffs. Trump, in a statement about Larry, suggested that he likes debate, a lot of internal conversation, and there's going to be that as this tariff initiative heads forward. To have Larry Kudlow in the center of that, playing that role of trying to arbitrate differences of opinion and hold his own, will be a good thing."

Now, what happened with Mr. McCabe, is an office inside the FBI, called the Office of Professional Responsibility -- in other words, they regard themselves as professionals and they have a responsibility to their authority as FBI agents -- those are the people who said Mr. McCabe's lack of candor was sufficient that he should be fired without his pension.

This is not -- these are not cooperative agencies. You can't have them going off on their own. It is bad enough when politicians cheat or bend the law, but when people entrusted to uphold the law are found to be dishonest -- in this case, look, it is another example, if what's being reported is true, the cover-up was worse than the crime, that he lied to the inspector general's investigators about what he had done regarding the leak."

Republican strategist, John Brabender, served as a senior advisor to former Pennsylvania senator and 2016 presidential candidate, Rick Santorum. He joins me now from Pittsburgh. John, welcome. I'll tell you, the one thing I noticed here was the Republican vote really fell off in this district from previous contested elections. What happened? JOHN BRABENDER, R-REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST & FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO RICK SANTORUM: We have to be very careful and understand the district. This district, when we say it is a red district, it's a lot of Democrats who traditionally vote Republican. If you count non-Republicans, there is a 72,000-vote majority for Democrats and Independents. What historically happens in this district is Republicans do well because Democrats keep putting up very progressive left-leaning Democrats. Donald Trump won by 20 points because it was really Hillary Clinton driving numbers, not just President Trump.

Conor Lamb, the Democrat, he opposed it and said, by the way, because it increases the deficit, they will cut Social Security and Medicare.

There were a lot of independent outside groups that ran, but they tried to turn Conor Lamb into a Nancy Pelosi Democrat. Conor Lamb ran an ad saying I don't like Nancy Pelosi and I'm not going to support her, and that message didn't work well. But you are 100 percent right. The key moving forward for the Republican Party is we need to have a better effective message on why these tax cuts are so beneficial to all Americans, not just wealthy Americans, but all Americans."

Still ahead, as Republicans look for lessons from this week's special election in Pennsylvania, there's at least one Democrat who hasn't learned from her 2016 defeat. Out panel weighs in on what it means for November's midterms, next."

      "utterance": "As Republicans sort through the lessons from this week's special election in Pennsylvania, it appears that at least one Democrat hasn't learned from her own defeat in 2016. Speaking at a conference in Mumbai, India, last weekend, Hillary Clinton blamed her lose on white women being pressured by their husbands, bosses and sons to vote for Donald Trump. She went on to tell the audience, quote, 'I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward. And his whole campaign, Make America Great Again, was looking backwards, you know? He doesn't like black people getting rights. He doesn't like women, you know, getting jobs.' We're back with Dan Henninger, editorial board member, Allysia Finley, and James Freeman. Dan, we'll get to Hillary Clinton. But on the Pennsylvania race, Paul Ryan saying it is a wake-up call. They said it was a wake-up call after Virginia. They said it was a wake-up call after the special election in the state election in Wisconsin. How many wake-up calls do the Republicans need here?"

    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Maybe just one more, Paul, and that is a wake-up call in the Oval Office. Donald Trump from went down there the Saturday before the election, spent 75 minutes giving a campaign speech nominally on behalf of Rick Saccone, who lost. The lesson is the great-man theory of politics only works for the great man. Which is to say there really is a disconnect in these midterm elections between the presidency and the candidates running. In 2010, Barack Obama lost -- or the Democrats lost 63 seats in the House, a complete wipeout. And Obama said later that he admitted he had not done that much to help Democrats running at that level. I think the same is true of Donald Trump. There were losses in the Virginia gubernatorial, the Alabama special Senate election, and now this. I think President Trump should let the Republicans run these races on their own and stay home in Washington doing his job, raising the attitude toward the presidency. That would help them."

So it was not good for morale, but I am not sure it means a whole lot more than that. Fortunately --"

I don't want to say Lamb lied, because I don't know his intention, but the falsehood that only rich people got tax cuts that hit up and down the income ladder, is very easily rebutted. And for competent candidate talking about how everyone benefits, and we are seeing wages go up as a result, this is a winning issue. I don't know how Saccone made it a losing issue."

As for the argument, OK, Rick Saccone was a bad candidate, which you keep hearing. He won his state Senate district by 20 or 30 points in the last week to elections. And these were Democratic-leaning districts. He had managed to hold these districts. The difference this year was the Republican turnout had fallen off."

      "speaker": "FINLEY",
      "utterance": "I guess we're clinging to our husbands and bosses now, or our brothers and sons. That comes as the Obama comment about the, quote, unquote, 'deplorable's.' Hillary Clinton made the 'deplorables' comment about working-class people trying to explain why they don't agree with them. It is very condescending, and women will react that way."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

      "utterance": "That is the nature of identity politics, Paul, when you feel that there are grievances, deep grievances involving gender, race, the rest of it, you will talk about that all the time. The only way you can talk about it is by suggesting, as Hillary does, that large swaths of the population are against black people, against women. And that doesn't compute with most Americans. But that is driving a large part of the Democratic Party right now, especially on the coast, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton. And I don't think the Republicans would be remiss at all if they would say to some of those voters out in the heartland, this is what you will be getting if you return the Democrats to the House in November."

This is a classic good-versus-evil tale, but Disney stripped the novel of its Christianity in favor of these P.C. platitudes. I remember, as a fifth- grader, my teacher read it out to aloud. Now, it appears even a two-story Oprah Winfrey with glitter and so forth is not enough to help this at the box office."
