Unemployment is still higher than Carley Shimkus at brunch. In Biden's defense we are paying people not to work. Creating unemployment with a surplus of jobs. Like Jerry Nadler's pants. It defies the laws of physics. So what were the press covering besides there sorry asses? Media Research Center assessed evening news coverage from the first two weeks of May and found almost no mention of Joe's failures. There's a few minutes on inflation if you want jobs, nothing on the border. Instead, they spent a combined 33 minutes on Liz Cheney. Yes. The most important thing going on in America is Republicans removing an unpopular Republican. Not that your savings are shrinking. I mean, if you get to rank stories in order of importance to average Americans, this story would come in slightly higher than a guy finding a Cheeto that looks like Jesus. But Liz didn't seem to mind. She soaked up the attention like Kilmeade me did a nude beach. I call it the strange new earned respect disorder or snerd for short. Snerding is when people who hate you suddenly like you because you're useful. And since the attention feels good, you go right along with this snerd herd. It happened with Mitch, it happened with Adam Kinzinger, it happened with Barry Manilow when he joined the Manson family. That didn't happen. I just needed a fourth example. But it's also happening to the bald headed pinheads of the Lincoln Project. But they're too dumb to realize it yet. So as the media flocked to Liz, what did she say?",

That'll get back to her. But I get it. I mean, after being hated for so long, it's nice to have the press pretending you're human. The word there of course is pretending. It's like that fake friend from school who gives you bad advice because they have their own agenda. Sure you can study for the test on the bus in the morning. Now shut up and shotgun this can of Colt 45. Hey Darla, if you get pregnant you'll be the most famous person in algebra. Or sure her. I think he can make it from the roof to the swimming pool. Never should have said that to Seth. He doesn't call me anymore. He doesn't call anyone anymore. That's the media, they want you to do stuff that's good for them and bad for you. A Labor Department report shows core inflation growing at its highest rate since April 1982. That was when Kat was only 10. CBS Evening News gave it only 11 seconds, which is the same amount of time it takes me to climb to the top of Tyrus, like he's a human rock wall. The reason for inflation, the stimulus, that's what happens when you pump more money into the system, it's supply and demand. A larger amount of money competes for the same amount of stuff. So the stuff gets more expensive, and the money loses value. It's like what happened to Brian Kilmeade. They overexposed him to administering a great product.",

Centuries ago, the first reporter only jotted down notes of village activities. No one minded because it kept him from the sheep. His stories would be something like goats seen in forest looking confused, or the cobbler soiled himself in the park, or journalist mounts goat in effort to scare cobbler. Then they got self-important and began injecting their opinions into stories. The earth is flat, women and minorities hit hardest. The Press morphed from insignificant to powerful because they wrote their own narrative and created their own awards. They would be the protagonist in all of their stories. Fearless, deeply moral in lying, because lying embellish is dull stories, and it's OK to be unethical if you think you're right. Plus, destroying people is exciting. It's why today local stories are now national. Oh, someone left the main message on a restaurant receive, stop the presses. Let's ruin someone for a click. Today the mainstream media is an ecosystem of gossip columnist pushing conflict for attention, because they're not -- because they're not hot or talented enough to be famous in any other industry. Present company excluded. Today's press is less legitimate than a guy in an orange jumpsuit claiming to be your Uber driver. It might not be the oldest profession in history, but it might as well be because all it does is screw people.",

You don't wear a mask inside when you're sitting next to the 96-year-old former president and then you put one on for the cameras outside because it's all about optics and it's all about applause. President Trump was the exact opposite. He obviously didn't care what people thought about him and he went in there like a wrecking ball and said, you know, NATO need to pay more.

The mass protest was led by Tom, Thomas Massie of Kentucky who tweeted that he had filed Pelosi's mask warning Wednesday, complete with a photo of it in the trash. He later said he had filed the $500 fine in the same place. I just hope there's no fine for not recycling because he's in trouble. CDC guidelines allows the vaccinated to go maskless indoors or outdoors. But House Leader Nancy Pelosi has forced all members, even the vaccinated ones to keep them on in the chamber anyway until every member is fully vaccinated, or until she goes to a beauty salon without cameras. Although there's no record of which house members have been vaccinated about 75 percent of them have and anyone in Congress who wants a vaccine has been able to get one since December. So, they get vaccines first and they can give themselves raises. No wonder they don't want term limits. Meanwhile, Pelosi asked if she could get her shot in her face because that's where she's used to getting her injections. Oh, they applaud that joke. Carley, how dare you laugh at something so mean?",

Unemployment is still higher than Carley Shimkus at brunch. In Biden's defense we are paying people not to work. Creating unemployment with a surplus of jobs. Like Jerry Nadler's pants. It defies the laws of physics. So what were the press covering besides there sorry asses? Media Research Center assessed evening news coverage from the first two weeks of May and found almost no mention of Joe's failures. There's a few minutes on inflation if you want jobs, nothing on the border. Instead, they spent a combined 33 minutes on Liz Cheney. Yes. The most important thing going on in America is Republicans removing an unpopular Republican. Not that your savings are shrinking. I mean, if you get to rank stories in order of importance to average Americans, this story would come in slightly higher than a guy finding a Cheeto that looks like Jesus. But Liz didn't seem to mind. She soaked up the attention like Kilmeade me did a nude beach. I call it the strange new earned respect disorder or snerd for short. Snerding is when people who hate you suddenly like you because you're useful. And since the attention feels good, you go right along with this snerd herd. It happened with Mitch, it happened with Adam Kinzinger, it happened with Barry Manilow when he joined the Manson family. That didn't happen. I just needed a fourth example. But it's also happening to the bald headed pinheads of the Lincoln Project. But they're too dumb to realize it yet. So as the media flocked to Liz, what did she say?"

It's like that fake friend from school who gives you bad advice because they have their own agenda. Sure you can study for the test on the bus in the morning. Now shut up and shotgun this can of Colt 45. Hey Darla, if you get pregnant you'll be the most famous person in algebra. Or sure her. I think he can make it from the roof to the swimming pool. Never should have said that to Seth. He doesn't call me anymore. He doesn't call anyone anymore. That's the media, they want you to do stuff that's good for them and bad for you. A Labor Department report shows core inflation growing at its highest rate since April 1982. That was when Kat was only 10. CBS Evening News gave it only 11 seconds, which is the same amount of time it takes me to climb to the top of Tyrus, like he's a human rock wall. The reason for inflation, the stimulus, that's what happens when you pump more money into the system, it's supply and demand. A larger amount of money competes for the same amount of stuff. So the stuff gets more expensive, and the money loses value. It's like what happened to Brian Kilmeade. They overexposed him to administering a great product."

His stories would be something like goats seen in forest looking confused, or the cobbler soiled himself in the park, or journalist mounts goat in effort to scare cobbler. Then they got self-important and began injecting their opinions into stories. The earth is flat, women and minorities hit hardest. The Press morphed from insignificant to powerful because they wrote their own narrative and created their own awards. They would be the protagonist in all of their stories. Fearless, deeply moral in lying, because lying embellish is dull stories, and it's OK to be unethical if you think you're right. Plus, destroying people is exciting. It's why today local stories are now national. Oh, someone left the main message on a restaurant receive, stop the presses. Let's ruin someone for a click. Today the mainstream media is an ecosystem of gossip columnist pushing conflict for attention, because they're not -- because they're not hot or talented enough to be famous in any other industry. Present company excluded. Today's press is less legitimate than a guy in an orange jumpsuit claiming to be your Uber driver.

You do things like you give money to both Iran and Palestine. You greenlight the Russia pipeline to please Germany. You don't wear a mask inside when you're sitting next to the 96-year-old former president and then you put one on for the cameras outside because it's all about optics and it's all about applause. President Trump was the exact opposite. He obviously didn't care what people thought about him and he went in there like a wrecking ball and said, you know, NATO need to pay more.

And I concluded it was not a colt because it may it didn't it one of the main criterias of a cult is that it does not deliver on the promises it offers to its followers. And instead, it only enriches a small few at the top. So, that's why I also like, like most religions wouldn't because they offer to do various works."

Six House Republicans have been fined 500 bucks for refusing to wear masks in the House chamber. Now $500 may seem like a lot to people who don't have a 14-grand refrigerator full of gelato. The mass protest was led by Tom, Thomas Massie of Kentucky who tweeted that he had filed Pelosi's mask warning Wednesday, complete with a photo of it in the trash. He later said he had filed the $500 fine in the same place. I just hope there's no fine for not recycling because he's in trouble. CDC guidelines allows the vaccinated to go maskless indoors or outdoors. But House Leader Nancy Pelosi has forced all members, even the vaccinated ones to keep them on in the chamber anyway until every member is fully vaccinated, or until she goes to a beauty salon without cameras. Although there's no record of which house members have been vaccinated about 75 percent of them have and anyone in Congress who wants a vaccine has been able to get one since December. So, they get vaccines first and they can give themselves raises. No wonder they don't want term limits. Meanwhile, Pelosi asked if she could get her shot in her face because that's where she's used to getting her injections. Oh, they applaud that joke. Carley, how dare you laugh at something so mean?"

Or it's just a terrifying abuse of power. That doesn't make sense. And even other Democrats like Joe Biden have said that you don't have to wear masks if you're vaccinated as to the CDC and other scientists or it's the fact that she doesn't have to wear masks when it when she doesn't want to there is a video of her hugging people at a White House event unmasked.

It's like what Jordan Peterson pointed out. It's like yes, you could tell me not to do this but you can't force me to use a what do you call it a gendered, a non-gendered pronoun or whatever? You can't tell me what to do, right. You can't tell me what I can't do. I won't smoke in the lobby. So this is like really creepy."

How dare you? It's a petri dish. You want them blue talking in your face. But I will say this. This is the science, no sciences. But once you're vaccinated, you can't give it once you're vaccinated.
