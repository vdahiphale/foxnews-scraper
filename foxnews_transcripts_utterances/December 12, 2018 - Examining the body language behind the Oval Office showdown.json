This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. It was one of the biggest stories of the year and there are still many outstanding questions. Tonight “The Ingraham Angle” will bring you an update on the Kavanaugh fallout. Is there reallty an investigation into who leaked Christine Ford's letter? What about the criminal referral submitted to the DOJ over false testimony by Michael Avenatti and Julie Swetnick? You be better not going to let go of that answers ahead. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, extortion at the southern border. What folks in the caravan are now demanding of President Trump. Hint, it' is not asylum. Raymond Arroyo is also here to break down the body language inside yesterday's Oval Office slugfest between President Trump and of course Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. I guess that's (inaudible).

Back to this, both the Senate and the house oath of offices are nearly identical. They begin like this, \"I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At this point, are we even sure that Chuck and Nancy took the oath? I have a news flash for the dynamic duo. When migrants illegally cross our borders, whether they come to work or to collect welfare, using false documents, whether they come to deal drugs or join murderous gangs that are already here, this does constitute a foreign enemy action. That's why Trump was so clear at the end of that Oval Office exchange yesterday. He understands the threat, and he wants to answer it.",

Here are the facts. The Democrats are willing to sell out the country, law and order be damned, in order to deny Trump a victory over the wall. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A few years ago, they were all for fortifying the border but not now. Of course, if we had a media that publicized actual facts on illegal immigration and other immigration issues rather than obsessing 24/7 about Michael Cohen or focusing on a few really sympathetic people in Tijuana, well, we would have a lot more Democrats feeling the pressure on this issue from the voters. Check this out. A new Gallup world poll found that nearly 160 million people around the world want to immigrate to the United States -- 160 million. I bet it's more than that. Naturally, the U.S. is the top destination for immigrants, 21 percent of them would like to come here permanently. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } How are we supposed to deal with that kind of demand for access to our shores? Obviously we can't absorb half of our current population, or is that actually what the Democrats want? After all, that would be an entirely new country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The pragmatic position here, my friends, is simple. There must be an orderly, legal process, one that protects the interests of the American people first when it comes to immigration. Most Americans I really think have no idea of the true cost of illegal immigration. Again, the media will not report it. Let's look at health care. Even though illegals are forbidden access from federally funded health care, Forbes magazine estimates that 3.9 million uninsured illegals receive about $4.6 billion in health services from the federal government, federal taxes -- 2.8 billion from state and local taxpayers goes to illegal immigrants. And 3 billion from higher payments by insured Americans. In other words, you are paying it because your costs are jacked up. All told, Americans cross subsidize health care for unauthorized immigrants to the tune of $18.5 billion a year. Now with that money, we could build a triple wall with all sorts of cool, you know, stuff on it along the border. Come on, $18.5 billion? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president knows well that our lose asylum loss, another issue, the catch and release policy, chain migration, have also acted as magnets and that has ballooned our illegal immigrant population. Once in country, they place an enormous stress on local law enforcement. As I said, health care providers and our schools, resources that should be benefiting Americans and legal immigrants. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This money should be spent on our people and the people who have respected our laws to come here. Not on noncitizens who are illegally present. Here's a perfect example. According to government data released yesterday afternoon, in President Trump's first fiscal year in office, more than 2,304 people were arrested for either employing illegals or working illegally in the country. That's a 700% increase from the previous fiscal year. Now, this is all a direct result of Trump authorizing ICE to investigate all crime committed by or with illegal immigrants and not just focusing of course on the most serious cases. Well, Democrats are going to say why is the government arresting hardworking immigrants? They are just seeking a better way of life. Well, this is a simple twofold answer. One, they are not here legally. But two, and just as important, they are taking jobs that hardworking Americans do not have access to. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We cannot incentivize corporations to use cheap labor, giving them an unfair advantage and destroying other company's abilities to compete. The crackdown also by the way sends a message to the next wave of illegals. You too will be deported if you try to come here and work without permission, and of course collect all those benefits along the way so, don't even try. Now my friends, this is Christmas time. And although the country is doing better, a lot better, under Trump, many Americans are still hurting particularly those entering the workforce for the first time. Single mothers and people without college degrees, many happen to be black and Hispanic. They don't have groups by the way like Pueblo Sin Fronteras or Central Sin Fornteras working on their behalf, filing cases on their behalf. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Of course, as the competition from the cheap illegal labor harms their chances of employment. Who is going to advocate their cases? Democrats use to claim that they cared about our poorest citizens, the little guy. But this year, Chuck and Nancy seem more like the Grinch, making promises to the illegals. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

She repped Ben Rhodes during all that, and then she repped the Clinton Foundation in 2015. She worked for Hillary Clinton, secretary of state.

I have a news flash for the dynamic duo. When migrants illegally cross our borders, whether they come to work or to collect welfare, using false documents, whether they come to deal drugs or join murderous gangs that are already here, this does constitute a foreign enemy action. That's why Trump was so clear at the end of that Oval Office exchange yesterday. He understands the threat, and he wants to answer it."

      "utterance": "It's that important for him. But the Democrats are determined to block Trump's efforts to fortify the border and you can see them. They recoil at any border wall talk. Here are the facts. The Democrats are willing to sell out the country, law and order be damned, in order to deny Trump a victory over the wall. A few years ago, they were all for fortifying the border but not now. Of course, if we had a media that publicized actual facts on illegal immigration and other immigration issues rather than obsessing 24/7 about Michael Cohen or focusing on a few really sympathetic people in Tijuana, well, we would have a lot more Democrats feeling the pressure on this issue from the voters. Check this out. A new Gallup world poll found that nearly 160 million people around the world want to immigrate to the United States -- 160 million. I bet it's more than that. Naturally, the U.S. is the top destination for immigrants, 21 percent of them would like to come here permanently. How are we supposed to deal with that kind of demand for access to our shores? Obviously we can't absorb half of our current population, or is that actually what the Democrats want? After all, that would be an entirely new country. The pragmatic position here, my friends, is simple. There must be an orderly, legal process, one that protects the interests of the American people first when it comes to immigration. Most Americans I really think have no idea of the true cost of illegal immigration. Again, the media will not report it. Let's look at health care. Even though illegals are forbidden access from federally funded health care, Forbes magazine estimates that 3.9 million uninsured illegals receive about $4.6 billion in health services from the federal government, federal taxes -- 2.8 billion from state and local taxpayers goes to illegal immigrants. And 3 billion from higher payments by insured Americans. In other words, you are paying it because your costs are jacked up. All told, Americans cross subsidize health care for unauthorized immigrants to the tune of $18.5 billion a year. Now with that money, we could build a triple wall with all sorts of cool, you know, stuff on it along the border. Come on, $18.5 billion? The president knows well that our lose asylum loss, another issue, the catch and release policy, chain migration, have also acted as magnets and that has ballooned our illegal immigrant population. Once in country, they place an enormous stress on local law enforcement. As I said, health care providers and our schools, resources that should be benefiting Americans and legal immigrants. This money should be spent on our people and the people who have respected our laws to come here. Not on noncitizens who are illegally present. Here's a perfect example. According to government data released yesterday afternoon, in President Trump's first fiscal year in office, more than 2,304 people were arrested for either employing illegals or working illegally in the country. That's a 700% increase from the previous fiscal year. Now, this is all a direct result of Trump authorizing ICE to investigate all crime committed by or with illegal immigrants and not just focusing of course on the most serious cases. Well, Democrats are going to say why is the government arresting hardworking immigrants? They are just seeking a better way of life. Well, this is a simple twofold answer. One, they are not here legally. But two, and just as important, they are taking jobs that hardworking Americans do not have access to. We cannot incentivize corporations to use cheap labor, giving them an unfair advantage and destroying other company's abilities to compete. The crackdown also by the way sends a message to the next wave of illegals. You too will be deported if you try to come here and work without permission, and of course collect all those benefits along the way so, don't even try. Now my friends, this is Christmas time. And although the country is doing better, a lot better, under Trump, many Americans are still hurting particularly those entering the workforce for the first time. Single mothers and people without college degrees, many happen to be black and Hispanic. They don't have groups by the way like Pueblo Sin Fronteras or Central Sin Fornteras working on their behalf, filing cases on their behalf. Of course, as the competition from the cheap illegal labor harms their chances of employment. Who is going to advocate their cases? Democrats use to claim that they cared about our poorest citizens, the little guy. But this year, Chuck and Nancy seem more like the Grinch, making promises to the illegals."

And $75 billion go to Central America and Mexico in remittances. And if you do the math, it works out to about $6,000 to $7,000 per person here who is undocumented, and that's 500 or 600 a month and 60 percent of people here are undocumented are on state assistance or federal or local. So Laura, you're basically asking the American taxpayer to subsidize remittances that goes back. And that's in addition to about $2 billion in direct aid and we have over 500 sanctuary cities where the immigration laws are not applied. And we don't do that to American citizens. If you disagree with EPA regulations or gun registration, you can't set up a sanctuary gun city and say you know what, federal laws don't apply to us. And you know, it's sad because people should -- if they have social justice questions, march on Mexico City or Guatemala City, not San Diego. And I think we really need to recalibrate the morality of all of this because we have this idea that we are the victimizers and people trying to break in are the victims, but if you actually look at it, as you said, American citizens have competition for low-wage jobs, entry wage jobs, our social services are swamped.

The total amount, net, even if you take into account the taxes illegal aliens pay, the total amount that we taxpayers are on hook for every year is over $100 billion if you get state expenditures and federal expenditures. And then the third category of people who lose are the victims of the thousands upon thousands of illegal alien committed crimes and as President Trump pointed out in the discussion yesterday, there is the terrorism risk as well. He mentioned 10 terrorists who have come across the southern border. Actually there than 15 publicized cases and it's probably much higher than that because there are many that we didn't catch.

And then suddenly, when we got up to 11 million or maybe 20 million people and we have children, we have 50 million immigrants (inaudible) when you count their children, we are up to 88 to 90 million people. And one out of every four Californians wasn't born in the United States. And then it became a demographic issue and a political issue. So, Nevada flipped.

A senate staffer tells THE INGRAHAM ANGLE\" exclusively tonight that the judiciary committee never actually submitted the leaked inquiry to the DOJ for investigation. It's unbelievable. Moreover, there is no word tonight on whether any individual offices are investigating it. My question is, we all had to go through that. The Kavanaughs had to go through that. Don't the American people deserve some answers on how it all got started? To help us unpack it all, we are joined by Helgi Walker, former colleague of Kavanaugh in the White House Counsel's Office and Carrie Severino, the Judicial Crisis Network and Attorney Scott Bolden, former D.C.

And the consequences were serious, as you said. Motivations were blatantly, transparently political to do anything they could to stop Brett Kavanaugh from becoming a Supreme Court justice, and luckily that failed.

That was incoming House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler explaining he will not continue the investigations into the multiple levels of corruption revealed at the highest levels of the FBI just over the past few years. The FBI is facing new scrutiny tonight after former national security adviser Michael Flynn's defense team revealed some troubling details in a late Tuesday night sentencing memo. Inside it they revealed that disgraced former deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe recommended, get this, that Flynn not have a lawyer present during his initial FBI interview. They wanted him to be very comfortable. Here with us exclusively tonight, House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes. Mr. Chairman, thank you for being here. What does it tell you about the so- called respect for the rule of law? They didn't give him an indication that this was any serious interview. They said in fact don't bring your lawyer, because if you do that, we're going have to call the Justice Department. Apparently they were good friends in this interview, and what happened?"

You have heard me say this ad nauseam over and over again about the most important crime that was committed here was the leak of the highly sensitive, compartmented information of General Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Yes. And then later again it showed up in \"The Washington Post,\" I think even more information. That was a leak of a phone call of an American citizen that he had every right to make. It wasn't just that he was a national security adviser. Any American has the ability to talk to any ambassador that they want. And they used a law from the 1700s, the Logan Act, that had never been used."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But this was all a pretext. So people watching understand, it looks like a set up. It looks like this is all pretextual. They had the transcript in their hand, the agent said so. They had the transcripts, and they were ready -- if Flynn said he didn't remember, they were going to read part of the transcript to him. But then he's in there without a lawyer, thinking that these are his buddies and there's no problem. Of course, I tell you. I have nothing to hide. Presumably that's what he said."

      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "I don't know why that would have been, but I also know that we were briefed on those interviews in the House Intelligence Committee a month or two after those interviews occurred. So you have memos that would've been written during the interview, and then you have a briefing before the House Intelligence Committee, probably the Senate. And then you move onward, and it's not finalized until August 22nd. So I'm glad that the judge is looking at this. I think the judge should also asked the House Intelligence Committee to provide the transcript that we have of Director Comey testifying before our committee. He would be interested in that also."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

      "utterance": "Right, he wants the notes beforehand and the 302s."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That will reveal a lot about what they actually thought and knew right beforehand right after they left which was apparently that they didn't think he lied, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So Peter Strzok did not think that Michael Flynn lied?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "That's what I believe, at least from the testimony that we received over many, many months was that there was no lying had occurred. That's why I was shocked by --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So he wants two documents, a memo that then FBI Director Andrew McCabe wrote after speaking with Flynn by ahead of the interview he did with the two agents during the same interview. So that's the FD-302, that McCabe part."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Which is the finalization and the moralization of the original interview. And I still don't understand how it took seven months. And remember, Senator Grassley has been all over this for a year asking for these 302s."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Sullivan also ordered the special counsel to hand over any memos or interview notes relevant to Flynn. So this all goes to your point. This was a complete setup from the beginning again Flynn. It looks obvious to me. It's obvious to anyone who has bothered to follow this for one minute. Another thing that's obvious is how many politically motivated actors have populated the Mueller investigation. Not all, but I want everyone to remember Jeannie Rhee is, just because of today, because she was speaking at the Cohen sentencing. He was sentenced today, got three years, southern district of New York. And for people who don't know who she is, I want to remind you. She worked for the Clinton Foundation. She repped also Obama Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes during the House Select Committee on Benghazi. She repped Ben Rhodes during all that, and then she repped the Clinton Foundation in 2015. She worked for Hillary Clinton, secretary of state. This is not someone who should be in the special counsel's investigation. And she also gave $5,400, too."

    },

      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "It's totally nuts, and if the shoe was on the other foot, the mainstream media would be going crazy. The Mueller investigation would've been shut down. It would've been called a fraud and hoax from the beginning."

      "utterance": "I am watching to see how the media is making this out to be like that Trump did something wrong, when the reality is, he's going to prison for tax evasion. And so, look, I think if you look at what the fed said, the fed said this guy did a lot of bad things, where you have the special counsel's office saying the opposite."
