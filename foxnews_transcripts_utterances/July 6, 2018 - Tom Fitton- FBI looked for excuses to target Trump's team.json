New details, we're going to bring them to you. Plus, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, they're getting scorched from the left over the Trump - Maxine Waters feud but what you are not going to believe is why. And a big trade war between the US and China is underway, or at least the first shots have been lobbied. But President Trump may have already won the first battle, we'll explain that later in the program. But first, the White House doubling down in its support if ICE. Calls to abolish the agency, they're spreading like wildfire as you know throughout the left. And earlier today Vice President Mike Pence became the latest administration official, when the number two comes into the defense you know they're bringing the big guns, to draw a line in the sand against the onslaught, listen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

New light is being cast on FBI's efforts to investigate the Trump campaign. John Solomon's latest piece in the Hill Newspaper details internal bureau memos about the pressure applied to justice department investigators and their effort to get a warrant on former Trump campaign advisor Cater Page. An email exchange between infamous FBI agent Peter Strzok and his lover Lisa Page from October 14th of 2016, just a few weeks before the election.

Joining us now with reaction is Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch. Tom thank you joining us this morning. We buried the lead on this, I'm going to put another quote up from Peter Strzok, this is from September 26 of 2016. He said and I quote, \"At a minimum, the letter that Carter Page wrote, provides us a pretext to interview him\", pretext is code for an excuse to interview Carter Page, how explosive is all this?",

A lot of major news developments going on right now including new details about intense institutional intentional pressure applied by the FBI at the highest levels to investigate the Trump campaign. New details, we're going to bring them to you. Plus, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, they're getting scorched from the left over the Trump - Maxine Waters feud but what you are not going to believe is why. And a big trade war between the US and China is underway, or at least the first shots have been lobbied. But President Trump may have already won the first battle, we'll explain that later in the program. But first, the White House doubling down in its support if ICE. Calls to abolish the agency, they're spreading like wildfire as you know throughout the left. And earlier today Vice President Mike Pence became the latest administration official, when the number two comes into the defense you know they're bringing the big guns, to draw a line in the sand against the onslaught, listen."

The American people have every right to engage in peaceful protests but these threats against ICE officers and their families must stop and they must stop now. Under President Donald Trump, we will never abolish ICE."

Well abolish ICE supporters are praying to make this wedge issue as the midterm elections approach. But is it going to blow up in their faces or might it work? Joining us now with reaction is Fox News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy, along with immigration attorney Francisco Hernandez and Democratic pollster and Fox News contributor Doug Schoen. Doug you've got the home court advantage since you're here in studio so we'll go to you first. You say it's not a set issue that abolish ICE is good for Democrats and that there's not much consensus here on that."

The number who want open borders or to relax scrutiny of those coming in at a time of terror and illegal immigrants coming from Central America is very small. I think it's the far left in the Democratic Party high jacking, effectively the mainstream narrative, to the ultimate detriment I believe, of the party if this carries on."

      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Interesting. Rachel to you there's a poll that came out from Reuters, and we're going to put it up on our screen, that showed that the most important issue currently for registered voters is immigration at 15 percent not out of majority, just out of plurality, well that a different poll but we'll roll with this anyway. Look at this, here we go, here's the poll we want 15 percent, however, for Democrats it's only seven percent it's their highest issue so it appears. And for Republicans 26 percent of Republicans believe that it's the most important issue. So a lot of intensity on the Republican side, less so on the Democratic side. It almost feels like the far extreme of the Democratic Party is driving this abolish ICE narrative and potentially in a really bad direction for that party."

I live in Middle America, I'll tell you what concerns people about the border and what's coming across the border, it's really about drugs. I'm mean Pete you're from the Midwest, you know where these forgotten communities are that are finally coming back thanks to the Trump economy but their still suffering because of so much drugs that are devastating our communities, devastating families. That's the majority that's coming over the southern border, that's important to them. Let me just say 127,000 undocumented criminals were arrested by ICE last year. Almost 2,000 of those were homicides, 78,000 of those arrests were for drug so, again, abolish ICE, what happens to those 127,000 criminal illegal immigrants?"

This was the zero policy at the border was going to tank his numbers. I'm going to put the poll up that we showed briefly earlier, it was the wrong one at first but now we'll get it right. Trump's approval rating among Hispanics since that policy has been in place has increased by 10 percent counter intuitive to costal elites, but to Hispanics that came here legally, it's offensive to think that immigration is the only issue that matters to them. The economy's improved, their lives are improving and they think lives ought to matter. Does that surprise you at all that the numbers have gone up so much?"

We're in a labor shortage in this country, the worst labor shortage we've had in the last hundred years for sure and we can't pass immigration, Congress is sitting there.

There is a reason why the Vice President is doubling down what the president said earlier. His speech this week he said, \"The Democrat Party wants anarchy\", that is absolutely true. This is where the Democrat Party are. They are the party of socialists, they are the party of anarchy and we have never had a President, a leader of the Republican Party with the, I don't want to use the word but you know what I'm talking about, the gumption to say the truth and it's resonating. People love law enforcement, people want rule of law including Hispanics which is why that poll, that you mentioned earlier, up by 10 percent. If you live in Central America you know exactly what happens when there is no rule of law. You know exactly what happens when you have a government that can't control its borders and can't control corruption. So yes this is a winning issue for the president, that is why he's doubling down on it. That is why the vice president is doubling down on it and the Democrats are fools to go with this abolish ICE message."

Let them filibuster, let them show the other side of that coin, let them show the double face, it'll make them filibuster."

      "utterance": "Thank you very much for your time, we appreciate it, fiery debate. Well coming up next, newly released memos that are raising questions about FBI pressure, institutional pressure, intentional pressure to investigate the Trump campaign. The new details you're not going to want to miss coming up next. Welcome back, we're just getting warmed up so stick with us. New light is being cast on FBI's efforts to investigate the Trump campaign. John Solomon's latest piece in the Hill Newspaper details internal bureau memos about the pressure applied to justice department investigators and their effort to get a warrant on former Trump campaign advisor Cater Page. An email exchange between infamous FBI agent Peter Strzok and his lover Lisa Page from October 14th of 2016, just a few weeks before the election. So is there desire to create talking points for the FBI Director Andrew Andy McCabe to help secure that permit. One email from Strzok reads in part and I quote, \"At minimum that keeps the hurry the `f' up pressure on McCabe\" and believe it or not that is just the tip of the iceberg. Joining us now with reaction is Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch. Tom thank you joining us this morning. We buried the lead on this, I'm going to put another quote up from Peter Strzok, this is from September 26 of 2016. He said and I quote, \"At a minimum, the letter that Carter Page wrote, provides us a pretext to interview him\", pretext is code for an excuse to interview Carter Page, how explosive is all this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIM FITTON, PRESIDENT OF THE JUDICIAL WATCH",
      "utterance": "Oh it's further the confirmation that the Trump Russian investigation wasn't affected by this hyper-political bias in President Trump where they were looking for excuses to target his team. He had Page write a letter complaining about an improper FBI leak and the response from one of the top FBI officials, \"Well let's use this as an excuse to bring him in and interview him\" And then they follow that up with the infamous Pfizer warrants which were supported which would never have been approved but for their reliance on the Clinton DNC Dossier. And then another aspect of this which is also in Solomon's piece is that right after the election the day after the election, President Trump's elected, they focus on, \"Well we have to get the people tied to Paul Manafort and compare notes and figure out what we're going to do there\" Well they thought Paul Manafort is being targeted, not because he did anything he did wrong, but the trigger is President Trump's election. Paul Manafort by the way, right now is in solitary confinement. President Trump should really think about ordering his justice department to at least this Mueller down or pause it, given all the corruption in its formation in the FBI in 2016."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Yes. You're referring to an email from Strzok to Page saying, \"We need all their names to scrub and we should give them ours for the same purposes\" Scrubbing after the election, never a good look. Carter Page was actually on this network a couple of hours ago on Tucker's program speaking for himself. Listen to what Carter Page said."

      "speaker": "CARTER PAGE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR",
      "utterance": "Tucker I couldn't imagine anything that I could potentially be charged with. Particularly after seeing John Solomon's article today, it just becomes, using the term from that quite that you had, pretext. The pretext was absolutely outrageous, ridiculous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "So they found a pretext, then they surveilled the guy for year. That sounds like a guy that's seems pretty confident they didn't found anything. Is this indeed the witch hunt the President accuses them of?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "Carter Page was a cooperating informant of the FBI and Strzok knew that, that's why the use the phrase `pretext' and the spying on Carter Page was a convenient vehicle to get at the Trump operation and who knows what other Pfizer warrants and applications were corruptly sent over to the court as well. Carter Page isn't going to be prosecuted, there is no Russia collusion and the only collusion that we're aware of with respect to Russia is Hillary Clinton using fusion GPS to gather Russian intelligence to smear Donald Trump. Mueller ought to be investigating how his investigation started if he's looking for Russia collusion."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "Oh there are no controls over Mueller practically speaking. Not only does he have other lawyers that he's hired, all of which are registered Democrats, no registered Republicans. He's actually going into the justice department and as needed using other resources informally. So that budget is just a pretend number because the justice department's at Mueller's beck and call, an out of control investigation that is really abusive in its targeting and of not only President Trump but people around him."

Two, in terms of the collusion question, we know that Donald Trump Junior, we know that Paul Manafort, we know that others, Kushner met with people who they believe to be representatives of the Russian government who were giving dirt on the Clintons. So whether there was a violation of criminal law, we don't know but there certainly is some smoke there. Let me just finish for one second, there had been 19 indictments of individuals. Three indictments of Trump campaign officials, five guilty pleas. The idea that this was some kind of bogus investigation is just ridiculous.

The left mounts a jaw dropping new defense of Maxine Waters and her feud with President Trump and you won't believe who they're throwing under the bus. We'll be back with that in a moment. Welcome back. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are now under fire from the left over their handling of President Trumps' feud with Maxine Waters. A letter signed by about 200 black female leaders and their allies, meaning men, blast Pelosi and Schumer for distancing themselves from the Congresswoman after she advocated the harassment of Trump officials. They're letter reads in part and I quote, \"Disparaging or failing to support Congressman Waters is a front to her and black women across the country and telegraphs a message that the Democratic Party can ill afford, that it does not respect black women's leadership and political power. And it discounts the impact of black women and millennial voters\" Not sure, not clear what millennial voters have to do with this but maybe we'll get to that. Have they not heard a single thing Congresswoman Waters has said recently? Joining us now with reaction, radio talk show host, and Fox News contributor Kevin Jackson, along with Erica Thomas, a Democratic State Representative for the state of Georgia, thank you both for joining us. Kevin I'm going to start with you. Maxine Waters has said, `Impeach 45.' She's talked about harassing Trump supporters, she said shoot straight, be careful, the wounded animal. Yet we can't criticize here, and these leaders say that she hasn't been defended sufficiently. What do you make this?"

Look, Maxine Waters has been one of the most incendiary people on the Democrats' side. She's now firmly representative of the left. And I can see why Schumer and Pelosi would distance themselves from her because she's strange beyond definition. And, look, she's reaping what she sowed over the years. So her wanting to impeach President Trump, who's done an amazing job for blacks, while watching those numbers drop -- and that's what Pelosi and Schumer watched. They've watched the black population slowly shift toward the Republicans. They've watched this walkaway movement from the Democrats take form. They've watched Hispanics -- we've seen the latest polls on them. They're for Trump. The millennials are for President Trump. Women are for President Trump. And the reason is very simple. Trump has performed. And looking at his record in comparison to Barack Obama, and Maxine Waters is living on the muscle memory of that, you're seeing the outcome."

Maxine Waters essentially put a target on the Trump administration employees and said it's OK to go after these people because their opinions differ. That's the crux of this whole thing.

Today the Trump administration slapped $34 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, with China immediately retaliating with tariffs of its own, targeting not just the U.S. but areas where Trump got the most support. But is President Trump actually winning this war already? There are signs of an increasingly weak Chinese economy. Meanwhile the U.S. Labor Department reported another strong month for American jobs in the economy in June. Joining us now with more is Tori Whiting of the Heritage Foundation along with Eric Beach, co-chair of the pro-Trump Great America PAC. Thank you for joining us this evening. Tori, so let me start with you. You're not a fan of this tariff strategy, but the administration would say, listen, we're fair traders and free traders, and the path to fair trade and free trade is staring down China and others who have had a slanted playing field.

We're having great jobs numbers coming out this week, and on top of that, good economic growth for two quarters last year. We saw growth above three percent for two quarters last year.

I think what President Trump represents, what he did in the campaign and what he's following through with as president is that he represents the America worker. The idea that we have this tax deficit that goes over, this tax money that comes from the workers that goes over and these big deficits with these other countries, $400 billion with China, is just irresponsible.

These are all good signs that something is being done that's working. Thank you both for your time this evening. Appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Will Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hold Kim Jong-un's feet to the fire and get North Korea to ditch their nukes? New details on the make or break, that's really what it is, these negotiations that are underway right now coming up next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Our Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushing for a breakthrough in denuclearization talks with North Korea. The secretary of state is meeting with top officials in the hermit kingdom, but fresh questions are now being raised about its commitment to actually ditch their nuclear weapons. There are new reports today that the hermit kingdom is working on a submarine capable of firing nuclear-armed missiles. Not a great sign. Joining us now to analyze is Gordon Chang, author of \"Nuclear Showdown, North Korea Takes on the world,\" along with David Tafuri, a former department official during the Obama administration. Thank you both for being here. Gordon, I'll start with you. You say they have got one shot, which the president has said. What has to happen on this trip for secretary of state? GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\": I think the secretary of state needs to come back with a written commitment from Kim saying, look, giving up nukes, giving up missiles, going to dismantle the weapons infrastructure, and agree to the most intrusive inspections regime on earth. We need this now because we've seen all the reports, not only the ones about the submarines, but also the increased production of fissile material, working on their plutonium reactor, which has no peaceful purpose, all the rest of it. So we need to know where Kim stands."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVID TAFURI, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL",
      "utterance": "Pete, I agree with Gordon. Pompeo has the hard work now of ironing out of the details of the agreement at the summit to denuclearize. That means he has to have a list of things that North Korea is going to do to denuclearize. And those have to be things that we can prove are happening, otherwise the President Trump and Pompeo cannot say that this is a success. I'm hopefully, I'm optimistic, but it means getting Kim Jong-un to really lock down on certainly things he's going to do, and then having him do those things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Gordon, David raises a good point. They've got to do it. What happens if, because we've seen these reports in the news media. They're still developing this, they're still doing that. What if we sign a great deal, Pompeo leaves, and then North Korea two or three weeks from now, it's clear that they're cheating, what do we do next?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "I think we go back to the maximum pressure campaign, which is the way Kim got to the bargaining table in the first place. So for instance that means tightening sanctions on North Korea, but more important, going after North Korea's major power sponsors, the Russians and the Chinese."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Is China being helpful right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "No. And President Trump actually intimated that when he said that after that second summit between Kim and Xi Jinping, the Chinese ruler, that the North Korean attitude became much more difficult. Chinese has been busting sanctions, very open about it. Chinese banks have continued to launder money for the North Koreans. And we have not imposed the costs on Beijing, and we've got to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. David, from the view of someone who worked for the Obama administration, do you feel like having folks that North Korea is worried about, whether it's John Bolton or Mike Pompeo, does that help at the table to help them realize if they don't do it they might see even more of the maximum pressure?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAFURI",
      "utterance": "I worked on the Obama campaign. I'm not sure if that helps or not. That may have gotten us to this point, especially some of the rhetoric by Trump. And Pompeo's real shuttle diplomacy which has been really effective. But right now the only thing that's going to result in actual progress is having North Korea actually demonstrate that it's pulling out of certain things. Now, we heard news this week that there's satellite imagery showing that North Korea is still using some of the nuclear sites, it's still actively using them. That's a bad sign, like the submarine example that you gave as well. So this is the hard work that Pompeo has to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. One of the things David just referred to is South Korean lawmaker said that it looks like they're developing a new submarine capable of launching nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. Is that a hedge in case this doesn't work, Gordon, or this is a thumbing of the nose?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "I think it's a thumbing of the nose. The North Koreans have been working on missiles launched from submarines for a very long time. They actually launched a missile from under the surface of Sea of the Japan August 24th, 2016. They have Russian technology to do this. So this has been a long-term project of theirs. I think now they're just accelerating what they've done before."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "David, I appreciate your fairmindedness on this as someone who has had to be defensive of certain things. As you look at the prospects of this deal, because we all want it to work, is it an over 50 percent chance that it happens, or are you pessimistic?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAFURI",
      "utterance": "I think it's 50 percent chance that this is going to move forward in a productive way, but I think it's real high stakes for the Trump administration because this is now their number one foreign policy objective, and they don't have much else to show on the foreign policy front other than North Korea, which could be fantastic if North Korea really does take legitimate, identifiable steps to denuclearize -- 50 percent."

The infamous Red Hen restaurant changing gears a bit. They tossed out Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Well, it reopened, and it's sounding a loud signal to anyone that may discriminate against Trump supporters. We're going to explain that, next."

    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",

Virginia's now infamous Red Hen restaurant which booted White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last month, reopened its doors last night, fully booked with full reservations. If discriminating against Trump officials, or his supporters, proves such a boon for the bottom line, are more places going to follow suit? Joining us now Cathy Areu, publisher of \"Catalina\" magazine along with Boston Herald columnist Ariana Cohen. Thank you both for being here. Cathy, OK, when I look at this, I see a bunch of left wingers who want to stand in solidarity with the resistance movement. They got reservations tonight, but they probably won't eat there tomorrow night. CATHY AREU, PUBLISHER OF \"CATALINA\" MAGAZINE: Why not?"

      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "Resistance is making a statement. It's the American way. And apparently it is good for business. I didn't think it was a good move kicking her out. I thought that was very un-American. I thought as an owner, we should support our customers. But it seems to be working. So it's good for business here."

      "speaker": "ADRIANA COHEN, BOSTON HERALD COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "It's really, really destructive, and it's disgraceful. First of all, it's textbook discrimination, which is wrong. It's a violation of Sarah Sanders' free speech and other Americans who have been harassed and accosted in public. And it's just un-American. We're a democracy that has a plurality of political parties. And so what does the left want exactly? Do they want to be a one-party state? Do they want to abolish the First Amendment? All Americans have a right to vote for whoever the heck they want, and they're allowed to use their free speech. And it's a violation of all Americans' rights when you can't eat in a restaurant for simply using your constitutionally protected free speech every election cycle. It is a disgrace. And I don't know how this is going to be a winning tactic for Democrats come November."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "That's a good point, I don't feel like it is a winning point. But Cathy, you are famously Tucker's Sherpa, and I want you to help me into the liberal mind. A, I couldn't even fathom confronting a member of a Democratic member of an administration that way, and, B, or saying I'm going to go to that restaurant and stand with the person that confronted them. Why does the thinking go in that direction on the left?"

      "utterance": "Maxine Waters came after the tweeter in chief. I mean, his behavior has been awful. He called Latinos horrible names. He started a long time ago. He's been saying horrible things on Twitter for years, at least five years. So it seems like the left is tired of maybe being the nice guy, and they're following their leader. And their leader is saying awful things. So they're just learning and taking it from the top."
    },

      "utterance": "Oh, it's so ridiculous. The left has been such hypocrites. They preach diversity, they preach tolerance, but they're none of the above. If the liberals were truly tolerant they could handle other people with different viewpoints. Yes, our country has a plurality of different opinions and political parties. They should respect that. And it's funny that the left can't handle some nonpolitically correct comments from President Trump, but -- and they get very upset when a gay couple, a cake isn't baked for them, but when Sarah Sanders, a working professional mom, gets kicked out of a restaurant, how many liberal lawmakers stood silent?"
