Among other things, Zelenskyy demanded the United States shoot down Russian aircraft over his country. The White House has not yet agreed to do that, but things do seem to be moving very rapidly in that direction. Not long after Zelenskyy's address, Joe Biden announced the United States will send a total of at least a billion dollars of weapons to Ukraine, just this week. Members of Congress in both parties then emerged to say they don't think that's enough. Watch.",

Salazar is a longtime news anchor from Miami, who a little over a year ago was elected to Congress as a Republican. She now sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee. A week ago, a reporter from \"The Grayzone\" asked Salazar what she thought of a no-fly zone. Here is what she said:",

At this point, no wants to say it out loud. But it is true. At this point, a shooting war with Russia seems inevitable. How could war with Russia not be inevitable? Virtually everyone with power is for it. We remain against it. We think that joining a war in Eastern Europe will hurt this country. Though, to be clear, when and if that war starts, we will be praying passionately for America's total victory. Unlike so many in the foreign policy establishment, we love this country, above all, and we mean it. But in the meantime, while the United States is still technically at peace, we thought it would be worth asking people who are calling for war, if they have considered in detail what a war would mean for this country. Congresswoman Maria Salazar was gracious enough to accept our invitation to come on the show. We're grateful she did. She joins us tonight. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on.",

We've had the G.O.P. when we had control of the House and the Senate for the first two years of the Trump administration vote against constructing a border wall. The woman I'm running against Jaime Herrera Beutler, who is a Republican, she voted against that as well. She has voted for amnesty every time it's been on the docket. But yet, we're supposed to hit the pause button and listen to some foreign leader on the floor of our Congress, tell us what we need to do for him to secure his country, and I sympathize with his country. I really do. I think he's fighting valiantly. I think Vladimir Putin is a horrible person. But it is an extremely fair thing to ask our elected officials who are asking us to fund this war, potentially send people off to die, because that's what a no-fly zone is. That puts us in a war with Russia in short order. So she feels so passionately, if any of these representatives feel so passionately about how we have to go and save the Ukrainians and provide enough lethal aid, and continue to push this escalation, they need to go back to their districts and tell the American people, tell their constituents what they're asking them to do and what the ramifications potentially could be.

But yet we see them have these massive press conferences, stand by these Ukrainian flags and say that they want to stand with people from another country and that's just not what they're supposed to do. We could potentially do both things at the same time. I'm very cautious about this war escalation. I don't think we've really explained to the American people what we're asking them to do, and no one is really amplifying the fact that there is a peace offer on the table. But we're leading Zelenskyy on and leading them down the path to further slaughter and not encouraging them to follow this path of diplomacy. The war drums are beating very heavily, because look, it's a great distraction from the political crisis. It rallies everybody around the military industrial complex and the media complex as well.

But this evening, an Appeals Court ruled that Jussie Smollett can go home while he works to get his conviction overturned, because he's not a Trump voter. He's not one of those January 6 guys rotting in solitary for more than a year. Who is Jussie Smollett? He's a famous actor. Smollett's attorney said the appeals process will take longer than 150 days. So it's only fair to let him out as the appeal works its way through the system because again, he is a Hillary man. They also argued Smollett was in danger in the Cook County Jail, even though he was in solitary confinement, he could have beaten himself up again. Apparently, those arguments took the day, so Jussie Smollett is back home tonight. So, it's been exactly two years since our political leadership imposed the first mass quarantine in American history on the population, China style lockdowns and over the course of those two years, a lot of our basic civil liberties eroded completely.

Congress shall make no law prohibiting freedom of assembly or the right of citizens to petition the government for a redress of grievances. That said, D.C. is a weird anomaly. It's arguable that Congress didn't make a law about what's happening. But I think a judge would certainly find that it's unconstitutional that people are being deprived of their rights, if the cops are arresting people for assembling, and as you rightly point out, we have a great history going back to the founding of our country. I mean, the Boston Tea Party was a protest. You know, the March on Washington, Vietnam War marches, you know, the pussy hat marches, I mean, marching -- petitioning government for redress of grievances is what we do as Americans. So you're right to notice and I wish more people in the media and in government noticed how catastrophically yet another benchmark of losing our rights and scarily being kind of handed over to arrest like the Canadian truckers, to misuse, to abuse, to restrictions, to punishment this represents. It's a whole new level of stripping us of our rights and freedoms as free people.",

And there is a much greater recognition that our country does not mean this, our country means something entirely different and they watch the burning up of the Constitution bit by bit with horror. Now, should everybody be aware? Yes. You know, should we all be kind of out in the street arresting people who have seized our liberties? These are unlawful acts, right? Having trials peacefully protesting, taking our country back? Yes. And I'm just going to remind everyone of one more thing, which is the Declaration of Independence doesn't say, sit around, watch television, you know, while people crush your sovereign liberty. It says, it is your job as Americans to rise up, you know, peacefully, ideally against tyrants. And hopefully, we're peacefully doing that.

But it's interesting, the second Chris Cuomo is out on his tail, the first person arguing to cut him off from his severance is Don Lemon. Don Lemon is saying in CNN meetings, don't pay this guy. He doesn't deserve a dime. And so Chris Cuomo, which you know, maybe he had some affection, boy, he's been betrayed now. And so what he's done is filed this lawsuit. And in it, he has declared something we know to be true as well, these reports that behind the scenes, Don Lemon was advising Jussie Smollett that the police in Chicago didn't believe him.

Well, the Biden administration has just announced that they get to stay in this country for at least another 18 months, which of course as you know, means forever. According to D.H.S., the announcement will quote \"Help protect Afghan nationals from returning to unsafe conditions,\" as if we don't have unsafe conditions in this country. Again, some of these are great people who helped the United States, some of them aren't. It doesn't matter. They're all allowed to stay because they're not American. That's it for us tonight. Don't forget a brand new episode of \"Tucker Carlson Today\" with Chief Craig. We will see you tomorrow. Have a great night. Content and Programming Copyright 2022 Fox News Network, LLC.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed Members of Congress today in a long and at times moving speech. Among other things, Zelenskyy demanded the United States shoot down Russian aircraft over his country. The White House has not yet agreed to do that, but things do seem to be moving very rapidly in that direction. Not long after Zelenskyy's address, Joe Biden announced the United States will send a total of at least a billion dollars of weapons to Ukraine, just this week. Members of Congress in both parties then emerged to say they don't think that's enough. Watch."

      "speaker": "REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA)",

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So things are changing very fast. For weeks, leaders in Washington told us that an American backed no-fly zone in Ukraine would be unwise because it would amount to an act of war against the nuclear armed Russia. As you can see, those views have evolved -- a lot. But in fairness, Congresswoman Maria Salazar got their first. Salazar is a longtime news anchor from Miami, who a little over a year ago was elected to Congress as a Republican. She now sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee. A week ago, a reporter from \"The Grayzone\" asked Salazar what she thought of a no-fly zone. Here is what she said:"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "So you don't know what a no-fly zone will mean, if you have to shoot down Russian planes? I mean --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "Of course."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I don't know what it will mean, but you know, freedom is not free. Now we made fun of that answer last week when we first showed you that clip. But now what we mocked is the consensus in Washington, we don't know what's going to happen, but we've got to do it immediately. That's the argument you're hearing. At this point, no wants to say it out loud. But it is true. At this point, a shooting war with Russia seems inevitable. How could war with Russia not be inevitable? Virtually everyone with power is for it. We remain against it. We think that joining a war in Eastern Europe will hurt this country. Though, to be clear, when and if that war starts, we will be praying passionately for America's total victory. Unlike so many in the foreign policy establishment, we love this country, above all, and we mean it. But in the meantime, while the United States is still technically at peace, we thought it would be worth asking people who are calling for war, if they have considered in detail what a war would mean for this country. Congresswoman Maria Salazar was gracious enough to accept our invitation to come on the show. We're grateful she did. She joins us tonight. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on."

      "utterance": "I think that's a hypothetical question. I think that we should concentrate, Tucker in what Zelenskyy asked Congress today, which is --"

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I'm sorry -- I can't -- and I am in no way trying to cut you off, but I can't let you laud over that. You said we should shoot down Russian planes. That's of course war. Since you've called for that, and you are a member of Congress --"

      "speaker": "SALAZAR",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "I didn't say that. That was taken -- yes, but that was taken out of context. Because I said, of course, that I know what that means. I was - - that interview was not very well conducted and that's why I'm here because I want to clarify my position."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Okay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "And my position is that we should not take the no-fly zone off the table. But before that, that's two, we need to do one and one is to give Zelenskyy exactly what he is asking for. No troops on the ground. Let's give him the MiGs and the S-300, what he needs to defend his own air airspace, so he will create his own no-fly zone. And that's what I think we should have done months ago. It's embarrassing that this guy, this President, who is under the bullets has come to Congress to beg for us to give him something that we should have done a long time ago. That's my position."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COOPER",
      "utterance": "Okay. Let me be clear when you say we should give President Zelenskyy what he is asking for he demanded today. I think you were there that the United States enforce the no-fly zone, so you are for denying him that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "Well, but he also said, and then we can give you alternatives, since we know that that should not be taken off the table, and I repeat it, I do believe that we should go to Plan A, which is to give them all the military weapons that he is asking for because if we do not --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think a lot of people sympathize with that. Let me just say, I think a lot of people who saw President Zelenskyy's speech today and who have seen the atrocities in Ukraine, feel deep sympathy for the Ukrainian people, and want this to end, I'm certainly among them."

      "speaker": "SALAZAR",

I represent District number 27, where you have millions of Cuban-Americans, and I'm representing what we think we know that we acquire peace through strength. Look at what happened in 1960, Fidel Castro and JFK."

But my question is, if we are providing weapons to one side in a war, I think it's fair to ask maybe the other side would say that's an act of war against us. And if that happens, then what next? And to not think about that seems negligent. But since you're on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I know that you have thought it through. So tell me your views on what would happen next."

So what is the difference between that and the MiGs and the S-300s? What's the difference? I mean, you have to understand that we are unfortunately, the United States, has fallen into the Vladimir Putin's trap. He is the one dictating what we're going to do, what we're not going to do. He said, we do not want -- we are imposing a no fly zone over Ukraine, and we are abiding --"
    },

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

A lot of people believe he's crazy, including some informed people, including many Russians. So we know he is volatile and we know that he's heavily -- how many nuclear weapons by the way does Russia have, do you know?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "Of course, that we are very concerned, and we're also concerned that he may be throwing a biological weapon against the Ukrainians within the next few hours, because he cannot take Kyiv or Kyiv as he thought he was going to. So of course, that we are confronting a dictator, but I think that we should put this into context. And I thank you very much that you're giving me the opportunity."

Because if we do not confront bad actors with strength, then we're going to have China and Russia and Iran and Fidel, and Venezuela and Nicaragua, they are watching what we are doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Hold on, but if -- and needless to say, I've made that argument, you know, for 30 years on television, the question is, are we doing it with all available risks known to the population in whose name we're doing it? So I'm asking you, what do you think the chances are, and I'm sure you've gained this out as remember the Foreign Affairs Committee that Putin uses nuclear weapon against the United States in response to this, what would you calculate the chance of that?"

    },

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "But what do you think the like -- I mean, our viewers are I am sure supporting you. I think most conservatives are on your side, but I just think they should know what the informed view of the likelihood of a retaliatory nuclear strike from Vladimir Putin is. What would you assess it as being?"

And that is the problem that I believe I'm not sure if you share in my view, that you obtain peace, you obtain this -- you can -- they take the other power away from Putin, if you show strength to put in a more layman's term."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So, do you believe that's true? So President Zelenskyy said yesterday that he is considering declaring that Ukraine would not join NATO, in exchange for having Russian troops withdraw from his country? Would you describe this as President Zelenskyy speaking, would you describe that as --"

      "speaker": "SALAZAR",

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Wait a minute. Hold on, please don't dodge the question. Is that -- would that be an answer you'd be satisfied with if Zelenskyy made good on what he just suggested that we agreed to neutrality, will relinquish claims to Crimea and the Russians leave, would that be okay with you? Would you consider that an honorable exit? Or would you consider it a display of weakness?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "If Zelenskyy comes to the United States Congress, and he says that this is the best path forward, we are no one to say something to the contrary, but I don't think he's going to say that, so we're creating scenarios here that are hypothetical."

We needed a reality check on all of that, so we are happy to be joined by him now. Joe Kent, thanks so much for coming on. I just want to say again, that we're grateful that Congresswoman Salazar was game enough to come on the show. I appreciate that very, very much. But I couldn't help but notice with respect, the difference in the urgency and people are dying in Ukraine in ways that are horrifying, and I concede that. But we've had a slow motion invasion to the tune of tens of millions of people for like more than a decade, and it is accelerating. So why does no one in Washington seem to care about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOE KENT (R), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE FOR WASHINGTON STATE",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it's very frustrating, Tucker. I mean, we've seen this unchecked illegal immigration coming across our borders. Most recently, inspired by Joe Biden. We've had the G.O.P. when we had control of the House and the Senate for the first two years of the Trump administration vote against constructing a border wall. The woman I'm running against Jaime Herrera Beutler, who is a Republican, she voted against that as well. She has voted for amnesty every time it's been on the docket. But yet, we're supposed to hit the pause button and listen to some foreign leader on the floor of our Congress, tell us what we need to do for him to secure his country, and I sympathize with his country. I really do. I think he's fighting valiantly. I think Vladimir Putin is a horrible person. But it is an extremely fair thing to ask our elected officials who are asking us to fund this war, potentially send people off to die, because that's what a no-fly zone is. That puts us in a war with Russia in short order. So she feels so passionately, if any of these representatives feel so passionately about how we have to go and save the Ukrainians and provide enough lethal aid, and continue to push this escalation, they need to go back to their districts and tell the American people, tell their constituents what they're asking them to do and what the ramifications potentially could be. All we're asking is to be informed as to what our government is doing, and to have it be a two-way dialogue. Why do foreign nations always come first? Why do we secure their borders and not our own?"

But wouldn't it be stunning to see Kevin McCarthy stand up at some sort of emergency press conference and say, you know, we just had it, this is really hurting our country. Hundred thousand people died of drug ODs last year, driven by our open borders. We're not putting up with it. We're sending the U.S. military, it's a volunteer -- anybody serving in uniform who wants to do it can. How thrilling would that be? How hard would that be to say something like that?"

Why Republicans aren't calling the people at the American people's attention to this crisis and showing us that they're working to solve it is beyond me. I don't understand it. But yet we see them have these massive press conferences, stand by these Ukrainian flags and say that they want to stand with people from another country and that's just not what they're supposed to do. We could potentially do both things at the same time. I'm very cautious about this war escalation. I don't think we've really explained to the American people what we're asking them to do, and no one is really amplifying the fact that there is a peace offer on the table. But we're leading Zelenskyy on and leading them down the path to further slaughter and not encouraging them to follow this path of diplomacy. The war drums are beating very heavily, because look, it's a great distraction from the political crisis. It rallies everybody around the military industrial complex and the media complex as well.

And once again the Ukrainian military showing it can do some real damage to Russian hardware. This time, we see some video that seems to show three Russian helicopters blown up at an airfield in the southern city of Kherson, that's put that at about thousand the number of vehicles and aircraft that have been destroyed just in three weeks.

Convicted hate crime hoaxer, Jussie Smollett was just sentenced to jail, and now, he has been released from jail or is about to be. He was just a few days in to his 150-day sentence. But this evening, an Appeals Court ruled that Jussie Smollett can go home while he works to get his conviction overturned, because he's not a Trump voter. He's not one of those January 6 guys rotting in solitary for more than a year. Who is Jussie Smollett? He's a famous actor. Smollett's attorney said the appeals process will take longer than 150 days. So it's only fair to let him out as the appeal works its way through the system because again, he is a Hillary man. They also argued Smollett was in danger in the Cook County Jail, even though he was in solitary confinement, he could have beaten himself up again. Apparently, those arguments took the day, so Jussie Smollett is back home tonight. So, it's been exactly two years since our political leadership imposed the first mass quarantine in American history on the population, China style lockdowns and over the course of those two years, a lot of our basic civil liberties eroded completely. We barely even remember them. We used to be able to say what we wanted and congregate together and worship freely. But no, and in fact, they are eroding still further. Tonight politicians are shutting off access to the nation's capital city because they don't want to be criticized by protesters because protests never happened in Washington.

It's arguable that Congress didn't make a law about what's happening. But I think a judge would certainly find that it's unconstitutional that people are being deprived of their rights, if the cops are arresting people for assembling, and as you rightly point out, we have a great history going back to the founding of our country. I mean, the Boston Tea Party was a protest. You know, the March on Washington, Vietnam War marches, you know, the pussy hat marches, I mean, marching -- petitioning government for redress of grievances is what we do as Americans. So you're right to notice and I wish more people in the media and in government noticed how catastrophically yet another benchmark of losing our rights and scarily being kind of handed over to arrest like the Canadian truckers, to misuse, to abuse, to restrictions, to punishment this represents.

They notice, but they think it's okay, because it's people like them who are giving the orders and that is chilling. I mean, history is full of people thinking that restrictive or tyrannical or abusive orders are okay if it's their own kind of people. It is people who look like them, talk like them, worship like them. In the red states, where I also travel among conservatives and libertarians, who are some of my new friends, people are horrified. And there is a much greater recognition that our country does not mean this, our country means something entirely different and they watch the burning up of the Constitution bit by bit with horror. Now, should everybody be aware? Yes. You know, should we all be kind of out in the street arresting people who have seized our liberties? These are unlawful acts, right? Having trials peacefully protesting, taking our country back? Yes. And I'm just going to remind everyone of one more thing, which is the Declaration of Independence doesn't say, sit around, watch television, you know, while people crush your sovereign liberty. It says, it is your job as Americans to rise up, you know, peacefully, ideally against tyrants. And hopefully, we're peacefully doing that.

You know, they take it out of your soul when you sign your contract. So we kind of like that. That was 2019. Oh, but that's all over and the breakup is nasty. Today, Chris Cuomo accused former colleagues at CNN, including Don Lemon, and the eunuch of smearing him."

      "speaker": "In a court filing, Chris Cuomo's lawyers wrote this, quote",

Chris Cuomo, by the way, is asking for $125 million from CNN. We don't want to get involved. But obviously we're rooting for him. Vince Coglianese is a radio show host in D.C., one of the top rated. We're happy to have him join us. So Vince, there's something very poignant about seeing the buddies break up, the Rat Pack dissolve after all these years, what do you make of it?"

      "speaker": "VINCE COGLIANESE, RADIO SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, everything about it was a lie. I mean, it's like, it's so crazy. You know, I always think that first of all about television news, and certainly about the left probably just the transactional nature of these relationships. Like here is what really was going on. I mean, Chris Cuomo was the only guy who had any semblance of ratings of CNN, Don Lemon would have him on his show for a huge portion of the show during what we call the handoff, and the reason for that was because Don Lemon desperately needed ratings' help, so the two of them would act like they love each other and they'd do this giant segment together. But it's interesting, the second Chris Cuomo is out on his tail, the first person arguing to cut him off from his severance is Don Lemon. Don Lemon is saying in CNN meetings, don't pay this guy. He doesn't deserve a dime. And so Chris Cuomo, which you know, maybe he had some affection, boy, he's been betrayed now. And so what he's done is filed this lawsuit. And in it, he has declared something we know to be true as well, these reports that behind the scenes, Don Lemon was advising Jussie Smollett that the police in Chicago didn't believe him. He was secretly tipping off Jussie Smollett information that he had."

      "speaker": "So Cuomo is going",

They said like there is some thought that maybe we can make it a news network. Not if all of your top talent has just been devastated of its credibility by the guy you just fired. They've got a lot of turnover to undertake to fix."

Can they get this man, this Soros-backed disaster out of offices? An exclusive report on that is coming up next."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Two years ago with help from George Soros, a self-described revolutionary called George Gascon became the District Attorney in Los Angeles. Since that time, Los Angeles has fallen apart. Gascon has refused to enforce the law and backed criminals. To sum it up in a single sentence, for the first time in a hundred years, train robbery is now an epidemic in LA, in the middle of the day. So it appears that finally the long suffering citizens of the Great City of Los Angeles have had enough. FOX's Bill Melugin has the story for us tonight. Hey Bill."

      "speaker": "BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Tucker. Well the campaigns of Recall DA George Gascon says it is well on track now to get the recall qualified on the ballot. They announced today they have already collected 125,000.00 petitions and have raised $3.5 million. Now, this campaign started collecting signatures back in early February, and they say return petitions are now increasing exponentially every single week. They say the momentum is on their side and that Gascon is quote, \"running scared.\" We all remember Gascon issued a series of criminal friendly directives literally the moment he took office. He refuses to prosecute gun or gang enhancements. He dismantled the office's Gang Unit. He doesn't believe in cash bail, the death penalty, or life without parole. He has refused to prosecute juveniles as adults, no matter how heinous their crimes are. Gascon recently admitted he got it wrong when he refused to prosecute 26-year-old transgender child molester, James Tubbs as an adult. That's a decision that allowed Tubbs to avoid any prison time or even having to register as a sex offender, which he boasted about in an in- custody phone call with his dad. Take a listen."

      "utterance": "So we decided to look a little deeper into George Gascon. One man backed by George shores really did wreck a city, the second biggest in the United States, a beautiful, very American city, Los Angeles. So we're about to premiere Season Two of \"Tucker Carlson Originals,\" our documentary series. And in our first episode, we sent a team to LA on the story. What they found is really unbelievable. We'll show it to you very soon. There's some political leaders in this country who still believe in the rule of law and they want to bring it back. James Craig is one of them. He was a longtime police chief in a bunch of cities, finally in Detroit, where he is from. Detroit was one of the very few cities in the Upper Midwest that did not have riots after George Floyd died. Now, Craig is running for Governor of Michigan. We spoke to him for a brand new episode of \"Tucker Carlson Today.\" He told us about his very first time walking the foot beat as a police officer. Here's part of it."

That's what they do to the rookies, walking the foot beat with another classmate. He was 18, by that time I was 20. And so I got my first opportunity to ride in a scout car -- police car. So I'm excited. So I show up. And by the way, the precinct that I was assigned out of the Academy was the same precinct my dad volunteered at during the civil unrest. The 10th Precinct."

      "speaker": "CRAIG",

He said, \"I don't want you here.\" He said, \"In fact, you do one thing, sit over there. You're not going to drive the car, don't touch the radio. Just sit there and be Black.\""

And the only way you do that is stay with it.\" And I thought about it. I mean, hard. He made a good point. I went back to work. Things got increasingly better. But it dawned on me even as now a 20-year-old new officer in the Detroit Police Department. I said, as a police officer, I can affect only so much change. You know, maybe I work in a neighborhood and do good in a neighborhood. I said, but the only way to affect and make wholesale change, I have to be a Police Chief. But my point was instead of seeking solutions. Hey, you, police officers on the ground, what do we need to do? Help us understand. How are you received? It wasn't that kind of welcome. It wasn't a welcome at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And so that really made me start to reflect even then",
      "utterance": "Why am I Democrat? I mean, I grew up conservative and I know having worked in communities throughout my now 44 years of service. Here is what I knew: People who live in vulnerable communities, particularly communities of color, they like the police. They want the police."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRAIG",
      "utterance": "But it's shameful today that these progressives, these socialists, the elected, I don't want to call them servants of people, they are political servants. They don't care about people in these communities. And here is the beauty of my candidacy, and I get asked this question all the time as I travel Michigan. \"Well, Chief you know, Republicans don't do well in Southeast Michigan, particularly Detroit.\" I say, \"That's true.\" I say, \"But we have an opportunity. I served in that city as their Chief for eight years. I'm branded in Detroit. The principles I've stood on transparency, honesty, making decisions, keeping Detroit safe. Was it easy? No. But I built a great team and we got it done.\" We built relationships with communities. Those folks are not going to forget. There's not a day that goes by if I'm in an eatery in Detroit and somebody will walk up to me and say, you know, I'm a Democrat, but I'm voting for you. I'm voting for you because I trust you."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "James Craig, former Police Chief of Detroit, now running for Governor of Michigan. That interview is on FOX Nation. It's worth watching. Jussie Smollett is about to walk out of jail any moment now, unlike the January 6th defendants. What happened to equal justice? We've got more, next."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So you're seeing pictures on the screen of the debacle that was our withdrawal from Afghanistan that humiliated the country and made the Taliban one of the best armed militaries in the region. Oh, but it gets worse. Because tens of thousands of Afghan refugees came here directly after and some of them are good people, some of them weren't. We don't know because a lot of them weren't vetted. In February, a report by the DoD's Inspector General found that some of these refugees had quote \"latent fingerprints on improvised explosive devices.\" In other words, they were literally terrorists trying to kill Americans. At least 50 were identified as suspected terrorists. So what happens to all these Afghan refugees now? Well, the Biden administration has just announced that they get to stay in this country for at least another 18 months, which of course as you know, means forever. According to D.H.S., the announcement will quote \"Help protect Afghan nationals from returning to unsafe conditions,\" as if we don't have unsafe conditions in this country. Again, some of these are great people who helped the United States, some of them aren't. It doesn't matter. They're all allowed to stay because they're not American. That's it for us tonight. Don't forget a brand new episode of \"Tucker Carlson Today\" with Chief Craig. We will see you tomorrow. Have a great night. Content and Programming Copyright 2022 Fox News Network, LLC.
