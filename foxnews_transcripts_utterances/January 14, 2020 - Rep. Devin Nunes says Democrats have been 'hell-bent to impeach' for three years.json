If they decide to dismiss on those grounds, I believe that under the case of Nixon, that is Walter and not Richard Nixon be United States. The Supreme Court cannot question that. In other words it's a political question the Supreme Court will not second guess. So my first answer to your question is there is no doubt the Senate can do this that, that will be considered a trial because the Supreme Court has said we don't look into whether something's a trial or not.

Yesterday The New York Times reported, \"Russian military hackers have been boring into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma at the center of the impeachment affair, according to security experts.\" So you might wonder, who are these security experts? It turns out, it's a company called Area 1 cofounded by Democrat donor Oren Falkowitz. Also the Washington Examiner reporting that Area 1 is actively working with the campaigns of 2020 Democrats. What? Somehow the paper either record failed to mention those insignificant details, a conflict of interest maybe, or found them totally unimportant. Either way, it's embarrassing. But forget that antiquated idea of checking sources, potential conflicts before you run with a story. Liberal pundits were all too happy to run back to Russia.",

This looks a lot like a planted story meant to pre-spin the 2020 election and maybe even provide cover to Democrat frontrunner Joe Biden should any inconvenient details come out. If they come out, they can just say, see, it's Russia. But let's consider for a moment the worst-case scenario, that the Russians did hack Burisma. All it proves is that, first of all, Hunter Biden should never have gotten involved with a corrupt company that has lax security procedures and is susceptible to these types of intrusions, especially while his father was the sitting vice president. Here now with me, acclaimed investigative journalist, FOX Nation host, Lara Logan. Lara, Noah Shachtman, \"The Daily Beast\" editor-in-chief, tweeted about \"The New York Times\" story, saying \"I hope my fellow editors will think hard, really hard, a lot harder than they did in 2016, before publishing any material hacked by the Russians.\" It seems they haven't learned a lot from the first Russia scare. They are saying basically that because there was a report from a source that Russia hacked into Burisma, that anything that comes out about Burisma and Joe Biden should basically just be discounted.

An actual trial is only necessary if preceded by a legitimate indictment. That didn't happen here. The process and the House were infected by partisan taint and defective legal arguments.

He can't do this he is abusing his power, so would that count to as an article of impeachment? Is he how wide berth this is? The President acted squarely with his article one powers and his telephone conversation with Ukrainian President. Ukrainian President himself said he felt no pressure, no quid pro quo.

This is all a dangerous distraction and McConnell should continue to call it out as such. Oh, and Mitt Romney and the other folks who are wobbly may be, Mitt Romney has the opportunity to be a hero here. Yes, I said hero. He had a handful of the other wavering Republican Senators have the power to preserve the legitimacy and the check of impeachment. Allowing new witnesses into the process at this point, it only empowers the partisans that began this madness from the beginning! The constitutional deficiency is obvious on its face. I think Romney knows that. It's imperative that they stop the Democratic Senators itching for a show trial. Allowing this impeachment to go forward only serves to set a poisonous precedent for future Commanders in Chief long after Trump is gone. So this is a time for the GOP to stand together. Just like they did in the face of the Kavanaugh smears. Lending any legitimacy to the Houses acidic article would burn a hole through the constitution and frankly, the Senate's legacy and that's \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Joining me now is Bob Barr Former Clinton House Impeachment Manager along with Sol Wisenberg Former Deputy Whitewater Independent Counsel and John Eastman Claremont Institute Senior Fellow and Constitutional Scholar. Gentleman we have a lot to get through tonight. Fox News is confirming that Mitch McConnell met today with GOP Senators to discuss trial strategies including the idea of witness reciprocity with Democrats basically, will trade you a Hunter Biden for a John Bolton. John, is this kind of a cutesy game? Mitch McConnell is very smart he knows the Senate procedure better than anybody on the Hill. Knowing that Democrats are never going to allow Hunter Biden or may be the whistleblower or Adam Schiff to testify, thoughts John?"

      "utterance": "Well, I think so, but if we're going to go forward with the trial it would be really interesting to hear from those folks. We have got enough evidence to show that there was collusion between Schiff and the whistleblower months before the call to try and set this up. We have got enough evidence to know that Hunter Biden was in a sweetheart deal getting money. We heard from your opening monologue, they keep saying nobody is above the law. That would include Hunter Biden and Joe Biden. It makes a perfectly legitimate for the President to want to look into that sweet heart deal. So all of these things ought to be on the table but even more importantly the whole scandal where, if it is illegitimate for the President to ask for foreign help and an investigation of U.S. citizens, then where is the talk about the Obama Administration investigation of Paul Manafort or the use of the FBI to spy on the Trump campaign? I still remain of the view that this whole charade is designed to provide cover and hide that most phenomenal, political scandal in American history."

      "speaker": "SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",

Either on the theory that the impeachment articles on their face do not allege an impeachable crime. Or on the theory that we've looked at all the evidence from the House and that does improve an impeachable crime. If they decide to dismiss on those grounds, I believe that under the case of Nixon, that is Walter and not Richard Nixon be United States. The Supreme Court cannot question that. In other words it's a political question the Supreme Court will not second guess. So my first answer to your question is there is no doubt the Senate can do this that, that will be considered a trial because the Supreme Court has said we don't look into whether something's a trial or not. That's up to the Senate alone."

And your idea of having a motion to dismiss is I mean it is so obviously the right thing to do for the Republicans that one wonders why there is all of this daily data lying around by some of the Republicans? It just takes a majority vote. They have more than the majority. Do it, get it over with. If the Democrats want to try and take it to the courts and have the court slapped their hand, that's fine.

And then Schiff is going to - this is a joke. This is terrible for the future of our country. It might be good for us we're going to have gangbusters ratings next week.

      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, and as you pointed out in your opening monologue, the claims of obstruction of Congress for the President, asserting his rights as an executive, he doesn't work for the Congress. This is not a parliamentary system. He has his own independent authority from the constitution directly from us the American people. What the House of Representatives are, second article of impeachment is trying to upset that balance and completely shift power back away from the executive. We have a unitary executive for a very important reason. It really is starting to threaten the entire infrastructure of our constitutional system."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Sol, when we read the reporting about Nancy Pelosi calling Mitch McConnell, a Russian asset. I'm paraphrasing. That is basically what she said. She said he has Kremlin connections it is going along with the far left radical hash tag about this that's been flying around Twitter. That also speaks to the underlying raw tear. This is a partisan attack, it is an extension of the failed Mueller probe and they're trying to go back and whip it all again try to get him out of office. I just think her comments alone tanked this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WISENBERG",
      "utterance": "Well, I believe when the history of this is looked at, Speaker Pelosi is not going to look very good. The reason for that, Senator McConnell, I don't always agree with him but I think he really hit the nail on the head. They did not take this process seriously. When you impeach a President, it's serious. You don't get up one day hold a press conference and say, we're now doing impeachment. You pass a resolution that says we're going to do an impeachment inquiry. You do it early enough to let people go to the courts and test whether or not they have to come and testify. They could have subpoenaed McGahn for the impeachment much earlier. They could have subpoenaed Bolton for the impeachment and the courts would have expedited this schedule and the courts would have decided. So on that question, I really believe history will show in the whole idea of her holding it for the last two weeks will show that she made a lot of tactical and strategic mistakes but all in all, she was not a serious person. And I think the judgment of history on her will be devastating."

Of course, the press happily joins in, and they relentlessly fan the flames of this new red scare. And now they think they have a new in. Yesterday The New York Times reported, \"Russian military hackers have been boring into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma at the center of the impeachment affair, according to security experts.\" So you might wonder, who are these security experts? It turns out, it's a company called Area 1 cofounded by Democrat donor Oren Falkowitz. Also the Washington Examiner reporting that Area 1 is actively working with the campaigns of 2020 Democrats. What? Somehow the paper either record failed to mention those insignificant details, a conflict of interest maybe, or found them totally unimportant. Either way, it's embarrassing.

This looks a lot like a planted story meant to pre-spin the 2020 election and maybe even provide cover to Democrat frontrunner Joe Biden should any inconvenient details come out. If they come out, they can just say, see, it's Russia. But let's consider for a moment the worst-case scenario, that the Russians did hack Burisma. All it proves is that, first of all, Hunter Biden should never have gotten involved with a corrupt company that has lax security procedures and is susceptible to these types of intrusions, especially while his father was the sitting vice president. Here now with me, acclaimed investigative journalist, FOX Nation host, Lara Logan. Lara, Noah Shachtman, \"The Daily Beast\" editor-in-chief, tweeted about \"The New York Times\" story, saying \"I hope my fellow editors will think hard, really hard, a lot harder than they did in 2016, before publishing any material hacked by the Russians.\" It seems they haven't learned a lot from the first Russia scare.

I hope he has something clearly warm to wear tonight as he is expected to spend it behind bars until his court hearing tomorrow morning. That's all the time we have tonight.
