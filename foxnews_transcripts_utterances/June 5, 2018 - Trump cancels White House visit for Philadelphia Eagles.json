And what you're saying is, well, the anthem is a political act. Standing for the anthem is a political act. If that's the case, then so is the fourth of July, so was the flag. That's garbage. Number one, it's just a symbol. That's all it is. Number two, saying it's a free-speech issue? It's only free-speech if it's pertaining to the government. This is an actual business. You're not getting arrested for saying something. You're actually just being -- you're being penalized as an employee. So, the way the media has carried this, and you saw it specifically in the press conference in which April Ryan and the other dude from NBC, can't think of his name, we're peppering Sanders with just redundant, stupid questions like aren't you aware this is about brutality? Yes. Aren't you aware that the message is convoluted? That when you see players up there, they're making -- or kneeling during the national anthem, they're making a huge mistake. They're injecting politics into a nonpolitical event. We talk about this every year. We talk about, oh, the best way to ruin a Thanksgiving dinner is to talk about politics.

They go, \"What about June 11?\" But what happens on June 11? A lot of people are going to be looking forward to June 12, because that's Singapore. So are they about to have a very explosive report that's swamped, intentionally? I use that word \"intentionally.\" Swamped by Singapore, which is the president's move. My thing is, I am not interested in Comey and Hillary's e-mails. I'm interested in Hillary's e-mails when she was secretary of state. They want to find out about that. I'm interested in the impact of Peter Strzok and Page and what they did and as it relates to Contreras, the judge, and what the FBI was up to when they should've been legitimately investigating both sides. But if you talk about Comey and Hillary's emails, I have no interest. McCabe lying, leaking to \"The Wall Street Journal\" and that battle between Comey and McCabe and who's telling the truth, that interests me. But Hillary Clinton is old news.

No one is ever going to take that away from us. But this is tough for me. You know, Eagles, Trump. I'm a Philly guy. I'm going to have to side with Trump, though. It's like the Eagles tried a trick play, Trump sniffed it out and shut it down. I don't like how they play the gamesmanship with the guest list. They started with 60, and then 24 hours before it was less than 10. It was like an owner, an assistant coach and a mascot. I mean, come on. And then you have the mayor coming in. He doesn't speak for the Philadelphia Eagles. He sounds like Joy Behar. The guy is a joke. What mess is this country in? Record unemployment, I don't know what this guy is talking about. So, he kind of compounded the air. But everybody was happy to be there. They didn't see the Eagles. They saw me. I was kind of the consolation prize. Although, one person thought I was Ted Mosby.

But then, this morning, he's tweeting out, hey, no escape to the locker room. And I'm thinking -- you know, the owners aren't even escaping here.

You're either 100 percent for the country and the flag, or we're not going to play ball. And he's going to fight until he's satisfied, then we'll see who backs down.

It will get cover the most. I do think it's a shame.

You know, what I would like to do, to see Trump do, is maybe do some more -- do a big drilling initiative to deal with the gas prices. That would be good. But the media has really carried the water on this and made this a terrible story. They claim this is not directed at the anthem which goes against our eyes. When you watched a football game you're watching it. You can say no, it's about police brutality, but we're watching it happen during the anthem. And what you're saying is, well, the anthem is a political act. Standing for the anthem is a political act. If that's the case, then so is the fourth of July, so was the flag. That's garbage. Number one, it's just a symbol. That's all it is. Number two, saying it's a free-speech issue? It's only free-speech if it's pertaining to the government. This is an actual business. You're not getting arrested for saying something. You're actually just being -- you're being penalized as an employee. So, the way the media has carried this, and you saw it specifically in the press conference in which April Ryan and the other dude from NBC, can't think of his name, we're peppering Sanders with just redundant, stupid questions like aren't you aware this is about brutality? Yes. Aren't you aware that the message is convoluted? That when you see players up there, they're making -- or kneeling during the national anthem, they're making a huge mistake. They're injecting politics into a nonpolitical event. We talk about this every year. We talk about, oh, the best way to ruin a Thanksgiving dinner is to talk about politics. So -- but somehow it's different at a sporting event? You can come in and inject politics? No. You inject politics at an appropriate venue. You pay the price. People don't want to hear it.

Just five months before November's midterm, a new poll reveals voters in competitive battleground districts don't have a clear idea of who leads the Democratic Party. Forty five percent of midterm voters say Democrats are leaderless. MSNBC's Chris Matthews has a theory on what might be causing the parties problem."

      "utterance": "There's too many elitist -- there's so much elitism in the Democratic Party. It's so outrageous. By the way, I'm rooting against them. Even though I may agree with their policies, I think there's a party attitude of elitism. And I think they've got to get over it. And it's too much talk into fundraisers, because the people they talk to on these kinds of shows are really the people they want the money from, and they're the elite."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "No, and that's a funny thing because when you look at what President Obama said to his -- to Ben Rhodes in that interview we've talked about when he said America just wasn't ready for me. So, if you want to talk about elitism that's -- Obama -- I mean, remember for the Democrats, America is the fallen and they are the angels. You know, everybody else is flawed. And I think it's really hard to be a blue-collar Democrat these days, because as a Democrat you have to be up on every nuance of gender and racial politics. You have to know the 50 pronouns. You have to know that every type of gendered designation. You have to have every nuance of cultural appropriation in your head. And the only way to do that is to be in elitist campus cultist. You can't be a plumber. You can't be an electrician. You can't be a carpenter and know all that stuff. You've just got to be a campus activist. That's a really small population."

So, then you find the prototype and who has those legitimate attributes and then run to them. Senator Schumer, a guy from Brooklyn, I'm not so to say it. Nancy Pelosi is from the west coast. I wouldn't say that's your ticket to success. And Bernie Sanders must scare the heck out of most Democrats because he's not even a Democrat, and he's a self-avowed socialist. So, the question is, who -- what does the Democrat look like? What are his attributes?"

I don't think you say any of them, although they're successful and ran as Democrats in states that were dominated by Donald Trump, or districts that was dominated by Donald Trump. These are folks who won. And so, I think, you're looking for new models. The thing that comes to my mind, if you go back to, let's say the last time we had a first-term president going into midterms, that's Barack Obama in 2010. Now, there was a terrible, large red wave that swept over."

And I think that when you look -- like today in the first segment, we're talking about the NFL players kneeling or we could talk about yesterday immigration. These are issues that gin up your voters. And the key issue becomes which sides voters are more enthusiastic about turning out, because turn out is the key in midterms. And in that 2010 race, Republicans were really sped up about Obamacare. In this case, you have Democrats who have a tremendous advantage in terms of voter enthusiasm. And guess what, it's about the actual man who this midterm is going to be about, the referendum on Donald Trump."

One thing that surprised me is that on the table in California, one of the questions is going to be expanding Medicaid to illegal immigrants who are adults up to age 26. Previously, it was just for -- up to people who are age 19. But now, California has this on the table and it is becoming quite a liberal state.

They have no common sense it seems now in government in California, because they want to hand everything out, pay for everything. They're having major financial and economic problems. How they're going to be able to sustain this? This is not a workable framework. They do not have the means to be able to pay for all this. Yet, they continue to flagrantly violate and, you know, basically just turn a blind eye to the law, whether it's sanctuary cities or now just giving free stuff away. It's becoming a completely, like a socialist state and being mismanaged. And it seems they're trying to tack to even more liberal direction, and we'll see where this goes.

They go, \"What about June 11?\" But what happens on June 11? A lot of people are going to be looking forward to June 12, because that's Singapore. So are they about to have a very explosive report that's swamped, intentionally? I use that word \"intentionally.\" Swamped by Singapore, which is the president's move. My thing is, I am not interested in Comey and Hillary's e-mails. I'm interested in Hillary's e-mails when she was secretary of state. They want to find out about that. I'm interested in the impact of Peter Strzok and Page and what they did and as it relates to Contreras, the judge, and what the FBI was up to when they should've been legitimately investigating both sides. But if you talk about Comey and Hillary's emails, I have no interest. McCabe lying, leaking to \"The Wall Street Journal\" and that battle between Comey and McCabe and who's telling the truth, that interests me. But Hillary Clinton is old news.

Look at how different this show is, in all seriousness. Look how different our show is for three hours. There's not \"Trump is great,\" \"Obama is bad,\" \"Bush is great,\" \"Carter is fantastic.\" We change gears. If you look at the other channels, it's 45 minutes of how bad Trump is and then 15 minutes on how they wish Oprah was president. So that, to me, it shows a program -- if you watch here, people are happier. I would like to see CNN do a study on why FOX viewers are so much happier. Because we have a diversity of views. It allows you to get information and make your own opinion, as rather \"we'll should you why you should feel bad.\""

It had under one minute left in the game to win the 1981 NFL championship game against the Dallas Cowboys. He was truly a legend, an incredible inspiration. You know, people who love football loved to watch him play. And it's just -- sadly, he lost his battle with ALS, with Lou Gehrig's Disease.
