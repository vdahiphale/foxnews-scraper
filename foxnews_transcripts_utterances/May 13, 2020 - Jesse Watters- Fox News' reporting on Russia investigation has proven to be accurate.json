Major breaking news today surrounding the unmasking of Michael Flynn, we're awaiting reaction from President Trump and we'll bring that to you very soon. GOP senators releasing the names of key Obama administration officials who may have received the identity of Flynn after it was unmasked. On the list, former Vice President, Joe Biden, former FBI Director, James Comey, and former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. The list also includes President Obama's former chief of staff, Dennis McDonough. Joe Biden was asked about this yesterday about the Flynn investigation.

And the Obama administration people have been very quiet about this part of the investigation, but very much willing to talk on the record, on Twitter, wherever else they could, about the Russia investigation leading up to impeachment. I think they're going to have to answer some questions. I mean, some of these things are curious. Like, I think that there is -- some make sense that you could imagine that the director of national intelligence, the CIA, like, that makes sense.

Now, asking for the unmasked -- asking for his name to be unmasked, apparently that might be within the rules of what they can do. But now, we get to the next question, which is, what happened after that? Who leaked the name? And that will be something that perhaps we can get to the bottom of as we start to go through these names, and we'll maybe start to hear from some of them, Clapper, Brennan, Powers.

      "sentences": "I have no idea what you mean by that, Juan. And I want to correct something you said earlier. You said that these were conservations he was having with Russians. No, they were unmasking every single conversation he had with anybody. I mean, he had basically one conversation with one Russian, so let's just make sure that is very clear. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He is allowed to talk to whoever he wants as the incoming National Security Advisor. And he should be able to do that without being literally spied on by the Obama people. Now, here is the deal. Was there a legitimate reason for all of these Obama officials to unmask an incoming National Security Advisor after the election? In my opinion, no, they were searching for a reason to take the guy out, because they couldn't have Flynn as National Security Advisor, because he would find out what they had been up to during the campaign and he would ruin the insurance policy. So here is how it all works. January 5th, President Obama's chief of staff unmasks Flynn and sees this conversation with the Russian ambassador. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They have the Oval Office meeting on the 5th of January, with James Comey, with Joe Biden. And that's when Comey and Barack Obama hatched this sting to nail Flynn on this BS Logan Act. Then, a week later, January 12th, Joe Biden himself allegedly unmasks Flynn or gets the Flynn request to unmask. And on that same day, January 12th, Ignatius writes the column in the Washington Post, which reports an illegal leak of the conversation, so the timing is very suspicious. They don't -- Biden says he doesn't know anything about this. That is obviously not true. He has his fingerprints all over it. So the question is, why were they doing this, how they did it. And like Dana said, it may not be illegal to unmask someone, although, you know, you are doing it without a warrant. It is very sketchy. But to criminally leak the classified conversation, that is exactly what Durham is looking into. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So all of these names on the lists, they are now the subject of a criminal leak investigation. And at this point, we found out more dirt from Barack Obama in three weeks than they found on Donald Trump in three years. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But he would just say tapioca pudding and Shetland pony, so it's pointless. He's going to make a terrible witness. What I find interesting, though, with Juan's question, you're seeing an interesting reversal of liberals, who always seem legitimately concerned about coercion by authorities, setups by authorities, no Miranda Rights being read or pretending not to be investigated a person until they finally get the guy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You know, the FBI did that with Flynn. They told him don't worry about a lawyer. They said, you know, we're not targeting you. They didn't read his Miranda Rights. And then what they did was they ruined him. They targeted him. They ruined him legally and financially, so essentially they set him up. So I don't know why liberals don't defend him the way they defend others. Maybe it is racism. Maybe they see Flynn as old, white male who served his country, right? He's not considered oppressed by their definition or by your definition, so it is not really an injustice. He's just a symbol of American oppression, so who cares? Now, I have a question and it might be a really stupid question, but I'm going to ask it anyway, and because we have a lawyer, Emily here. Now, we have confirmed that this is a three-year charade. It was a phony process of re-litigating something that didn't happen. The person behind that was Adam Schiff. We now know that Schiff lied every step of the way. So could somebody sue to reverse the impeachment when we now know that the impeachment was a house of cards?

Now they're saying the president is politicizing the intelligence. That is pretty funny coming from them because it wasn't Donald Trump that set people up with stings, that used spies, that cooked up crooked dossiers and colluded with the Russians and entrapped people and threw political opponents in jail. No, that was Democrats that did that. All the president is doing now, like this unmasking list, is shining a light. All he's doing is disinfecting the last administration. He's exposing it. He's correcting an injustice. That's what's going on here. And the timing is not being used to distract from the pandemic. It was Adam Schiff that released all of those transcripts under oath.

And I hate -- I hate to pretend -- I hate to act like the worst, the very worst of the media and the very worst of the Democrats about demanding this person get locked up and this person be tried and this person go away. But something's got to be done for Adam Schiff because he created three years of a massive fallacy that did so much damage to this country and made us miss probably one of the most important stories of our lifetime. We were having hearings on impeachment while the corona virus was exploding. We talked about that virus in green rooms, but we were -- we to do this impeachment story. We had to show these hearings. It's all on him, man. He's got to go. They got to investigate him. They got to hold him accountable. I'm not going to say he should go to prison, but my evil twin will say he should go away to prison for a very long time.",

You know, regardless of how you view it, I think lots of people do worry that it is diversionary. Certainly, Vice President Biden has said that. The other thing that I wanted to mention to you, Dana, was I think the president was pretty clear. He said that the Democrats bill that Nancy Pelosi put out today is DOA, dead on arrival. And then he said that Jay Powell, the Federal Reserve chair is his most improved player over the last few months for reducing interest rates and the like. But today Jay Powell came out and said you know, the economy is in big trouble and needs additional help and support from the government. So the question now becomes what will the president and the Treasury Secretary Mr. Mnuchin put forward. Are they going to negotiate? Because their own Federal Reserve chair, the most improved player for the president is saying the economy, the workers need help and Nancy Pelosi is talking about getting more money to workers, more money for kids who are hungry through food stamps, more money for small business.",

Major breaking news today surrounding the unmasking of Michael Flynn, we're awaiting reaction from President Trump and we'll bring that to you very soon. GOP senators releasing the names of key Obama administration officials who may have received the identity of Flynn after it was unmasked. On the list, former Vice President, Joe Biden, former FBI Director, James Comey, and former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. The list also includes President Obama's former chief of staff, Dennis McDonough. Joe Biden was asked about this yesterday about the Flynn investigation. Take a look at what he said."

But I was thinking, you know, isn't it the case that, you know, any administration's top officials given Russian interference in 2016 election, would want to know who is talking to the Russian ambassador, telling them, you know, don't worry about sanctions intended to punish Russia, just take it easy. Wouldn't you think that is normal?"

And I think that, you know, that Hillary Clinton campaign, they still maintain that the Obama administration did not do enough to stop Russian interference. But I think that this horse has now left the barn. And the Obama administration people have been very quiet about this part of the investigation, but very much willing to talk on the record, on Twitter, wherever else they could, about the Russia investigation leading up to impeachment. I think they're going to have to answer some questions. I mean, some of these things are curious. Like, I think that there is -- some make sense that you could imagine that the director of national intelligence, the CIA, like, that makes sense. But why would ambassador to Italy and the Republic of San Marino need to know the identity of this person in this document? There -- seems to me there's a lot of people on here that would not even necessarily be in a need-to-know basis, but more like a want-to-know basis. Now, asking for the unmasked -- asking for his name to be unmasked, apparently that might be within the rules of what they can do. But now, we get to the next question, which is, what happened after that? Who leaked the name? And that will be something that perhaps we can get to the bottom of as we start to go through these names, and we'll maybe start to hear from some of them, Clapper, Brennan, Powers. The only name that's not on here that I thought would be is Susan Rice."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I agree with you. All right, Jesse, does this mean that people like Samantha Power, Joe Biden, Dennis McDonough, that they somehow were telling Flynn, oh, talk to the Russian ambassador about sanctions. Go right ahead. Did they get him involved? Does this explain or justify his actions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "I have no idea what you mean by that, Juan. And I want to correct something you said earlier. You said that these were conservations he was having with Russians. No, they were unmasking every single conversation he had with anybody. I mean, he had basically one conversation with one Russian, so let's just make sure that is very clear. He is allowed to talk to whoever he wants as the incoming National Security Advisor. And he should be able to do that without being literally spied on by the Obama people. Now, here is the deal. Was there a legitimate reason for all of these Obama officials to unmask an incoming National Security Advisor after the election? In my opinion, no, they were searching for a reason to take the guy out, because they couldn't have Flynn as National Security Advisor, because he would find out what they had been up to during the campaign and he would ruin the insurance policy. So here is how it all works. January 5th, President Obama's chief of staff unmasks Flynn and sees this conversation with the Russian ambassador. They have the Oval Office meeting on the 5th of January, with James Comey, with Joe Biden. And that's when Comey and Barack Obama hatched this sting to nail Flynn on this BS Logan Act. Then, a week later, January 12th, Joe Biden himself allegedly unmasks Flynn or gets the Flynn request to unmask. And on that same day, January 12th, Ignatius writes the column in the Washington Post, which reports an illegal leak of the conversation, so the timing is very suspicious. They don't -- Biden says he doesn't know anything about this. That is obviously not true. He has his fingerprints all over it. So the question is, why were they doing this, how they did it. And like Dana said, it may not be illegal to unmask someone, although, you know, you are doing it without a warrant. It is very sketchy. But to criminally leak the classified conversation, that is exactly what Durham is looking into. So all of these names on the lists, they are now the subject of a criminal leak investigation. And at this point, we found out more dirt from Barack Obama in three weeks than they found on Donald Trump in three years."

    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "I would say who are they? I don't really -- I don't respond to people -- the sum of people who say things. I respond to the people who specifically say things. I do think it is pretty weird that in an era when we're telling people to wear masks, we're doing a story about unmasking people, which to me is proof that we are definitely living in a simulation for that story to happen now. I think we could ask Joe Biden what did he know and when did he know it. But he would just say tapioca pudding and Shetland pony, so it's pointless. He's going to make a terrible witness. What I find interesting, though, with Juan's question, you're seeing an interesting reversal of liberals, who always seem legitimately concerned about coercion by authorities, setups by authorities, no Miranda Rights being read or pretending not to be investigated a person until they finally get the guy. You know, the FBI did that with Flynn. They told him don't worry about a lawyer. They said, you know, we're not targeting you. They didn't read his Miranda Rights. And then what they did was they ruined him. They targeted him. They ruined him legally and financially, so essentially they set him up. So I don't know why liberals don't defend him the way they defend others. Maybe it is racism. Maybe they see Flynn as old, white male who served his country, right? He's not considered oppressed by their definition or by your definition, so it is not really an injustice. He's just a symbol of American oppression, so who cares? Now, I have a question and it might be a really stupid question, but I'm going to ask it anyway, and because we have a lawyer, Emily here. Now, we have confirmed that this is a three-year charade. It was a phony process of re-litigating something that didn't happen. The person behind that was Adam Schiff. We now know that Schiff lied every step of the way. So could somebody sue to reverse the impeachment when we now know that the impeachment was a house of cards? See, I know you are laughing. Because I admit, it might be a dumb question. I don't know. But we now know the whole impeachment thing was a circus. It was a circus, so can --"

Because he was impeached, but he was not convicted, so he still remains in the Oval Office, and likely will enjoy another four years.

And the notion that we have so many current laws right now that can become like blowfish with the amount of government power that can turn into abuse. Because the government is made up of people, its members, so the FISA court, that much of this was based on, that standard is probable cause. You were communicating with a foreign government. But the Constitution demands that is probable cause you are committing a crime. So I think viewers and all of us should ask ourselves what kind of government do we want. Do we want one that is bound by the Constitution or one that is bound by some looser set of laws that for some reason, the institutional forces on the Hill continue to protect. And I think right now, regardless of your party, you should be deeply concerned and you should care deeply what this is all uncovering, because one day, it might not be a three-star general, it might be you."

For example, like California. If you don't know what's too soon or what's too late, the 50 experiments are going to tell you. So when people say, oh, screaming, oh, people will die. We know that that is a possibility. The 50 experiments will show you the best path forward.

Look, Germany, they are now friends of ours, but they're still competitors on trade and other things. So Germany, Japan, others have negative rates. And I think if they do, we are the most prime of the world. You know, we're -- it's based -- many countries, based on the dollar, the dollar is by far the strongest, most powerful currency in the world. We've made it more powerful. We've made it stronger. And certainly, they're going to have the advantage of negative rates. We should, too. I feel strongly we should have negative rates. Negative rates is basically where they pay you interest if you borrow money. This is a new one. I've been looking for something like that all my life. That's a pretty good one. But certainly, if other countries are going to be paid for putting up money, I mean, think of it. They are borrowing money. And instead of paying interest, they are getting paid. It's the craziest thing. But you know what, other countries are doing it. Look at Germany. Look at Japan. Look at others. And we are the most prime in the world right now. And we have the currency and we have the power of the dollar. So I know that the chairman has done a very good job over the last couple of months. I have to tell you that because I've been critical.

We're down to zero interest. That is good. But some countries and some states, rather, and some also countries you look at. But we are paying right now zero, and other countries are paying less than that, if you can believe it, if you couldn't believe it. They are receiving money. And I think we should be in the exact same situations. And by the way, states are getting tremendous deals on borrowing. So a lot of the states that are coming to the federal government, they can go out and they can borrow and they're getting phenomenal rates. Some of our states is where I'm talking about. They are getting phenomenal borrowing rates."

They want to be able to make sure that Republicans can't win an election by putting in all sorts of mail-in ballots. Now, I don't know if you do because the press doesn't report this too much. But we had two very big victories last night. We won very big. Tom Tiffany won very big in the great state of Wisconsin. You saw that. That was last night. It came in. That was a big one. You saw that, Doug, and won by very, very substantial margin. And in California, of all places, we had a fantastic race, and this was all mail-in ballots. This was all mailed ballots. And when they saw, because it was the mail, they saw they were losing three days ago. And they end up putting polling booths in into basically Democrat areas. But despite that, it is looking like Mike Garcia, I don't know if they've called the race yet. But he was substantially ahead. That's the problem with mail-in ballots. Are they going to dump a whole pile of ballots on your desk just before the election? So the problem with the mail-in ballots it is subject to tremendous corruption -- tremendous corruption, cheating, so I'm against it. And if you look at the bill that Nancy Pelosi is putting in, it has a lot to do with elections. We're not going -- we're not going to lose elections because of that.

All the construction, all of energy, all of Ag, including all of elective surgery at hospitals kept that going."

And that's why that approach is so important. Then you providing all that support, along with us in Congress with the CARES Act as well. But you see that now with North Dakota, with Colorado, and across the country.

So we still have THE FIVE together, so we'll take it around the table, so to speak. Jesse, maybe let's just start on bigger news of today on the Flynn unmasking, list that has come out. The president is talking about that. He has an interview with Maria Bartiromo, which will air tomorrow morning. He says there is more to come."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, there keeps being more to come. And he's been right, and Fox has been right. All of our reporting on this entire thing has proven to be accurate. And all reporting from the other side in the mainstream media has proven false, which makes me wonder, why aren't the mainstream media reporters angry? They were fed lies by their sources for three years and they printed fake news. Now, if I printed fake news for three years and then I found out through the transcripts my sources knew they were telling me lies and knew they were having me push a fake story, I'd be angry at my sources. But they're not angry at their sources. They are angry at the people that have pointed out that their sources lied. Think about how ridiculous that is. Now they're saying the president is politicizing the intelligence. That is pretty funny coming from them because it wasn't Donald Trump that set people up with stings, that used spies, that cooked up crooked dossiers and colluded with the Russians and entrapped people and threw political opponents in jail. No, that was Democrats that did that. All the president is doing now, like this unmasking list, is shining a light. All he's doing is disinfecting the last administration. He's exposing it. He's correcting an injustice. That's what's going on here. And the timing is not being used to distract from the pandemic. It was Adam Schiff that released all of those transcripts under oath. Remember that. And it was the Justice Department that withheld the exculpatory evidence from General Flynn for two years. So the timing of all of this, it's on the Democrats. It's not on the Republicans."

I mean, one of the -- when Jesse just said that it made me think about how reporters -- I mean you would have think they would have been mad then."

      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes. I feel like a broken record but the fact is look, I just -- I just saw -- I think it was one of Biden's spokesperson meltdown on Twitter over this basically attacked Catherine Herridge. It's pretty brutal attack on her. And I believe they might have removed the tweet. I'm just interested how the media is going to approach that. Will that be considered a sexist attack because she's a woman or is it different because it was a Democrat doing the attacking. But it's clear that Joe's campaign is worried. And I hate -- I hate to pretend -- I hate to act like the worst, the very worst of the media and the very worst of the Democrats about demanding this person get locked up and this person be tried and this person go away. But something's got to be done for Adam Schiff because he created three years of a massive fallacy that did so much damage to this country and made us miss probably one of the most important stories of our lifetime. We were having hearings on impeachment while the corona virus was exploding. We talked about that virus in green rooms, but we were -- we to do this impeachment story. We had to show these hearings. It's all on him, man. He's got to go. They got to investigate him. They got to hold him accountable. I'm not going to say he should go to prison, but my evil twin will say he should go away to prison for a very long time."

      "utterance": "Well, I think people are glad to talk. I think the question is are you playing into a political action. You know, regardless of how you view it, I think lots of people do worry that it is diversionary. Certainly, Vice President Biden has said that. The other thing that I wanted to mention to you, Dana, was I think the president was pretty clear. He said that the Democrats bill that Nancy Pelosi put out today is DOA, dead on arrival. And then he said that Jay Powell, the Federal Reserve chair is his most improved player over the last few months for reducing interest rates and the like. But today Jay Powell came out and said you know, the economy is in big trouble and needs additional help and support from the government. So the question now becomes what will the president and the Treasury Secretary Mr. Mnuchin put forward. Are they going to negotiate? Because their own Federal Reserve chair, the most improved player for the president is saying the economy, the workers need help and Nancy Pelosi is talking about getting more money to workers, more money for kids who are hungry through food stamps, more money for small business."

Are you seeing that out in where you are that the parks are reopening, that people are figuring out a way to get back to business? You mentioned that there's a possible registry at restaurants in Seattle."

    {
      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST",
      "utterance": "Exactly. That the governor has outlined a plan for a restaurant to be able to have dine in people. So for people to be able to go and sit indoor, they have to provide -- the restaurants have to stipulate, agree to its stipulation. They'll provide the names, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers of those diners. So of course, people are sort of revolting. It remains to be seen obviously whether that's going to be implemented. But as of now, the governor has articulated that. If I may, Dana, you asked before we cut to the president about California which is where I'm from, and we saw the difference of the governor's treatment in California of all of those other governor's that were in the Cabinet Room with the president. Governor Newsom is operating under a short-term crisis psychology and it's in stark contrast to that long-term fundamental unraveling that we are watching there --"
