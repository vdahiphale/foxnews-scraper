So, this is a small crowd looking to get to the main crowd. And the activity right now is a lot of marching. They wind up to the interstate. They attempted to get on the interstate.

Right now, the direction were headed in. Now, does far tonight, people are using that phrase \"peaceful protest.\" All protests are supposed to be peaceful. The modify applies will become a violent protest. Don't worry that is just an obstacle on the road and skillful camera man. What happened earlier today though? Right around 5:00 o'clock local time. They came up to the police headquarters with a good bit of passion in them. And a group of the protesters got on top of the police SUV. Jumped up and down, broke the windshield on the police SUV. There were some rocks thrown. The bottles thrown were only plastic bottles but the police saying, showed up with riot gear, with a pepper spray. Had a big confrontation.

Thirteen people arrested thus far according to Chief O'Toole out here in St. Louis. So, that is the situation. I personally observed some weapons. At least one of the weapons a fake AK-47, was a fake gun. Some of the other weapons I can't tell you if they are real but they looked like an M-4. One kid had something that looked like a long rifle. Another kid had tucked into his waistband I could tell a handgun. So, it looked like a semi-automatic handgun. The authenticity of it, you really can't verify while it's all happening so fast. As far as the demonstrators that we see. A lot of them, Black Lives Matter demonstrators. We do see some of the kids, dressed the part of the black block or anti-fa kids. From a police source, they don't have a lot of Intel that national groups like anti-fa are descending at this stage on this particular demonstration. But there is a lot of emotion. This is going out over the web.

Another terror attack in London. Now, during the morning rush hour a terrorist set off a homemade bomb on a subway train injuring 29 and causing passengers to flee in panic. A manhunt is going underway for the suspect. And officials have raised the terror threat level to critical in the U.K. Meaning another attack may be imminent. President Trump reacted on Twitter calling for a, quote, \"Larger, tougher and more specific travel ban here in the United States.\" And said this earlier today.",

But we need to trained and harden the individuals so that they know how to react to things like that. A lot of people called at this a failed attempt because no one died.

The way that the United States responds to the terrorist threat and tries to combat it has changed. The battlefield is largely now in cyber space. The face of these terrorist organizations has changed hands many times. We have seen organizations like ISIS rise and fall. It's not defeated yet but it is much reduced.

Last week I did a monologue on this Southern Poverty Law Center and they took issue with me with some of the statements made on the show, including a joke that they do virtually no law. But in fact they say they spent over 1 million in 2015 on out of pocket case cost on behalf of their clients, so we must make clear now, that FPLC does in fact quote, do law, unquote. FPLC also uses offshore investment vehicles. That is common for non-profit organizations to do. That is great.

It's 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" This is the Fox News alert. Protesters are taking to the streets tonight in St. Louis. After a police officer was acquitted of murder for shooting and killing a black suspect after high-speed chase. Former St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley shot Anthony Lamar Smith back in 2011. And the not guilty verdict was announced today. Joining us now with more from St. Louis is Mike Tobin."

      "utterance": "Hi there, Kimberly. We are catching up with the demonstrators right now actually from doing that last live shot with Brian. I got separated from. So, this is a small crowd looking to get to the main crowd. And the activity right now is a lot of marching. They wind up to the interstate. They attempted to get on the interstate. Cops didn't want that to happen. So, they had a standoff for a little while and that is effectively diffused. So, they are back in over the Central West end. Right now, the direction were headed in. Now, does far tonight, people are using that phrase \"peaceful protest.\" All protests are supposed to be peaceful. The modify applies will become a violent protest. Don't worry that is just an obstacle on the road and skillful camera man. What happened earlier today though? Right around 5:00 o'clock local time. They came up to the police headquarters with a good bit of passion in them. And a group of the protesters got on top of the police SUV. Jumped up and down, broke the windshield on the police SUV. There were some rocks thrown. The bottles thrown were only plastic bottles but the police saying, showed up with riot gear, with a pepper spray. Had a big confrontation. A lot of pushing and shoving. Four police officers had some minor injuries. Thirteen people arrested thus far according to Chief O'Toole out here in St. Louis. So, that is the situation. I personally observed some weapons. At least one of the weapons a fake AK-47, was a fake gun. Some of the other weapons I can't tell you if they are real but they looked like an M-4. One kid had something that looked like a long rifle. Another kid had tucked into his waistband I could tell a handgun. So, it looked like a semi-automatic handgun. The authenticity of it, you really can't verify while it's all happening so fast. As far as the demonstrators that we see. A lot of them, Black Lives Matter demonstrators. We do see some of the kids, dressed the part of the black block or anti-fa kids. From a police source, they don't have a lot of Intel that national groups like anti-fa are descending at this stage on this particular demonstration. But there is a lot of emotion. This is going out over the web. We will see how these progresses in the future -- Kimberly."

Now, during the morning rush hour a terrorist set off a homemade bomb on a subway train injuring 29 and causing passengers to flee in panic. A manhunt is going underway for the suspect. And officials have raised the terror threat level to critical in the U.K. Meaning another attack may be imminent. President Trump reacted on Twitter calling for a, quote, \"Larger, tougher and more specific travel ban here in the United States.\" And said this earlier today."

Radical Islamic terrorism. It will be eradicated. Believe me."

      "utterance": "Because we will always be vulnerable. And that includes people. People have to start thinking in training. We train for earthquakes when we were kids. You know, we train for mass shootings as adolescents. The crowd panicked here and they trampled a little boy and they hit a pregnant woman. Pushed her over. These are natural responses, what happens when people panic. But we need to -- this is how terrorism works. It creates fear. People panic and it makes it worse. But we need to trained and harden the individuals so that they know how to react to things like that. A lot of people called at this a failed attempt because no one died. But every one of these attacks is successful because every attack that happens, terrorist learn something from it and they adjust their techniques. So the next time the attack is more deadly. This could have been just a dry run. I think that what is necessary -- I think this poor -- the officials and the experts are overwhelmed. I think they need more bomb-sniffing dogs for two reasons. They are efficient. And inexpensive at sniffing out bombs. And terrorists hate them because they can't get to paradise if a dog is in their presence when they die."

      "utterance": "Well, you know, so this terror attack and Monday was the anniversary of 9/11 that comes around every year and gives us an opportunity to think about where we are in the war on terror. And I think this attack highlights as do the ones we have seen in Western Europe in recent months that really since 2001, everything about the terrorist threat has changed. The way that the United States responds to the terrorist threat and tries to combat it has changed. The battlefield is largely now in cyber space. The face of these terrorist organizations has changed hands many times. We have seen organizations like ISIS rise and fall. It's not defeated yet but it is much reduced. The thing that remains the same and that we are still not getting right is the impact that radical ideology still has on large population areas across the world. And I think that is an area where the United States in spite of our incredible military and intelligence prowess is still not doing enough. We have got this, I think it's called the \"global engagement center\" at the State Department. It's underfunded. It's understaffed. These are the people that are responsible for fighting ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism online. This is where we need to be putting more money, more time and attention, more public political attention. I don't understand why we're not doing that. Because its attacks like this that are so low-budget that really highlight as long as people are attracted to that ideology, we're not solving the problem."

    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Okay. Got it. All right. So Jesse, obviously, thoughts and the prayers go out to the people in London. It's just that the anxiety and worrying when you wake up in the morning, could something happen? Could you be the person or your family member in the wrong place at the wrong time? People relying on public transportation. Which now as we have seen has become one of these soft targets. You know, unless they have people on there that are arm and there is some kind of physical deterrent to this type of conduct, it seems like this is the direction that they are going in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes. Great Britain is our best ally but they have to get much tougher. And I think in Trump's own way he was trying to tell them that. No American city would tolerate this kind of repeated carnage which we have seen over there in London. The majority of Americans agree with what President Trump is pushing after this, in the aftermath here. We want stricter internet crackdowns on Jihadi propaganda. We want to be less politically correct. We want more surveillance. And I think 60 percent of the American public wants the travel ban. So, that is all clear. He faced a little criticism today when he pivoted from the attack to the travel ban. And I don't blame him. Because all politicians seize on big moments in order to push their agenda. Every time there is a domestic terror attack in this country, President Obama pushed gun control."

      "utterance": "When you see hurricanes happen, politicians push the global warming agenda. So, I don't blame him for that. He also said that Scotland Yard had their eyes on these people and caught a little heat from Theresa May, the Prime Minister. You know, he also said that the London bridge attack was a terror attack before Scotland Yard had called it that. And he was right. So, I'm sure he has great intelligence from our intelligence officials. And the guy shoots from the hip. And we just have to get used to it. You have mentioned to Greg earlier, we have had eight years of the president of the United States wait sometimes two days after an attack to call it a terror attack. And if a guy is yelling \"Allahu Akbar,\" you know, from Syria and he is stabbing people, President Obama still really wouldn't say Islamic terror. President Trump will say it. This is why we elected him. We wanted someone who was tough on terrorism. You know what? In four years, the public might not like that. We could have Pocahontas as president. But right now we have President Trump and I think the media has to get used to this kind of tough talk."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, just to start by saying, I think it was 29 people were injured. Thank God it wasn't, no one was seriously injured. Most of it flash burns from the explosion in the subway. And the second thing to say is that with regard to Trump. He was rebuked by Theresa May. I mean, she said this is not helpful. The London police said, not helpful. And then you had the National Security adviser H.R. McMaster come out and he was like, cleaning up after the president. And says, oh, the president was speaking generally. He didn't have any specific information. So, what we have here to my mind is, you know, as Jesse was saying we know our president. You know, we love President Trump. But goodness gracious, he speaks impetuously at times. It's almost like he is just quick to fire and you have to think it's not a matter of the press, Jesse. It's a matter of our top ally, a key intelligence ally saying what are you doing? You are putting us and putting lives at risk by indicating to the terrorists that we have them in our sights and we know the network they are connected with. We are not there yet. We are not putting that out. We are working this case. This is a live investigation. And so, there is some, you know, problem there with that in my opinion. But I think the biggest problem here is one in which you see President Trump so quick to shoot at anything that fits his, as Jesse was saying, agenda. I don't see that when it comes to white supremacists down in Charlottesville. Oh, no! Slow to say anything about that. And this business about saying, \"radical Islamic terror.\" That is not solving the problem. Solving the problem and Trump said this today by the way folks, we have to do better on the internet, picking up on what Gillian was saying. Much better, we hardened targets. But we have to fight the ideology. That is the cancer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Can I just respond? There are two cultural points here. This is a far bigger problem than anything that happened in Charlottesville. This is a worldwide ideology. And the ideology when you are talking about a collision between bitter loaners and the western world. It used to be that people didn't see how others lived. If you were in Pakistan, you never know what the Kardashians were because there was no way you knew that. Our western world is colliding with people who hate that. So that -- it's not necessarily ISIS ideology. It's just the fact that they hate the west."

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Uh-hm."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "The other thing, too, is that you are supposed to as an individual say something after seeing something, especially when the authorities cannot protect you 100 percent of the time. As you can see. They stopped a lot of plots. They weren't able to stop this one. But they stop a lot. The point is this. If they can't project you, somehow you have to protect yourself. By saying something when you see something. However, there is a cultural blockade there that deems you Islamaphobic, if you say something, when you see something and you might be wrong. If you are wrong, you are screwed. And so, when you are on a subway and you are on bus and you see something and you go, I want to say something but you know what? I don't want to end up on a blog being ripped apart. I don't want to lose my job. So, I am not going to -- we have to make it okay to say things. And Juan, you know that."

Keep in mind that these protests have been going on now about 11, almost 12 hours throughout the course of the day. They started in downtown St. Louis and shifted over here. Throughout the course of the night, as the sun has gone down, it's remained very peaceful. When the sun was still up, we did had flashes between protesters. Fourteen people. Thirteen, I believe. Thirteen people were arrested. More police officers were hurt although not so badly that they had to be taken to a hospital. I want to point out to you something, Juan here. You look over at the sidewalks and you see the windows. They are not boarded up. That is not the story in downtown St. Louis. Downtown St. Louis (INAUDIBLE) -- about what happen here with all of these protesters. Especially they knew that -- this will likely come down tonight. The story that hasn't had a lot of national media attention. In fact, the shooting happened back in 2011. But that being said, you have had -- Ferguson about 20 minutes north of us. This racial tensions percolating under the surface of this community. In fact, one business owner in downtown St. Louis told me earlier today that this is really a divided community. You have the white St. Louis. You have the black St. Louis. When you have a not guilty verdict like you had earlier today.

Our allies and adversaries across the globe don't agree on anything when it comes to the threat of North Korea but everyone wants to avoid a potential nuclear holocaust. Right? I think what is happening right now is we are at an inflection point and the U.S. has a more crucial role than ever before to play when it comes to getting the U.N. Security Council members that voted this Monday for the most robust, harshest set of sanctions ever implemented against the foreign nation, make sure that they uphold that our allies and adversaries on the U.N. uphold those sanctions.

Targeted and tactical nuclear strike that would have to be so overwhelming and so simultaneous that they would not be able to retaliate at all. I mean, that would make Hiroshima look like child's play. And even if they do retaliate, you're looking at a missile launch to the DMC where we have about 40,000 U.S. troops. They could hit nuclear reactors in South Korea. Radioactive fall-out. They could hit our greatest ally in the region, Japan. Guam could target. Heaven forbid they've get off an ICBM that puts San Francisco in the crosshairs, Los Angeles in the crosshairs. So, I've said this before, I think the only way to really solve this are three things. Coup, assassination attempt or you have China bring so much pressure on the north that they finally back themselves off this cliff."

So that is something to consider. But this is why everyone needs to get on the same page. And in fact, you know, the acting and working in concert against North Korea to shut this down. I mean, the problem is that now we are seeing with more alarming frequency, they are doing these missile tests, they are actually working. They are actually being able to hit, you know, further away in terms of their range which is highly problematic. So something that used to be sort of theoretical before has now become, you know, actualized under the present day circumstances of what we have going on. And I agree with you.

Last week I did a monologue on this Southern Poverty Law Center and they took issue with me with some of the statements made on the show, including a joke that they do virtually no law. But in fact they say they spent over 1 million in 2015 on out of pocket case cost on behalf of their clients, so we must make clear now, that FPLC does in fact quote, do law, unquote. FPLC also uses offshore investment vehicles. That is common for non-profit organizations to do. That is great.
