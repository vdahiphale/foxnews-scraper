White House chief of staff Ron Klain could step down in the coming weeks, the biggest administration departure since President Biden took office two years ago. The move was expected. Klain has been at Biden's side through the legislative triumphs of his first two years and through his Supreme Court confirmation, but also through major controversies, like the disastrous U.S. departure from Afghanistan. Klain may be best known for helping the president pass massive spending bills like the $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan, the $1 trillion infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act. Critics say the spending helped accelerate the current inflation crisis and added to the national debt. In 2000, the debt was just over $5 trillion. It's climbed to over $31 trillion today. It's money already spent and now the U.S. is over its borrowing limit which could put the nation's credit rating at risk.",

The White House needs to cooperate with the Justice Department. That's what they've been doing for months. Obviously, that's in stark comparison to the other investigation of classified documents with former President Trump. And I think as long as the White House does what it should do, which is cooperate fully so we can get to the bottom of this, I think that's the appropriate process.

Andy McCarthy, former federal prosecutor, tweeted this out: It's not six classified documents, this latest discovery. Awkwardly worded statement by Biden team, i.e., spin is favorable to Biden as possible, were six items consisting of documents with classified markings and we don't know what they meant by item. Box, envelope or how many classified documents in each item. So, there is a special counsel investigations already under the way -- under way.

The White House was hoping for a speedy inquiry, planning to disclose this matter only after Justice issued its all clear. But the approach would end up prompting accusations that the Biden's team had purposely kept the public in the dark. Congressman Gottheimer, we know all of this started before the midterms.

There was obstruction. You needed subpoenas. President Trump didn't come forward and offer up his documents. He was keeping them locked up. And this administration, I believe, has cooperated in a constructive way with the Justice Department from the beginning. They didn't take months. They didn't stall. The president wasn't trying to hold up these documents as trophies. And so, it's a huge difference. But the bottom line is this, and Brian is exactly right. We need to have a full cooperation investigation. We need to get to the bottom of what happened, why and when, to understand everything. And in a broader sense, to make sure that no White House, no administration is ever able to handle classified documents this way and take them out of the White House from a classified setting. And I think, you know, we should get to the bottom of both, and I think we should run a reasonable process. And that's what's happening right now.",

There are questions about whether there are logs of visitors or people who would have been there. Andy McCarthy writes this: I'm very confident that if the agency, meaning the Secret Service, believed it was in the interest of the president's security that the information would be produced for the bureau would be produced at warp speed. We've got at least one source saying to us the Secret Service is prepared to come forward with some information about visitors there but Congress is going to have to ask.

So, I have no doubt that certainly we're going to make sure of this, that the bureau does their job investigating this case. And again, they got to apply the law equally. That's very, very important for people in America to have faith and confidence in our justice system. It's a system I have worked in. It's very important for me that they do things the right way so that the American public has confidence in it. And that requires equal application of the law, consistent standards on investigations.

When you have a divided government, four-vote Republican margin in the House, a one-vote Democratic margin in the Senate, divided chambers, you have to negotiate. That's what the American people elected us to do, is to work this out. So nobody should be taking the position that we're not going to negotiate. That's very irresponsible. Pertaining to your question, Shannon, one thing that we're just going to offer up as a possible bridge-building solution is to go right at the 1917 law itself that established the debt limit. It established it as a number, a numerical dollar amount, which doesn't make any sense. We think that more practically speaking, it should be a debt to GDP ratio. In 2008, our debt to GDP was about 40 percent. In 2018, it was about 70 percent. It's now at 125 percent. That's not sustainable. So, when you have a child that has a spending problem, you do two things. You pay their bills, and take away their credit card. You don't do one, you do both. That's what has to happen here. So what we're going to propose is whatever negotiated amount we can agree on on a debt to GDP ratio and have a cure period there after. If that cure does not happen, certain budgetary reforms automatically kick in on the discretionary side. So, we're still putting the meat on those bones. Me and Josh are going to work through our proposed solution. But the first thing that's got to happen, Shannon, the president has to sit down with Speaker McCarthy.

And that's why this legislation that would protect the marriage equality that we have come to expect from our constitutional rights into law. So, I think we're seeing a great awakening of people recognizing that. If this Supreme Court isn't going to recognize the full spectrum of equality and liberty that was supposed to be guaranteed to us in the 14th Amendment particularly, that they are going to need to use other channels like the congressional enactments that I just talked about and like their ballot measures. You know, we, the people, are coming back to say, we need equal citizenship stature. We need to be able to come to the public square as people who can make fundamental decision about our own bodies, about our own lives, for ourselves.",

He was our senior vice president of news and politics. For decades Alan was a guiding force here. He started as a writer when Fox News Channel launched back in 1996. Alan then worked his way up through the ranks. A diligent, perfectionist who became indispensable. Alan was part of every major news story and every election night for decades, meaning he had a hand in how Fox covered the biggest stories that affected your world. Alan, who I will always remember with a smile on his face, was just 47 years old. He is survived by his loving wife Rachel, who was his high school sweetheart and prom date, and their two children, 17-year-old son Ben and 13-year-old daughter Olivia. Alan was so very proud of them. As my colleague, Bret Baier, said this week, Alan made all of us better. He will be remembered in a service today in East Brunswick, New Jersey. We are wishing comfort to his family and his friend and to everyone who is feeling this loss. That's it for today. Thank you for joining us. I'm Shannon Bream. We'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.

It happened late last night at a dance club in Monterey Park, California, close to where a lunar New York celebration had been taking place. Authorities say they believe the shooter is male and at this time it appears that person is not in custody. No word yet on a motive. Deputies say they are reviewing security video in that area. Monterey Park is about ten miles east of Los Angeles. We'll keep you updated on any developments we get in from there. Also breaking this morning, the Justice Department seized more classified documents from the president's private residence just this week. The news comes as President Biden prepares to speak in person with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to discuss the new Congress, a range of challenges there, where they disagree. And that, of course, includes the debt limit. Congress is facing a deadline to strike a deal or risk a financial crisis as the Treasury department steps in to avoid a government default. In a moment, we will chat with two moderate lawmakers, Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey. They are trying to press their way into the most polarized policy debates and find solutions. But, first, let's turn to Lucas Tomlinson outside the White House where there are multiple developing stories this morning. Hello, Lucas."

The president also facing a debt ceiling fight amid reports his top aide is leaving. White House chief of staff Ron Klain could step down in the coming weeks, the biggest administration departure since President Biden took office two years ago. The move was expected. Klain has been at Biden's side through the legislative triumphs of his first two years and through his Supreme Court confirmation, but also through major controversies, like the disastrous U.S. departure from Afghanistan. Klain may be best known for helping the president pass massive spending bills like the $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan, the $1 trillion infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act. Critics say the spending helped accelerate the current inflation crisis and added to the national debt. In 2000, the debt was just over $5 trillion. It's climbed to over $31 trillion today. It's money already spent and now the U.S. is over its borrowing limit which could put the nation's credit rating at risk."

      "utterance": "With the latest discovery, there's no real question that the Biden documents were grossly mishandled. There only remains who was responsible. However, the discovery of documents at yet another location used by the president is crushing for his defense team. He says he's done everything right, he has no regrets. Congressman Gottheimer, should he, at this point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOTTHEIMER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we've seen the Justice Department is conducting an on going investigation. That's the proper process here. And you want to get to the bottom of these things, which is why they were at his home yesterday in full cooperation. And I think that's the -- what you need to do here. The White House needs to cooperate with the Justice Department. That's what they've been doing for months. Obviously, that's in stark comparison to the other investigation of classified documents with former President Trump. And I think as long as the White House does what it should do, which is cooperate fully so we can get to the bottom of this, I think that's the appropriate process. And, of course, in a broader sense, we should understand in any White House, whether it's the last White House or this one, how any documents would ever get out. And the key is to make sure that never happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So, also in contrast is the fact that there have been on going negotiations with this Justice Department, with the Biden White House and legal team. And there was an agreement for them to be there together Friday during the search, but what we found is leading to more questions than answers for a lot of folks."

Awkwardly worded statement by Biden team, i.e., spin is favorable to Biden as possible, were six items consisting of documents with classified markings and we don't know what they meant by item. Box, envelope or how many classified documents in each item. So, there is a special counsel investigations already under the way -- under way. You heard Lucas Tomlinson say, maybe some Democratic senators are also interested. House oversight has already said that it's going to investigate. Congressman Fitzpatrick, any word you have that the GOP is going to overreach on this or look like they're politicizing it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITZPATRICK",
      "utterance": "I don't believe so, Shannon. Two things are true. Number one, classified documents can never be taken out of the SCIF ever. I'm both a former FBI agent and I'm currently on the House Intelligence Committee. That's number one. Number two, we need equal application of the law. And that's what we're going to make sure that we ensure. We're going to do a deep dive into the circumstances surrounding the prior administration and the current administration, both dealing with classified documents and making sure the law is applied equally across the board. That's what the American people are demanding."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So the Wall Street Journal had reported on conversations between the two teams, and the Biden side, and the DOJ side about whether or not FBI agents or others should be doing these searches now that we're on umber five. And up into the point on Friday, they had agreed to let the Biden team handle it. \"The Washington Post\" also has this, that the White House was hoping to keep this quiet. The White House was hoping for a speedy inquiry, planning to disclose this matter only after Justice issued its all clear. But the approach would end up prompting accusations that the Biden's team had purposely kept the public in the dark. Congressman Gottheimer, we know all of this started before the midterms. Do you get the perception that some people have that there are differences in the way the DOJ handles Republican and Democrat cases?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOTTHEIMER",
      "utterance": "I mean, there's a huge difference in the fact, if you look at the last administration, the Trump administration, what happened in Mar-a- Lago, there was a refusal to cooperate for nearly a year, right? There was obstruction. You needed subpoenas. President Trump didn't come forward and offer up his documents. He was keeping them locked up. And this administration, I believe, has cooperated in a constructive way with the Justice Department from the beginning. They didn't take months. They didn't stall. The president wasn't trying to hold up these documents as trophies. And so, it's a huge difference. But the bottom line is this, and Brian is exactly right. We need to have a full cooperation investigation. We need to get to the bottom of what happened, why and when, to understand everything. And in a broader sense, to make sure that no White House, no administration is ever able to handle classified documents this way and take them out of the White House from a classified setting. And I think, you know, we should get to the bottom of both, and I think we should run a reasonable process. And that's what's happening right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, you as members of Congress may have more of a hand in that in the coming weeks and months. There's this, you know, piece again -- Andy McCarthy speaking out on this saying after the White House has said there are no logs there, this is the personal home, where in the past they said the president does work from there. There are questions about whether there are logs of visitors or people who would have been there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Andy McCarthy writes this",
      "utterance": "I'm very confident that if the agency, meaning the Secret Service, believed it was in the interest of the president's security that the information would be produced for the bureau would be produced at warp speed. We've got at least one source saying to us the Secret Service is prepared to come forward with some information about visitors there but Congress is going to have to ask. Congressman Fitzpatrick, will you do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITZPATRICK",
      "utterance": "We will, Shannon. There's multiple ways to gather evidence and conduct investigations. Obviously, visitors log would be very helpful. If that doesn't exist, you go to other forms of evidence, video surveillance, physical surveillance, witness interviews. There's a whole host of ways to collect evidence. So, I have no doubt that certainly we're going to make sure of this, that the bureau does their job investigating this case. And again, they got to apply the law equally. That's very, very important for people in America to have faith and confidence in our justice system. It's a system I have worked in. It's very important for me that they do things the right way so that the American public has confidence in it. And that requires equal application of the law, consistent standards on investigations. That's what we're going to make sure happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Okay. You all are trying to make sure something else happen, which is that we don't default on our credit ratings. And you're negotiating and talking actively about the debt ceiling in a deal that could possibly come together. The White House says no negotiations at all. We know that's not practical given some of the demands that House GOP members that spending cuts and other things be included in order to get their vote. Our Edward Lawrence over at FOX Business has been reporting, Congressman Fitzpatrick, you've been working on something that would be a debt to GDP ratio, potentially. If you hit a certain number, then automatic cuts kick in. Can you give us any sense of where those negotiations are? What would be the ratio? How in the world do you decide whose programs automatically get cut in that scenario?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITZPATRICK",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, first thing that has to happen, Shannon, Speaker McCarthy has made several overtures to the White House. He wants to sit down and work a reasonable solution out. I hope the White House accepts his offer. In fact, it was White House that offered Speaker McCarthy the opportunity to come in. I hope that happens. And the White House's position cannot --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, but they say it's not going to be a negotiation over the debt ceiling. They say that is not what's going to happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITZPATRICK",
      "utterance": "That's a -- that's a problem. That's a problem and that's not leadership. When you have a divided government, four-vote Republican margin in the House, a one-vote Democratic margin in the Senate, divided chambers, you have to negotiate. That's what the American people elected us to do, is to work this out. So nobody should be taking the position that we're not going to negotiate. That's very irresponsible. Pertaining to your question, Shannon, one thing that we're just going to offer up as a possible bridge-building solution is to go right at the 1917 law itself that established the debt limit. It established it as a number, a numerical dollar amount, which doesn't make any sense. We think that more practically speaking, it should be a debt to GDP ratio. In 2008, our debt to GDP was about 40 percent. In 2018, it was about 70 percent. It's now at 125 percent. That's not sustainable. So, when you have a child that has a spending problem, you do two things. You pay their bills, and take away their credit card. You don't do one, you do both. That's what has to happen here. So what we're going to propose is whatever negotiated amount we can agree on on a debt to GDP ratio and have a cure period there after. If that cure does not happen, certain budgetary reforms automatically kick in on the discretionary side. So, we're still putting the meat on those bones. Me and Josh are going to work through our proposed solution. But the first thing that's got to happen, Shannon, the president has to sit down with Speaker McCarthy. Speaker McCarthy offered to negotiate in good faith. I hope President Biden does as him (ph)."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK. So, \"The Washington Post\" is quoting a senior Democrat over in Congress that says he had a conversation with Ron Klain, White House chief of staff who may soon be leaving. But he essentially said, no holds barred, there will be no negotiations. You've got to make it look like we're the responsible ones and that the Republicans are essentially irresponsible, trying to kill entitlements, and those kinds of things. Congressman Gottheimer, can you work with that? If that's the strategy, if that's the theory, how do you move the ball at all?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOTTHEIMER",
      "utterance": "Well, I've had conversations with the White House just this weekend. And I'm optimistic that they will sit down as this White House always has. That's why we were able to accomplish so much in a bipartisan way last Congress. It takes constructive conversation. I think there's things reasonable on the table and things that are unreasonable. Gutting Social Security and Medicare is obviously on the unreasonable side."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Which the speaker has said is not on the table. Yeah. Just to be clear, the speaker has said that those -- that those -- that that's a talking point and that Republicans are not going to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOTTHEIMER",
      "utterance": "By the way, that's great, because I don't think it should be on the table. Things like 30 percent sales tax should not be on the table. But there are plenty of things that should be. And, you know, Brian and I and the Problem Solvers Caucus are obviously having discussions. I think the White House, you see Kevin McCarthy and the president will be sitting down, the speaker and the president will be sitting down. I think that's a good thing. What we can't do is put the full faith in the credit of United States of America at risk. We can't put people's 401(k)s at risk. We need to have these constructive conversations, make sure that we raise the debt limit responsibly so that people can have faith in our country and our currency. And we can also talk about our fiscal health and do that in a responsible way. I think we need to do both. And I'm optimistic that everyone will sit down. We'll work this out, because we have no other choice. We have to work this out."

      "speaker": "FITZPATRICK",

Again, we're going to let our speaker take the lead on this with his negotiations and then Josh and I are going to offer our solution that hopefully can be constructive. But I don't believe it's going to affect our relationship with the White House, Shannon. We've had a constructive relationship with them.

Given this discovery, the fifth batch on Friday, as DOJ and FBI agents were there. Jonathan Turley writes this about the personal's statements. He shrugged off the matter like finding a borrowed hammer in his garage.

Every day, seems like everywhere he's had a cup of coffee he's got documents behind him. And now, DOJ is finding all this. I think the biggest issue as we turn forward with it is the access piece to it, right? We know what the Mar-a-Lago raid, were all in one room and the access was fairly limited. It's in his garage, right? In certain office space. We don't know who has access to this stuff. I think that's the biggest question going forward."

Marie?"

    {
      "speaker": "MARIE HARF, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON",
      "utterance": "Look, the reason we know there were more documents found is that Biden's personal attorneys invited the department of justice in to look for them. A couple were found, I think six last night. So they are fully cooperating. The Biden team will tell you, we are fully cooperating, we are inviting them in. That is in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who repeatedly lied, he and his attorneys did, to the federal government. He claimed they were his. He claimed he declassified them. We have no idea who had access to them at Mar-a-Lago. We know there have been security concerns there. So, would I prefer not to be talking about this on \"FOX News Sunday\" as a Democrat? Of course, I would. But I think attend of the day the distinction of how the Biden team has handled them, inviting DOJ and fully cooperating, letting them look into whatever they can, compared to the Trump team which is at every single turn really pushed back, even lied to the FBI and to the Archives. I think at the end of the day that distinction will be quite clear to people."

Did they have security clearance? Which we don't have full clarity on yet. But, look, Shannon, years ago. I remember seeing Dean Martin. He'd walk out on stage and say, how did all these people get in my room? That's Joe Biden every time he finds a document. How did this document get here? Well, it didn't walk in. You placed it there or someone near you did. We need to know why and how. When you look at the Penn Biden Center, that first discovery is particularly disturbing because the classified documents were mingled in among personal files. They were even in envelopes marked personal files. Why? Who put them there? And when you overlay the timetable of the documents discovered and what was happening in Joe Biden's life, they do track with the Hunter Burisma deal, the Iran nuke deal, the Chinese natural gas deal that we've discovered, or has come to light, via Hunter's lap top.

They gave the White House this week to answer questions about this. They say they've heard crickets so far from the White House, despite the public responses. Meanwhile, White House administration officials telling me they're still deciding how they want to respond to these request for communications. But as far as President Biden goes, the revelation that some of those documents included documents, we don't know how many, dating back to his time in the U.S. Senate, is at odds with the statements from the White House that he has handled the classified information in an appropriate manner and takes it very seriously, so to speak, bringing new scrutiny on that."

They're pressing for big spending cuts but there's a real chance the GOP could end up blamed for cascading negative effects if the U.S. even approaches a scenario where it defaults on its financial obligation. How much danger for them there?"

You've got Democrats basically at this point saying we're going to have a clean debt ceiling. That's about it. There's zero chance that that happens. There's going to be a discussion between Speaker McCarthy and the administration. I assume the Senate will be part of that discussion. It's not unprecedented. I remember sitting there in 2011 when we were doing this with Joe Biden with the Budget Control Act. So, this is something that has lot of history, lot of precedent. What U.S. Republicans need to do is figure out what ignites them to get to question, because that's the other piece that has to happen. It's not a negotiable outcome. The outcome has to be there. But they've got to get as far down the road on the conservative side with spending cuts and the like to get that conference together."

Republicans in Congress voted three times to raise the debt ceiling under President Trump, not demanding any of the kinds of spending cuts they're demanding now. So, Republicans find fiscal austerity generally when a Democrat is in the White House. But the case that Ron Klain or any other senior adviser to Biden will tell you is under President Biden, record unemployment, 11 million jobs created, record numbers of small business applications being put in in the last two years. Contrast that with Republicans taking over Congress. The first thing they do, cut Medicare and Social Security, default on our obligations, get our credit rating downgraded. I think the Biden White House feels very confident that if you take those two messages to the American people, they're going to come out on the winning end of that policy wise economically but also politically, Shannon."

As you were talking about earlier this morning, many of these clerks have already left. Their tenure ended, they moved on. We didn't get testimony for some of them and records for some of them.

So, thank you for coming to have the conversation. Penny, I want to start here. Many of the marchers I talked to said this is just the beginning, getting rid of Roe, and that's something that the White House finds alarming. This is what the president said in a proclamation this week about the Supreme Court overturning Roe. He said, never before has the court taken away a right so fundamental to Americans. In doing so, it put the health and lives of American - of women across the nation at risk. So, opponents of your work, including the president, say you're actually hurting women by this work."

Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who in their paper, The Revolution, called it sadly child murder. You had women like Alice Paul who said, the - that abortion is the ultimate exploitation of women. And then now, the pro-life movement is led by women all over this country. Concerned Women for America have worked to protect women and their children from the very beginning. We have marched to the Capitol. We have gone and advocated for our position. We've gone to the state capitals and women have gotten elected to advocate for this position because we believe that in the dignity and human life, there are two people, two lives at stake in this question. And we want to love them both. There was a poll that just came down, a Marist poll, that said 90 percent of people want to protect the babies and their mothers. People recognize this is a lie. Roe wasn't settled because people knew in their hearts there was a baby at stake."

So, available through the mail. There's no prohibition on women traveling across state lines. So, is there a problem with access in 2023?"

      "speaker": "ELIZABETH WYDRA, PRESIDENT, CONSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY CENTER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean there is a problem with access for sure. There was actually a problem with access even when Roe was on the book. But I think what we're seeing here is millions and millions of Americans, particularly women, woken up after Roe was overturned to this idea that many had taken for granted that a decision so fundamental, so personal, so life changing such as whether to terminate a pregnancy or to carry a pregnancy to term was now not going to be their own decision. That instead it could be made by politicians and not be made by the person themselves with their family, with their doctor, with their god, but instead could be determined by their state legislatures or their governors. And that's why we've seen this wave of activism where people are saying in states, you know, not just super liberal states, we're also talking like Kentucky, Kansas, you know, states where, through ballot initiatives, people are saying, we want to ensure reproductive care access. We want to make sure that reproductive care, including abortion, is still available. And it is up to the person themselves to determine whether or not to terminate a pregnancy."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Both of you have mentioned the fact that this did go to the states and there were ballot initiatives. There were different places that we covered and talked about how people have voted on this. I remember, Penny, talking to you years ago, in 2016, when President Trump got into the primary. A lot of pro-life leaders were very worried about him. They weren't sure where he was going to be. You wound up calling him the most pro-life president in history. Then after the midterms did not go as well as expected for the Republicans, he said this. It wasn't my fault that the Republicans didn't live up to expectations in the midterms. It was the abortion issue poorly handled by many Republicans that lost large numbers of voters. So, what's your response to that accusation this issue actually hurt at the polls?"

    {
      "speaker": "NANCE",
      "utterance": "Well, of course, you know, the pro-life movement is very grateful to President Trump. He appointed three constitutionalist justices that Concerned Women for America worked very hard to get confirmed. And I even called him after the overturn and thanked him for that. But, you know, we just basically disagree. What we saw happen was Republicans listening to the consultant class, running away from the abortion issue, being told only to talk about inflation and Joe Biden, and being outspent 35 to one on this issue. The other side spent $391 million on ads to Republicans pettily little $11 million in ads. The other side painted them as extremists when the real extreme opinion on this is the other side that says abortion should be legal, any time, any reason, any number, all paid for by the taxpayer. We know that is not the position of the American people. This question has been returned to the American people. And we are happy to advocate for our position and go state by state. And that's the next step. That's the next phase of what Steve Scalise said at the march."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, and - and there are things that are still happening here in - in -- both on Capitol Hill as well. And there's talk about a national ban or a national codification. But a couple things the House has already voted on, again in the control of the GOP now. They voted on a resolution to condemn attacks and violence on pregnancy centers and pro-life organizations. Only three Democrats out of more than 200 voted yes on that. There was also a bill that would have called for medical care for a baby that survived an attempted abortion. Only one Democrat voted for that. Elizabeth, why vote no on those kinds of measures?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WYDRA",
      "utterance": "You know, I haven't seen the particulars of those bills. You know, I think we should condemn violence on, you know, all activists who are, you know, people who are -- have been - there have been subjects -- threat subjects and danger to people who are trying to facilitate abortion care. So - but I think, you know, one of the pieces of legislation that I find really interesting for this moment is actually the Respect for Marriage Act that passed with bipartisan support in the last Congress. And I think what that showed is that, with overturning of Roe, people woke up to the idea that other rights that they thought were deeply embedded in constitutional principles of equality and liberty, like the right to choose abortion for oneself, including marriage equality for LBGTQ Americans, interracial couples, they saw that those could be on the chopping block, too. And that's why this legislation that would protect the marriage equality that we have come to expect from our constitutional rights into law. So, I think we're seeing a great awakening of people recognizing that. If this Supreme Court isn't going to recognize the full spectrum of equality and liberty that was supposed to be guaranteed to us in the 14th Amendment particularly, that they are going to need to use other channels like the congressional enactments that I just talked about and like their ballot measures. You know, we, the people, are coming back to say, we need equal citizenship stature. We need to be able to come to the public square as people who can make fundamental decision about our own bodies, about our own lives, for ourselves."

I tried to get Garth Brooks tickets for - for Vegas. Couldn't do that. So, I think it's been long overdue, quite frankly, for someone to have some regulatory action here and investigation because America -- this is something that Americans care about, right? This is something that they don't always pay attention to the debt ceiling or, you know, any of these topics we talk about, which are important, I wish they did, but at the end of the day if you say, what drives you crazy, a loft them will say Ticketmaster."

Those are the service fees that, in this case, you pay on - on going to an event like this. That's something that Amy Klobuchar and the senators who are investigating in this are also looking into.

He has denied all along that he pulled the trigger, that he's responsible. Prosecutors feel otherwise and they have charged him. \"The Federalist\" has this headline, Alec Baldwin baffled that he, not the gun, will be charged with manslaughter. According to Baldwin, everyone and everything are to blame for the shooting except for himself. Josh, this -- this has all kinds of currents to it. We have a woman, Halyna Hutchins, who lost her life here and yet it's a very prominent case involving a very prominent celebrity."

I mean it's just the perfect example of a celebrity going out, trying to justify themselves in the court of public opinion, not knowing that ultimately down the road everything that he said in all these interviews with Stephanopoulos and everything else is used and is admissible to the ultimate criminal charges that are up against him. That's his problem. I think that's why he's in this hot water."

When they say cold gun on a set and the armorer brings you that gun, you expect there is nothing in that chamber. That's what he was assured. I don't think you can hold the actor culpable here. But the one charge of manslaughter might apply to him as a producers."

      "utterance": "We have some difficult news to share this morning. A treasured member of the Fox News family passed away this week. Alan Komissaroff died following a heart attack. He was our senior vice president of news and politics. For decades Alan was a guiding force here. He started as a writer when Fox News Channel launched back in 1996. Alan then worked his way up through the ranks. A diligent, perfectionist who became indispensable. Alan was part of every major news story and every election night for decades, meaning he had a hand in how Fox covered the biggest stories that affected your world. Alan, who I will always remember with a smile on his face, was just 47 years old. He is survived by his loving wife Rachel, who was his high school sweetheart and prom date, and their two children, 17-year-old son Ben and 13-year-old daughter Olivia. Alan was so very proud of them. As my colleague, Bret Baier, said this week, Alan made all of us better. He will be remembered in a service today in East Brunswick, New Jersey. We are wishing comfort to his family and his friend and to everyone who is feeling this loss. That's it for today. Thank you for joining us. I'm Shannon Bream. We'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY."
