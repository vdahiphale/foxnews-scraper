It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" We begin with a Fox News alert, a powerful 7.0 earthquake causing what local authorities are calling major damage after striking just outside the city of Anchorage, Alaska. Trace Gallagher is standing by with the very latest.

If you've showed pictures this is traffic backed up for several miles. The Seward Highway was shut down because of a rock slide. But a lot of the major access roads are either open and flowing or in the process of being reopened. A lot of the traffic that's coming in right now back into Anchorage, remember there was that tsunami warning earlier, that was listed but a lot of those people were told to go to higher ground. They're now trying to get back into their homes. And some bridges, the structural integrity of those has not been checked out, so a lot of the traffic is being diverted on to other roads. As for electricity, there are reports of at least 7,000 homes and businesses without power, but one of the primary substations has just gone back on line. And there are no reports of any powerlines down and that's very good news for the crews that are trying to get those electricity needs up and running again. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And here's the amazing thing, a short time ago the fire chief came out and said that they went and scanned around the city of Anchorage and found no major structural damage of any of the buildings, which is a very big testament to the city's very strict building codes. We should also note that Alaska Airlines is now back up and running, it is the region biggest carrier and flights are now going back to and from Ted Stevens Airport. And the airport is really emphasizing to people that it is open again. Earlier, the roads to and from were closed, but now they're saying the roads to and from the airport are open. The airport is open. The bad news is the train service across most of the state is not operating. The good news is that in Alaska most of the train service is freight. It's not passenger. This earthquake, imagine, 7.0, stronger than the San Francisco earthquake, the North Ridge earthquake, and the damage right now appears to be significant but not devastating, Dana. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Take a look at that first one, Prince William Sound earthquake in 1964, it's a 9.2. That was the second strongest earthquake we've seen anywhere on earth, at least, in recorded history. So they get very, very strong ones there. That last one here, the fifth one, the Unimak Island one that caused a storm surge -- excuse me, a tsunami all the way into South America. So, travels very far. The tsunami is not the case with this one. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That is what we have the earthquake thing in the last 12 hours. Those yellow dots are the last 12 hours, the red dots as we get a little bit closer within the last hour. And you get an idea of all of the aftershocks here we've had in the last 12 hour. Lots of them, some smaller aftershocks here just within the last hour. But the proximity into Anchorage is why we were so concerned about potential damage from this, from a 7.0 earthquake, the first aftershock after that was a 6.6. Because of that we did had a tsunami warning that came out here just across the Cook Inlet, that expired though, so we're looking just fine with that. And as far as temperatures go, it is very cold right now, temps into the 20's, 28 degrees. Just about 2.5 hours more of daylight. Tomorrow once the daylight comes back, up temps go up to about 40 degrees. Dana?",

He held firm on steel and aluminum. And it puts him in a really strong position. What he needs to achieve tomorrow over the China trade war, and we're winning that trade war right now. The Chinese economy is off 30 percent since that trade war started. They thought those retaliatory tariffs were going bring political pressure to bear on the president. That did not happen.

On China, I think that, obviously, the trade war is significant, and there needs to be more leverage gained and mentioned of the IP theft going on, the erosion of quality, and also they're flooding our country, frankly, with illicit drugs. There's a lot of talks about southern border, physical penetration. It's also happening in the air supply and with the mail system. So I think there are overarching issues that need to be included in that conversation that, certainly, again, the elected officials they need to be a little bit more than whiners.",

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" We begin with a Fox News alert, a powerful 7.0 earthquake causing what local authorities are calling major damage after striking just outside the city of Anchorage, Alaska. Trace Gallagher is standing by with the very latest. Trace?"

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Dana, this was a big one. A number of roads in and around Anchorage have now been damaged including the Seward Highway. If you've showed pictures this is traffic backed up for several miles. The Seward Highway was shut down because of a rock slide. But a lot of the major access roads are either open and flowing or in the process of being reopened. A lot of the traffic that's coming in right now back into Anchorage, remember there was that tsunami warning earlier, that was listed but a lot of those people were told to go to higher ground. They're now trying to get back into their homes. And some bridges, the structural integrity of those has not been checked out, so a lot of the traffic is being diverted on to other roads. As for electricity, there are reports of at least 7,000 homes and businesses without power, but one of the primary substations has just gone back on line. And there are no reports of any powerlines down and that's very good news for the crews that are trying to get those electricity needs up and running again. And here's the amazing thing, a short time ago the fire chief came out and said that they went and scanned around the city of Anchorage and found no major structural damage of any of the buildings, which is a very big testament to the city's very strict building codes. We should also note that Alaska Airlines is now back up and running, it is the region biggest carrier and flights are now going back to and from Ted Stevens Airport. And the airport is really emphasizing to people that it is open again. Earlier, the roads to and from were closed, but now they're saying the roads to and from the airport are open. The airport is open. The bad news is the train service across most of the state is not operating. The good news is that in Alaska most of the train service is freight. It's not passenger. This earthquake, imagine, 7.0, stronger than the San Francisco earthquake, the North Ridge earthquake, and the damage right now appears to be significant but not devastating, Dana."

      "utterance": "Yeah, Dana. So they get a lot of earthquakes in Alaska, they also get a lot of really strong ones. Take a look at that first one, Prince William Sound earthquake in 1964, it's a 9.2. That was the second strongest earthquake we've seen anywhere on earth, at least, in recorded history. So they get very, very strong ones there. That last one here, the fifth one, the Unimak Island one that caused a storm surge -- excuse me, a tsunami all the way into South America. So, travels very far. The tsunami is not the case with this one. That is what we have the earthquake thing in the last 12 hours. Those yellow dots are the last 12 hours, the red dots as we get a little bit closer within the last hour. And you get an idea of all of the aftershocks here we've had in the last 12 hour. Lots of them, some smaller aftershocks here just within the last hour. But the proximity into Anchorage is why we were so concerned about potential damage from this, from a 7.0 earthquake, the first aftershock after that was a 6.6. Because of that we did had a tsunami warning that came out here just across the Cook Inlet, that expired though, so we're looking just fine with that. And as far as temperatures go, it is very cold right now, temps into the 20's, 28 degrees. Just about 2.5 hours more of daylight. Tomorrow once the daylight comes back, up temps go up to about 40 degrees. Dana?"

They've been saying that since the inauguration. I've been watching the Clinton affair on A&E and it reminds me when he was trying to knock out deals and protect the country and improved the economy, and he had this nasty special counsel on his back. And he kept saying over, and over, and over again, put this aside, let me go back to work for the American people. I have to work and help the country. And what did the voters say? At the end of the whole spectacle he had the highest approval rating ever because all he wanted to do was work hard for the American people. If I were Trump I would do the same thing. I would just stop with the witch hunt texting and the tweeting. I'll say let me get to work. And look what he's doing, speaking of Clinton, his signature trade deal he's now rescinded it and repackaged it so American auto workers, dairy producers, energy, water, wine, all these industries are now in an improved position. He held firm on steel and aluminum. And it puts him in a really strong position. What he needs to achieve tomorrow over the China trade war, and we're winning that trade war right now. The Chinese economy is off 30 percent since that trade war started. They thought those retaliatory tariffs were going bring political pressure to bear on the president. That did not happen. Trump only lost one soybean district in the mid-terms. And if you look at the whole big picture, Greg always likes to say look at the results. The results are strong. You just have this really nagging special counsel on the other end which makes his life miserable."

Their cheeks swollen with rotten fruits and vegetables because that's all they want is bad news. And that's what you saw in that montage, a bunch of -- they all have Trump success denial disorder. They can't bear it. The thing is, I've even admit, like I learned a lot about trade. I don't like where he was going with trade, but he forced it on me. I had to learn about these imbalances that I didn't want to learn about because, frankly, I'm an opinion person. I don't want to learn about trade. I just want to shout about it, but he forced me to learn about it. And I realize, you know what, the guy cares about it. The guy turns out he's right, he's getting stuff done.

In terms of the NAFTA deal, let me just point out that a good conservative organ like the Wall Street Journal said this is just basically the status quo. It could have been worse given Trump's protectionist instinct. But you look at what is highlighted in terms of the NAFTA deal and that is dairy farmers. And you say, well, is it a much better deal for American dairy farmers? Well, it's a 1 percent - - or a little less than 1 percent increase in the quota of American dairy allowed into Canada.

He doesn't make any reference to the class seven pricing system being gone in Canada, and what things are achieved. And for me as an American citizen, I don't understand why compromise hasn't been achieved this entire time. Hasn't been reached. I don't want my elected officials to be standing and shouting for 20 years without anything accomplished because it's compromise that we're all sending them therefore because otherwise they're not serving us and they'll be absolutely nothing gained. On China, I think that, obviously, the trade war is significant, and there needs to be more leverage gained and mentioned of the IP theft going on, the erosion of quality, and also they're flooding our country, frankly, with illicit drugs. There's a lot of talks about southern border, physical penetration. It's also happening in the air supply and with the mail system.

I think he's too young. He's too green. And I don't think he has the sharp elbows. Remember, Obama was pretty strong in those debates, and he had a pretty sharp tongue. I think Beto is too nice. I will look at some of those other candidates. Julian Castro, he's got a good look. I think he could definitely go far.
