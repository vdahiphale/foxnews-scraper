Fresh off the released of her tax returns, revealing Elizabeth Warren's $900,000 income, pretty close. The latest contestant, Bernie Sanders, who just told the New York Times, \"I wrote a best-selling book, if you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire too.\" It sounds pretty cool.

So, he is not going to acknowledge the fact that our free enterprise system is generating as many jobs and rising prosperity, and bigger paychecks. Because that doesn't fit with his sort of Marxist Leninist view of how economies work. But, you're right, he's just ignoring the facts. Think about it. When President Trump came in, Democrats who served in the Obama administration said, we'll never see that three percent growth that Trump keeps talking about. One of them called it a fairy tale. What we've had three percent growth. We've seen unemployment continue to drop. We've seen jobs continue to be created. We now have more vacancies than we have people looking for work, and wages are growing up. Now, they were going up under President Obama, but the wages for supervisors were growing 40 percent faster than the wages for working people.

But what we're should be focusing on is actually solving the problems that a lot of Americans are dealing with because we've been fighting for too long in Washington, and we haven't fixed our health care system. We haven't lower drug prices, we haven't built infrastructure, we haven't done some of the basic things we should have done. I mean, to me, Ed, the model of the United States of America is we're a free-market country and we have strong social programs. Like Medicare and Social Security and we're supposed to have good public schools. And there's a lot of problems that we need to solve and that's really where we need to focus. We need new ideas."

      "speaker": "DELANY",
      "utterance": "So, I would expand something called the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is really the worker's tax credit, right? Because the unemployment numbers are low but pay is also really low. You know, half of this country can't afford a $500 expense, right? So, they're working two or three jobs, they're barely getting by. I would want to do things like take that Earned Income Tax Credit which is a really successful and used to be a bipartisan kind of endeavor. It puts a tax credit in the pockets of hardworking Americans. I want to actually double that. So, if you're working, you know, you get -- you get some additional tax credit help from the federal government."

      "utterance": "So, rather than cutting the corporate tax from 35 to 21, and by the way, Ed, no one even asked for 21, the business community asked for 25. How much better would that tax reform bill have been if we were to cut the corporate tax from 35 to 25 which is where the business community asks for today and taken $600 billion and expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit."

Who has the best ideas, the best new ideas? A lot of the things my -- some of my competitors are pushing -- you know, like single-payer health care, that's bad policy. We should have universal healthcare. But that's not the right way to get there. You know, the Green New Deal is not the right way to deal with climate change, which is a huge issue that we have to deal with.

He presented an application to the FISA Court where he has a special obligation to tell the other side of the story because it's never told, and I helped create the FISA Court so I think I'd probably understand it may be a little better than he does and I sure understand the obligations you have better than he does."

He'd go through the first three pages, this is something that should be you know, read in a -- in some dirty club or something, and it's really ridiculous. And then he never did anything to corroborate it. He said it's unverified. He's the director of the FBI. He's supposed to verify it, Jim you got to verify it. Here what you could -- here's what you could verify. You could have asked Steele, when is the last time you're in Russia. He'd have told you nine years ago.

I mean, the revelations of crimes committed by the people who instigated this investigation and some of the things they've done along the way are actually much more concerning than the ridiculous allegation of collusion which has no substance. Crimes were committed by the people who instigated this investigation. It starts with the four applications to the FISA Court which are fraudulent, they're phony, they're false."

I suspect it'll be nothing that we're not prepared for or haven't thought of, the president hasn't thought of, and we were ready for it three months ago. And the reality is there was no collusion. It's a joke but it's worse than a joke. It was a setup. It was a specific conspiracy to frame him. I think the facts are starting to come in on that. Pay attention to Ukraine, something the -- what do we call it, the mainstream media won't cover the scandal going on there, the investigation by the Ukrainian government of Ukrainians who possibly conspired with a Hilton -- the Clinton campaign and the DNC --"

    {
      "speaker": "GIULIANI",

The President of the United States did not obstruct. How can you obstruct when there's no underlying crime? Everything they're talking about that he did, this is an innocent man defending himself. If I'm accused of robbing a bank and I didn't do it, and I was with my friend the night that it happened, and I tweet out and I write to my friend and I say please tell them the truth, and if you don't you're a rat because you're lying.

What they are trying to take away from us, Weissman and Mueller's gang, these deranged Democrats is our ability to defend ourselves, and damn it, I'm not let them do that.

I don't know what your politics are. I'm really confused by it. I don't know what your sense of America is. I hope it's there, but I'm sure it is, but you did something wrong and I'd like to see you apologize for it and maybe we get we got a straight path then.

Tweeting, the people and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. Was bush she wrote, downplaying the terrorist attack? What if he was a Muslim? President Trump a short time ago fired back with a tweet of his own saying, simply we will never forget. Earlier I spoke to Hassan Shibly, Head of CAIR's Florida Chapter.

The point she was trying to make was that literally some people did something and it was horrible and as a result of some people doing something literally there has been countless hate crimes against community.

And again, like I said, when we were fighting, with my friends and I that work -- we weren't fighting for America against Islam, we were fighting for the western world against an ideology. I'm a public speaker. I remember one of the best compliments I got a few months ago, a man came up to me and said that I'm a Muslim-American and today I was very proud of you.

Students there voting overwhelmingly, a margin of 66 percent to 33 percent, to approve a fee of $27 per student to help fund charitable causes that directly benefit descendants of slaves once sold by the Jesuits in 1838. Now the measure still requires final approval from the university's board. So, what do you think about this? Lawrence Jones, editor of chief at Campus Reform and Fox News contributor. Jason Nichols is an American studies professor at a nearby college, University of Maryland, I should say, at College Park. Gentlemen, good to see you."

The problem is how do you determine who are the descendants of slaves and how is this actually going to help black folks in the long run?

And $27 a semester is a dinner at the Olive Garden. And this is one of the wealthiest universities, has one of the wealthiest populations of any of the universities in the country.
