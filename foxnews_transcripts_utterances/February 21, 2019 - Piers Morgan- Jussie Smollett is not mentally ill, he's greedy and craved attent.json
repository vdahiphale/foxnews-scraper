A tale of victimhood is now a tale of unimaginable hubris. Smollett stands charged with a felony for plotting his own assault from the very beginning. Tonight, we will investigate how this happened and why it happened. We will take a close look at Smollett's defenders who dismissed doubts about this story, doubts that any reasonable person would have had from day one as conspiracy theories.

      "sentences": "That's a fair question. What Smollett did was not simply illegal and weird, it was terrible for the country. So why did he do it? Well, the short answer appears to be he wanted a raise at work and he thought this would get him that. The broader answer, the one that we should all think about and meditate on is that Smollett was simply responding to the incentives that American society has created for him. Smollett pretended to be a victim because we reward victims. We've decided that it's more heroic to suffer than it is to achieve. That's the message of our culture, our politics, and our workplaces. Jussie Smollett was doing his best to get ahead according to the rules that others made. And in fact, had his hoax succeeded, there is no doubt Smollett would have been richly rewarded for it. He would probably get a significant bump in pay and an extended segment on \"Colbert.\" He would have been a hero. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So Jussie Smollett was not crazy. He knew exactly what he was doing. Faking a hate crime was an entrepreneurial move. In modern America, victimhood is power that's why so many powerful people claim it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's why Elizabeth Warren pretended to be an American Indian. It's why at every low point during the entire span of his political career, Barack Obama invoked bias. That's why so many politicians do the same today. \"I have suffered, you cannot criticize me.\" The academic left has constructed an entire theology around the holiness of victimhood, it's called intersectionality. It comes with an elaborate ratings system in which every group in America is assessed according to how much it has suffered. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The more your group says it has been discriminated against, the more moral authority you receive. It's a pretty good deal for a lot of people and they have no interest in changing it, and that explains why so many on the left initially jumped to Jussie Smollett's defense. They weren't simply defending him. They were defending identity politics. We could give you any number of examples of this, but we will skip ahead to the most nauseating one of all.

Who is the victim? Well, there is one. What Smollett did was not a victimless crime. There is no such thing as that. An entire group of people did get slandered by this hoax. Regular people from outside the coastal cities. People with the wrong political beliefs and the wrong skin color. Smollett and his many defenders savagely attacked these people and they are not apologizing for doing it. Instead they are telling you, you hear this everywhere that the real losers here are the authentic victims of hate crimes who won't be believed the next time. Okay. That's fine. But what about the innocent Americans they just poured venom on for two weeks because it matched some bigoted stereotypes they had about Middle America? What about them?

That is why when Smollett was finally caught, Lemon reacted in a very puzzling way. He didn't seem especially concerned that his buddy had lied to further divide the country to hurt America which he did, no, that wasn't the real problem. The real problem, according to Don Lemon is that Smollett's arrest might discredit the occult of victimhood. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And you see the effects very clearly. In the workplace, for example, in the years after the 2008 recession, there was enormous surge of claims of workplace bias of all kinds. There is still no evidence that bigotry itself increased at all during those years.

They had to be two white Trump supporters in \"Making America Great Again\" caps who attacked him because he knew that would be the perfect vehicle to turn him into American hero.

On Saturday, just this past Saturday, coming Saturday rather, Senator Cory Booker is attending a Silicon Valley fundraiser. It is hosted by Gary and Laura Lauder. They are heirs to the $14 billion Estee Lauder fortune. Kamala Harris just had a fundraiser in Beverly Hills that was attended by an army of wealthy studio execs. Kristin Gillibrand did not even start her campaign for President before asking the permission of Wall Street. So what is the message? Rich people are highly progressive now and you can see why? They love mass immigration, it brings them servants. They support Federally-mandated snobbery, masquerading as environmentalism. Abortion essentially a sacrament to them especially when practiced in poor neighborhoods. But here is the confusing part, these are by definition affluent people, and yet increasingly confiscatory tax rates are the rallying cry for the Democratic Party.

Here is one reason. Billionaires understand that they will never have to pay those taxes. Why? Because the top Federal income tax rate stops at about 500 grand. So what's the difference between someone making $500,000.00 a year and someone making $50 million a year? The answer. The richer one can much more easily evade paying full freight and they do. This group makes far more of their money on capital gains which are taxed at only half the rate of your salary, and some of it is not even taxed at all. Under the 2017 Tax Law, investments in Federally-designated opportunity zones evade capital gains taxes entirely. One such opportunity zone by the way is right by the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia, one of America's richest zip codes. But even on their official tax returns, even on income, the richest Americans are paying less. According to the IRS, the top 1% of Americans pay about 27% of their income in taxes, but the top tenth of 1% -- that's people who make $35 million a year -- pay less than 26%. And the top thousandth of a percent, the absolute richest pay less than 24%. In other words, past a certain point, the richer you are the less you pay. That's why billionaires back socialism. It doesn't cost them much. Dana Perino hosts \"The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.\" She is also coming on later in the show on \"Final Exam\" with Greg Gutfeld, but for now --",

She recently bragged about smoking a ton of weed in college listening to Tupac. Tupac Shakur had not released any music at the time it turned out. So when pressed on her commitment to legalizing weed, Harris resorted to another stereotype, \"Come on, man, I'm Jamaican.\" She said, \"I'm Jamaican.\" Okay, one person who didn't think was that funny was her own father. He is a Stanford professor called Donald Harris. He released a statement condemning what his daughter said, quote, \"My dear departed grandmother, as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their graves right now to see their family's name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity connected in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics. Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically disassociate ourselves from this travesty.\" It's amazing, but it really shouldn't surprise you. She was trafficking in stereotypes. Completely. Not every Jamaican has dreadlocks and smokes weed all day and you only have to be Kamala Harris to think otherwise. Amazing. That's it for us tonight.

We will take a close look at Smollett's defenders who dismissed doubts about this story, doubts that any reasonable person would have had from day one as conspiracy theories.

Why would a popular actor on a network TV show, someone who is rich and successful and famous pay people to assault him and risk going to jail in the process? Well, at a press conference in Chicago today, the Police Superintendent wondered the same thing."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That's a fair question. What Smollett did was not simply illegal and weird, it was terrible for the country. So why did he do it? Well, the short answer appears to be he wanted a raise at work and he thought this would get him that. The broader answer, the one that we should all think about and meditate on is that Smollett was simply responding to the incentives that American society has created for him. Smollett pretended to be a victim because we reward victims. We've decided that it's more heroic to suffer than it is to achieve. That's the message of our culture, our politics, and our workplaces. Jussie Smollett was doing his best to get ahead according to the rules that others made. And in fact, had his hoax succeeded, there is no doubt Smollett would have been richly rewarded for it. He would probably get a significant bump in pay and an extended segment on \"Colbert.\" He would have been a hero. So Jussie Smollett was not crazy. He knew exactly what he was doing. Faking a hate crime was an entrepreneurial move. In modern America, victimhood is power that's why so many powerful people claim it. That's why Elizabeth Warren pretended to be an American Indian. It's why at every low point during the entire span of his political career, Barack Obama invoked bias. That's why so many politicians do the same today. \"I have suffered, you cannot criticize me.\" The academic left has constructed an entire theology around the holiness of victimhood, it's called intersectionality. It comes with an elaborate ratings system in which every group in America is assessed according to how much it has suffered. The more your group says it has been discriminated against, the more moral authority you receive. It's a pretty good deal for a lot of people and they have no interest in changing it, and that explains why so many on the left initially jumped to Jussie Smollett's defense. They weren't simply defending him. They were defending identity politics. We could give you any number of examples of this, but we will skip ahead to the most nauseating one of all. Watch anchor Robin Roberts of ABC quote, \"News\" beam with joy after Smollett finishes the most dishonest performance of his life and then tell him his lies are beautiful."

      "utterance": "\"You can talk to me,\" Don Lemon says because there aren't a lot of us out there. Well, here is the translation. \"Us\" means people who have been oppressed in the ways that Jussie Smollett has been oppressed. Lemon is letting you know that he is in that group, too. Yes, he is a highly paid news anchor with his own TV show, and yet, like Jussie Smollett, Don Lemon is a holy victim. So there is a mad scramble over who is the victim here? Who is the victim? Well, there is one. What Smollett did was not a victimless crime. There is no such thing as that. An entire group of people did get slandered by this hoax. Regular people from outside the coastal cities. People with the wrong political beliefs and the wrong skin color. Smollett and his many defenders savagely attacked these people and they are not apologizing for doing it. Instead they are telling you, you hear this everywhere that the real losers here are the authentic victims of hate crimes who won't be believed the next time. Okay. That's fine. But what about the innocent Americans they just poured venom on for two weeks because it matched some bigoted stereotypes they had about Middle America? What about them? There is no mention of them. Don Lemon very like to keep up those attacks on those people, attacking them allows him to feel oppressed. That is why when Smollett was finally caught, Lemon reacted in a very puzzling way. He didn't seem especially concerned that his buddy had lied to further divide the country to hurt America which he did, no, that wasn't the real problem. The real problem, according to Don Lemon is that Smollett's arrest might discredit the occult of victimhood."

      "utterance": "Yes, because when you tell the truth about a hate hoax, you are the real hater. What's the cost of this attitude so floridly on display to our society? What does it do to us? Well, think of it this way? What would happen to your kids if you woke them up every morning by telling them that they were victims? No matter how hard they worked, people would always hate them just for who they are? What if did you that? Would that be good parenting? Would it make your kids stronger, happier, and more successful? No, it wouldn't and good parents would never do that. Good parents tell their kids to take responsibility for their lives, not to blame others, to work as hard as they can to overcome obstacles. That's what good parents of all of races and all background tell their kids. And if you don't believe it, just ask 10 well-adjusted accomplished people if their parents allowed them to feel like victims. Again, it doesn't matter where they are from or what they look like. Ask them. Did your parents tell you, you are a victim and not one of them will say \"yes.\" And yet, we tell our citizens just the opposite. And you see the effects very clearly. In the workplace, for example, in the years after the 2008 recession, there was enormous surge of claims of workplace bias of all kinds. There is still no evidence that bigotry itself increased at all during those years. And yet, when people felt threatened by a teetering economy, they knew that claiming victimhood status would give them an advantage. Can you blame them? No, you really can't. Not really. They didn't write the rules of our society. They are just following the rules that people like Don Lemon wrote, but at great cost.

This is where the victimhood culture that you so brilliantly articulated there meets Trump derangement syndrome, this disease which has afflicted so many particularly liberal celebrities. And I think in Jussie Smollett, you had greed as a motivation, but you also had - he wanted to be a celebrity victim as you said. He wanted people to feel sorry for him, to like him, to retweet him. But, also, he wanted to use the prism of his hatred for Donald Trump and all things Trump as the bedrock for this. They had to be two white Trump supporters in \"Making America Great Again\" caps who attacked him because he knew that would be the perfect vehicle to turn him into American hero. That actually if he was attacked by Trump supporters who lynched him or tried to lynch him with a noose and really, you know, committed one of the worst hate crimes imaginable, then he, Jussie Smollett, would become a hero and he would be a heroic victim, and in fact, he went further. In the Robin Roberts interview, he said that he fought back against these two guys. Well, we have now seen the size of them. These are two very big men. And, our hero, Jussie fought back, so he is a victim, but a hero who also fought back. And I look at this whole story. I tweet every day all day and I write columns two or three times a week.

And slowly but surely, the real story built up and this guy had completely invented the whole attack. He had staged it. He had roped in his friends to do this and I'm sorry, but I have already seen on social media people starting to feel sorry for this guy. You know, \"We should cut him some slack. He has got has mental health issues.\" That's always the first refuge of excuse for this kind of behavior. He is not mentally ill. He is greedy and he is somebody who was craving attention and a lot of the media as I think is very apparent from the story, a lot of the mainstream media in America have gone so full on anti-Trump that they were prepared to suspend all journalistic integrity and credibility in the way they reported this story by just believing every word this guy said, and they did it, Tucker, because we're now in a culture where my truth is perceived to be the truth and it's not. Time and again now, we see people where their truth, their idea of a truth is a complete lie. Jussie Smollett claimed to have been effectively lynched. Everybody followed up with this. All the Democrats were tweeting -- Kamala Harris to Cory Booker -- it was a lynching. They were trying to lynch this guy, but it wasn't. The only thing that was lynched was the truth."

      "utterance": "2019 is only a couple months old. We haven't given it a name yet, so how about \"The Year of the Woke Billionaire.\" Sit back and watch as the Democratic presidential candidates simultaneously jockey to establish the most left wing possible credentials and at the very same time, feverishly suck up to the super rich to fund their campaigns. We have seen some of this before Tom Steyer and George Soros as the obvious examples, but there are many, many, many more. On Saturday, just this past Saturday, coming Saturday rather, Senator Cory Booker is attending a Silicon Valley fundraiser. It is hosted by Gary and Laura Lauder. They are heirs to the $14 billion Estee Lauder fortune. Kamala Harris just had a fundraiser in Beverly Hills that was attended by an army of wealthy studio execs. Kristin Gillibrand did not even start her campaign for President before asking the permission of Wall Street. So what is the message? Rich people are highly progressive now and you can see why? They love mass immigration, it brings them servants. They support Federally-mandated snobbery, masquerading as environmentalism. Abortion essentially a sacrament to them especially when practiced in poor neighborhoods. But here is the confusing part, these are by definition affluent people, and yet increasingly confiscatory tax rates are the rallying cry for the Democratic Party. So why are billionaires so eager to back candidates who want to seize their assets to fund new entitlements? This is confusing. Here is one reason. Billionaires understand that they will never have to pay those taxes. Why? Because the top Federal income tax rate stops at about 500 grand. So what's the difference between someone making $500,000.00 a year and someone making $50 million a year? The answer. The richer one can much more easily evade paying full freight and they do. This group makes far more of their money on capital gains which are taxed at only half the rate of your salary, and some of it is not even taxed at all. Under the 2017 Tax Law, investments in Federally-designated opportunity zones evade capital gains taxes entirely. One such opportunity zone by the way is right by the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia, one of America's richest zip codes. But even on their official tax returns, even on income, the richest Americans are paying less. According to the IRS, the top 1% of Americans pay about 27% of their income in taxes, but the top tenth of 1% -- that's people who make $35 million a year -- pay less than 26%. And the top thousandth of a percent, the absolute richest pay less than 24%. In other words, past a certain point, the richer you are the less you pay. That's why billionaires back socialism. It doesn't cost them much. Dana Perino hosts \"The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.\" She is also coming on later in the show on \"Final Exam\" with Greg Gutfeld, but for now --"

And, yet, presenting herself as Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's what happens when you actually get into this sort of neo-apartheid of racial classification, and I find it particularly absurd.

Nobody alive today has a grandparent who was a slave, and in that sense, I think you reach a point where, you know, you need to move on. I mean, the reparations thing, eventually as the decades goes by becomes ridiculous. I'm Canadian. I mean, you guys should give us reparations because if you hadn't had Revolution, we would have -- the whole continent would now be Canada and if you were going to steal our land from us and driver the loyalists out, Tucker, you could at least have divided the continent East and West so that we, Canadians weren't holed up in the cold bit."

And, you know, listen, I've spent a lot of time with the Secret Service and the NYPD, but you don't have to be a law enforcement officer to have seen the red flags in the case, Tucker. First, if you are attacked like this violently at night, who doesn't turn over their police records to immediately clear themselves and try to get the actual bad guy? It just didn't make sense? And that statement you just read, I mean it's outrageous. He is not entitled to due process? Tucker, he was given every single benefit by the media, by everyone else, benefits by the way you and I wouldn't have -- we would have been questioned about this vigorously from the beginning. And now he is claiming somehow that he is a martyr in this? Listen, of course you are presumed innocent. I get that.

If they are cooperating and they have been released, what does that say to you as someone who thinks in common sense terms? They are either the attackers or they are not. They have been released.

They were wearing MAGA hats and they screamed, \"This is MAGA country.\" And then they put a noose around -- You know, one of the most abhorrent symbols of a troubled time in American history, it's all of these aggravating things he threw on top as if being attacked and claiming it was Trump supporters wasn't bad enough, Tucker, we've got to put bleach in it and a noose in and they screamed \"It's MAGA country.\" I mean, it really speaks to if this didn't happen and this is all a hoax, a level of serious depravity. This guy could need some serious help."

She heard Jussie Smollett's story and she concluded it was, quote, \"Beautiful.\" Was there ever a moment when you heard his story and you thought yourself that's beautiful?"

      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "No. I thought it's questionable. But, Robin Roberts needed that story to be true and wanted it to be true and it's clear from the questioning, there was not one critical question asked of a guy with a very suspect story. It's a real shame and a stain on journalism."

This was today. When he arrived he begged the crew and his fellow actors to believe him, to believe in his innocence. He said this, quote, \"I would never do this to any of you. You are my family. I swear to God, I did not do this.\" End quote. Well, the press didn't need that kind of begging to believe Jussie Smollett. Virtually, everyone in the press was ready to believe him anyway. LIZ PLANK, HOST OF VOX MEDIA'S \"CONSIDER IT\": What we do know is that racism is alive and well in this country. There is real evidence of people who have done these crimes who cite that the President has inspired that. JONATHAN CAPEHART, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": The fact that reportedly it reportedly said, \"This is MAGA country,\" adds to sort of the atmosphere of menace that African-Americans in particular and people of color in general have felt since the advent of the Trump administration."

He predicted the outcome in the Smollett case more than two weeks ago that he was attacked for it, but joins us now for a well-deserved, I don't want to call it a victory lap, but you were right.

That was the first thing that tipped me off there, like, something isn't right here. Now, we expect our -- that is the most simple question to ask. We expect our journalists to be able to -- that would be the most basic thing I would look up. None of them did it. And now what we see with the media is they are legitimately gas lighting the American public and saying \"No, no, we handled this very, very well. We were very fair.\" They are saying, \"A lot of celebrities and activists on Twitter ran with it and you are confusing us with them.\" No, you can certifiably look up \"The Washington Post,\" ABC News, NBC News, the Associated Press, \"The Guardian.\" You can go on forever. They all ran with the story. They all never said alleged attack. They never said claims. They said he was definitively attacked. Now, they are circling their wagons and now they are defending one another. I have never seen a journalist ever have true remorse ever go through a period of or very rarely a period of self-reflection and we're not going to see it here. Brian Stelter over at CNN is sort of leading the charge with this. It's about - they are continuing to protect their own, protect their industry, and they just simply do not care about the truth. They do not care about being anything but activists at this point."

      "utterance": "No, I think that's absolutely right. What's interesting is that there doesn't seem to be any penalty in this deeply corrupt, deeply corrupt business of journalism for getting it wrong in one direction. But if you would come out in public two weeks ago, I had doubts myself about this story, it seemed obviously like -- there were at least holes in it. I was afraid to express those doubts in public. It's not worth it actually. There would have been massive penalty for doubting this in public, and yet our job - isn't our job supposed to be skepticism?"

    {
      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "utterance": "Exactly, and I sort of thought the same thing. I said, if I'm wrong this could really be a big hit to my career. I was just so convinced that it wasn't. Nothing about it made sense. Meanwhile, at the time when a few brave people were actually expressing skepticism, they were called conspiracy theorists by the media. They were maligned and they were treated like kooks. And it turns out they were right all along, and, you know, the media will just move on. They don't care. They are really the propagators of all of this. They are the reason why Jussie Smollett felt like he could get away with this because he knew they would be on his side. Because they created this fake narrative of armies of racist Trump supporters marching around and assaulting people. So, why would he think that he wouldn't get away with it?"

It's almost like when these journalists actually seek out the truth and actually try to get to know these boogieman Trump supporters, they almost seem to always deflect afterwards and sort of seem to see the horrors that are happening in their industry. Journalists are -- they couldn't be more disconnected. I think that the Democratic politician who ran with this story from day one are genuinely corrupt and they are smart enough to see the holes in it."

      "utterance": "Thank you. Well speaking of presidential candidates, Kamala Harris has lost no time resorting to stereotypes to advance her cause. True. She recently bragged about smoking a ton of weed in college listening to Tupac. Tupac Shakur had not released any music at the time it turned out. So when pressed on her commitment to legalizing weed, Harris resorted to another stereotype, \"Come on, man, I'm Jamaican.\" She said, \"I'm Jamaican.\" Okay, one person who didn't think was that funny was her own father. He is a Stanford professor called Donald Harris. He released a statement condemning what his daughter said, quote, \"My dear departed grandmother, as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their graves right now to see their family's name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity connected in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics. Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically disassociate ourselves from this travesty.\" It's amazing, but it really shouldn't surprise you. She was trafficking in stereotypes. Completely. Not every Jamaican has dreadlocks and smokes weed all day and you only have to be Kamala Harris to think otherwise. Amazing. That's it for us tonight.
