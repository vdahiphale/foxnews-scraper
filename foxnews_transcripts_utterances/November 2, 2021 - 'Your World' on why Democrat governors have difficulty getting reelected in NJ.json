It seems like the race in Virginia has been defined by schools, by Critical Race Theory, by COVID, by mask mandates. But when you talk to Democrats privately -- and Republicans are pushing this very publicly -- inflation is front and center. And when you look at the latest lines of the Federal Reserve, they're basically suggesting that this isn't going to be transitory, that this could be with us for some time. They give an indeterminate timeline, though, for how long it will be with us. And the crucial question, at least politically, is whether or not this will affect the midterms. So will there still be 4 percent, 5 percent annualized inflations when voters go to the poll -- polls in one year? And, of course, overlaying all this is the decision on who Biden will appoint to the Federal Reserve. He just gave us a little bit of tease there, Neil. He said he will be making an announcement fairly quickly. So I will let you tease that out on just how imminent a Fed announcement might be -- Neil.",

I think one of my biggest critiques of the 2017 Trump tax cuts were that some of them were rushed through, and people didn't get the full implications. As a finance guy, there is some devil in the details on the tax policy.",

Every other week was infrastructure week, and nothing happened. We produced a broad bipartisan bill. And then I agree with the vast majority of the president's agenda in the Build Back Better agenda. And I think we could have sequenced that infrastructure vote in September. But I think we get this done, the sausage-making, people will forget very quickly. And what they will remember is, the country stepped up on climate change, the country stepped up on child care, so that women could get back to work, we did it in a way that was paid for, in a way that makes our tax code fairer.

And what in the world to make of some contests that weren't supposed to be contests little more than a couple of months ago, but are very much so right now?

They close here at 7:00 p.m. They say that they're encouraged by some of the reports that they're hearing from around the state as to where people are showing up on this Election Day. Of course, show me a pessimistic politician, at least who will acknowledge something pessimistic on Election Day, it'll be a pretty tough ask here. Terry McAuliffe himself has had a pretty quiet day today. He showed up earlier today in Falls Church, Virginia, met with a number of union supporters from the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU. He's also been getting a boost from politicians in the Democratic Party from Washington, congressional Democrats, and especially from President Joe Biden, who campaigned with him last week, and now from across the pond and Europe is doing so again today."

We talked to a Clyburn aide, said that he wanted to come out and wanted to support McAuliffe here to turn out the African-American vote in the state because he said it is so important. Now, early voting started in this state in the middle part of September. And that process ended on Saturday. McAuliffe's folks said that they are encouraged by where those early vote totals are coming from. About a fifth of the electorate voted by Saturday in this race. But we have had a full day of open polls here. They close at 7:00 p.m. And what happens between then and where we are at 7:00 p.m. is going to determine what kind of an event they have here in Northern Virginia. Back to you."

And he has left the big names and the big party players off the campaign trail. But whether he -- where he really found his footing, I mean, that was clearly on the issue of education, promising to combat what he sees as government overreach in schools.

And Youngkin, as you mentioned, does have all the momentum. I think you got to be looking at a county like Loudoun County, which is in the outskirts of Washington, D.C., the suburbs, which went for Democrats in the last election. That county went heavily for Biden, less so, but still heavily for Hillary Clinton. If Youngkin can keep that to the single digits, just lose that by five or six points, he's going to win this. I see a lot of signs of Youngkin in Northern Virginia, which trends blue. So that's a good sign for Youngkin. He's been a good candidate, and the Biden numbers really hurt McAuliffe. They really do."

Is it that much of an issue? I know, as you remind me, local races are local races. State races, it's more about the state. But is there frustration among Democratic voters who say, all right, we were on the verge of getting something, now it looks like it's delayed, maybe even denied? What do you think?"

As far as Biden victories, yes, he got the COVID-19 bill through, that was a big victory. That was an eternity ago in politics."

      "utterance": "Now, I was thinking of that, and knowing that you were coming on, wondering the finger-pointing that would begin, if it turns out that way, that will moderates blame progressives for forcing an issue, delaying things, confusing the American people? You can take a lot of leaps here, but where would it go?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUSACK",

But none of that seems to be resonating. Now, it might, and we might be premature in dismissing it. But the president looks powerless in the face of a potential wave. How would you describe his predicament?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUSACK",
      "utterance": "I think it's a very bad sign that Biden, who was over 50 percent, doing well this summer, has dropped basically 10-plus points, depending on which poll you look at. And this is the first year of his presidency. So that's the problem for the midterms going forward. And, of course, there are a lot of lawmakers that we talk to in the House and Senate, Democratic lawmakers, who know their history and know that the House is likely to flip to Republicans. The Senate's tougher, because Republicans defending a lot more seats. But that could also flip. So there's a lot of angst in the Democratic Party right now, because they haven't gotten the legislative wins that they thought they would have got to by the end of October."

So they're going to watch how many hold onto their jobs, all the way up to Phil Murphy himself, because remember this about New Jersey. It rarely reelects Democratic governors. In fact, the last time it did so was back in 1977 with Brendan Byrne. So, Phil Murphy isn't only fighting Republicans. He could be fighting history. Christie Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor, on that -- after this."

But a number of Republicans have won the governorship there, just as they have in states that are also liberal, like Massachusetts, for example. But the anomaly in New Jersey for a Democratic governor seeking reelection is remarkable, that no Democratic governor has gotten reelected in his own right since Brendan Byrne did it back in 1977. So it does raise questions that Phil Murphy isn't only battling the Grand Old Party, but some very stubborn grand old history.

I caught up with both candidates out on the campaign trail in just the last few days. Jack Ciattarelli, who's running as a moderate has been highly critical of the governor's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and tells us he's now focused on fixing New Jersey's taxes, which are the highest in the nation.

Although New Jersey has more registered Democrats than Republicans, this race has actually become pretty tight, more tight than people have expected leading up to Election Day. And it's been 44 years since a Democratic governor has been reelected in New Jersey, more than 40 years since that's happened. It's a wild statistic. And polls close tonight at 8:00.

Jack Ciattarelli has -- is counting on the conservative Republican base. That's how he's been running. And that's where he -- those people come out to vote. He knows that. He has to get them out. And that's what he's still doing today. And Murphy is trying his hardest. He's not perhaps the most exciting candidate that gets people's passions up.

It's on that issue that he seems to be running the most favorable among voters.

And everybody who runs says they're going to go after this issue. And so I think -- I think voters here in the state have sort of said, OK, we have heard that before. We wish you luck. We hope you do it. But the most important thing to my immediate future is what's happened with COVID.

One of the other things that you have heard championed by Joe Manchin and some other maybe more moderate Democrats, certainly a whole slew of economists, is, all of this government spending is going to be inflationary and the proof is in the pudding right now. By the way, pudding prices have doubled. I didn't know that. But the fact of the matter is, it is a worry. I'm just wondering how much of it worry and a concern today in all of these crucial contests. Let's go to Hans Nichols of Axios, pick his fine brain on this. Hans, what do you think, inflation as a factor in these races? What do you think?"

It seems like the race in Virginia has been defined by schools, by Critical Race Theory, by COVID, by mask mandates. But when you talk to Democrats privately -- and Republicans are pushing this very publicly -- inflation is front and center. And when you look at the latest lines of the Federal Reserve, they're basically suggesting that this isn't going to be transitory, that this could be with us for some time. They give an indeterminate timeline, though, for how long it will be with us. And the crucial question, at least politically, is whether or not this will affect the midterms. So will there still be 4 percent, 5 percent annualized inflations when voters go to the poll -- polls in one year? And, of course, overlaying all this is the decision on who Biden will appoint to the Federal Reserve. He just gave us a little bit of tease there, Neil. He said he will be making an announcement fairly quickly. So I will let you tease that out on just how imminent a Fed announcement might be -- Neil."

They have been buying a lot of Treasury notes and bonds ad nauseum to the tune of $120 billion a month.

We do know, we get a sense, at least from the senators that are talking to the White House about the appointment, that they are concerned about market reaction. And that's one of the reasons why you have some Democrats like Senator Jon Tester who says, markets like Powell, Powell has done a good job, he deserves a second term.

And that just means how much it's going to cost and how much they're going to raise, and that they want 72 hours to read it all. All that tells you, Neil, is that don't plan for a vote this week, OK? They could work out a lot of things. When you listen to Manchin and take a step back, Manchin's basically always been on a 2022 time frame. That doesn't mean he couldn't be for something in December. But he seems at least talking about next year for all this, because he wants to, to your point, see what the effects are on all this spending that has happened on inflation. Just real quickly, on the other side, and that is the White House says that this is going to increase supply, help supply chains, and, therefore, it would have downward pressure on inflation. And they say it's going to be fully paid for, so, therefore, it won't tip the ledger in terms of any additional money out there in the overall monetary supply -- Neil."

And that's actually good for the markets. So a low approval rating is actually good, because the markets like gridlock. And that may not be the market that we like. That's the market that we have. And I think what we have seen here is, American business has been so resilient in the face of increased regulation, increased costs, supply chain issues, labor issues, everything -- COVID -- everything that's been thrown at it. People get up in the morning, they go to work. And these small business owners have proven that America is the place to be. And we want to keep it that way.

And the biggest concern is, we have these massive supply chain issues. And everybody knows your Christmas gift is on a container ship off of Long Beach, and it may never get here. And that's really the frustration is, people want to work. Demand has never been the issue. And Washington keeps stoking demand. It's the supply chain issues. And that's where Washington has been tone-deaf. They have yet to really address the supply chain issues, the labor challenges, all these business concerns. Families are struggling. They're having to make a choice this winter between food and fuel, that there's nothing in this legislation. You're spending trillions of dollars, and you're going to make the situation worse. So I think that's where people -- independents today are voting with their wallets. And that's what you're seeing in key gubernatorial races. That is a preview of midterm elections, where economic issues for middle-class families are going to take center stage. And rising costs every day are hurting working families. It's a regressive tax.

And I think there's a lot of optimism in the economy, despite the frustrations and the concerns with what's going on in Washington. And I think most people, they have had enough. They want less Washington, more Main Street economy. They want less stimulus that's going to create more supply chain issues, and they want less inflation.

I also agree that, candidly, we should have voted for the bipartisan infrastructure deal back in September, when it first came up. I think that would have helped the president. I think it would have helped Terry McAuliffe in Virginia. I think it would have actually shown the economy in terms of relief on whether it be roads and bridges long-term or broadband or resiliency. But we are where we are. And the final details -- as I told you, this has taken more time than then I even predicted a while back. But when you're talking about tax policy changes, taking time to get it right is the right thing to do. I think one of my biggest critiques of the 2017 Trump tax cuts were that some of them were rushed through, and people didn't get the full implications. As a finance guy, there is some devil in the details on the tax policy."

      "utterance": "But you did raise, I know, recently, and you said it again, Senator, that this lack of action and watching them could have blowback for Terry McAuliffe. If he were to lose today -- and I know you're convinced he will still pull out a victory -- could it be traced to this lack of action?"

      "utterance": "Neil, I will let you draw any kind of conclusions. I will tell you this much about -- I will tell you this. I feel better today than I did yesterday afternoon, and, basically, because the early vote ended up coming in about 1.2 million votes. Again, we don't have much to compare it to. Last year, obviously, we'd had a high, but we had COVID. But the vote in Northern Virginia, in Charlottesville, and in some of the cities from Richmond through Hampton Roads is coming in really strong. So, I feel much better, but it's going to be -- it's going to be a close race. I mean, Glenn Youngkin, first-time candidate, did a strong job."

      "utterance": "What I think -- what I wished the Democrats would have done -- and I say that as a Democrat -- that we should have taken the win we had in the spring in terms of coming out of COVID, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which got 69 votes, first time in 50 years we addressed infrastructure -- I remember it became almost a joke line under President Trump. Every other week was infrastructure week, and nothing happened. We produced a broad bipartisan bill. And then I agree with the vast majority of the president's agenda in the Build Back Better agenda. And I think we could have sequenced that infrastructure vote in September. But I think we get this done, the sausage-making, people will forget very quickly. And what they will remember is, the country stepped up on climate change, the country stepped up on child care, so that women could get back to work, we did it in a way that was paid for, in a way that makes our tax code fairer. And, as you heard today, something I think even the vast majority of FOX viewers support, is, we got to bring down our prescription drug costs. It makes no sense that Americans pay five and 10 times more for the same drugs that are sold cheaper in Canada and in the U.K."

      "utterance": "All right, let me ask you then about where we go from here. A lot of presidents and/or parties also change after midterm. Bill Clinton famously did that in working with Newt Gingrich after his party was shaken and lost so many seats in the '94 Republican landslide. This is not a midterm election. But if his key candidates go down to defeat, do you think it should be treated that way? Do you think that Democrats should moderate? Some of the progressives, with their dominant role in the party, should tone it down?"

But, listen, I have been on your show many, many times. I come at this a little more business-minded than some of my colleagues. I think the numbers need to always add up. And, candidly, having a bit more time, we are going to have that regardless of what happens in the House this week, just because of the craziness of the reconciliation process, to get some of these details right, I think that's a step..."

And, frankly, I think both sides come with relatively unclean hands on these -- on these tools."
