Michigan Congressman John Conyers admits to settling harassment complaint against him in 2015, but denies the allegations were true.

I would say the stronger argument for a lot of people in Alabama is that he's very pro-choice. And so, if you care about reproductive rights, you would probably want to go ahead and vote for Doug Jones.

But he's still raising money independent of the RNC, and the prediction markets are actually predicting that Roy Moore does win. And the lesson if you listen to what the president said if you deny the allegations, you get the benefit of the doubt in politics. That's a strange barometer, I think going forward. It's very different in politics versus the private sector. The private sector, the mere accusation, goodbye. In politics, you either get sent to an ethics committee, you know, maybe you pull an endorsement, but the guy will still be alive. Right now, it comes down to pure, raw power politics.

Meanwhile, the longest-serving member of the house is now under scrutiny. Michigan Congressman John Conyers admits to settling harassment complaint against him in 2015, but denies the allegations were true. Al Franken keeping a low profile after a second woman comes forward with groping allegations.

But I can tell you, if you don't need somebody who is soft on crime, like Jones. Roy Moore denies it. That's all I can say. He denies it. Women are very special. I think it's a very special time because a lot of things are coming out, and I think that's good for our society, and I think it's very, very good for women.

What did you think of the president's messaging on this, that he did finally make a statement, but he didn't go so far as to say he was going to campaign for Roy Moore. He denies the allegations. We'll get back everybody next week as to whether or not he'll be campaigning for him."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "He has already crossed the threshold. I mean, at this point you're basically saying I'm good. No problem. But for me, hard pass. I also think it's a heck of an argument to be leading -- you're right on the cost of having tax reform done. Before the election, before Roy Moore is voted on. You've actually have the chance to get tax reform done without him regardless, and you actually have really good messaging, and you have members of congress all talking on the same wavelength. Everybody is working hard in your favor. We're in the middle of this society-altering hurricane. And he didn't need to step into the middle of it today, but he did. And now, there's really no going back. I hope he will give people a pass because every single Republican is going to be asked, do you agree with President Trump on Roy Moore? And they're going to have to make their own decisions. And if they say no, I hope he would understand that that it's going to be the way it is. It's not personal, but this is a decision that they made. The RNC has already walked away from him. There is no money. So now all of a sudden the president is saying like, yeah, maybe I'll go and campaign for him. I think that this is something that he actually didn't need to do, but now having done it, there will be consequences for it. It doesn't mean Roy Moore won't win. It's likely that he could win in Alabama. The thing is, also on Doug Jones, his opponent, I don't accept that he's weak on crime. I would say the stronger argument for a lot of people in Alabama is that he's very pro-choice. And so, if you care about reproductive rights, you would probably want to go ahead and vote for Doug Jones. But if you are a pro-life person, when there is many of them in Alabama, then Roy Moore would be your choice because if you're a single issue voter, I think it's that. I don't think it's necessarily crime given Doug Jones' background."

But I do expect that President Trump will go and campaign for him and we'll just have to see where it leads."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Pretty stunning developments. This guy went from extremely toxic two weeks ago, Moore, to now slightly less toxic to the point where the president of the United States -- kind of keeping a mid-arm length a little bit. Not fully endorsing him, but not-not endorsing him at all. Very surprising. It looks like it's a free-for-all now, because like Dana said the RNC here. But he's still raising money independent of the RNC, and the prediction markets are actually predicting that Roy Moore does win. And the lesson if you listen to what the president said if you deny the allegations, you get the benefit of the doubt in politics. That's a strange barometer, I think going forward. It's very different in politics versus the private sector. The private sector, the mere accusation, goodbye. In politics, you either get sent to an ethics committee, you know, maybe you pull an endorsement, but the guy will still be alive. Right now, it comes down to pure, raw power politics. Do we want to keep the senate majority, the Republicans are thinking? Or do we want to take the moral high ground and, you know, maybe save face and fight for another day. That's the calculation all of these Republicans have to make by themselves."

At some level, you've got to stop and say wait a minute. I'm a human being. A 14-year-old -- or young women, or he said, yeah, generally. Remember he went on Sean Hannity -- generally, I didn't mess around with younger -- what is going on? When people can't see something so obvious sitting in front of them. It's alarming to me. But let me just, you know, pick up in general. I think the president then -- this is the way I felt when he tweeted about Al Franken on a political level, why is he doing that because it opens the door to charges about him and questions about his past behavior. Greg said, oh, you've just have to go back and listen to Franken on Howard Stern. Go back and listen to Donald Trump on Howard Stern. And you've got."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yeah. But I'm saying so is Trump's stuff sitting there and nobody -- you know, for the moment people like let it go. Now the big Republican argument has been, well, the American people elected him -- actually hasn't been litigated. Nobody has sat down and gone through -- but now you are because I think there's like a dozen-plus women who charges against the president. One final point, this is really about Republican infighting. Steve Bannon has stayed by Judge Moore's side. Kay Ivey, the governor, the Alabama Republican Party stayed by his side. I find this bizarre, but it's true. The national Republican Party understands. This will be a program that will be hung around their necks for all time, and they understand how it's going to be damaging to them and their brand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Dana, I want to get to -- we don't have time to run the sound bite, but let's talk about the kind of reaction, what you thought of the women of SNL, they came out to support Al Franken in light of these groping allegations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, I have mixed feelings about that. If they weren't coerced into signing their names onto something, or intimidated into signing their names on something, or let's say that you didn't sign it and then you were intimidated that way, I'm not for that at all. I don't think that's right. I'm also concerned like this idea that if you deny it, then you're going to be fine. Conyers did the same. And they're like, wait, what about -- there is actually a settlement. It's like, oh, that settlement, right. OK. Oh, right, that's what you're talking about. So if you're a woman who feels like you've been wronged and something bad happened to you, why would you come forward? Because if you know the man is going to deny it and they're going to be fine, and your reputation is the one that's going to suffer. Like, I don't like any of this, but I also go back to -- this is truly a society-altering event. We joked this morning and we're talking about like getting -- I kind of joked, but putting together the show for this afternoon. Mid-morning like what are we going to lead with? And I said, well, wait until this afternoon and there'll be something bigger. Sure enough, there's another person from Disney who is stepping down amid allegations. So I don't know if we need a new definition of what actual harassment is. I think it's interesting that so many companies are waiting until the news story they know is coming before they actually do something. But I hope that for the women that have decided to come forward with true allegations that they feel that they can get some restitution. And I don't mean reparations, necessarily, but something that will quiet their minds so they can move on with their lives in a healthier way, and not have to have this hanging over them. Like a lot of these people, if they are victimized, they carry it through their lives. And you see it over and over again with people who've been victimized that end up having problems later on because they didn't deal with it then. Hopefully, there's enough companies out there, including that congress that need to change its laws so that you don't have to wait 180 days, so you can actually have a secret mediation, and maybe not get any restitution for another 30 days, then another 30 days if you could do it -- by that time, you might as well quit and move on, or you get fired, which is what happened to the young woman that worked for Charlie Rose."

So it doesn't benefit the victim or the accused. Categories are important because as piggish as Al Franken is, he's not Weinstein. And as stupid and creepy as Glen Thrushes, he's no James Toback. And we have to somehow slow it down, separate the accusations, maybe allow for a defense, you know, maybe, why not? And then addressed the capacity for change if somebody says that's the way they were and they're not that way anymore. You know, we talk about a forgiving society, certainly the media isn't. The media will eat their own for a story."

When I see it, you know, juxtaposed like the court of law. You actually get a trial, you know, by a jury by your peers.

      "utterance": "Days after taking office, President Trump signed an executive order to cut funding from sanctuary jurisdictions in America, places that provide safe havens for illegal immigrants. Well, a federal judge has just permanently blocked that order. U.S. district court judge, William Orrick of California, ruled the White House does not have the authority to impose new conditions on spending already approved by Congress. The administration fired back saying the court exceeded its authority and the Justice Department will vindicate the president's lawful authority to direct the executive branch on this matter. So here we go again on sanctuary cities, Kimberly. I guess the Justice Department saying that they will appeal this ruling and see if they can get to a better resolution. It's highly predictive in these cases, especially on sanctuary cities or immigration that is based on party line vote. And since this is in California, it's not a surprise to you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "No, it's not a surprise. I know Judge Orrick. He's a very bright man. But, nevertheless, he's a very solidly, decidedly, proactively in the liberal lane, OK. So he's a big Democratic supporter, huge fund raiser and supporter for President Barack Obama, so it's no surprise here, and also with the ninth circuit. You know, this is the way they rule. They're not going to be in anything in favor of what President Trump is doing, especially as it relates to sanctuary cities or illegal immigration. He raised 200,000 in contributions for the Obama campaign. He did it in 2004, too. He raised money for John Kerry. He's very involved with those groups and with acts and fundraising. So I think in this case, we're just going to have to wait for it to go up on appeal, to be honest. This is sort of pro forma on what you expect at this point."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. So if congress wants to path a different law, they can. And let's just deal with the substance here because if we start looking at the federal judiciary as basically controlled by partisan politics, gee, you have a lot to say about Neil Gorsuch, even John Roberts, certainly, you know, Scalia and the likes. I just don't look at it that way. I think these people have some integrity. And the idea is that this had been an injunction, again, blocked by injunction, this time now confirmed by the ruling by Judge Orrick. I mean, the larger point here is that President Trump now goes to the Justice Department as if he is the king and says, oh, yeah, this is what I want. Doesn't matter what the congress wants, doesn't matter what the courts say. Doesn't matter that we have checks and balances and the courts are exercising some restraint here. I want this. This is what we're going to do."

That's fine. I'm just going to pre-butt Juan because I know he's going to run garbage about sanctuary cities. They did a study in a liberal institution out in California.

I don't know. But sanctuary cities exist on the backs of the border patrol. So the border patrol risks their lives to keep the villain out. If they worked there, sanctuary cities would be a hell pit. No border patrol, no sanctuaries cities, it's like you don't have a lock on your front door, then all the other doors must be locked.

Now the magazine just makes you dumber. Once a noted publication, it's now a thinly-pressed carcass of mind vomit. Their latest, an article by Melissa Matthews called, \"How murderer Charles Manson and Donald Trump used language to gain followers.\" Hold on. Isn't that what Newsweek does, use language to gain followers? Isn't that what Melissa Matthews does? Isn't that what The New York Times does? Isn't that what we all do? Does that make Newsweek like Manson? Imagine how this story came about. A group of young editors -- close to my age, early 30s -- they're sitting around, they're hoping for any idea to take a naked Charlie Rose off their minds. It's like a hairless cat on his hind legs, smoking a pipe. Now they know they're one paycheck away from opening a cat-sitting business in Brooklyn. Finally, a cretin says, \"Let's compare Manson to Trump.\" Relieved, they break for lunch: vegan wraps and green tea all around. Good for them, I say. If you want people to click on your free webzine, which is what Newsweek is, saying Trump is Manson beats all comers. Although in the article, even they admit that Trump isn't really Manson. They didn't buy it either, and they don't expect you to buy it, too. That's why it's free. So Newsweek is now, like, the saddest sideshow attraction. The sign reads \"See the Caterpillar Man,\" and it's just a junkie in a sleeping bag. Fact is, even they know they're peddling tripe. But an editor has got to eat. They don't have the words, but they do have Manson."
