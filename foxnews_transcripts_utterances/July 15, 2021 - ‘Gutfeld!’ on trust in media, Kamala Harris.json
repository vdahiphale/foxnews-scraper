A poll on American distrust in the media. It's like injecting adorable puppies into my waiting veins. And lo and behold, we got one. It's true. A new Gallup poll shows that more than 75 percent of the public has very little confidence in legacy media, like newspapers and T.V. news. So first, it's kind of interesting that people still use newspapers to get their news. I guess it's a good way to start the day before they spend the next 12 hours churning their own butter. But only 11 -- 21 percent of respondents said they had a great deal of confidence in newspapers, which of course they get from reading Cathy. It was worse for T.V. news at 16 percent which was only slightly less hated than Congress at 12 percent. But that's like being told you're only slightly more popular than chlamydia. This after a Reuters survey show the U.S. media ranked last among 46 countries when it comes to public trust. We even ranked behind Canada, and they don't even have electricity. So, do you think in industry witnessing a collapse in their trust might try to figure out why? But not the media, because their profit model is always pointing fingers. So, it's impossible for them to implicate themselves. So, if the public is sick of their lies, well, then that's the public's fault. So, they just assumed they can smear Americans and push policies meant to punish them, it will still be here for them later. Now they're creating a narrative that a domestic 9/11 is just around the corner.",

It's factually unreliable because you know the truth about your own weight. That, friends, is the red pill that exposes the media's fakery. You don't know how wrong the media is until you're the subject of the article. It's like being a guy wrongly sentenced for a crime he didn't commit. Only he knows the truth. Once it's about you, then you can see the disconnect between reality and reporting. You become the world's greatest expert on bias because you're the world's greatest expert on the topic. You.

It's never to help you. Their entire purpose is to slam their subject because in their world that's success. You don't win awards for doing a piece on Trump supporters that says wow, these people are decent Americans or even most Trump supporters are decent Americans. You find one that isn't and then you smear the rest. Anger and fear sells. Whenever I'm interviewed about my job, I can easily sense the narrative some reporters have. It's not about success. It's always about rumors. I keep getting the same questions. Is it true? You got caught trying to put a camera in Jesse Watters dressing room? Is it true Dana Perino lets you try on her dresses after the show? Yes, and yes, but why not -- why not stick to our amazing ratings? One piece actually claimed that I don't talk to people in the elevator, which is odd since I don't even take the elevator. I'm carried by shirtless Chippendale dancers up every single flight of stairs. The cost of the dancers is why my staff doesn't get dental, but they're OK with it. But it's like they'd already written the article and we're looking for quotes to fill in later. Talk to anyone who's been the subject of media scrutiny. They'll say the same thing. The contrast between what's true and what's written is huge. The differences is as vast is what Lisa Booth tells her parents what she did last weekend and what she really did last week. So that's today's lesson in how to view the media. If you'd like to hear more on this topic, I'll be doing this for the rest of my life or until the world ends in eight years.",

I mean, you look at lies about the coronavirus giving China time to cover up and, you know, get rid of any kind of incriminating evidence.

In the heartland region, that's in the middle, Kat, independent voters who want neighbor, want neighboring states to shove off, I don't even know if that made sense. But before you start designing a new flag for Wash-Alas- Go-Fornia, consider this from the poll creators they say this: \"We caution that this survey item reflects initial reactions by respondents about an issue that they are very unlikely to have considered carefully.\" Then why did you ask the question? \"Secession is a genuinely radical proposition, and expressions of support in a survey may map only loosely to a willingness is, to act toward the end.\" Way to cover your asses pollsters.

A poll on American distrust in the media. It's like injecting adorable puppies into my waiting veins. And lo and behold, we got one. It's true. A new Gallup poll shows that more than 75 percent of the public has very little confidence in legacy media, like newspapers and T.V. news. So first, it's kind of interesting that people still use newspapers to get their news. I guess it's a good way to start the day before they spend the next 12 hours churning their own butter. But only 11 -- 21 percent of respondents said they had a great deal of confidence in newspapers, which of course they get from reading Cathy. It was worse for T.V. news at 16 percent which was only slightly less hated than Congress at 12 percent. But that's like being told you're only slightly more popular than chlamydia. This after a Reuters survey show the U.S. media ranked last among 46 countries when it comes to public trust. We even ranked behind Canada, and they don't even have electricity. So, do you think in industry witnessing a collapse in their trust might try to figure out why? But not the media, because their profit model is always pointing fingers. So, it's impossible for them to implicate themselves. So, if the public is sick of their lies, well, then that's the public's fault. So, they just assumed they can smear Americans and push policies meant to punish them, it will still be here for them later. Now they're creating a narrative that a domestic 9/11 is just around the corner."

It's factually unreliable because you know the truth about your own weight. That, friends, is the red pill that exposes the media's fakery. You don't know how wrong the media is until you're the subject of the article. It's like being a guy wrongly sentenced for a crime he didn't commit. Only he knows the truth. Once it's about you, then you can see the disconnect between reality and reporting. You become the world's greatest expert on bias because you're the world's greatest expert on the topic. You. Meanwhile, everyone else accepts the site's data because they aren't you.

It's never to help you. Their entire purpose is to slam their subject because in their world that's success. You don't win awards for doing a piece on Trump supporters that says wow, these people are decent Americans or even most Trump supporters are decent Americans. You find one that isn't and then you smear the rest. Anger and fear sells. Whenever I'm interviewed about my job, I can easily sense the narrative some reporters have. It's not about success. It's always about rumors. I keep getting the same questions. Is it true? You got caught trying to put a camera in Jesse Watters dressing room? Is it true Dana Perino lets you try on her dresses after the show? Yes, and yes, but why not -- why not stick to our amazing ratings? One piece actually claimed that I don't talk to people in the elevator, which is odd since I don't even take the elevator. I'm carried by shirtless Chippendale dancers up every single flight of stairs. The cost of the dancers is why my staff doesn't get dental, but they're OK with it. But it's like they'd already written the article and we're looking for quotes to fill in later. Talk to anyone who's been the subject of media scrutiny. They'll say the same thing. The contrast between what's true and what's written is huge. The differences is as vast is what Lisa Booth tells her parents what she did last weekend and what she really did last week. So that's today's lesson in how to view the media. If you'd like to hear more on this topic, I'll be doing this for the rest of my life or until the world ends in eight years."

And, you know, we kind of joke and gloss over these things, but with the media has done significant harm to the country.

The whole premise of it, that we're going to take advice from these people who have these, you know, horrific abuses to their own populations and how to invite them into America to tell us how terrible we are, as a country, you know, shows what a whole joke it is. And it's -- people like Colin Kaepernick who were saying they were pressed and they're making millions of dollars, not author of their athletic ability or being good at anything but simply just being anti cop and wearing socks that depict police officers as pigs. So, I mean, it's all just complete B.S. And of course, these people aren't oppressed because they're making millions of dollars and, you know, live their part -- one percent of the population.

A new survey finds that one in three parents say they feel physically ill at the very thought of having to help their kids with math and science homework. Even more half of the parents with kids ages five to 13 think their kids know more about science than they do. I wonder which half, probably the mom, says that sexist. And 30 some odd percent said the same thing about math even worse, 48 percent of parents don't even know what stem stands for. So many numbers in this segment. I'm feeling sick myself. But this is why I don't help kids with their homework. It's like a wise man once said children should be seen and not heard. Unless they get sucked into a wood chipper. Then they definitely should make some noise or it could get messy. Charles, your thoughts, you have, you have kids."
