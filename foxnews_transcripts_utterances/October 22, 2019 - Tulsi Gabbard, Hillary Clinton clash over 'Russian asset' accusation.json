We've seen national polls that show a majority leaning towards impeachment. But take a look at this. In Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Arizona, 53 percent say that they do not want to see the president impeached. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then, another indicator out there is the big money that's pouring into the Trump campaign which has now raised $165 million that's the campaign alone, not RNC. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, that's why we're comparing it as apples and apples with what Biden has raised -- Warren has raised. $60 million for Biden, $52 million for Warren, and $38 million for Pete Buttigieg. Be kind of those numbers right (INAUDIBLE) on the screen, probably better than I do at this moment. All right, so, tonight, Congressman John Ratcliffe, who was one of the questioners in today's round of the impeachment hearings, joins us. Also, hear, General Petraeus, he will talk about whether the president may be shifting his thinking on the huge question of what to do in Syria. Also joining me, George Papadopoulos, he was at the center of the origins of the Russia probe. He says that the Durham investigation may have James Clapper and John Brennan, laying a bit low on that topic right now.

Certainly, a big achievement to defeat the Islamic state that was an army and to take away their Caliphate, but now our partners who did that hard fighting on the ground and who lost nearly 11,000 lives in doing that as we advised and assisted and enabled, but as they did the fighting on the front lines, they are having to look to their own safety and security as we have withdrawn We have essentially abandoned our allies in Syria and many of them are becoming refugees together with their families.

And we also need to re-establish again confidence in us as partners and allies. This has not been a deliberate well-planned and phased operation as you well know. It has become a bit of a chaotic endeavor. Certainly, the Turks now coordinating with the Russians. They're the new powerbroker there. And you saw the meeting today between President Putin and the President of Turkey Erdogan in Sochi, and they will work out what's going to happen on the border.

But we're still getting in those comments. So, we'll bring you more as we get it. And back to our top story tonight coming out of Washington is the impeachment probe out of step with sentiment in some of the swing states, with just 12 months to go before the election. We've seen national polls that show a majority leaning towards impeachment. But take a look at this. In Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Arizona, 53 percent say that they do not want to see the president impeached. Then, another indicator out there is the big money that's pouring into the Trump campaign which has now raised $165 million that's the campaign alone, not RNC. So, that's why we're comparing it as apples and apples with what Biden has raised -- Warren has raised. $60 million for Biden, $52 million for Warren, and $38 million for Pete Buttigieg. Be kind of those numbers right (INAUDIBLE) on the screen, probably better than I do at this moment. All right, so, tonight, Congressman John Ratcliffe, who was one of the questioners in today's round of the impeachment hearings, joins us. Also, hear, General Petraeus, he will talk about whether the president may be shifting his thinking on the huge question of what to do in Syria. Also joining me, George Papadopoulos, he was at the center of the origins of the Russia probe. He says that the Durham investigation may have James Clapper and John Brennan, laying a bit low on that topic right now. We're going to see what he has to say about that. But first, tonight reports that the closed-door testimony of our top diplomat in Ukraine elicited quote, sighs, and gasps from some of the people who were in that hearing room. Democrats say that the testimony represented the most damning that they have heard."

And on that most important issue, neither this witness or any other witness has provided any evidence that there was a quid pro quo, any evidence that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld on July 25th.

This is us finding out when we walk in the door what the rules of the day are going to be for that particular witness. And it's really unfair for all of us that are trying to represent our constituents in this process.

And again, Ambassador Taylor, today, I found him to be very forthright here, very strong opinions about Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy. But again, the mainstream media reporting that he provided evidence of a -- of a quid pro quo involving military aid is false. I question him directly on that and under Adam Schiff's rules, I can't tell you what he said, but I can tell you what he didn't say. And neither he nor any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can't have a quid pro quo with no quo."

There is no quid pro quo until someone from the Ukraine says we knew that military aid was being withheld during that July 25th call. And that testimony hasn't come and is not coming. This is just another in the latest of frame job of the president. They tried to frame him for being a Russian agent and failed, they try to frame him for obstructing justice using a legal standard that had never been applied to anyone else and failed.

One of them is the spokesperson for John Brennan, who says, \"What Barr and Trump were reportedly up to not only doesn't make any sense whatsoever, but it is yet another dangerous abuse of power, something that seems to now happen on a daily basis in this administration.\" That from the spokesperson for John Brennan."

So I was very pleased to see that John Durham and William Barr's investigation was expanding in both scope and capabilities as soon as his trip to Italy and the U.K. was finished. What I think is going to happen is I think that the foreign governments that were involved that were actually probably prodded or weaponized to do the dirty work of the Obama administration are now going to be the Achilles heel of the previous administration because they have new government in place. They're not loyal to the Obama administration anymore. And people like Clapper and Brennan who are more likely than not prodding these governments to do their dirty work are now going to be telling Barr and Durham exactly what happened.

We now also have evidence that this infamous Professor Joseph Mifsud was also targeting Michael Flynn three months before he was targeting me. So the notion that these were all despaired events and all of these characters involved in this story were random nobodies that the Intel agencies had no idea about I think is absurd."

So I think they are incredibly linked, these high-level officials. Alexander Downer at the time, for the viewers who might not be familiar with him, was the equivalent of the ambassador of Australia to the U.K. and he had previously run the equivalent of the CIA in Australia for 17 years.

So General Keane is not commenting on that NBC report tonight, but breaking this evening, he is offering a stark warning to the president in a Fox News op-ed with Lindsey Graham. The two writing, Northeastern Syrian oil fields where we presently have troops can be a beneficial asset for us and our allies. Instead, they're about to fall into Iranian hands. And the proceeds funneled straight to Tehran could be used to fund further operations against the United States and Israel. Their number-one concern right now though isn't the oil, its terrorists. They say, while President Trump is correct and saying the ISIS Caliphate has been destroyed, there remained thousands of ISIS fighters still in Syria. They warned without a strong U.S. military presence in the region, it's only a matter of time until they regenerate and seek to again establish a caliphate. Now, while President Trump reportedly did consult with Keane and Graham about the situation on the ground, his own envoy to Syria, Jim Jeffrey, told lawmakers just moments ago the President didn't talk to him before pulling troops out of Syria. Earlier today is the last of the 100 U.S. military vehicles retreating from Syria across the border into Iraq. They were told they're not welcome. The Pentagon had planned to station that convoy in Iraq and then have them monitor ISIS from there. The Secretary of Defense asked if U.S. troops will only be deployed to countries who foot the bill for them being there like Saudi Arabia's now doing. He said, no."

      "speaker": "PETRAEUS",
      "utterance": "Well, I share the reservations, the concerns of Senator Graham and my very good friend General Jack Keane. This -- it's very important that we regroup as quickly as we can to keep the pressure on the Islamic state which already had some 20,000 to 30,000 forces in the greater Iraq and Syria area that had not yet been accounted for. Certainly, a big achievement to defeat the Islamic state that was an army and to take away their Caliphate, but now our partners who did that hard fighting on the ground and who lost nearly 11,000 lives in doing that as we advised and assisted and enabled, but as they did the fighting on the front lines, they are having to look to their own safety and security as we have withdrawn We have essentially abandoned our allies in Syria and many of them are becoming refugees together with their families. So again, we've got to salvage what we can. We need to resume the focus on the Islamic state. I do think that maintaining security of the oil fields together again with our Syrian Kurd partners would be a very wise move. It's a very important bargaining chip for them and it keeps that from falling into the hands either of Iran or perhaps once again of the Islamic state who used to hold those when they had the caliphate established in Iraq and Syria. And we also need to re-establish again confidence in us as partners and allies. This has not been a deliberate well-planned and phased operation as you well know. It has become a bit of a chaotic endeavor. Certainly, the Turks now coordinating with the Russians. They're the new powerbroker there. And you saw the meeting today between President Putin and the President of Turkey Erdogan in Sochi, and they will work out what's going to happen on the border. Turkey moving probably 20 miles or so inside Syria all along a very long border in an area into which they now want to move refugees who are on Turkish soil but who are not from that area. So there is also a fair amount of ethnic displacement that is going to take place."

    {
      "speaker": "PETRAEUS",
      "utterance": "Well, it sounds as if there's -- it sounds as if there's at least a consideration of maintaining some forces. And to be fair, there is all -- there is a force that will stay in place at all time. That's much further down. It's not contiguous to the northeastern area but it's a very important border crossing between Iraq and Syria. And it prevents Iran from achieving something it has been seeking for a long time which is a ground line of communication that would connect Iran through Iraq, through Syria, and down into southern Lebanon to Hezbollah, the enemy of our ally Israel."

He had made a bunch of conditions if you wanted to get a nickel of U.S. aid. Joe Biden had a quid pro quo with Ukraine. Even if you accept that the prosecutor deserved to be fired, he said we're -- I'm going to hold up this quid, a billion dollars in loan guarantees if you don't deliver the quo, firing the prosecutor. That's a quid pro quo. Might have been OK, but that's a quid pro quo. So, it just depends on what the quo is. In the case of Trump, you know, two things.

So that's obviously sort of, you know, a capitalist credo, right?

Maybe she could pick the people to make this all work. Without Glass-Steagall coming back, she may be too late, it would be too late to win an election.

Small businesses can't get loans these days, individuals have a hard time getting loans -- just to get a mortgage, you have to have all kinds of paperwork you didn't before.

She will put at risk a quarter of the annual GDP or may be almost 50 percent of the productive part because 43 percent of the GDP is based on government spending.

Since then, his parents have fought tirelessly to push for change even taking their fight to Capitol Hill today along with other parents and anti- hazing advocates to demand that Congress back the End All Hazing Act. Timothy Piazza's father, Jim joins me now, along with Jim -- Jud Horras, CEO of the North American Interfraternity Conference. Welcome, gentlemen. Good to have both of you with us.

The End All Hazing Act is a game changer because it will give parents transparency into the organizations that their sons and daughters who are joining it will give the students the opportunity to learn about the organizations that they are joining. This is already a law in five states but that's a reaction to where deaths have occurred. We don't -- we don't have the time or the capability to go to all 50 states and get this law passed.

I think that every parent should be aware and talk to their sons and daughters about what type of way they are raised, how you treat people whether it's bullying or hazing, and also, they should be aware that if they see something, they should report it immediately.
