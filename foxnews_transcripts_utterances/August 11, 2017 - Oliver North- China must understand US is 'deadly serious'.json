We should not allow ourselves to be held hostages by this erratic regime and the threat of nuclear terrorism against our country."

      "utterance": "Yes, no, look, I think the legacy of policies over the past 25 years has been appeasement. And it's not the first time it's been called appeasement. Former secretary of state Jim Baker, right after the Clinton administration signed the Agreed Framework, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times that called the Clinton administration policy appeasement. That was 20 years ago. It hasn't worked. So unless you want to have a future where North Korea can threaten the United States with nuclear-tipped missiles, you have to look either at one more diplomatic play to convince China to reunite the peninsula with us in a constructive way and eliminate North Korea, or you have to look at the military option. People are worried about the difficulty, the chaos that might create today. The risk is real. What about the chaos when North Korea launches missiles at the United States?"

I wish we had started it 10 years ago. But better late than never because otherwise, the American people have a choice -- live with a nuclear North Korea and the threats and nuclear bribery that will entail forever, or do what the politicians said.

We hear today that there are back channels. And yet you've got the president saying, hey, we're locked and loaded and we're ready to defend this country and our territories. OLIVER NORTH, HOST, \"WAR STORIES\": Well, look, I agree completely with what John just said in terms of convincing President Xi in the People's Republic of China that it's in their interests to act now because unless Xi intervenes to stop Kim Jong-un, the United States is going to have to take preemptive military action against the regime in Pyongyang. And that's going to have catastrophic consequences not just for North Korea but for the People's Republic of China. Consider this, Judge.

We face the same problem ultimately from Tehran. Now, we could, for example, just to make sure everybody understands we're serious. Deploy the U.S. naval ship Mercy, the hospital ship from San Diego, to Pousan (ph), Korea, sends a big signal. It's very visible. Deploy more U.S. Marine and Navy assets out to the region, deploy more intelligence satellites and reconnaissance and update our target lists. And that's going to leak here in this town. You know that. You could deliver biological and chemical protection equipment to the Republic of Korea. And finally, you could urge President -- excuse me -- Japanese prime minister Abe to go to Beijing and tell the PRC President Xi, You'll go down in history as the man who talked us back from the brink.

You have been involved in the communications, and I'm sure you've been watching the verbal back and forth, the volleys that have been going back and forth. Kim Jong-un has given us almost a deadline. He said specifically the middle of August. In the last month, he's launched two ICBMs. We know that he's got the miniaturized nuclear warheads. We know that he is boasting that he's going to, you know, turn us into jelly. Now, people are critical of the president.

So they're getting all the pieces here, and I think we've got to see the signs and take it very seriously. I agree with my old boss, John Bolton, that the play here is not with North Korea, it's really with China. And one interesting thing, Judge, is that the Chinese removed oil sanctions from this last round of U.N. sanctions. By them removing the oil sanctions, that means that they think that we still have time, which goes to Colonel North' point that they're not taking us seriously. And what they need to understand is that this is not President Obama just with a threat of military action, but this is President Trump with a credible threat of military action. For diplomats, we need that credible threat behind us so that when we're sitting across the table and we are negotiating, the other side knows we need to come to a peaceful deal because if not, we have to transfer the file back to the Pentagon and General Mattis, Secretary Mattis -- they don't negotiate."

TONY TATA (RET.), \"BESIEGED\" AUTHOR: Well, you know, I think what you're seeing, Judge, is the application of all of the elements of national power working in synchronization and harmony, something the Obama administration was particularly incompetent at. And I agree with everything Ric says. You know, we've got a real perception gap to overcome here because President Obama so anesthetized the entire nation and the world by submitting to our enemies and actually giving billions of dollars to Iran and other countries. And now when President Trump, who says what he means, it's like a stark difference out there. And so people are waking up, but it takes them a little bit of time to say, does an American president really mean what he says? And I believe that President Trump is using the information aspect of national power in a very effective way. He's saying something that's very clear.

I don't know if he believed that President Trump and the American people are going to hear it or not, but we have now heard it.

Senators like that I believe need to be defeated. But the overarching question is, is this the Republican establishment? And who is more established that Mitch McConnell?

They are not there to represent the interest of the American people, and the American people have figured that out. I'm not sure what they claim that reason is for voting against the skinny repeal. And look, we know it wasn't as big and grand as many of us would have liked, but at least it would've been a big step in the right direction following but the House of Representatives had done.

      "utterance": "You're absolutely right. And the media is particularly incensed because the president is going over their head. How dare he? Journalists in America are overwhelmingly liberal. Studies prove it. The most recent one showed a scant seven percent of Republicans, so there's no diversity of thought in the newsroom. It's endemic in the industry, and journalists tend to wear their liberalism on their sleeve. They're utterly intolerant of anybody who dares to disagree with them, especially the president of the United States. How could he have won, they think. We are smarter than anybody else, we didn't want him as president, so he must have cheated in some grand conspiracy with Vladimir Putin to throw the election. And they are hell-bent on conjuring criminality where none may exist."

      "utterance": "The whole idea of Russia and the collusion after eight months, it may even be nine months at this point, we haven't heard one iota, one piece of evidence that indicates collusion. And yet the mainstream media, now we know that because Jay Sekulow and American Center for Law and Justice in getting some of the emails from the Department of Justice has found out that The New York Times and The Washington Post said they really didn't want to discuss that tarmac meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton. I mean, we know that they know about it and they are colluding, there is the collusion, to not tell the American people."

      "speaker": "KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESPERSON",
      "utterance": "That's right. And it's journalistic malpractice at its best. You look at Jim Comey, that startling testimony before the Senate Intel Committee when he said that February New York Times story alleging collusion between -- or contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, he said that story was not true. He went on further to say many, many of the Russia stories are in the dead wrong. This is Jim Comey. He has no incentive to help the president who fired him, and he is saying so much of the reporting is false. It is empirically verifiable the press is left leaning and this Russian collusion conspiracy theory is based on little more than rumors and newspapers. And those are the words of Senator Dianne Feinstein."

They think to themselves, look, if they are lying, if they are publishing stories that they know are not true, that some of that, in spite of New York Times Sullivan, that they should be liable for this kind of thing. Should they be?"

    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Is there malice and malicious intent had proven over and over in terms of what they want to cover, what they lie about? We all knew as Kayleigh said the February story in The Times was not true, and yet no one would deny it until Comey was under oath, and then he had to deny it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "The president calls it fake news, and he is right to the extent that the media by virtue of their liberalism distorts the news. Then, yes, to some extent that is fake news. They are not acting as impartial reporters of the truth in the news as it is. Instead they're doing something quite different. They are infusing their bias in the stories they choose to tell and the way that they tell them. And I will give you an example. The most egregious form of it was Donald Trump Junior meeting. The media went apoplectic that he met with a Russian. It's a crime, cried the media."

There's more than 1,000 of them here in the United States, they meet with people. It's not a crime to talk to a Russian. And the Federal Election Commission, just go to their website, and it specifically says former nationals may volunteer for American political campaigns. It's not a crime."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "The American people are having to look to other sources, like for instance this Trump news update that he is doing on his Facebook. It is positive information about the president, all factual, all true, but you have to go to Facebook, you have to go to the president's own website to hear anything positive. In today's day and age, it is only news if it is negative."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But he is on Twitter. He is on Facebook. He is on Instagram. The whole family is on Instagram, and all of those social media sites. And so what you've got are how many millions of people who are getting their news from that because they are now convinced the mainstream media is not out for their interests?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "And the media is upset about it because he has co-opted their job. He's speaking directly to the American people. He is not allowing the media to exercise their nearly unlimited power of mass communications in the way they have in the past to try to indoctrinate Americans into the media's form of liberalism and progressive --"

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "That's right. And that's one thing we've learned about the American people is they are smart, they can see through the negative coverage leading up to the election. I had a man in Nevada tell me, say that the coverage is so bad, I didn't vote for President Trump but it did compel me to give him a chance. Polling reflects that. People see through it. They recognize his bias, and they will not be fooled, which is why media has the lowest approval ratings in Gallup recorded history."

And coming up next on this special edition of \"Hannity,\" President Trump has made his support for law enforcement very clear. Sheriff David Clarke joins me to weigh in on that and the new dramatic body cam footage of an officer being shot earlier this year. Stay with us. You are going to want to see this one."

As you know, I am a big, big believer and admirer of the people in law enforcement, OK, from day one. You are saving American lives every day and we have your back, believe me. We have your backs 100 percent, not like the old days. Not like the old days."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Indeed not like the old days. That was President Trump repeatedly praising law enforcement and, unlike the Obama administration, President Trump has made it crystal clear he fully supports those who serve and protect us, and for good reason. A newly released body cam video shows a police officer in South Carolina being shot three times last January after confronting an armed suspect. We must warn you the video you are about to see is extremely shocking."

Joining us now with reaction, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke. All right, good evening, Sheriff. The truth is that had there not been a camera on the glasses of the police officer, this individual who shot him three times and almost killed him to the point where the police officers has tell my family I love them, he thought he was going to die, it would never have been captured. Can you tell me why more law enforcement doesn't have these body cameras or cameras on the glasses as opposed to the body?"

      "speaker": "DAVID CLARKE, MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF",
      "utterance": "Some of those are financial considerations that each jurisdiction has to make in terms of priority. I think it is a high one but that bean counters have to make that. But I get chills every time I hear President Trump support and praise the American police officers. Officer Quincy Smith here, that was gut wrenching video. Only by the grace of God did he survive that. But I want to talk a little bit about this idea coming out of this 21st century task force that Obama put together, and it was second by PERF, the Police Executive Research Forum and Chuck Wexler, and the IACP is supporting it. And they call for stupid things like engaging in more dialogue with these suspects before using deadly force, considering less than lethal options. You saw how much time -- once that gun came up --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But the police officers said I'm going to tase you. The police officer said, he didn't threaten to shoot him and he said I will tase you. Take your hand out of your pocket."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLARKE",
      "utterance": "Right, and the thing fell apart very quickly. He told him to stop about six or seven times, told him to take his hand. You've got to see a suspect's hands, you have to see the hands, that's job one. But I'll tell you what, if he would have used his firearm, and I'm not here to second guess what he did. Every individual officer gets to make his own decision, but had he shot this guy the second time he told him to take his hands out of his pocket, it would have been reasonable under the circumstances even if he was not armed. And I get tired of hearing about this unarmed assailant that the police officers use deadly force against because unarmed does not mean not dangerous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And what is interesting about this is because of the camera on the eyeglasses, we find out that, number one, the police officer was only going to tase him, and, number two, you know what, a lot of cops have good instincts. When he says take your hand out of your pocket, take your hand out of your pocket, take your hand out of your pocket his instincts and, you know, I've been in this business a long time, too, has have you, his instincts are there's something dangerous in that pocket."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLARKE",
      "utterance": "You have to trust your instincts. I tell police officers all the time, trust your training, trust your instincts when you go into these things. It may be where you make a mistake at the end, but in the end they want you to go home and we will sort it out later. Again, the training kicks in later as well. But you can see from the minute, I timed it, from the minute he pulled the gun out, the suspect, one second elapsed before he got off three or four shots and the officer couldn't go to the next level up to his firearm because by that time the shots had rung out and it was over. But he did a great job."
