The regime media knows exactly what's happening in Canada and it scares the heck out of them. Now, it's not because they think the truckers or the truckers' supporters are terrorists. They know they're not. But they're scared, because if usually mild mannered Canadians have figured things out that most of what their governments did to fight COVID was insanely destructive. Then how can liberals here possibly think for one second that they're going to keep this COVID theater going on in the United States for much longer? So back to CNN. Rather than seriously reporting on these unprecedented grassroots protests, the CNN and the backbenchers denigrate or dismiss them. I'm telling you tonight, this is a huge mistake. People and viewers follow strength and courage. Not small men like Jeff Zucker, or the dewy face, Justin Trudeau, who, as far as we can tell, is still hiding in an undisclosed location tonight. For two weeks now, Canada has seen what happens to do a supposedly free people when they're pushed to the brink. Out of touch provincial governments drunk on their own power thought that they could keep Canadians subdued with these COVID rules forever. But they were wrong. The situation in Canada is a preview of what would have happened here if we didn't have a strong populist movement that listens to America's working class voters. In Canada, workers have a lot less hope than we have here. So they're turning to more radical actions. For years, Canada's mainline leaders like our establishment here, frankly, did everything they could to help China at the expense of their own people. Then came woke ideology and condemnations of Canadian history and patriotism. Unlike here, where populace in the GOP were able to take over their party and offer an alternative governing approach, the Canadian Conservative Party was led by a limp-wristed moderate, who tried to pull his party to left. It's crazy. But let's review what happened in Canada just over the past few years. In June of 2020, BLM radicals took over Parliament Hill in Ottawa. Naturally, pretty boy Trudeau was there to take a knee. Then in Montreal in August of 2020, leftists tore down and decapitated a statue of Canada's first prime minister. In July 2021, the liberal mob cheered as they tore down statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II. So what has this all taught average Canadians? That their government is more concerned about heaping more and more restrictions and rules on the working class and sucking up to the wokesters than standing up to the radical left. And by hammering working class Canadians while enabling and praising the leftists, those in charge were inviting a blow up and, boy, have they gotten one. At least the Conservative Party at this point in Canada is looking for new leadership though. The Canadian Liberal Party is stuck with its positively boosted cutie pie, who doesn't like other boys playing in his sandbox.",

But it looks like Justin strategy really did fail than calm things down at all. Look at the crowds. Now, I see these protests happening every other week for almost 18 months across Europe, in France, and Italy, and elsewhere, people are out there demanding their basic freedoms. And when I see it, I have to say, thank God for our red state governors. They started our own freedom convoys back in May of 2020 by pushing to open their states, or never closing them in the first place. Now, it never made sense that kids in Florida had normal school experience for almost the entire pandemic. While New Yorker kids were masked and separated from each other. And I also think, thank God, we have a Republican Party that has almost entirely rejected its old guard. We're not the party of Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney, who wouldn't know how to fight for the average blue-collar worker in America if their lives depended on it. Conservatives in Canada did everything that Romney and Cheney wanted. They had a moderate leader named Erin O'Toole, who ran under progressive platform in 2021. As the Washington Post noted, \"He ran as an explicit centrist, a man at pains to emphasize how he revised Conservative Party. Pro LGBT, pro-choice, pro-carbon tax, pro-immigrant, spend-happy, against budget cuts and so on. He was not your dad's Conservative Party.\" Well, it failed spectacularly. As a result, the liberals were still able to cling to power in the 2021 election there. So many working class of Canadians saw how this all worked out. And they essentially - for at least now, they gave up on a political solution. And now Canada's problems are bigger than ever. But here, thankfully, things are different. And tens of millions of us see real reason for hope. It's a fact that the movement Trump began has already taken power in many states. School boards, now they're looking over their shoulders now, aren't they? People are demanding more law enforcement, given the crime rates and Hispanics are moving to the GOP and record numbers. We have an incredible new Hispanic voice later on in the show. You got to stick around for that. And even some blue states are starting to drop their mandates. So will we need our own trucker rally to end all of this insanity once and for all? I thought not, until Biden spoke through Psaki today.",

Now, it's gotten so bad that even the New York Times has been forced to report on how unwieldy this committee has become. They noted over the weekend that the committee is borrowing techniques from federal prosecutions, employing aggressive tactics typically used against mobsters and terrorists. Some of the Democrats on the committee were concerned that if the panel was too aggressive, Republicans might turn the tables. But Miss Cheney insisted they be as aggressive as possible. Joining me now is Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, House Judiciary Committee ranking member; and Indiana Congressman Jim banks, Republican Study Committee Chair. Congressman Jordan, let's start with you.

And they have - the New York Times piece was amazing, because it said, 14 former prosecutors are part of this committee. Now, if your whole focus is a legislative purpose as it's supposed to be under our Constitution, do you really need 14 former prosecutors to figure out what you might do or might not do with the Electoral Count Act or whatever?

The RNC over the weekend made it official by censoring them and saying they no longer represent the values of the Republican Party, because they've turned this sham investigation. They're treating it like a criminal investigation, even though they're not going after any criminals. They've issued 80 subpoenas, and very few of them have actually gone toward anyone who was involved in, or participated in any way in violence or crime on January 6. Instead, they're going after people who were lawfully participating in a permitted rally, exercising their First Amendment rights on January 6.

It now contradicts modern laws that are specifically designed to preserve Hawaii's natural coastlines.\" Now, look at these things. The wall looks like a prison camp there. Now, when it comes to climate change and environmental activism, Obama's obviously full of hot air. But then again, he's no different from most other wealthy and connected Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi.",

And retaking the schoolboard, as Chris just discussed, from the left, taking it from them is the only way, the first step, really, to saving our education system.

Case and point, Douglas County school district was forced to cancel all classes last week after teachers held a sick out in protest of the policies pushed by the new conservative majority school board. My next guest chairs the political action committee that helped flip Douglas County school board in Colorado from liberal to conservative. And joining me now is Ryan Girdusky, chairman of the 1776 Project PAC. Ryan, what policies did the school board push that have the teachers up in arms? RYAN GIRDUSKY, THE 1776 PROJECT PAC CHAIRMAN: In January, the school where the new conservative majority school board asked for the superintendent, Corey Wise, to review the equity program by September to offer suggestions to make it better. Many parents had complained about privilege walks, about questions about race and equity and power structures within the homework and lesson plans, and just to review to show possible improvements. On the asking of even recommendations to improve it, 1,500 teachers within the third largest school district in Colorado called out sick in one day. And rather than trying to temper the situation, rather than trying to bring on the anger by the teachers and just clarify, this isn't a white nationalist thing, this isn't to attack LGBT students, as many on the left were sitting there and saying. This is just to review the program that many parents complain about. Corey Wise, the superintendent, did nothing. And so he was fired on February 4th, and now the new school board, conservative school board is looking for a superintendent that better reflects the value of the school district.",

The regime media knows exactly what's happening in Canada and it scares the heck out of them. Now, it's not because they think the truckers or the truckers' supporters are terrorists. They know they're not. But they're scared, because if usually mild mannered Canadians have figured things out that most of what their governments did to fight COVID was insanely destructive. Then how can liberals here possibly think for one second that they're going to keep this COVID theater going on in the United States for much longer? So back to CNN. Rather than seriously reporting on these unprecedented grassroots protests, the CNN and the backbenchers denigrate or dismiss them. I'm telling you tonight, this is a huge mistake. People and viewers follow strength and courage. Not small men like Jeff Zucker, or the dewy face, Justin Trudeau, who, as far as we can tell, is still hiding in an undisclosed location tonight. For two weeks now, Canada has seen what happens to do a supposedly free people when they're pushed to the brink. Out of touch provincial governments drunk on their own power thought that they could keep Canadians subdued with these COVID rules forever. But they were wrong. The situation in Canada is a preview of what would have happened here if we didn't have a strong populist movement that listens to America's working class voters. In Canada, workers have a lot less hope than we have here. So they're turning to more radical actions. For years, Canada's mainline leaders like our establishment here, frankly, did everything they could to help China at the expense of their own people. Then came woke ideology and condemnations of Canadian history and patriotism. Unlike here, where populace in the GOP were able to take over their party and offer an alternative governing approach, the Canadian Conservative Party was led by a limp-wristed moderate, who tried to pull his party to left. It's crazy. But let's review what happened in Canada just over the past few years. In June of 2020, BLM radicals took over Parliament Hill in Ottawa. Naturally, pretty boy Trudeau was there to take a knee. Then in Montreal in August of 2020, leftists tore down and decapitated a statue of Canada's first prime minister. In July 2021, the liberal mob cheered as they tore down statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II. So what has this all taught average Canadians? That their government is more concerned about heaping more and more restrictions and rules on the working class and sucking up to the wokesters than standing up to the radical left. And by hammering working class Canadians while enabling and praising the leftists, those in charge were inviting a blow up and, boy, have they gotten one. At least the Conservative Party at this point in Canada is looking for new leadership though. The Canadian Liberal Party is stuck with its positively boosted cutie pie, who doesn't like other boys playing in his sandbox."

But it looks like Justin strategy really did fail than calm things down at all. Look at the crowds. Now, I see these protests happening every other week for almost 18 months across Europe, in France, and Italy, and elsewhere, people are out there demanding their basic freedoms. And when I see it, I have to say, thank God for our red state governors. They started our own freedom convoys back in May of 2020 by pushing to open their states, or never closing them in the first place. Now, it never made sense that kids in Florida had normal school experience for almost the entire pandemic. While New Yorker kids were masked and separated from each other. And I also think, thank God, we have a Republican Party that has almost entirely rejected its old guard. We're not the party of Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney, who wouldn't know how to fight for the average blue-collar worker in America if their lives depended on it. Conservatives in Canada did everything that Romney and Cheney wanted. They had a moderate leader named Erin O'Toole, who ran under progressive platform in 2021. As the Washington Post noted, \"He ran as an explicit centrist, a man at pains to emphasize how he revised Conservative Party. Pro LGBT, pro-choice, pro-carbon tax, pro-immigrant, spend-happy, against budget cuts and so on. He was not your dad's Conservative Party.\" Well, it failed spectacularly. As a result, the liberals were still able to cling to power in the 2021 election there. So many working class of Canadians saw how this all worked out. And they essentially - for at least now, they gave up on a political solution. And now Canada's problems are bigger than ever. But here, thankfully, things are different. And tens of millions of us see real reason for hope. It's a fact that the movement Trump began has already taken power in many states. School boards, now they're looking over their shoulders now, aren't they? People are demanding more law enforcement, given the crime rates and Hispanics are moving to the GOP and record numbers. We have an incredible new Hispanic voice later on in the show. You got to stick around for that. And even some blue states are starting to drop their mandates. So will we need our own trucker rally to end all of this insanity once and for all? I thought not, until Biden spoke through Psaki today."

Now, it's gotten so bad that even the New York Times has been forced to report on how unwieldy this committee has become. They noted over the weekend that the committee is borrowing techniques from federal prosecutions, employing aggressive tactics typically used against mobsters and terrorists. Some of the Democrats on the committee were concerned that if the panel was too aggressive, Republicans might turn the tables. But Miss Cheney insisted they be as aggressive as possible. Joining me now is Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, House Judiciary Committee ranking member; and Indiana Congressman Jim banks, Republican Study Committee Chair. Congressman Jordan, let's start with you.

And they have - the New York Times piece was amazing, because it said, 14 former prosecutors are part of this committee. Now, if your whole focus is a legislative purpose as it's supposed to be under our Constitution, do you really need 14 former prosecutors to figure out what you might do or might not do with the Electoral Count Act or whatever?

The RNC over the weekend made it official by censoring them and saying they no longer represent the values of the Republican Party, because they've turned this sham investigation. They're treating it like a criminal investigation, even though they're not going after any criminals. They've issued 80 subpoenas, and very few of them have actually gone toward anyone who was involved in, or participated in any way in violence or crime on January 6. Instead, they're going after people who were lawfully participating in a permitted rally, exercising their First Amendment rights on January 6. But these two want to go after them and go after anybody that has any ties to Donald Trump, or represents anything that had to do with the agenda of the Trump presidency.

She illustrated the same type of liberal hypocrisy perfectly on Friday, posing with all those poor little kids all masked up, while she was beaming maskless in the foreground. She cares so much about those kids. What a humanitarian she is. Well, they say a picture's worth a thousand words, but this image brings to mine just one. Fraud. Coming up later in the show, why are Hispanic women flocking to the GOP? One new congressional candidate from the Rio Grande Valley will tell us how the media has gotten it all wrong. You won't want to miss her. But next, a wealthy DC suburb forcing primary and secondary school students to participate in an anti-racism audit. What is it? Journalist Chris Rufo is here.

Specifically, the auditors want to know if the curriculum empowers students, and helps them understand and resist what they call systems of oppression.

And this is what happens when you take the ideology of critical race theory and you attach it to administrative power. What they're doing is, they're plumbing the students for dissent. They're trying to reorganize them from the inside out. It's really a form of, kind of, brainwashing technique where you go in, you do an anti-racism audit. Guess what, they always find racism. It pays these diversity consultants. And then it puts the children under the thumb of these ideologues. And make no mistake about it. This isn't about education. It's about turning (ph) Czech children into activists."

But now it's equal outcomes?"

      "utterance": "Yes, that's right. And really, this is a way of shifting blame. They are scapegoating these abstract kind of demonized ideas like systemic racism, really to absolve themselves the people in the school districts of their own faults. We've expanded funding for schools by somewhere between 20 and 300 percent over the previous decades. But scores all over the country have remained completely flat. It seems like no matter how much money you pour into these bureaucracies, they can't improve student outcomes. And doing these kind of complex pseudo scientific audits is really just a way for them to say, Hey, wait, it's not our fault. Keep giving us money. Shut up if you don't like the results."

It takes a partnership between the school house, central office, and the community to combat.\" Chris, what are they getting at?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUFO",
      "utterance": "This is really the theme that we've seen over the past year. It's that the permanent bureaucratic forces in American society are now turning the apparatus of the state against the American people, against parents. And this is exactly why you're seeing parents revolting. In more than 1000 school districts across the country public institutions are designed to serve the public not to subjugate the public. And this kind of reckless, political and ideological activism should be resisted by the people of Montgomery County, and resisted by people all over this country."

Occasionally, some stuff slips out like this, but they don't want this to be publicly acknowledged, or the public to be made aware of."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUFO",
      "utterance": "That's right. Critical race theory can only survive in the shadows. And so for the last few months, I've run out advocacy campaign for full curriculum transparency, and 19 state legislatures have now introduced bills that would require all public schools to post all teaching materials online so parents could easily see what's happening in the classroom, and that is where we need to go."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Chris, that is so great. And it's such a simple idea, and you thought of it. OK, I wish I did. You thought of it. That's awesome. Let's keep it going. Chris, thank you. And retaking the schoolboard, as Chris just discussed, from the left, taking it from them is the only way, the first step, really, to saving our education system. Now, the second step is facing the teachers' unions and all the control. Case and point, Douglas County school district was forced to cancel all classes last week after teachers held a sick out in protest of the policies pushed by the new conservative majority school board. My next guest chairs the political action committee that helped flip Douglas County school board in Colorado from liberal to conservative. And joining me now is Ryan Girdusky, chairman of the 1776 Project PAC. Ryan, what policies did the school board push that have the teachers up in arms? RYAN GIRDUSKY, THE 1776 PROJECT PAC CHAIRMAN: In January, the school where the new conservative majority school board asked for the superintendent, Corey Wise, to review the equity program by September to offer suggestions to make it better. Many parents had complained about privilege walks, about questions about race and equity and power structures within the homework and lesson plans, and just to review to show possible improvements. On the asking of even recommendations to improve it, 1,500 teachers within the third largest school district in Colorado called out sick in one day. And rather than trying to temper the situation, rather than trying to bring on the anger by the teachers and just clarify, this isn't a white nationalist thing, this isn't to attack LGBT students, as many on the left were sitting there and saying. This is just to review the program that many parents complain about. Corey Wise, the superintendent, did nothing. And so he was fired on February 4th, and now the new school board, conservative school board is looking for a superintendent that better reflects the value of the school district."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Good, great. It's going to take time, Ryan, right. This is not going to be fixed overnight. And sunlight really is the best disinfectant. But as Chris said, none of these teachers who are on the left -- there are some conservative teachers out there, or just middle of the road folks, but a lot of them don't want this information to become public because the public doesn't want this. They do not want this garbage to be taught in the schools."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIRDUSKY",
      "utterance": "And the teachers' union said this is a process to take back power from the conservatives. This is all about politics. It's never about the students. And now many people are demanding they recall the superintendent. So that is why my PAC, the 1776 Project PAC is working to protect these school board members who are fighting these superintendents and these leftwing activists in the teachers' union, and trying to win more schoolboards back for conservative parents."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Ryan, one of the conservatives who got elected, I guess that you helped get elected to Douglas County school board was Kaylee Winegar, I hope I get the name, pronunciation right. She spoke with FOX News Digital about the latest moves from the teachers' union there. Watch"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Ryan, the left always invokes the children whenever they are pushing some horrible policy. So the teachers, they're walking out on the kids. They don't care about the kids. They care about their power."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIRDUSKY",
      "utterance": "Right. And these are children who lost almost a year of school because of the COVID shutdowns. The last thing they need to do is miss more school. But the priority of the teachers' union is never the students, it's always the teachers and their power and their grip on public education. And it is so important that conservatives realize public education and curriculum is key. We can't give up and we can't cede this fight. So I'm so proud of all these school board members who are taking on this very, very tough role and receiving protests. The teachers' unions are absolutely the bully. But you know what, as many people are supportive of teachers' unions, they are more supportive of parents and the children that need this education."
