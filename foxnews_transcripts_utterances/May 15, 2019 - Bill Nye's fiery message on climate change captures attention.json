They're about to head into the historical association dinner of the White House. Watch there for any news-making statements that the president may make because there's a lot of news today that we could hear from him on. And meanwhile, the man who hopes to make history by becoming the 46th president, Joe Biden keeps climbing in these polls, folks. But he knows that it is a long road ahead. Anything can happen that could flip this whole race on its head. And if history is any guide, if probably will. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” Look at this snapshot exactly four years ago. Donald Trump was in eighth place. Only 21 percent of Republicans said there was no way they would ever vote for him. He had Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker. All polling ahead of the outsider Donald Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As the country at that time was reeling from a church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and same-sex marriage became law of the land. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What about this? Let's go back to '07, around this same time in the whole process. Clinton was 11 points ahead of Obama. And her fellow New Yorker, Rudy Giuliani on the other side, they appeared to be the unbeatable ones in that race. That year, the President Bush authorized the surge in Iraq. It was very much about Iraq that election. And Nancy Pelosi became the first female Speaker of the House. But looking today, at Biden on top of this very crowded Democrat field, billionaire businessman Mark Cuban says he sees what Donald Trump saw when he looked at a stage of seasoned Republicans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "That's a nice moment. Thanks, Bret. Coming up, right now, the president and first lady at the White House on an absolutely beautiful evening. They're about to head into the historical association dinner of the White House. Watch there for any news-making statements that the president may make because there's a lot of news today that we could hear from him on. And meanwhile, the man who hopes to make history by becoming the 46th president, Joe Biden keeps climbing in these polls, folks. But he knows that it is a long road ahead. Anything can happen that could flip this whole race on its head. And if history is any guide, if probably will. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” Look at this snapshot exactly four years ago. Donald Trump was in eighth place. Only 21 percent of Republicans said there was no way they would ever vote for him. He had Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker. All polling ahead of the outsider Donald Trump. As the country at that time was reeling from a church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and same-sex marriage became law of the land. What about this? Let's go back to '07, around this same time in the whole process. Clinton was 11 points ahead of Obama. And her fellow New Yorker, Rudy Giuliani on the other side, they appeared to be the unbeatable ones in that race. That year, the President Bush authorized the surge in Iraq. It was very much about Iraq that election. And Nancy Pelosi became the first female Speaker of the House. But looking today, at Biden on top of this very crowded Democrat field, billionaire businessman Mark Cuban says he sees what Donald Trump saw when he looked at a stage of seasoned Republicans."

We're going to talk to all three who are all Fox News contributors. Byron, I want to start with you.

When Biden announced on April 25th, he had a six percentage point lead over Bernie Sanders and the RealClearPolitics average of polls. That is now 23 points. So, he is doing something right. So, I think if you listen to him, what he is selling is a restoration. He knows that Democrats just cannot stand Donald Trump. And he doesn't want to go back to some far ago era. He just wants to go back to before '17, the 2017, and the world before Donald Trump."

He blew away everybody with a record number for the first 24 hours of fundraising. But I think Byron, put his finger on it. Our view of the Democratic Party over the last year or so has been that is dominated by these new Democratic socialists. AOC and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. But maybe Joe Biden is a reminder that there are a lot of traditional Democrats out there who don't share the enthusiasm to the hard left for all of these big ambitious prescriptions to turn the country upside down and utterly transform it.

He has great grassroots, right now, and I think he has to work on his national message. And I think it's something he's doing. But I certainly think Joe Biden has gained an incredible amount of traction because he is viewed as the most electable today because what he did in the midterms, he was our number one surrogate. He could go both in the coasts as well as rural and industrial America. It's and you know, and we got a bunch of new polls in today. And I want to go back to this one which shows most responsible for the current economy. Trump and Republicans 44 percent, Byron. Obama and Democrats, 15 percent. That's a number that is not going to be attractive to Democrats who have been trying to convince people that all of this has nothing to do with President Trump, and it all started under Obama."

But, you know, in next year's campaign, he'll have been president for more than three years. And so, I think that he will get the credit for that. Now, on this Beto O'Rourke thing, I agree that you shouldn't just write these candidates off. Because think back to 2012, the Republican race, that was the one that Mitt Romney eventually won. But there was a big field and the lead just seemed to alternate. You know, Rick Perry was leading, and then Rick Santorum was leading. And then Herman Cain was leading, and the Newt Gingrich was leading. This thing could bobble around between people. That -- that's easily a possible model for what could happen. MACCALLUM: Yes.

But it sounds good. And this goes back to the thing that we're talking about. Everybody is trying to differentiate themselves. You have the traditional Democrat lane, in which you have Joe Biden is the dominant figure. Amy Klobuchar, as the -- as a not so dominant figure. You've got the hard left with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. You got the new kind of -- more traditional but nonetheless do a different kind of Democrat in Mayor Pete. And then, you've got everybody else trying to figure out where they are. Robert Francis O'Rourke had a great opportunity to launch himself onto the scene. He blew it very rarely in politics. Do you get a second time -- being a second first time to introduce yourself? I think it's going to be hard for him to re-enter the race in the kind of format that, that he wanted to be. He's underneath five percent. Warren, Harris, Sanders, Mayor Pete."

She says, \"Many Americans, myself included, disagreed when Roe v. Wade was handed down in 1973. The sponsors of this bill believe that it is time once again, for the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit this important matter, and they believe this act may bring about the best opportunity for this to occur.\" Now, this debate is going to get extremely heated.

I thank you, Martha, for having me and give me this opportunity. Yes, the bill is a very pure bill. It speaks with the personhood of the unborn child which makes it a direct confrontation of the ruling in Roe, the unborn child is not a person within the meaning of the U.S. Constitution. The issue has been hot for 46 years. The thing about the pro-life debate over abortion as it's never gone away and it's gotten more intense as time goes on. And we knew that someday there may come an opportunity to once again review Roe. 1992 was the Casey decision. That was the last time there was a chance for a meaningful review and we think now there's another chance."

We're not trying to make a conception argument or philosophical argument whether we agree with that or not. We want to be able to have a prosecuting attorney to prove that some woman was pregnant when an abortion was performed, that means personhood. And when you have rape or incest, it doesn't matter how you were conceived, whether about consent, by accident, rape incest, or artificial insemination, you're still a person. It would be disingenuous and very difficult for us to argue in court that you're a person on one hand but not the other. Now, we don't know what --"

I've been a part of a lot of these planning efforts in my time in the military. Sometimes tensions ramp down, sometimes we have to use other options to crank up pressure to de-escalate and deter.

Their maligned activities supporting proxy forces like Hamas, Hezbollah and others. They have been a maligned interest for a long time and we need to use all elements of national power to protect our interests. Economically, we are now cranking up sanctions. We pulled out of the Iran deal which I supported, and our military presence and deterrence options are available, as well as diplomatic action in order to keep us safe. So, as someone who has been to war, you know, that's something we certainly don't want. We want to be able to protect our interests.

I've also been a commander and that's a responsibility like many people can't understand. Responsible for the mission, responsible for the people, the good order and discipline, the unit cohesion, everything about honor and respect of how our teammates treat each other. And so, commanders need to be responsible for stopping military sexual assault. If you remove them from that decision-making process then you take your eye off the ball. So, my legislation which I just introduced actually provides more resources and more support to commanders. That once brave victims come forward that we have the best trained investigators with the best equipment for the forensics teamed up with the prosecutors so that they can do a timely and thorough investigation and also duo process for the accused. Because this is the way, our way of life, you know, we protect that and we wear the uniform for that. And so, let's make sure that we have the best opportunity to have justice in these cases that are very difficult to prosecute and that's what my legislation is about and I really look forward to getting it passed."
