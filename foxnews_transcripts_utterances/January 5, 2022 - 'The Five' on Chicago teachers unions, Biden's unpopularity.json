The Chicago teachers unions causing chaos and panic for over 350,000 students after pulling the plug on in-person learning late last night. Thousands of families left scrambling after the union switch back to remote learning because its demands weren't met. More than 90 percent of Chicago public school employees fully vaxxed but that isn't enough for teachers to do their jobs. Not being at school has all sorts of negative consequences, but don't take my word for it.",

I think it's absolutely awful. What I would do, to answer your specific question, is to dock them their pay for every day they are out. And I would continue the lockout, the virtual lockout that Lori Lightfoot has put in place, Jesse. She is not letting these absent teachers sign on to do their virtual education. So, they can say these renegade teachers cannot say that they presented themselves for virtual work, because they are not allowed to sign on, dock their pay.

We know because when we talked about it for a long time all of the danger, whether it's psychological, mental, whether it is just in terms of emotional. And then scholastic. All of the harm to children when they are not at school. Domestic violence, child neglect, all of that. We also know that 90 percent of the teachers are vaccinated. We also know, Jesse, as you said, $2 billion to protect the schools. Now, why are teachers saying it's not safe enough to go to school when they are in one of the most protected environments in the country? I doubt that anything is more protective other than a hospital. It's because the teachers are lazy. But ask yourself this, for all the teachers who were afraid to go to school, 90 percent of whom are vaccinated among the least affected of our population, children, do they go to Dunkin' Donuts? Do they go to the supermarket? Did they get into an elevator to go to their apartment? Do they get on a bus? Do they go to the barber shop? Are they separating themselves from society at large? Or are they just too lazy to go to work? And that's what this is. This is an illegal walkout. They should not be paid and it's time for these teachers, and they've collected money by the way, Jesse, for the last three years, it is time for them to knock that paycheck.

What I would do if I were Joe Biden is tomorrow after I gave my January 6 commentary at the statutory hall at 9 a.m., I would get on a plane with Dr. Jill Biden, with Miguel Cardona, the secretary of education, with Xavier Becerra. Remember him? The secretary of health and human services? I think he might be in witness protection for cabinet secretaries. He is nowhere to be found during this entire crisis. And I would go to Chicago, I would stand with Lori Lightfoot. I would have something that says, sort of concrete thing that says, we are going to have a stand here. Many Democrats across the country realize just how terrible this is and they are worried about it. You know, you had Nicole Hannah Jones of the 1619 Project, saying, she said, hey, we should be able to talk about how teachers should be in the classroom. And it goes on from there. This is across the board a terrible situation. You know, it's a good thing to think about the future of, perhaps school choice being more widely applicable after something like this. But right now, you have a crisis of parents having to try to homeschool children by Zoom while teachers, who should've been vaccinated, but probably will be willing to go to the bar. I mean, Jeanine, you are very kind asking if they did all those things that were normal, but what a lot of parents have seen is that some -- check these teachers Instagram accounts that's all I'm saying.",

The teachers unions pushed us over the cliff. It is going to happen February 1st. This is all going to be behind us. And it's time now to sever the ties with the least competitive entity on the planet since the Washington generals. Our education -- educational system is just like the Washington generals and that we pay them to lose. The only thing worse is that they are teaching our children to lose. They are going to lose in life because they are falling behind. We've learned one really important thing from remote learning. No one is remotely learning. This, children are locked in supervised jail time in the schools, all that's missing are three hats and a cot. The school is a prison run by clock watchers and we've now figured this out. This is an amazing opportunity. I think that we should dive on this. It's all about school choice, it's all about introducing competition into the one place on planet earth besides Cuba and North Korea where competition is seen as obscene. It's time. Blast.

For one freaking day they were pro-cop. And why is this happening? It is because your victimization, the average American's victimization is not the media's shared experience.

The poll numbers continue to go down. If he has signed the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which had pretty good support, I mean, even President Trump wanted to do it, I think he would've done it differently, a little less on the green side of things. But that is what Nancy Pelosi is saying. Because when you pull people and say, what do you think Biden has accomplished? Nobody has any idea that that infrastructure bill actually got signed. And that is purely the fault of President Biden and the chief of staff, I would say, in terms of the strategy around there. The other thing is that the CNBC poll that came out that said 72 percent of Americans do not -- disapprove of Biden on inflation. 72 percent, that's a huge number.

The Chicago teachers unions causing chaos and panic for over 350,000 students after pulling the plug on in-person learning late last night. Thousands of families left scrambling after the union switch back to remote learning because its demands weren't met. More than 90 percent of Chicago public school employees fully vaxxed but that isn't enough for teachers to do their jobs. Not being at school has all sorts of negative consequences, but don't take my word for it."

I'm generally pro-union, but this walkout, it was clumsy, it was spiteful, it was absolutely devastating for these children's well-being. Where are they going to eat, some of these families now. I think it's absolutely awful. What I would do, to answer your specific question, is to dock them their pay for every day they are out. And I would continue the lockout, the virtual lockout that Lori Lightfoot has put in place, Jesse. She is not letting these absent teachers sign on to do their virtual education. So, they can say these renegade teachers cannot say that they presented themselves for virtual work, because they are not allowed to sign on, dock their pay.

We know because when we talked about it for a long time all of the danger, whether it's psychological, mental, whether it is just in terms of emotional. And then scholastic. All of the harm to children when they are not at school. Domestic violence, child neglect, all of that. We also know that 90 percent of the teachers are vaccinated. We also know, Jesse, as you said, $2 billion to protect the schools. Now, why are teachers saying it's not safe enough to go to school when they are in one of the most protected environments in the country? I doubt that anything is more protective other than a hospital. It's because the teachers are lazy. But ask yourself this, for all the teachers who were afraid to go to school, 90 percent of whom are vaccinated among the least affected of our population, children, do they go to Dunkin' Donuts? Do they go to the supermarket? Did they get into an elevator to go to their apartment? Do they get on a bus? Do they go to the barber shop? Are they separating themselves from society at large? Or are they just too lazy to go to work? And that's what this is. This is an illegal walkout. They should not be paid and it's time for these teachers, and they've collected money by the way, Jesse, for the last three years, it is time for them to knock that paycheck. Call it a day and replace them."

What I would do if I were Joe Biden is tomorrow after I gave my January 6 commentary at the statutory hall at 9 a.m., I would get on a plane with Dr. Jill Biden, with Miguel Cardona, the secretary of education, with Xavier Becerra. Remember him? The secretary of health and human services? I think he might be in witness protection for cabinet secretaries. He is nowhere to be found during this entire crisis. And I would go to Chicago, I would stand with Lori Lightfoot. I would have something that says, sort of concrete thing that says, we are going to have a stand here. Many Democrats across the country realize just how terrible this is and they are worried about it. You know, you had Nicole Hannah Jones of the 1619 Project, saying, she said, hey, we should be able to talk about how teachers should be in the classroom. And it goes on from there. This is across the board a terrible situation. You know, it's a good thing to think about the future of, perhaps school choice being more widely applicable after something like this. But right now, you have a crisis of parents having to try to homeschool children by Zoom while teachers, who should've been vaccinated, but probably will be willing to go to the bar. I mean, Jeanine, you are very kind asking if they did all those things that were normal, but what a lot of parents have seen is that some -- check these teachers Instagram accounts that's all I'm saying."

The teachers unions pushed us over the cliff. It is going to happen February 1st. This is all going to be behind us. And it's time now to sever the ties with the least competitive entity on the planet since the Washington generals. Our education -- educational system is just like the Washington generals and that we pay them to lose. The only thing worse is that they are teaching our children to lose. They are going to lose in life because they are falling behind. We've learned one really important thing from remote learning. No one is remotely learning. This, children are locked in supervised jail time in the schools, all that's missing are three hats and a cot. The school is a prison run by clock watchers and we've now figured this out. This is an amazing opportunity. I think that we should dive on this. It's all about school choice, it's all about introducing competition into the one place on planet earth besides Cuba and North Korea where competition is seen as obscene. It's time. Blast. An MSNBC host flipped out on Twitter over a four-year-old not allowed in a restaurant because the four-year-old wasn't vaxxed. So why would an MSNBC anchor gets so pissed off about this?

Dana mentioned Hannah Jones, you had the walking head injury known as Joe Lockhart. You've got Lightfoot, who was about 10 years behind us in this matter, finally catching up to us. So once again you see that lag, but now the people that refuse to listen to us are saying, holy crap, it's now my kids. It's now my job. It's now my career. What the f are we going to do? Well, you should have listened to us because we've been saying this for two years you stupid morons. I have no sympathy for Lori Lightfoot. She should have been there at the beginning because she is the leader. But none of these people are leaders. It is time for the American public to become the leaders to say we've had enough of this crap. It's over. Our kids, if you are not teaching our kids, we are taking our kids out of the schools.

On top of that, the new D.A. will be reducing charges for serious crimes like armed robbery. For example, if a thief uses a gun to rob a store but no one gets hurt, it would just be a misdemeanor instead of a felony.

And follow me on this, if you want to take a bus and not pay for it, have at it. If you want to keep one of those bikes, those rental bikes, go ahead and keep it. Do you want to not pay for a taxi ride? That's no problem, just jump out. And to all the business and all the storekeepers in New York City, if a gang comes in with a gun, I don't care if it's an AK-47, an AR-15 or whatever. And there is no risk of genuine risk of serious physical injury or serious physical injury, which means a risk of death. Then they are going to get away with a misdemeanor, which is like stealing a DVD out of a store. This man is looking to create lawlessness and anarchy in New York City. Let me tell you one more thing, guys. Because I did this for 30 years. This is going to throw us back to the wild west. New York will lose its home values, its business values. Your kids are not safe going to school. You are not safe riding on the streets. There is no traffic crimes that will be prosecuted. You can drive 120 miles an hour down 6th Avenue and you can't be arrested. And if a cop is getting punched out for making an arrest that guy will not be prosecuted for resisting arrest.

We were told that there is no riots, right? There was no crime wave, there was no explosion in murder, it was mocked daily on CNN, but then January 6 happens and suddenly, CNN is pro-cop for one day. For one freaking day they were pro-cop. And why is this happening? It is because your victimization, the average American's victimization is not the media's shared experience. Like I said in the a-block, nor does it validate their political beliefs. The fact is the guy in a Viking hat validates their political assessments about the people they despise. Therefore, that is more important than thousands of murder victims strewn across this country.

And those catastrophic numbers spelling doom and gloom for Dems in the midterm. Nancy Pelosi is scared and knows a red wave is coming. She is reportedly telling donors that Democrats need to be more boastful about Biden's accomplishments. But more Dems keep heading for the exits. A 25th Democrat will not seek reelection. All right, I will start with you, Dana. I mean, how is it that the Democrats should be more boastful about Joe Biden's accomplishments? What has he accomplished?"

I think one of the things that happened for the Biden administration, he made a huge mistake. He had a bipartisan infrastructure deal that was right there for the signing, but instead of going for that in April, he decided to link it to the bigger, big huge build back better agenda, which got completely bogged down over the summer, and inflation started rising, and as you saw Afghanistan happened right around there. The poll numbers continue to go down. If he has signed the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which had pretty good support, I mean, even President Trump wanted to do it, I think he would've done it differently, a little less on the green side of things. But that is what Nancy Pelosi is saying. Because when you pull people and say, what do you think Biden has accomplished? Nobody has any idea that that infrastructure bill actually got signed. And that is purely the fault of President Biden and the chief of staff, I would say, in terms of the strategy around there. The other thing is that the CNBC poll that came out that said 72 percent of Americans do not -- disapprove of Biden on inflation. 72 percent, that's a huge number. That means he's losing a slew of Democrats as well."

Big business love that. Then he cracked out on traditional American energy to pay off the greens. And then he went big with the vax mandates which big pharma loved. What did that do? Totally scrambled the labor market, divided the country, and made everything more expensive. So, now we didn't get back to normal like he promised. We don't trust him because he had the mission accomplished moment this summer with the virus and the catastrophe in Afghanistan.

There's a cycle that you can't break regardless of who you are. It's historic. It repeats itself. Right now, the Democrats are on the tide is going out rapidly. They are going to have a very, very difficult time come November. Build Back Better, they're arguing whether to say it's transformational.

An 8-month-old dog, his name is North, crawled on top, kept him warm for 13 hours until rescuers came to the scene. The hiker was taken to a hospital. He underwent surgery.
