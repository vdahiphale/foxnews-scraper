It's like wiping the slate clean. It's all moot. And that's why it restores the entire situation back to that original place. Secondly, there's a whole host of concurrent investigations happening. And here, the defense was arguing, well, look, we're duplicating the efforts of the inspector general. Judge Toomin obviously said, no, you're not. So right now for viewers, we have the inspector general. We have now a special prosecutor. We have the FBI investigating the hoax. We have the city of Chicago lawsuit against Jussie for costs. And then don't forget the brothers who have sued his attorneys. Final point, she blamed her ethics -- yes, she blamed her ethics officer on it. And remember, she ran on that platform of I'm going to instill an ethics officer and bring ethics back to the city of Chicago. She failed.",

      "utterance": "Sure, let me break this down for you, Jesse. All right. It's kind of weird that Donald Trump has made it OK for Republicans to be anti-war. This is what we've noticed with this unusual phenomenon that is Trump is that he's not your typical Republican, OK? So by being antiwar, now the media has transformed into becoming these craven hawks. Like now they're going like why aren't you doing this? I mean, it's kind of weird when you see, because I like Bret and I like, you know, some of these people, but they're kind of like goading him. They're suggesting that there's some kind of weakness by not killing these people. And so what they're basically saying is you should go to war. We talked about this yesterday. We were trying to figure out what is the response that feels right to the downing of a drone? And I said yesterday it's stuff versus stuff. And that's progress because we're not throwing bodies at each other anymore. And the media seems like they miss that. They want to have the bodies. They want to have the pileup. And what we're seeing right now is -- I think it's progress towards a new way of dealing with a threat that's been around for 40 years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KENNEDY, HOST",
      "utterance": "I think this is great. And the fact that this president -- this is one of my favorite aspects about his personality, it's not only the anti-interventionism but it's been one of the bigger concerns with Iran is who has his ear? And I'm always troubled when its Mike Pompeo and John Bolton because I think they're impulsive and I think they're a little trigger happy, but then you also have people like his daughter Ivanka. And if you remember, he dropped missiles on a Syrian air base because of some of the images from Bashar Assad, and perhaps the Russians, gassing Syrians with chlorine gas. But the fact that we're seeing a president take a measured approach and actually not make excuses but talk about a body count and show some empathy, I think that, to Greg's point, making phenomenal progress. And it's always very disconcerting when you have people on the left, and I lump Hillary Clinton into this category who've never worn the uniform, they've never served, but they're some of the ones who are so quick to thrust us into these incursions."

      "speaker": "DOUG SCHOEN, HOST",
      "utterance": "The Iranians are vicious killers. They are threatening the state of Israel. They are the ones who destabilize Syria, kept Bashar Assad in power. The Republican Guard only understands one thing, power. And while I think in fairness the president's explanation makes sense, but what I think we lack is a strategy as to how we're going to deal with future incursions because there is a sense among nations in the Middle East that we don't have the power and the fervor that we need to confront radical Islam and terrorism. So while in the short-term I can agree with what you and Kennedy and Greg are saying, in the longer term I'm worried that we do not have a clear and cogent strategy."

      "utterance": "I'm thinking 100 percent, but I wasn't going to say it until then. Yeah, absolutely. Look, I think that the benefit of today's occurrences is that, one, it gave Iran an incredible scare that they are one step or we're one step away from something that they would pay dearly for. I will say that those in the military that I've spoked to today were deeply surprised, however, by this decision by the president. But I think it had that two-fold benefit of showing Iran that we were seriously. And secondly of dealing it in the media, we nipped it in the bud. We nipped it in the bud with a left leaning media, because if Trump had proceeded with either the cyber-attacks, that whole spectrum we discussed yesterday, if he had pursued the kind of financial choke holds to the treasury department can conduct in terms of the elicit financial mechanisms supporting the Republican Guard, or the support structures in those neighboring countries, then they'll still would be talking about throughout this entire decision -- well, he's bringing us to the brink of war and what happens if this. He's blustering in it. There always would have been that what if. I love that he went there already so that now he explains transparently why he backed away, and then we can proceed with those lesser measures."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "I was going to say, do you know what bothers me is you now have John Kerry and former Obama administration foreign policy officials that have been actively speaking and advising the same Iranian regime that is shooting our drones out of the sky, that's a huge problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "And also -- issue like Iran is a long-term issue, and it feels like the North Korea issue -- this is something that's going to take decades and whatnot. But the media doesn't like that. The media needs to have them -- doing a show in this fog, right? We don't know -- fact, we don't even know what really is going on, and there could be stuff that's happening between Iran and the United States right now that we have no clue. And it's all going to look really foolish tomorrow. But the fact is Trump has always been kind of willing to take the longer term approach. It's like we'll see what happens, which is basically a long term approach. We'll see what happens. I'm not that interested in bombing them right now. Maybe I might bomb them later."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KENNEDY",

And unfortunately, Joe Biden gave them an entree for this kind of criticism that really sticks to him, and this is the hardest aspect of his past to explain away. He hasn't done a very good job of that. So he has opened himself up to that and they're the ones who stepped in to try and score political points, which is what do you in an election."

A Cook County Illinois judge is appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the handling of the case by Chicago's top prosecutor Kim Foxx, as you remember her office dropped all charges against the actor. It was a big surprise. He was accused of staging a hate crime attack on himself. It's tough to do. The judge saying that Foxx did not have the right to assign her top deputy to lead the case after she colloquially recused herself. In a statement Foxx said that she disagrees with the judge's decision. So, Emily, this is really fascinating because I -- you know, you're a lawyer, you can explain this better. But I was wondering if there was some double jeopardy in here, but the special prosecutor said that no, they can reopen the case and Jussie Smollett can be charged once again with all 16 counts of fewer or even more."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "Yes, and anyone else that has been caught up in this can be charged as well. I want to point out for viewers a couple things. Number one, the judge, Judge Toomin came out swinging at Kim Foxx. He said essentially that her -- the phrase she used, the acting states attorney, (INAUDIBLE), basically was made up in her imagination and, therefore, this is the important part, the arrest, the subsequent prosecution and the dropping of all charges, therefore, is inexplicable. It's like wiping the slate clean. It's all moot. And that's why it restores the entire situation back to that original place. Secondly, there's a whole host of concurrent investigations happening. And here, the defense was arguing, well, look, we're duplicating the efforts of the inspector general. Judge Toomin obviously said, no, you're not. So right now for viewers, we have the inspector general. We have now a special prosecutor. We have the FBI investigating the hoax. We have the city of Chicago lawsuit against Jussie for costs. And then don't forget the brothers who have sued his attorneys. Final point, she blamed her ethics -- yes, she blamed her ethics officer on it. And remember, she ran on that platform of I'm going to instill an ethics officer and bring ethics back to the city of Chicago. She failed."

It's all bogus if you're a regular American who is working hard, you feel like if you're not someone who is politically connected or rich, you can't really work the system in your favor.

He's like that paint canister that bank tellers slip into the money bag to give to the bank robbers, and they're almost there and the whole thing just explodes and they're covered in paint. My solution for him, and I've said this before, is that he should come clean and meet with the people that he smeared. He smeared these imaginary MAGA supporters.

He also says that the Dominican Republic has nothing to hide, and that it was the D.R. who reached out to the FBI to help in this situation. The major concern for them at the moment at least one of them is the tourism, that's the lifeblood for this Caribbean island. But we did at one point, get a chance to ask his Minister of Tourism what he would say to the families of those 11 tourists who have died in the span of 12, the past 12 months from June of last year to June of this year. He says, while he is sympathetic to those families who have lost the loved ones, he continues to hammer down the fact that he does not believe there is any sort of mystery surrounding the deaths. And the big thing that we are all waiting for and it seems like this entire island and people watching this story waiting for the results of these toxicology tests of three of the Americans who have died, these are the tests that the FBI is involved and assisting with. We might not get those results until next month. Kennedy."
