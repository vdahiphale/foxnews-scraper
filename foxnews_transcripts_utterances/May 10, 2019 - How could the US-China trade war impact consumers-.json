It's not to say that there won't be any more trade talks, but there is nothing on the books right now. And in the last few minutes, President Trump weighing in on today's talks with the vice premier of China, Liu He, the president tweeting -- quote -- \"Over the course of the past two days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries. The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversations into the future will continue. In the meantime, the United States has imposed tariffs on China, which may or may not be removed, depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Late last week, China reversed itself on some core issues that it had already agreed to, and then started to play the delay game on another round of talks. So, the president lit a fire under them with the imposition of new tariffs, which had been postponed. That increases tariffs from 10 to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. President Trump also turning up the heat, threatening more tariffs, tweeting this morning that the process has begun to place additional tariffs at 25 percent on the remaining $325 billion. That would be the biggest round of tariffs yet. After last night's brief talks and dinner, the Chinese delegation saying they would prefer a different route of negotiations than the imposition of tariffs.

So, our way out should be to solve the practical problem in a better and principled manner, so that we can finally come to the only result of cooperation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The cargo ships coming in today and for the next three to four weeks were already in transit by the time those new tariffs took effect, so those ones will be taxed at the 10 percent rate, the old rate. Anything, though, that leaves China, left China after midnight last night will be subject to that 25 percent new tariff rate. That is a huge price difference, and it's causing a big conundrum for business owners and retailers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Part of the question is whether the retailers and suppliers will absorb some or all of the costs increase, hoping to keep consumers shopping, or if they will reprice their items to reflect those tariffs and risk losing some business. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Some big retailers made bulk orders, anticipating the tariffs, and may be able to fend off price hikes until that inventory is gone. But smaller shops may pass off that extra cost to consumers faster -- $200 billion dollars worth of goods are impacted, nearly 6,000 products, including things that American shoppers purchase regularly, like furniture, clothes, food and electronics. Some industries are being hit harder than others.

Now, the silver lining here is that the $200 billion worth of additional Chinese goods the president has targeted with these 25 percent tariffs, they will not affect goods that are already in transit here or right here, only new goods. So there's about a couple of weeks, maybe three weeks of wiggle room, presumably, the markets like to think, to avoid them ever being implemented on a formal basis, let alone the threat of adding another $325 billion to that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the fact that matter is that talks would continue.

It's going to affect $40 billion in consumer goods. And if this is passed along to consumer, well, and one economist saying it's going to be about 500 bucks per household per year just off the tariffs alone in added cost as they get passed along. And we're not just talking made in China, but things made with parts in China could also be slapped with this. You will be looking for the goods that were shipped before midnight last night, because that's when it went into effect. Unclear if all products will be hit, though. Analysts are saying Apple may be spared. So if you're looking for a new iPhone, it may help you. Gene Munster, a widely followed analyst at Loup Ventures, saying that Apple is seen by the president as a sign of U.S. strength in business, and they also have a good working relationship. And keep in mind Apple was spared from tariffs last fall. So, we will see how this falls out as a case-by-case basis. If hit, though, Munster is saying Apple would eat those costs initially. Many small businesses won't have that luxury, though, as they're having to pay more for goods. They will have to pass it along to folks. And some folks like farmers say they're getting hit coming and going, Neil. They're paying higher prices for steel products -- think of tractors -- and then of course, ag prices falling, as they're being hit with tariffs on some of the agricultural products in China. So, it will be interesting to see how this shakes out. And think about stores like Best Buy. Lastly, Neil, they have razor-thin margins, about 5 percent. And almost all the goods that they're selling are made in China. So you will be paying more, no doubt, at the till pretty soon if you're buying stuff from Best Buy and other retailers -- back to you.",

Richard Burr is not investigating obstruction of justice, because he's not a prosecutor. That leaves two things, election security and the report that he has yet to publish.

No deal yet, but President Trump says the talks will continue. Now, his treasury secretary just said kind of the opposite, that nothing is planned right now. Nevertheless, stocks were trimming earlier gains, but they came back from huge, huge losses. Also today, we were focusing on Uber shares, a big debut in the market today, a bit of a dud when it came to its opening day performance, down about 8 percent. Those were the crosscurrents today. What a day. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And Fox on top of trade tensions that are still over the top. We have got John Roberts at the White House on where those talks are standing now, Jacqui Heinrich on in Bayonne, New Jersey on the impact to our economy right now, and Robert Gray out in Los Angeles, where consumers are bracing for an inevitable hit right now. We begin with John Roberts. Hey, John."

It's not to say that there won't be any more trade talks, but there is nothing on the books right now. And in the last few minutes, President Trump weighing in on today's talks with the vice premier of China, Liu He, the president tweeting -- quote -- \"Over the course of the past two days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries. The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversations into the future will continue. In the meantime, the United States has imposed tariffs on China, which may or may not be removed, depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations.\" Late last week, China reversed itself on some core issues that it had already agreed to, and then started to play the delay game on another round of talks. So, the president lit a fire under them with the imposition of new tariffs, which had been postponed. That increases tariffs from 10 to 25 percent on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. President Trump also turning up the heat, threatening more tariffs, tweeting this morning that the process has begun to place additional tariffs at 25 percent on the remaining $325 billion. That would be the biggest round of tariffs yet. After last night's brief talks and dinner, the Chinese delegation saying they would prefer a different route of negotiations than the imposition of tariffs. Here's Liu He."

Last night, according to sources, he told Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, and the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, that there was nothing more that he, Liu He, could do, that it had to come down to President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping getting together to try to pull this wagon of a trade deal across the finish line. We haven't heard anything more about that, at least from the U.S. side, but we may hear more from President Trump, who's got an event in the East Room coming up here in the next few minutes -- Neil."

      "speaker": "JACQUI HEINRICH, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, the effects of these new tariffs aren't being felt quite yet. The cargo ships coming in today and for the next three to four weeks were already in transit by the time those new tariffs took effect, so those ones will be taxed at the 10 percent rate, the old rate. Anything, though, that leaves China, left China after midnight last night will be subject to that 25 percent new tariff rate. That is a huge price difference, and it's causing a big conundrum for business owners and retailers. Part of the question is whether the retailers and suppliers will absorb some or all of the costs increase, hoping to keep consumers shopping, or if they will reprice their items to reflect those tariffs and risk losing some business. Some big retailers made bulk orders, anticipating the tariffs, and may be able to fend off price hikes until that inventory is gone. But smaller shops may pass off that extra cost to consumers faster -- $200 billion dollars worth of goods are impacted, nearly 6,000 products, including things that American shoppers purchase regularly, like furniture, clothes, food and electronics."

      "utterance": "As John Roberts mentioned, the president has one big card left to play. Earlier this week, he threatened a 25 percent tariff on goods that are already impacted by those tariffs. That's about $325 billion worth of Chinese exports, just about every Chinese export left. He didn't pull the trigger on that. And retailers are hoping that he doesn't have to, and this negotiation reaches a conclusion -- Neil."

      "utterance": "All right, Jacqui, thank you very, very much. I do want you to peek at a chart of the Dow today. It was -- it was crazy, folks. I mean, talk about a roller-coaster ride. We were heading south, and quickly, down about 358 points at one point, finished up about 114 points. Everything was going tick for tick on where this particular trade negotiation was going. Now, the silver lining here is that the $200 billion worth of additional Chinese goods the president has targeted with these 25 percent tariffs, they will not affect goods that are already in transit here or right here, only new goods. So there's about a couple of weeks, maybe three weeks of wiggle room, presumably, the markets like to think, to avoid them ever being implemented on a formal basis, let alone the threat of adding another $325 billion to that. But the fact that matter is that talks would continue. And the president was optimistic that they would, even though you got a slightly mix vibe out of the treasury secretary. Didn't seem to matter. By day's end, we avoided having the worst week of the year. The Dow came back, but the major averages did have a rough time this week. Let's get the read from market watchers Frances Newton Stacy, Ted Oakley, and Scott Shellady. Scott, to you. What do you make of just how we ended on the day? Could have been a lot worse. Right?"

      "speaker": "SHELLADY",
      "utterance": "But you can't do that now. What I think really happened was -- is what we saw on our desk. The selling really happened in the first four or five days -- four days this week, and then started to slowly but surely dry up, looking at the Uber offering that we saw today, and that we just didn't have those people come in and continue to keep -- keep pressing that market. And then that's when the buyers could start to take over. And they did and they brought it up higher on the day. But I will tell you this. We see a lot of these desks. We see equities. We see fixed income and we see commodities. The commodities across the board pretty much are telling us this is going to be longer and more protracted than we think. So that's giving me a yellow danger signal. Then you have got the equity market trading the U.S. economy, right? Everything great, it's hunky-dory. And every now and again, we do trade on China. But we're still up there like we did today. And then, lastly, I go to the fixed income or interest rate market. Interest rates are telling me also, flashing yellow, 2.45 percent, things that might not be that good going forward. So we're thinking that we have got more of a danger ahead of us than we do happiness."

Frances, we're also worried or some people were about how China responds. They threatened their own retaliatory measures to counter what the president did with these higher tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods. What do you think they're up to?"

And certainly I have read \"The Art of the Deal.\" And I really understand President Trump trying to increase his leverage point. And we -- certainly when it comes to trade, we have a lot more leverage. However, the Chinese are all about saving face. They do not have the same political goals that we do. They do not have the same definition of transparency that we do. And I just have to think, if Trump can go in and make Xi look good, rather than trading these punches, then maybe we can get a little bit closer psychologically, so that we can start kind of building the trust back, because China does have options in making us feel pain. Maybe it's not on the trade front, but maybe they can put pressure on the U.S. multinationals, which puts pressure on our stock market and our stock prices, which, of course, Trump likes. And also -- hopefully not -- but they have -- they could make things with North Korea a little bit difficult. So..."

Ted, one of the things that's remarkable about China is, we have a -- they have a surplus with us, a half-a-trillion dollars, whatever it is. They import a little over $100 billion worth of U.S. goods. So you talk about impact. Obviously, they're on the tougher end of that particular stick. But they have a couple of so-called nuclear options, right? They could devalue their currency, cheapen it to the point that's a global impact right there. Or they could just say, you know what, all those treasuries we own, we just stop buying them. In fact, we might just start selling them. Then what?"

And I think you saw a little of that today, when they came in and supported their own market, which made the market, their market, move up another 3 percent or so. But, in general, I think they would wait on the treasury side, I mean, from we're on a rate situation. But they have those two options. I think they would do the yuan first, though."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, you're talking about their currency, the yuan. Scott, obviously, that's an extreme scenario. They didn't do anything today thus far. Maybe they're trying to see if they can patch things up. Obviously, you have got the delegation going back. They're going to get their marching orders from Xi Jinping. What do you think they are?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHELLADY",
      "utterance": "I think that they're pretty -- well, I think they're closer than they have been. And I think things ultimately will get done. I mean, look, I have got a farm. We have got a family farm. I hear a lot from the soybean farmers out there. It's not good either. But I think that we have still got some political goodwill capital that we're going to be able to spend here. It's not going to happen overnight. Like, everybody who is waiting for some sort of May 10 epiphany, that's not happening. But I need to remind everybody also, the U.S. economy is so big, so big and so good that, with a 3.2 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, you take into consideration these new tariffs, that's probably going to shave 0.3 -- three-tenths or maybe at the most four-tenths off of our growth. So it's not disastrous, and we're still very, very healthy."

I think the -- I think if Trump could call Xi before we get into this let's punch each other, let's punch each other, let's punch each other, and let him save a little bit of face. I think he sent Liu He over today because he knew that nothing was going to happen today. And he doesn't want that failure on him. And the Chinese are about saving face. And I know Trump is a tough talker. But I think, if he allows them to do that, it'll go through smoother and faster. I still think it's going to take a couple of months. I think we're going to get a deal. And I think the equities were trying to readjust to the possibility of no deal and then readjusted to yes, a deal is coming."

      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. Yes, it would seem that this deal between the U.S. and China would come down to a phone call between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China. China's top negotiator, Liu He, told the U.S. delegation yesterday at dinner that he has nothing left that he could do and it would come down to that phone call. Right now, I can tell you the top negotiator also told us today the talks went fairly well today. In addition, he says that more talks could happen in the future. He said the talks will continue. However, though, the White House confirming that there's no schedule for those talks going forward at this point. Now, President Donald Trump says that he doesn't mind collecting all those tariffs, the administration remaining positive, Vice President Mike Pence today saying that a deal is possible with the Chinese still. Now, it means that if you buy something of the one of 6,000 items that went up to 25 percent tariff -- that's $200 billion worth of imports -- it could cost you more. We're talking about airplane rubber, plywood, also inflatable rafts. Now, moving forward, there is no schedule, as I say, of right now as to what happens next. The Chinese have left the United States now. They're on a flight on their way back to China. The administration also started the paperwork to put everything else that China imports into the United States under a 25 percent tariff there. The Chinese seem to be on the clock now, the president following through with his -- with his threats to add these tariffs. And the ball seems to be in the Chinese court -- back to you, Neil."

Remember, the president had briefly considered him to be a labor secretary. But, Andy, what's interesting here is, we do have some wiggle room before the implementation of these 25 percent tariffs, but -- because it's -- if they already have goods in transit, they're not affected. It's the new -- the new stuff that will be. But, having said that, if they were to go into effect, absorbing a 10 percent hit is one thing. Businesses will try to swallow and not pass it along to their consumers; 25 percent, it would be another matter. Then what? ANDREW PUZDER, FORMER PRESIDENT & CEO, CKE RESTAURANTS: Well, I think it's a lot -- it's going to be a lot tougher on the Chinese than it's going to be on the Americans. I think this -- there is -- a deal needs to be done here. It needs to be done. The Chinese need it done.

A lot of people look at that and say, all right, what does that mean for other public offerings that are sort of waiting on the runway? Who better to ask than my friend Charles Payne?

No one is greedier than Silicon Valley and the venture capitalists out there, no one out there. They have had 24 rounds of fund-raising over the years. What that means is that, years ago, certain people got a bite at the apple at a $500 million valuation, then $1 billion valuation, and it goes up and goes up. And for a long time, they were able to go public, these companies, and knowing that the public, particularly the users -- I mean, think of this. Tens of millions of users around the world would automatically want to own the stock. And that's kind of backfiring right now. People are getting a little hip to this."

I mean, keep in mind, electronics, bicycles, toys, furniture, you name it, made in China being slapped with fresh tariffs up to 25 percent or something elevated up to 25 percent. It's going to affect $40 billion in consumer goods. And if this is passed along to consumer, well, and one economist saying it's going to be about 500 bucks per household per year just off the tariffs alone in added cost as they get passed along. And we're not just talking made in China, but things made with parts in China could also be slapped with this. You will be looking for the goods that were shipped before midnight last night, because that's when it went into effect. Unclear if all products will be hit, though. Analysts are saying Apple may be spared. So if you're looking for a new iPhone, it may help you. Gene Munster, a widely followed analyst at Loup Ventures, saying that Apple is seen by the president as a sign of U.S. strength in business, and they also have a good working relationship. And keep in mind Apple was spared from tariffs last fall. So, we will see how this falls out as a case-by-case basis. If hit, though, Munster is saying Apple would eat those costs initially. Many small businesses won't have that luxury, though, as they're having to pay more for goods. They will have to pass it along to folks. And some folks like farmers say they're getting hit coming and going, Neil. They're paying higher prices for steel products -- think of tractors -- and then of course, ag prices falling, as they're being hit with tariffs on some of the agricultural products in China. So, it will be interesting to see how this shakes out. And think about stores like Best Buy. Lastly, Neil, they have razor-thin margins, about 5 percent. And almost all the goods that they're selling are made in China. So you will be paying more, no doubt, at the till pretty soon if you're buying stuff from Best Buy and other retailers -- back to you."

The next round, if it's put into place, would have more of effect. But companies will work hard to shift that production. And for most categories, a lot of that has already occurred, as China is no longer the low-cost producer it once was. For toys, for bicycles, it still made in China for quite some time to come."

Because a lot of retailers were preparing for this by building up their inventories, putting more on their shelves, just in case. A lot of people said that's why the first-quarter GDP was as strong as it was. What do you think?"

Meanwhile, again, I want to reinforce that many companies have been moving production outside of China for years, both because it's no longer as cheap as it once was to make product there, but also to diversify their sources of production. So it's only certain categories that are so heavily affected. And I am always amazed at the flexibility and responsiveness of capitalism."

So if he's sending a subpoena, that tells me that private negotiations for a voluntary appearance failed. The next question is, OK, what does he want? The Senate Intelligence Committee found no evidence of criminal collusion a long time ago. You ought to be forgiven for maybe not remembering that, because it didn't get a lot of play in the D.C. media, but the Senate Intelligence Committee long ago said no criminal collusion. Richard Burr is not investigating obstruction of justice, because he's not a prosecutor. That leaves two things, election security and the report that he has yet to publish. And my suspicion is, there is testimonial discrepancy between witnesses. And chairman Burr is wanting to give one of those witnesses an opportunity to clarify, amplify, otherwise correct a discrepancy. He did it with Jared Kushner."

He's about to publish a report that is going to be consumed by everyone, and he wants the report to be fulsome. So if you have witness discrepancy, the fair thing to do is to give those witnesses a chance to say, I had inaccurate recollection or misrecollection, my recollection has been refreshed. The only way to do that is to invite the witness to come back in voluntarily. Apparently, that did not work. Your next option, which I think Burr was pretty reluctant to use, is a subpoena. When this final story is written, Neil, I think you will find that he offered a voluntary, it didn't work out, and this has nothing to do with collusion or obstruction."

Our private messages, it's all being catalogued and remembered."

      "utterance": "What they want to do is they want to de-gender society, which I don't really care about from a political perspective, except for the fact that it becomes extremely rhetorically clunky. If you have ever tried to write about two groups of people, an actor and an actress, and you don't want to say their name every single time, having a gender difference is helpful. But now we're being told that that is politicizing that?"

They don't have to wait for something. It's been very real, very palpable, and very painful. Thank you very, very much, Jeff Flock. We are all over the trade impact of this, because, for now, it might be limited to agricultural items feeling the pinch, and the U.S. is trying to help them out any way it can. But who knows what's going to happen? Who knows if this escalates? Who knows if cooler heads ultimately will prevail? Ten a.m. Eastern time tomorrow, we're all over it, the impact on you, your money and the next time you go shopping. Here's \"The Five.\" Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
