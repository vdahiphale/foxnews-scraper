Most of them were healthy when they got down there for their vacation and they have one thing in common several of them, drinking from the hotel minibar shortly before they became ill. More than two million Americans go there every year. There's a third -- that's a third of the country's tourism. The D.R. is the most popular spot in the islands. It runs on tourist revenue. Bringing in $6 billion a year. So, as they scramble to save their lifeblood, families are grieving, questions are mounting, as is the investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In a moment, the devastated daughter of a man who died in the Dominican Republic in January. She says her father was enjoying his retirement. He went there on vacation perfectly healthy and never came home.

The American College of Cardiology says one four Americans will die of heart problems, yet, seven of the eight Americans who died in the Dominican had a heart attack and or pulmonary edema. And we don't yet know the last person's cause of death. So, all of the tourists we know about who were generally healthy died of very similar causes, which is exceptionally unusual especially when you consider that 63-year-old Nathaniel Holmes and his 49-year-old fiancée Cynthia Day died of the same thing at the same time. Then, there's the minibar you mentioned. Three of the eight Americans did drink from their hotel minibars. It's unknown if the other five did, but it appears most of them drank alcohol. And our corporate cousin the New York Post is reporting that investigators are looking into whether the tourists were poisoned by bootleg booze. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Police want to know who supplied the alcohol and whether it contained dangerous chemicals. And Dominican tourism officials, say the FBI and other federal agencies have now taken an active role in the overall investigation. And that the FBI, in particular, is going back and re- analyzing toxicology results to see if there are more common links. The latest American tourist to die in the D.R. is Leyla Cox who turned 53 last weekend. Her son says he's getting very little information. Watch.",

It keeps tradition with the anniversary of the consecration of the cathedral's altar celebrated every year on June 16. As of this week Notre Dame Foundation has received nearly $18 million donations. Another 425 million pledged by donors in an ambitious effort to get it rebuilt within five years is the dream of President Emmanuel Macron. So, we will see if he can pull it off.

President Trump points the finger at the \"nation of terror\" in the wake of the tanker attacks, where is this whole thing going. Also tonight, Democrats find out who they will share the debate stage with. And David Axelrod goes after Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a big way. Going after her legacy of what he says is defending the indefensible. Governor Huckabee is going to be here in a moment. He has something to say about that. But first tonight, “The Story” investigates what on earth is going on in the Dominican Republic. New developments this evening out of the Caribbean country where something very strange is clearly happening. Eight Americans have died there in just 12 months. Most of them were healthy when they got down there for their vacation and they have one thing in common several of them, drinking from the hotel minibar shortly before they became ill. More than two million Americans go there every year. There's a third -- that's a third of the country's tourism. The D.R. is the most popular spot in the islands. It runs on tourist revenue. Bringing in $6 billion a year. So, as they scramble to save their lifeblood, families are grieving, questions are mounting, as is the investigation. In a moment, the devastated daughter of a man who died in the Dominican Republic in January. She says her father was enjoying his retirement. He went there on vacation perfectly healthy and never came home. Plus, former deputy assistant director of the FBI who is now involved in this case as well, Danny Coulson on what they would be doing there, and how they can solve this mystery. But first, let's go to Trace Gallagher, who breaks it down for us tonight and gives us the very latest developments this evening on this. Hi, Trace."

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. Let's begin with the common denominators. First, pulmonary edema, water on the lungs is mostly caused by heart disease. The American College of Cardiology says one four Americans will die of heart problems, yet, seven of the eight Americans who died in the Dominican had a heart attack and or pulmonary edema. And we don't yet know the last person's cause of death. So, all of the tourists we know about who were generally healthy died of very similar causes, which is exceptionally unusual especially when you consider that 63-year-old Nathaniel Holmes and his 49-year-old fiancée Cynthia Day died of the same thing at the same time. Then, there's the minibar you mentioned. Three of the eight Americans did drink from their hotel minibars. It's unknown if the other five did, but it appears most of them drank alcohol. And our corporate cousin the New York Post is reporting that investigators are looking into whether the tourists were poisoned by bootleg booze. Police want to know who supplied the alcohol and whether it contained dangerous chemicals. And Dominican tourism officials, say the FBI and other federal agencies have now taken an active role in the overall investigation. And that the FBI, in particular, is going back and re- analyzing toxicology results to see if there are more common links. The latest American tourist to die in the D.R. is Leyla Cox who turned 53 last weekend. Her son says he's getting very little information. Watch."

And remember, a Colorado couple says they drank from a mini bar in the D.R. and got violently ill, but recovered. They were later diagnosed with pesticide poisoning. And a forensic professor now says the symptoms suffered by most victims who died are consistent with poison. Martha."

And they had something to eat and drink that evening, and then returned to their room. And my dad started to not feel well, and he laid down in bed and went to sleep. And the next morning when he woke up, he complained that his back hurt and his elbow hurt and that he just didn't feel great. So, they went and had a massage. And after the massage, he still wasn't feeling well and decided to just head back to the room and lay down and take a nap. And that was pretty much what happened for the next two days. And then, Thursday, he complained that he was so sick, he just wanted to go home."

So, I want to thank you for being here tonight. And we're going to go now to Danny Coulson. Kellie, thank you. Danny Coulson is former deputy assistant director of the FBI.

The FBI is there, they're doing the investigation. They'll do a very comprehensive investigation. If I were doing it, one thing I would focus on is the alcohol. I do a lot of work on that part of the world and a high percentage the alcohol is counterfeit. And Lord knows what they put in that stuff. So, I would look at that, I'd look at pesticides, insecticides, and do a whole lot of interviews. And also, they have great surveillance cameras there. I'd be looking at that. So, there's a -- there's a lot of potential to solve this case. And I think they'll do it, we'll know what happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, I mean, one aspect of it could be -- you know, using pesticides that maybe we wouldn't use in this country that are poisonous. You know, that would be -- that would look like it leads towards an unintentional cause. But that the liquor has the possibility of leading towards something that could be -- you know, much more devious. And you hear these stories also about the dispenser. You know, we're not talking about little bottles necessarily in a minibar that have a top on them that -- you know, are sealed. In some of these cases, we're talking about a dispenser that was in the room. And in that case, pretty much anything could be in that bottle, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COULSON",
      "utterance": "That's right. Also, don't rely on this. That the fact that the bottle is sealed, that isn't mean anything. Some of the finest restaurants over there have sealed bottle, it's all counterfeit. The bottles are counterfeit or recycled. And they put things in it and aren't really what you think they are. So having it sealed is not the issue, it's what do they do with it? They're very sophisticated at copying high-quality liquor and other items. So, it could be the dispenser, it could be -- it could be something else."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

But if it's -- we haven't resolved this thing pretty quickly, I wouldn't send my family down there. Let's get some answers then we'll go down, it's a beautiful place, I've been there. And -- but I would want answers rather than subject myself or my family to that type of threat."

      "speaker": "COULSON",
      "utterance": "It's a big investigation. It's going to be a couple of months, at least, I would say. Unless they suddenly stumble across something. But they've never get manifest, shipping data, all kinds of things, and a whole lot of interviews."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COULSON",
      "utterance": "I would say it's probably greed. It's probably, people trying to save money. Remember, in our country have a lot of protections of EPA about pesticides, insecticides and a lot of things. They don't have it there. So, when you go down there, you involve yourself in a crapshoot. So, it's something -- we can -- FBI will solve this. We'll know."

So in talking about his business dealings, his foundation work, and not being able to come forward with his taxes and not doing it, you actually open the door for a lot of this type of scrutiny. So I think I think it's fairly reasonable for Democrats and others to look at some of what he's talking about and saying you know, there's some malfeasance here, there are some discrepancies here, we need to actually look into that.

      "utterance": "Well, look there's a reason why Donald Trump is the president. It's because people don't like this kind of nonsense. They saw Washington D.C. gazing at its navel, having its cocktail parties, thinking only of itself, fixated on weird things that don't affect the American people or if it does it affects them negatively. Donald Trump was elected because he talked about the issues, he had proposals. Yes, there was chanting of locker up and all of that, but it wasn't campaigns based on let's go get that person. And I think that the Democrats should continue this. Because it guarantees the president will be re-elected. I think he will be reelected. It's certainly something they -- no one should take for granted. But this is a reminder about the nature of what can happen when you get fixated and when you don't want to talk about the details of the issues. There's a lot of things going on with Americans right now, the news today in Iran of course, the Strait of Hormuz. The world is very -- getting very disturbed and the nation has to be governed. The signaling that this sends to the world is that there's turmoil here and it affects also our national security. So I think that this is something the Democrats if they were serious would stop. And the debates coming up may be the chance for people to see exactly how much these people know about the details of the issues."

But this is a region in a country, in a regime that has been so dishonest, and they've been so brutal not only to their enemies like Israel and the rest of the world but also to their own people. But I think the president is playing this right. He's not rushing into military action which would be a huge mistake. He is being very careful and calculating.

I'm a little surprised that this came out of Axelrod. He is a better person than that he knows better. And I am really shocked and surprised that he would go there to that degree.

So, we're really talking about comments that have been made over a lot of time. And I think that you know, a candidate has been the opportunity to evolve and clearly, he evolved from 1974 to 2006. And I think this is exactly where Biden needs to stay. He needs to stay in the middle of the road. He needs to be true to his values. He doesn't need to get into this whole fight about the Hyde Amendment. He needs to stay true to who he is. So, I don't see a problem with the comments that he made if that is his truth."

It suggested that he, you know, was changing his mind about federal funding for abortion and that maybe he felt like it had to be supported now and then he said no, that's not what I said and then he said yes, that is what I said. What is going on here? LILA ROSE, FOUNDER & PRESIDENT, LIVE ACTION: Right. I mean he is a flip flopper, Joe Biden, he's just like everybody else now in the field in the Democratic Party running for -- running to be the nominee for president. They all are extreme on abortion. Out of touch with the vast majority of Americans. This isn't evolving on abortion. This is regressing on abortion. Look, most Americans want abortion restrictions. Seventy percent of millennials and gen-z want abortion to be banned until the first trimester or banned all together. So, this idea of these Democrats that abortion should be legal through all nine months for any reason, funded by the taxpayer, funded by anybody, everybody, is really repugnant to most Americans."

Because when you do look at the polls, there is a lot of support for people who are more in the middle on this issue. And it has sort of become the party line among Democrats that unless you are pro-choice, there is no room in the party for pro-life Democrats. Kirsten Gillibrand has said that very clearly. Then you see sort of on the Hollywood and music level, Ariana Grande giving the money that she gave because in Georgia they have adopted more harsh abortion laws that is the debate that has been shaping up.

Because I'm gone five days a week, I'm home for two. So, she was also the campaign manager. So, whatever she did that will be looked at too, I'm sure. But I didn't do it."

Margaret Hunter has now pleaded guilty to knowingly and willfully converting those funds, admitting to spending the money on things like this. A $10,000 trip to Italy, a flight for rabbit whose name is Eggburt. Zip lining excursion for Duncan and their kids, and a $351 lunch for the family. Here's now lady's night, Lisa Boothe, Jessica Tarlov, and Susan Li. You know, when I look at that and she pled guilty, you know, maybe it was all her fault, Lisa."

But it's more than that, it's really sort of, their philosophy of how to keep their intimacy strong. And she says she has an intimacy coach who has guided her through all of this.

Wow. Remember that moment? The mass is going to take place in a side chapel. No more than 30 people will be in attendance but broadcast on French television for Christians to take part around the world. So pretty good idea to bring attention to that. It keeps tradition with the anniversary of the consecration of the cathedral's altar celebrated every year on June 16. As of this week Notre Dame Foundation has received nearly $18 million donations. Another 425 million pledged by donors in an ambitious effort to get it rebuilt within five years is the dream of President Emmanuel Macron. So, we will see if he can pull it off. That is “The Story” for this Friday night. Have a wonderful weekend, everybody. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
