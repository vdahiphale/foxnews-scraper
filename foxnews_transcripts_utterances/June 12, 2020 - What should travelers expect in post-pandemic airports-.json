So, if you're in legal issues or police issues, criminal issues, well, you might be waiting a while. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's where we stand right now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Welcome, everybody.

Carmen Best got the inside look at the precinct yesterday. And she said, we wanted to look at the damage, but really nothing major. She said it was not her decision to cut and run. And she almost apologized to her officers for what this is doing to morale.

However, under the -- if the president must be talking about -- he didn't really answer Harris Faulkner's question directly, but he must be talking about sending in troops. He has no other people to send in, either troops or DHS, Department of Homeland Security, which is a federal police department 60,000-strong. But he doesn't have the legal authority to do that, unless requested by the legislature of the state of Washington or by the governor, if the legislature is unable to meet. That's right out of the Constitution. And even then, he can only send in federal apparatus, whether it's military or DHS, in -- when there's a state of rebellion or insurrection. Now, if you look at those pictures, it looks like there's a rebellion. But the Supreme Court has defined rebellion or insurrection, Neil, as meaning a state of affairs manmade or natural, like Katrina, where the courts can't sit, because, theoretically, no matter how bad the violence is, people can get arrested and be brought before courts. Or the governor could get an order for these people to vacate the neighborhoods from a federal judge. And if they don't, then the governor can use force to enforce that court order.

The president talked to Harris Faulkner, seemed to dismiss it out of hand. But it comes at the same time the president has had differences with present and past defense officials. Of course, Jim Mattis maybe started all this a couple of weeks ago, questioning whether the president's language was divisive. Of course, his former chief of staff former General Kelly, who disputes the characterization that Mattis was fired. So, I could go on and on here. But let's go to retired Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis, author of \"Collision Course,\" much more, but a good read on this. And I'm wondering, Colonel, looking at this, how big a deal is this for the president that there might be a dust-up with military officials who do not seem to recoil from speaking out?",

So, the gap between them is not as great as some would pretend. As -- you talked about West Point. About 50 years ago, I raised my right hand on -- while standing on the Plain at West Point, and I swore to abide by the Constitution and by the orders provided by the president and those that he appoints. Now, if any general today or admiral decides that they can't put up with what this president is saying or doing, they can resign. And for the good of the country, they probably should. We saw something like this during the Iraq War, to a certain degree, and we have seen it before. Yes, these generals are well-trained. They have great knowledge, but that we also have a Constitution and a Bill of Rights. They can become civilians and then speak out more. But even General Mattis -- I think it really comes down to, whose ox are you goring today? Certainly, President Trump is tough. Some argue he's divisive. But I would argue that President Obama before him was incredibly divisive, especially against people like me, who are pro-life, and all his radical agenda. So we need to recognize that the will of the people is to elect a president. That president runs and commands our U.S. military. And, sometimes, we don't like what he or she would do, but that's just the way our Constitution is constructed.",

And then some clever people got together and they thought about making cocktails, drug cocktails. And that's what's responsible for controlling AIDS and now, subsequently, a lot of other viruses. We and others have now discovered a whole new class of drugs against viruses called antibodies. I'm sure everybody knows about antibodies now. They are the things that your body makes in response to vaccines that protect you. And so a lot of people have been going forward with single antibodies, and they're trying to move them in the clinic to see if they will work. Well, we have pioneered this approach, actually, with Ebola, which is why there's a lot of hope. But what we pioneered with Ebola was a cocktail of several antibodies, thinking that the same thing that might happen with AIDS or hepatitis C with traditional antiviral drugs could happen here with antibodies as well. So, we have insisted internally to only go forward with cocktails. We did that with Ebola. It was very effective. Now, Ebola, luckily, was a situation where there wasn't a huge epidemic, so there wasn't room for escape. But what we did was, we recently demonstrated in high-profile papers that will be published in the premier scientific journal in the next couple of days that cocktails are much more effective for containing particularly the possibility of escape than individual antibodies. And we announced simultaneously -- this rarely happens in science that you publish seminal fundamental papers. Usually, you wait years to try to make it in reality.

Her police chief seems to have a very different opinion. Carmen Best got the inside look at the precinct yesterday. And she said, we wanted to look at the damage, but really nothing major.

Now, she doesn't even have the guts to stand up and say, yes, I ordered that. But there is absolutely no doubt. The Seattle police chief, Carmen Best, said as much, without coming out and saying it was her. And here's -- here's my feelings on this, Neil. And this is going to maybe sound a little radical to some people. But Carmen Best is the chief of police. The police department is a paramilitary organization. They take -- the officers take their orders from the chief. It is time for that chief to do what her duty is. And that is to order her officers to take back that six blocks. And if the mayor physically intervenes with, that mayor needs to be handcuffed and taken away and charged with intimidating a police officer or interfering with a police officer."

And the mayor had specifically said not to do that. She did. She didn't make a big, huge deal about it and get in your face about it, but she did that. Now, you're saying here she could move on our own in the effort of protecting the local citizenry. The local citizenry, so far, do not seem to be endangered.

But here is -- this is an on the line kind of moment. This is where your leadership and your courage come in. And isn't it time to stand up for something that you know is right?

Well, that's a big worry right now, because Seattle has always been dealing with a homeless and related problems here. This has taken it into a new focus. And these protests, which, by and large, were being done very, very peacefully -- there were some disruptions. I told you about at least one tear gas episode. But the fact of the matter is, this is at least a turnoff for the business world there and getting back to normal there. Charles Payne on that impact. Charles, I cannot imagine, forget about the impact on the city, but those in that area, it's drawing things down to a halt. Right? CHARLES PAYNE, HOST, \"MAKING MONEY\": It absolutely is. And to your point, this is already the epicenter, along with Los Angeles, for homelessness. And, of course, the city, their ham-fisted way of dealing with that was to introduce what they call hostile architecture, you know, like a city bench with a whole bunch of lines in the middle, like bars, so you couldn't take a nap on it, instead of dealing with these issues. They tried to shake down the largest corporations there, the companies that can get up and move if they were pushed too hard. So that didn't work. So it's just sort of -- to be quite frank with you, it's been such a terrible response to citywide crisis, one after another. I'm not surprised that they're botching this big time, and that they're making things a lot worse, because, over the long term, you think about what these protesters are now demanding. Without a tax base, you can't even provide the basic services, let alone some of the grievances that are being expressed there."

But leaving aside how some of them are a little over the top and never going to be realized, I am wondering, the more time that goes on that the police do not intervene, play that out for me. You mentioned something very interesting in the middle of the George Floyd protest, that it was something that hearkened back to you growing up in Harlem and where the police obviously were looked upon suspiciously, but you missed them when they weren't around, right?"

And it was almost a daily occurrence, to be quite frank with you. But on more than one occasion, they came around the corner, and I was relieved, relieved for my life, relieved for my family's life, relived for a neighbor's life. So this idea of defunding the police, taking away their pensions, and it's a surreal and crazy world. I mean, these folks yesterday had to call the fire department, which is all part of the same apparatus. So it's -- listen, they have got some grievances they want to talk about. Before you start talking about free college, how about demanding better school systems, demanding stronger curriculum for your children? Some of these things are just farfetched. But I think the genesis of them, if you go to the roots of them, some could be legit and talked about, discussed, and maybe get some real progress."

The picture that was just painted by our colleague Dan and the analysis by our colleague Charles is devastating if you live or work in that neighborhood, and it sounds like there's a serious breakdown in governmental authority. However, under the -- if the president must be talking about -- he didn't really answer Harris Faulkner's question directly, but he must be talking about sending in troops. He has no other people to send in, either troops or DHS, Department of Homeland Security, which is a federal police department 60,000-strong. But he doesn't have the legal authority to do that, unless requested by the legislature of the state of Washington or by the governor, if the legislature is unable to meet. That's right out of the Constitution. And even then, he can only send in federal apparatus, whether it's military or DHS, in -- when there's a state of rebellion or insurrection. Now, if you look at those pictures, it looks like there's a rebellion. But the Supreme Court has defined rebellion or insurrection, Neil, as meaning a state of affairs manmade or natural, like Katrina, where the courts can't sit, because, theoretically, no matter how bad the violence is, people can get arrested and be brought before courts. Or the governor could get an order for these people to vacate the neighborhoods from a federal judge. And if they don't, then the governor can use force to enforce that court order. So we are nowhere near the threshold that the Constitution and federal statutes and Supreme Court opinions require for the president to send his men and women in there."

And, nowadays, the economy is improving, the market is maturing, we're maybe getting past some of the shocks and some of the emotion that the market was feeling just some weeks ago.

You can build things, but will people come? Will people flock to those events, as you mentioned? And the reality remains, it's a wait and see. But I do believe that the market is more hopeful, let's say, than it has been in the past.

But this is going to cause a lot -- it costs a lot of money for Charlotte, because rather than having all the hoopla and all the people in the vast tens of thousands of press and delegates and alternates and straphangers and enthusiasts, they're going to have a much smaller crowd.

And now she's attacking the president's campaign for having a rally in Tulsa by saying it's irresponsible and selfish. So, she's there with tens of thousands of people protesting the president, and that's healing and hope, but the president having a rally, that's irresponsible and selfish. And we have seen this across -- across the Democratic spectrum. Bernie Sanders, I congratulate the protesters. Now the president's rallies are a threat to the health and well-being not simply of the people in the arena, but of the country. And we had Mayor (sic) Cuomo, who said, no right to jeopardize the health of my children, and yet then he said, I stand with the protesters. And we had Mayor de Blasio shutting down Orthodox Jewish funerals and now saying, I stand with the protesters. So it's beyond me. I'm sitting here in Austin, Texas. Our City Council and mayor are about ready to extend the shelter-in-place rule, but they had no problem at all with hundreds of people right over my shoulder standing and trying to -- spray-painting the capitol of Texas and holding nightly rallies.

The president talked to Harris Faulkner, seemed to dismiss it out of hand. But it comes at the same time the president has had differences with present and past defense officials. Of course, Jim Mattis maybe started all this a couple of weeks ago, questioning whether the president's language was divisive. Of course, his former chief of staff former General Kelly, who disputes the characterization that Mattis was fired. So, I could go on and on here. But let's go to retired Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis, author of \"Collision Course,\" much more, but a good read on this.

About 50 years ago, I raised my right hand on -- while standing on the Plain at West Point, and I swore to abide by the Constitution and by the orders provided by the president and those that he appoints. Now, if any general today or admiral decides that they can't put up with what this president is saying or doing, they can resign. And for the good of the country, they probably should. We saw something like this during the Iraq War, to a certain degree, and we have seen it before. Yes, these generals are well-trained. They have great knowledge, but that we also have a Constitution and a Bill of Rights. They can become civilians and then speak out more. But even General Mattis -- I think it really comes down to, whose ox are you goring today? Certainly, President Trump is tough. Some argue he's divisive. But I would argue that President Obama before him was incredibly divisive, especially against people like me, who are pro-life, and all his radical agenda. So we need to recognize that the will of the people is to elect a president. That president runs and commands our U.S. military.

And I'm just wondering, when you hear the same from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who seems to be speaking in his role, not judging the president going to Lafayette Square, but a top military official like him being there with him, that it somehow sent a condoning signal for what some have called just a photo-up.

No, he probably had some sense. If he didn't, then I would hold that against the press corps, certainly at the White House, who should have advised him contrary. But the president's in a tough place here. He has faced an opposition from the Democratic Party, who've impeached him, who are constantly badgering and going after him. I can understand.

      "utterance": "But, very rapidly, there were viral mutation escape, and people got resistance. It was called drug resistance. And that created a whole new scourge. And then some clever people got together and they thought about making cocktails, drug cocktails. And that's what's responsible for controlling AIDS and now, subsequently, a lot of other viruses. We and others have now discovered a whole new class of drugs against viruses called antibodies. I'm sure everybody knows about antibodies now. They are the things that your body makes in response to vaccines that protect you. And so a lot of people have been going forward with single antibodies, and they're trying to move them in the clinic to see if they will work. Well, we have pioneered this approach, actually, with Ebola, which is why there's a lot of hope. But what we pioneered with Ebola was a cocktail of several antibodies, thinking that the same thing that might happen with AIDS or hepatitis C with traditional antiviral drugs could happen here with antibodies as well. So, we have insisted internally to only go forward with cocktails. We did that with Ebola. It was very effective. Now, Ebola, luckily, was a situation where there wasn't a huge epidemic, so there wasn't room for escape. But what we did was, we recently demonstrated in high-profile papers that will be published in the premier scientific journal in the next couple of days that cocktails are much more effective for containing particularly the possibility of escape than individual antibodies. And we announced simultaneously -- this rarely happens in science that you publish seminal fundamental papers. Usually, you wait years to try to make it in reality. We also announced that -- on the same day that we announced that this major scientific story was coming out that, for coronavirus, cocktails might be important, we had put the first cocktail into human patients this week."

There's a lot of hope because it worked for Ebola in our hands -- the same people in our labs who put together this possible new treatment for coronavirus did it very successfully for Ebola. And so we are very excited that this is something that could really change the impact of this pandemic."

And I think that we have to say that, in addition to the incredible work throughout the entire bio-industry, everybody coming together to try to address this pandemic -- here particularly at Regeneron, we're so proud of our people that, while the rest of the world has been on lockdown and shutting down, they have been upping their game, working 24/7, killing themselves to try to bring this forward in record time."

Something to look forward to, except, by the way, when you want to travel right now, these days, having nothing to do with Regeneron, and everything to do with the new rules of flying -- after this."

George Casey, the Vantage Airport Group CEO, think airport management and business operator. He will a firsthand role in La Guardia, I think the Terminal B and part of a $5 billion fix-up and reopening. George, I look forward to seeing that. What people have to get used to now in the changes that are to come? Because many of them have not been anywhere near an airport, but, in the weeks and months ahead, they will be. What should they expect?"

      "utterance": "Well, thanks for having me on board. There's no doubt this current backdrop with COVID has created anxiousness for travelers. And so what we do, we do, as a company that's operating a network of airports, is, we need to instill confidence in the travelers. And we're doing that through projects like La Guardia Terminal B. And some of the specifics we're implementing there include the wearing of face masks in the terminal building, enhanced cleaning, the installation of Plexiglas shields in and around checking areas, gate areas and commercial retail areas, hand and towel sanitizer stations, also restrooms that are as touchless as possible. And we're using mobile and handheld devices to diminish the interaction from a touch standpoint for things like ordering food, in delivery of food, and also customer check-in at kiosks, a lot of on-site communication, reminding passengers and employees how to stop the spread of COVID, and also spacing in queuing. And those are things we're doing now to deal with this and to really decrease the level of anxiousness for travelers as the market picks back up. And then we also have things that we're studying over time, like ultraviolet light cleaning, and using cameras for temperature checking. And those are just a couple of the measures we're doing and looking at in the near term."

But we're doing everything, again, to keep our facilities safe and also facilitate the passenger experience in these challenging times. So, we want the traveler to feel confident, especially traveling through La Guardia Terminal B and all of our airports, that they are safe and healthy in transit. So we're doing everything in our power to make that as easy as possible."
