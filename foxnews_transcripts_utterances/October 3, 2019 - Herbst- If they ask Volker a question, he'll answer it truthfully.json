A week ago, Adam Schiff, the chair of the Intelligence Committee, along with the chairs of two other committees involved in this transcribed interview today with Volker, they set a deadline for Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, to comply with a subpoena for documents. Based on some of the things that Pompeo has said, we don't think that there's going to be compliance. Now, why is that important? We don't know. They said that end of the day, first thing in the morning. Just said by the 4th of October. This is important, Neil, because, if they don't comply, as the Democrats began to write their articles of impeachment, they could use that as justification for a contempt -- or -- excuse me -- an obstruction of Congress article. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We saw that with Richard Nixon, that that was one of the articles of impeachment in 1974 that the House Judiciary Committee crafted. So if they don't get the information, they could incorporate that into that. And Congressman Zeldin is still going here. One of the things I would like to know and I'd like to ask him here is, what if they don't hear from Mike Pompeo tomorrow and the State Department? What if there is exculpatory information that's not there? That's something that Democrats and Republicans, frankly, would like to have. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she talked about that the other day at her press conference, saying that the president ought to have the right to defend himself against these potential charges -- Neil.",

And then he was then asked whether or not he has made that ask of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping."

He got kicked out of the Navy. All of a sudden, he's getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a payoff."

Days later, a private equity fund Hunter Biden was involved with received investment money from China. The president claims, as you heard there, $1.5 billion, but The Washington Post fact-checker has disputed that figure. In a statement today, the Biden campaign said that President Trump continues to engage in what they are calling an abuse of power. They added as well -- quote -- \"What Donald Trump just said on the South Lawn of the White House was this election's equivalent of his famous, 'Russia, if you're listening' moment from 2016, a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country.\" Those comments, by the way, from the president came, as I said, as he was leaving for Florida, where he signed an executive order just a little while ago involving Medicare. This held a bit of a dual role, as the president's executive order will try to strengthen Medicare Advantage, but it also allowed him to go to the swing state of Florida and attack Medicare for all, as he sees it, as socialism. But, at one point, Neil, toward the tail end of the comments, the president also suggested that big pharma might be behind the -- quote, unquote -- \"nonsense\" or the -- quote, unquote -- \"hoax,\" as he put it, essentially the impeachment efforts, by saying of big pharma he -- quote -- \"wouldn't be surprised if it was from some of these industries like pharmaceuticals that we take on\" -- Neil."

The president has broad range of authority over the conduct of our foreign affairs, and is commanded by the Constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. For the president to request the cooperation of a foreign government in an ongoing investigation involving corruption between the officials of that government and ours is not only fully within his authority and responsibility. He'd be derelict if he didn't. And, in fact, there were three leading U.S. senators last year who wrote to the Ukrainian government asking for their cooperation in the Mueller investigation. What is the difference between that and the president asking for their cooperation in the follow-up investigation?

And don't forget, much of this Russian collusion hoax that was used to interfere with our election in 2016 and then to obstruct the lawfully elected president of the United States, a lot of that began with Ukrainian intelligence agencies.

      "utterance": "Well, just behind me a couple of steps here is Lee Zeldin, Republican congressman from Long Island. He's been in this meeting with Kurt Volker, the U.N. envoy, for most of the day. He just appeared at these cameras a couple of moments ago. And he was asked, you know, what's going on in there? And he says -- quote -- \"This is blowing a hole in the Democrats' case.\" Now, we don't know what's being said. Jim Jordan, Republican congressman from Ohio, came out a little bit earlier, and he said that he found Mr. Volker to be very impressive. We haven't really heard from the Democrats here. Again, the take is slightly different. Adam Schiff, the chair of the Intelligence Committee, came out a few hours ago and he said this reinforces that they're trying to interfere in the elections. Now, coming up tomorrow is going to be a key date. A week ago, Adam Schiff, the chair of the Intelligence Committee, along with the chairs of two other committees involved in this transcribed interview today with Volker, they set a deadline for Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, to comply with a subpoena for documents. Based on some of the things that Pompeo has said, we don't think that there's going to be compliance. Now, why is that important? We don't know. They said that end of the day, first thing in the morning. Just said by the 4th of October. This is important, Neil, because, if they don't comply, as the Democrats began to write their articles of impeachment, they could use that as justification for a contempt -- or -- excuse me -- an obstruction of Congress article. We saw that with Richard Nixon, that that was one of the articles of impeachment in 1974 that the House Judiciary Committee crafted. So if they don't get the information, they could incorporate that into that. And Congressman Zeldin is still going here. One of the things I would like to know and I'd like to ask him here is, what if they don't hear from Mike Pompeo tomorrow and the State Department? What if there is exculpatory information that's not there? That's something that Democrats and Republicans, frankly, would like to have. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she talked about that the other day at her press conference, saying that the president ought to have the right to defend himself against these potential charges -- Neil."

And I have great respect for Congressman McClintock, whom you interviewed right before our colleague Chad Pergram, but a fair reading of the transcript of the conversation with the president, in which we now know there were gaps -- and that's another issue that the Congress can wrestle with -- is, hey, there's $391 million here, but, first, I need a favor. And that's what the issue is, holding up military aid in return for a personal favor of investigating Joe Biden or bringing dirt on Biden's son. I have to challenge Congressman McClintock on one issue. There is no criminal investigation of Joe Biden at the present time. The president was suggesting the generation of one in the Ukraine. There's no -- there's none going on here. And I don't know if the president knows that. And I don't know if Congressman McClintock knows that, but the attorney general does."

The president decided to ask for it anyway. What was the president told? Did he understand it was against the law? His oath is to uphold the law, not to break the law."

No one -- he wasn't doing anything sneaky or Nixonian behind the scenes or whatever you want to call it. And then he did it again today, doubled down, tripled down, on the heels of hearing that he was petitioning the Australian prime minister to debunk, if these reports are true, the Mueller probe. It's all out there."

Going into the fourth quarter, it's looking pretty dismal once again. But I bet you that corporations, they will come up with some excuse anyways, whether it's the strong dollar, whether it's trade tensions or China.

Well, New York Congressman Max Rose is one of those moderate Democrats who managed to flip a safe Republican seat in a district the Republican president, by the way, won handily. So it is understandable he might be deemed reluctant to pile on the impeach Trump bandwagon, that is, until now, because now Congressman Rose is for at least an impeachment probe. He joins us now to tell us why. Good to see you."

      "utterance": "Absolutely not. And, quite frankly, the Democrats who are saying impeach him right away, who, quite frankly, were supportive of impeachment even before they got sworn in, they're absolutely wrong. They're just as wrong as the Republicans who ignore and dismiss anything this president does because he's a Republican. At this stage, though, as I announced last night, I certainly believe, especially as a consequence of the pure, unadulterated deflections and obstruction practiced by this administration, that an impeachment inquiry is appropriate."

      "utterance": "Look, I'm sure some people are happy about this, some people are upset about this. Along with my pledge last night to support pursuing an impeachment inquiry, I also pledged that we will not let this completely captivate our agenda. We have got to maintain our focus on things like building a seawall on the East Shore of Staten Island, stemming the flow of fentanyl into this country."

      "speaker": "ROSE",
      "utterance": "I think that that's ironic. And you know I really have very little allegiance to the Democratic Party. The president retweeted a couple of videos about me, saying, Max Rose, only investigations, doesn't want to get anything done. You should actually play it one day. It's such a lame video. But they deserve some free press."

Pretty much the only thing they accomplished was a tax scam, a tax giveaway to the wealthiest people amongst us. We have a problem with government today. We have a problem with hyper partisanship. We have a problem that we're not getting enough done. We need an infrastructure bill. And I lay the blame at that at the Democrats too that we haven't passed that. We got to pass something on drug crisis."

      "speaker": "ROSE",
      "utterance": "Well, no. Right now, that is up to the Democrats, how we are perceived going forward. What we have to do is, we have to pursue a fair, balanced, reasonable approach that doesn't jump to any conclusions. We have to earn the trust of the American people."

Well, look, Donald Trump did something wrong, it's clear, but doesn't everybody do it, and he's just being singled out? This is politics, Max. The American people have lost faith in their elected officials. We have to..."

And I believe, for that reason, that we should initiate the most expansive anti-corruption effort in the history of this country, so we can finally clean up our politics and earn the trust of the American people again, so they will think that, when we proceed with something like this, we're being fair."

      "speaker": "HERBST",

On any level, is that bad?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERBST",
      "utterance": "I would not comment on whether or not it is impeachable, but certainly I think the president was off-base. People who know Ukraine well know that what Biden did in trying to get rid of a corrupt prosecutor general was what the entire international community promoting reform in Ukraine thought was the right thing."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Neil, this is number four, the fourth parent to be sentenced, Gordon Caplan now slated to self-report to prison on November 6, sentenced to one month behind bars on this single count, a conspiracy and fraud charge. Prosecutors argued in court today that, unlike others embroiled in the scandal who first engaged with Singer for legitimate services, Caplan's relationship with the scheme's mastermind was about fraud from the very start. Caplan's attorneys, though, argued that Rick Singer is the real con man here and noted that Caplan has repeatedly apologized. He did so again today outside of the courthouse."

And you won't believe the amount of money he's putting down to make it happen, or hope to happen."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

He's a Houston icon, best known, you might recall, for sheltering thousands of Houston residents in his Gallery Furniture store right after Hurricane Harvey. And now he's putting his money behind the -- well, the Houston Astros, another passion of his, favored to win it all at the World Series. Of course, I think the New York Yankees stop them first."
    },

So the deal is, you came in to buy a Tempur-Pedic mattress, $3,000 or better, for the last several months, if the Astros win it all, you get the matches purchase free. So making these big bets, $5 million worth of bets, is a way to hedge it off. So, if the Astros do win, then the customers get the mattress for free."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCINGVALE",
      "utterance": "Yes, anything can happen in baseball. As Billy Beane said, playoff baseball is a crapshoot. But the Astros have a great chance. It will be interesting to see how they do against Tampa Bay and then see if they play the Yankees and Dodgers. So it's a lot of fun for our customers. In brick-and-mortar retailing nowadays, we have to find new ways to be relevant. And having these promotions is a great way to stay relevant with our customers. And we're a huge Astros sponsor. And I'm a big Astros fan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, you might have a better record and maybe have an edge going in if you get to the Yankees. Of course, it ends there. But leaving that aside, how are your customers reacting?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCINGVALE",
      "utterance": "They love it. They love being able -- the fact they can by a mattress, and the worst that can happen is, they get the mattress, they get a great deal, a great night's sleep. The best that can happen is, they get a great night's sleep and a free mattress. We did this in 2017, gave away about $13 million in free mattress when the Astros won it all that year. So hopefully this year we will give away a little more than that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, you have got a lot of goodwill in the community, and especially people remember how you were after Harvey and helping everyone out. So there's obviously a lot of goodwill there. And, obviously, every time I have caught an Astros game, the stadium is always sold out. So there's no problem with that, from the earliest part of the year to now. How do you think just fans are going to respond?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCINGVALE",
      "utterance": "Fans respond great to it. The fans respond great to the fact that they can get a free mattress."
    },

      "speaker": "MCINGVALE",
      "utterance": "And they -- we're big Astros sponsors, so they -- the Astros are tremendously popular in Houston, just like the Yankees are in New York and New Jersey.
