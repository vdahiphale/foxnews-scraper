I want to sit with you, by the way, and watch the Golden Globes. That would be a riot. I'm going to fly out there and do that with you. And the previews in the media are a bit odd. Listen to this. Reuters asks, party or not, Golden Globes prove test for Hollywood sex scandal. And NPR writes, are harassment scandals overshadowing Hollywood's award season? So I have to ask you this, Michelle. Are we actually supposed to feel sorry for these folks who have over-sexualized themselves and the culture for years? Look at those, that's plunging all the way to the ground those necklines, and they wonder why people give them a couple of glances. We're supposed to feel sorry for them because their goody bag experience is not going to be as wholesome this year?",

You know, they call them the experts. Tonight we focus on the economists and all those financial analysts who are sowing fear and pessimism about President Donald Trump's approach to fiscal matters. On the night Trump was elected, Nobel prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote \"It really does look like President Donald Trump and the markets are plunging. If the question is when the markets will recover? A first pass answer is never.\" Krugman also said \"We are very probably looking at a global recession with no end in sight.\" Andrew Ross Sorkin of The Times predicted the stock market would, quote, \"fall precipitously.\" Just weeks after the president took office, Matthew Barkoff of Carlson Capital in Dallas, he was out there warning Trump might trigger, quote, \"a global depression.\" The Bank of England and several prominent economists also issued their own dire warning. Yet 2017 was the best year for the global economy since 2010. Unemployment in the U.S. has plunged to 4.1 percent and Wall Street hit another record high today. It's an astonishing 62 times it did that last year. And last night The Washington Post tried to cover for all of those horrible predictions by arguing in part that the global markets are just ignoring Trump. Wait a second. You've got to be kidding me. As The Post points out, the U.S. accounts for one quarter of the world's $80 trillion economy. If Trump had truly been that a wrecking ball that all the experts predicted, there would have been a seismic shock in all of the global marketplace. And if you're wondering how Krugman won a Nobel, just remember, so did President Obama and Al Gore and Yasser Arafat. We'll be right back.",

But somehow we managed to get through these weather events without collapsing or stocking up with 100 rolls of toilet paper. We managed to figure it out. Today in the Washington, D.C., area, Fairfax County D.C., school was either delayed two hours or it was canceled for the second straight day. And why is this? This is what cyclone bomb affects look like in the D.C. areas. Look at that. The grass isn't even covered with snow. Two days of school canceled in northern Virginia. My friends, this is embarrassing. This is pathetic. So before we send the kids out in the morning from now on, I have an idea just to keep them really safe. Why don't we just dress them up in bubble wrap? That way they can comfortably weep in their safe spaces, never getting too hot or too cold again. That's why they didn't have school, it was too cold. What happened to a hat, gloves, and a jacket? Scarves are too dangerous, what a joke. This is my message parents and kids and the school superintendent, suck it up, buttercups.

Wolff's (inaudible) tall tales and embellished quotes are not going to negate the election or they are not going to stop your progress on behalf of the American people. In fact, Gallup reported this week at the end of December the president's approval rating is up to its highest level in six months. President Trump has had a really good year, all things considered. He's poised to have it even better 2018. That means the country is going to have a better year. In fact, the president seems to have all the fire and the only fury I see is coming from the media who hates to cover it. That's THE ANGLE.

Plan B is Donald Trump is crazy. He is mentally unstable. He's nuts. No, not at all. He has his eccentricities, so did Harry Truman, Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson. In the case of a guy like Joe Scarborough, this is just bitter jealousy. The entire time Joe Scarborough was in the House of Representatives, he told his aides and his successor in Congress that he would someday be president. When Donald Trump was nominated for president, Joe Scarborough thought he should be the nominee. When President Trump chose Vice President Pence for vice president, Joe Scarborough thought he should be vice president. Now that didn't stop Joe and Mika from brown-nosing around Mar-a-Lago. In fact, we now know it was Mika who recommended (inaudible) Powell for the deputy national security director in the Trump administration.

I want to play something that he said on \"The Today Show\" this morning with Savannah Guthrie, this is Michael Wolff who wrote this lurid book, let's watch. MICHAEL WOLFF, AUTHOR, \"FIRE AND FURY\": In the beginning, it was like every 25 or 30 minutes, he would get the same three stories repeated. Now it's the same three stories every 10 minutes."

But unfortunately, I think the facts are in. You might chalk this up to animus if it had happened after Steve Bannon left the White House. But we learned that he was saying these things while he was on the White House payroll and he owed his loyalty to Donald Trump. The idea that the president didn't want to win, didn't expect to win? I spoke to him throughout the campaign, never once did he say, that he either didn't want to win, and in every conversation, he was confident that he would. So, I chalked the entire thing up to your typical inside beltway maelstrom where a political operative, who the voters have never heard of and don't care about are trying to whip up a narrative that is their Plan B. The Trump presidency is unstable because the president is not. Look, in Lyndon Johnson, we had a president who actually conducted White House meetings while sitting on the toilet defecating. But now they are saying, Trump is crazy. No, Trump is the same solid citizen he's ever been. Yes, he has his own style and he used it to -- and he used to win the greatest upset victory in American political history."

Trump on issue after issue has demonstrated that he has more savvy and greater ability to connect with the average voter than any of these Manhattan, Washington Coastal elites combined. I think it describes them (inaudible). I want to read something to you. This is from Tony Blair, Roger, and he disputes a claim in the book. He said this story about British surveillance during the campaign that apparently is in Wolff's book. He says, \"This story, as we pointed out, is a complete fabrication, literally from the beginning to end. I've never had such a conversation in the White House, outside of the White House, with Jared Kushner, or with anybody else.\" Claiming that the campaign was under British surveillance.

The agenda of the left is a given. It's a constant, Laura. They are not going to stop. It's like the rain in Seattle, but what can you do to prevent it, to blunt it?

He talked to -- because I've talked to the staffers who talked to him, and I understand he was given access. I don't know who green lit it, but that was not a smart decision. I don't know why in God's green earth you would ever trust Michael Wolff to do a book? Ron Kessler is doing a book, but I probably pretty fair because he's written fair books in the past.

Did the FBI pay him at the same time the Clinton campaign was paying him? And we need a second special counsel. Even Lindsay Graham and a host of members are calling for that second special counsel to examine all these. So those are the four key points. If there is movement on those, fine. That's what I hope happens, but if there's not then there should be a new attorney general. That's what we said in our piece. I like Jeff Sessions. I want him to do his job. And if he's going to do that and as you point out, I think we turned a corner this week on the fact that they are telling us they're not going to give us the documents and access to important witnesses."

We don't know if that's true, but if it is, I think that's problematic certainly. So, I think this is critical as are a host of questions. Think about it -- why did the Justice Department released some of the text messages? Normally, they say ongoing investigation, we're not going to release any information public.

Not one bit of evidence shows the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the election. We know today that the Clinton campaign paid the law firm who paid Fusion who paid Chris Steele who paid Russians to do what? Influence the election. We know that Peter Strzok, the guy who ran the Clinton investigation, interviewed her, change the exoneration letter, have these text messages with Lisa Page where he said we need an insurance policy to make sure that we don't run the risk that Donald Trump gets elected by the American people.

Now the president is asking Congress for $18 billion for new and replacement barriers, another deterrent that would cover nearly half of the southern border. But is that really enough to fulfill his campaign promise? Is that the wall that everybody thought about? For answers we turn to conservative columnist Michelle Malkin who is in Colorado Springs. She joins us now. Michelle, build the wall and make Mexico pay for it, we are seeing some prototypes of the wall, and some of them look really imposing and great. But when I start hearing about sensors and towers and roads, towers and roads you do need, but sensors and see through walls and virtual walls, that doesn't thrill me I have to say. What are your thoughts? MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\": Well, the $18 billion request is a good solid down payment on Donald Trump's premier and marquis promise to secure our borders and build that wall. I applaud that. It comes on top of another $2 billion that was requested earlier last year to add another enforcement on parts of the Texas border and San Diego that would cover another 60 miles. But I think one of the key principles that has to be repeated over and over again, and I'm hearing from ranchers, from grassroots immigration enforcement activists, from the angel moms and dads that were promised by Donald Trump that this would be his first and most important priority, is that we need to fix our borders, not DACA. And I think we have some prepositional problems here, Laura, because I do not want to hear the phrase, well, we will have DACA before, as if something is contingent on something else.

This is between 2013 and 2017, fewer than 900 currently serve in the U.S. military, that's 0.1 percent in the U.S. military, as if we couldn't make that up, Michelle, with other recruits who are American citizens. They always say they are serving in our military, like 600,000 are serving in the military.

And that is the deal that has gotten completely thrown under the bus. Why is it we have so many politicians on both sides of the aisle, Laura, and you and I have talked and reported tirelessly for upwards of two decades now, why is it we have politicians who think it is such an urgent priority to put 800,000 illegal aliens and their families above all of these working-class Americans and also law-abiding, naturalized citizens."

    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "No president does. Actually I was one of the early voices saying that Sessions should recuse himself, and I actually think it was better for the president for him to recuse himself, because if Sessions hadn't, no matter what happened in the investigation people would be questioning its outcome. I don't see a crime here, I never have. And I think that the best thing for the president is to remove all of these shadows and say go ahead, investigative it, let's get to the conclusion. Now McGahn's involvement is problematic."

    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, timing is everything here. If the report is correct and McGahn was aware that Sessions had decided to recuse himself, then it's pretty problematic for him to go and try to convince him not to. Once you have someone who has made that conflict determination, if it was his view that he was considering it --"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Was that McGahn obstructing justice or the president?"

      "utterance": "I don't think this is obstructing."

      "speaker": "ALAN DERSHOWITZ",

      "utterance": "I'm afraid I have to disagree with Alan on this. There's lots of things people can do constitutionally or legally but they can do them for the wrong reasons, for unlawful reasons. And so I think a president could be charged with obstruction of justice. Now whether it would be a strong case --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "He's in charge of the law enforcement of the whole country. So isn't it in his discretion whether to fire Comey, not fire Comey, whether it's to encourage someone, you don't need to recuse yourself or not recuse himself, he's the head of the entire branch of government. He could fire any of these people even if his White House counsel's office concluded that, even though they didn't tell him that, if they were worried he was going to fire Comey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "I think that's what makes this a difficult case to make. But I don't think there's any bar on making the case. There's lots of people with discretionary authority that use it inappropriately, use it illegally. Can you be charged with that? Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, but they're not the president, the titular head of the entire executive branch. That's the different here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "But I think the problem here is not that President Trump couldn't be charged with it. The problem is President Trump had ample reason to fire Comey. His timing was pretty bad, but he had ample reason to do so. And in fact if you look at the record, he actually states those reasons. Now, it got all messed up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Apparently he said initially Russia wasn't mentioned in the letter firing Comey, but then this report says it was in the letter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Comey himself said that in this meeting that Trump said that he agreed, that Comey agreed with him that the Russia investigation should reach a conclusion. And that doesn't sound like a guy trying to obstruct it. He did say I would you to forget about Flynn, he's been punished enough. But I don't see a case for obstruction. But can a case theoretically be made against a president? I don't see the constitutional bar to that."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Jonathan Turley, you must come back. Have a great weekend, always good to see you. And when we come back, are the experts really smarter that you are? A new segment coming up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK, you ready? A new segment where we will regularly feature the good, the bad, and the truly ugly from those geniuses who are paid to know more about all the complicated stuff than the rest of you. You know, they call them the experts. Tonight we focus on the economists and all those financial analysts who are sowing fear and pessimism about President Donald Trump's approach to fiscal matters. On the night Trump was elected, Nobel prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote \"It really does look like President Donald Trump and the markets are plunging. If the question is when the markets will recover? A first pass answer is never.\" Krugman also said \"We are very probably looking at a global recession with no end in sight.\" Andrew Ross Sorkin of The Times predicted the stock market would, quote, \"fall precipitously.\" Just weeks after the president took office, Matthew Barkoff of Carlson Capital in Dallas, he was out there warning Trump might trigger, quote, \"a global depression.\" The Bank of England and several prominent economists also issued their own dire warning. Yet 2017 was the best year for the global economy since 2010. Unemployment in the U.S. has plunged to 4.1 percent and Wall Street hit another record high today. It's an astonishing 62 times it did that last year. And last night The Washington Post tried to cover for all of those horrible predictions by arguing in part that the global markets are just ignoring Trump. Wait a second. You've got to be kidding me. As The Post points out, the U.S. accounts for one quarter of the world's $80 trillion economy. If Trump had truly been that a wrecking ball that all the experts predicted, there would have been a seismic shock in all of the global marketplace. And if you're wondering how Krugman won a Nobel, just remember, so did President Obama and Al Gore and Yasser Arafat. We'll be right back."

      "utterance": "Can we talk? Before we go, a few observations about generation snowflake. I'm not going to claim that I walked to school uphill 10 miles each way in a blizzard. No, I didn't. But somehow we managed to get through these weather events without collapsing or stocking up with 100 rolls of toilet paper. We managed to figure it out. Today in the Washington, D.C., area, Fairfax County D.C., school was either delayed two hours or it was canceled for the second straight day. And why is this? This is what cyclone bomb affects look like in the D.C. areas. Look at that. The grass isn't even covered with snow. Two days of school canceled in northern Virginia. My friends, this is embarrassing. This is pathetic. So before we send the kids out in the morning from now on, I have an idea just to keep them really safe. Why don't we just dress them up in bubble wrap? That way they can comfortably weep in their safe spaces, never getting too hot or too cold again. That's why they didn't have school, it was too cold. What happened to a hat, gloves, and a jacket? Scarves are too dangerous, what a joke. This is my message parents and kids and the school superintendent, suck it up, buttercups. Everyone have a great weekend, roll tide. Shannon is up next. END Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
