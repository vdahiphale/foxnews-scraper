      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. A lot going on, but some big trends, too, when you think about them. You often wonder, what is going on? And for quite some time now, we've wondered what's going on with congressional Republicans, a lot of nice people in the Republican Party. But the point of a political party is not to be nice. It is to represent the interests of its voters. That's the only reason political parties exist in the first place. There's no other reason to have them except to represent their own voters. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yet, year after year on issue after issue, the leadership of the Republican Party fails to represent its voters and we're not guessing about that, we know what Republican voters care about. They tell pollsters all the time. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And since they kept getting ignored, in 2016, they elected Donald Trump just to make it incredibly clear what they cared about. If that wasn't a wake-up call, nothing would be and yet, nothing really changed. It remains true as of right now that the priorities of the people who run the Republican Party are very different. In some cases, completely different from the priorities of the people who vote Republican. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why is that? Well, there are a lot of reasons for it, probably, but Frank Luntz is definitely one of those reasons. Luntz, Dr. Frank Ian Luntz as he is often called at his request, is the Republican Party's longest serving message man. For decades, Frank Luntz has told elected Republicans what to say and precisely how to say it. Luntz's massages language for politicians. He does it now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Just this week, in fact, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the NRCC invited Luntz to Florida for its so-called Policy Summit where he was asked to weigh in on the hot topics. Luntz's job was to tell Republicans, officeholders, people with power, how to think about the most important issues of the day. And we didn't hear the presentation, but there's no doubt it was compelling. Frank Luntz is a smooth salesman. That's why he has been around for a while. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The problem with Frank Luntz is that his views, his personal views are very different from those of your average Republican voter. Frank Luntz is a conventional liberal. His main clients are left-wing corporations like Google. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } When Frank Luntz gives advice to congressional Republicans, he has got Google's perspective in mind. That's a huge problem. We wanted to talk to Luntz about all of this on the show tonight. Nothing personal, but it's interesting, and it's important. So we texted him an invitation this morning, but he did not respond. That's odd, since we've known him well for a long time. In 2019, for example, he tweeted us this greeting, which tells you a lot about the kind of person Frank Luntz is, quote, \"This Thanksgiving, let's give thanks to the men and women of the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Intel Services.\" That's literally what the message says, it's on the screen. Even on Thanksgiving, Frank Luntz takes time to bow before the powerful. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, why does Frank Luntz remain a fixture in Republican politics at a time when the companies he works for are opposed to the Republican Party, explicitly so? Well, in part because he is particularly close to the House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy of California and has been since McCarthy entered politics. In an interview earlier this year, Luntz described Kevin McCarthy is a personal friend. And that relationship gives Frank Luntz outsized influence over the Republican Party's policy positions. The big ones. Take the border crisis. Frank Luntz's view of immigration is very much like Google's view of immigration. America needs a lot more immigration right away, and anyone who disagrees with that is a racist. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, rather than simply say that out loud, rather than make the case for his own opinions, Frank Luntz slyly dresses up his own personal opinions as social science. He'll conduct something called a \"focus group.\" That's a moderated conversation between several people that has in fact, no actual relevance to anything. It's just random people yammering. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Your 90-second exchange with the UPS guy this morning meant more than a Frank Luntz focus group. And yet, purely on the basis of that irrelevant conversation, Luntz manages to make pronouncements about the country and how the Republican Party should respond to it. Most of those pronouncements as you can imagine, tend to comport perfectly with his own views, as well as with the views of Google executives. AXIOS recently reported on Luntz's findings about immigration. So what did Frank Luntz supposedly find out about immigration? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, it turns out according to Frank Luntz that Republican voters in fact, are dying to give amnesty to as many foreign nationals as they possibly can. They're demanding it right away. It's a top priority for them. Watch. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We can debate it. But Frank Luntz doesn't want to debate it, probably why he didn't come on tonight. He wants instead to pretend that his personal opinions are established fact and that the Republican Party had better listen to them and obey. Open borders activists immediately seized upon Luntz's research to justify what they were already doing: keeping the borders open. The National Immigration Forum tweeted out a link right away. \"DACA has bipartisan support,\" the group wrote, pointing to Frank Luntz's opinions posing as research as evidence of that. Passing the DREAM Act is an opportunity to make real meaningful progress. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You see. Amnesty has broad bipartisan support. There's a national consensus in favor of opening the border so Republicans had better get on board because Frank Luntz's research proves they desperately want it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is pretty close to fraud, actually. Who is served by it? That's always the question in Washington. Well, Frank Luntz's corporate clients are served by it, of course, but also the Democratic Party is served by it, a party whose priorities Frank Luntz's appears to support. Here he is back in 2012 telling the rest of us that according to his highly scientific surveys of a dozen people in some shopping mall somewhere, most Americans actually really want the government to take their guns away. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

As we told you a minute ago, Luntz's main business is not helping the Republican Party, no, his main business is working for left-wing companies that despise the Republican Party, are horrified by Republican voters and everything they believe. Frank Luntz's long list of corporate clients include Jeff Bezos's Amazon, Facebook, Nike, Coca-Cola, Disney, Delta Airlines, and the Chamber of Commerce.

Of course, they're his clients. \"This left-wing cancel culture is out of control.\" He wrote mockingly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You've got to wonder if Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines sent him a bonus for that. We don't know, they should have. Either way, toadying for big corporations clearly pays well. Here is Frank Luntz showing off the replica of the Oval Office he had built in his home.",

Look, I don't want to be unfair to Frank Luntz, who is not an evil person, and I don't want to suggest that, and I don't think that he is the cause of the Republican Party's problems.

The leadership of the party? PEDRO GONZALEZ, SENIOR WRITER, \"AMERICAN GREATNESS\": Right. Well, in the 90s, we faced a crime wave and had a consensus about getting tough on crime that worked. It kept people safe. Today, as homicide rates soar to historic highs, we have a consensus from Republicans like Tim Scott with Joe Biden about getting soft on crime in part because guys like Luntz are advising policy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Democrats and their allies are going to continue getting everything that they want until the right learns to fight its own party and demands fighters for it. And I'll give you an overview of what Republicans are up to across the country. In Texas, Republicans, although they have the upper hand over Democrats there, they have sandbagged a transgender sports bill. The Texas Republican legislature is also dragging its feet on passing a bill that would prohibit the chemical castration of minors, and Republicans, excuse me in North Dakota following in the footsteps of Republicans, Asa Hutchinson and Kristi Noem, the Republican Governor there, Doug Burgum has vetoed a transgender sports bill. The Republican-led Senate there then upheld his veto. Recently, Josh Hawley was the only Republican to vote no against lunatic Mazie Hirono's hyper politicized hate crime bill, which of course, Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran was instrumental in putting together. Moran recently got endorsed by Trump, by the way. Republicans also took the idiotic position of condemning the left and Maxine Waters' intimidation of the Chauvin jury, and then celebrating the outcome of that trial and promising more soft on crime policies, which is the same exact thing the Democratic Party wants. And I don't think that it was an accident that on Wednesday night, when Tim Scott responded to Joe Biden, he had one short insubstantial, throwaway line about immigration, because congressional Republicans right now are talking with the Democratic Party about putting together an amnesty deal.",

But if we're talking specifically on the issue of prisons, it came to my attention recently that there's a man who is accusing the State of Georgia for being negligent in protecting him in a men's prison, because he is claiming that he was raped by men in the men's prison. Now, I want to be very clear here, if that happened, that is horrible. And there's a Federal law on the books called the Prison Rape Elimination Act and its goal is to eliminate rape in prison. And if in fact, this man was raped in a men's prison, then he has every right to complain and to sue and to hold the Georgia prison officials accountable. Now, the difference here is that the man who is presenting this claim, quote-unquote, \"identifies as a woman\" or claims to have, quote, \"transgender status.\" And that phrase, \"transgender status\" has come to be in our public conversation quite frequently these days, because in part of some things that the Biden administration has done. But what I want to know is the Federal Department of Justice has weighed in on this man's case arguing that this man who was raped in a men's prison allegedly, again, if he did, if he was, then he has every right to complain about that. But the answer is not to transfer him into a women's prison and the Biden administration, the Justice Department is arguing that he should and what I want to know is, where is the Justice Department when it comes to a woman who was allegedly raped in a women's prison in the State of Washington by a man who the State of Washington was housing in the women's prison on the basis of his so-called transgender status? I also want to know where is the Biden administration when it comes in to reporting a woman in an Illinois prison who was allegedly raped by a man who was being held in the women's prison on the basis of his transgender status. I would also like to know, where is the Biden administration? Where's the Justice Department when it comes to the State of California, and the literally 261 applications that came from male prisoners to be held in a California women's prison between January and March of this year? Two hundred and sixty one between January and March of this year is approximately three a day, applications filed by male prisoners to be held in women's prison on the basis of their so-called transgender status.

      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. A lot going on, but some big trends, too, when you think about them. You often wonder, what is going on? And for quite some time now, we've wondered what's going on with congressional Republicans, a lot of nice people in the Republican Party. But the point of a political party is not to be nice. It is to represent the interests of its voters. That's the only reason political parties exist in the first place. There's no other reason to have them except to represent their own voters. Yet, year after year on issue after issue, the leadership of the Republican Party fails to represent its voters and we're not guessing about that, we know what Republican voters care about. They tell pollsters all the time. And since they kept getting ignored, in 2016, they elected Donald Trump just to make it incredibly clear what they cared about. If that wasn't a wake-up call, nothing would be and yet, nothing really changed. It remains true as of right now that the priorities of the people who run the Republican Party are very different. In some cases, completely different from the priorities of the people who vote Republican. Why is that? Well, there are a lot of reasons for it, probably, but Frank Luntz is definitely one of those reasons. Luntz, Dr. Frank Ian Luntz as he is often called at his request, is the Republican Party's longest serving message man. For decades, Frank Luntz has told elected Republicans what to say and precisely how to say it. Luntz's massages language for politicians. He does it now. Just this week, in fact, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the NRCC invited Luntz to Florida for its so-called Policy Summit where he was asked to weigh in on the hot topics. Luntz's job was to tell Republicans, officeholders, people with power, how to think about the most important issues of the day. And we didn't hear the presentation, but there's no doubt it was compelling. Frank Luntz is a smooth salesman. That's why he has been around for a while. The problem with Frank Luntz is that his views, his personal views are very different from those of your average Republican voter. Frank Luntz is a conventional liberal. His main clients are left-wing corporations like Google. When Frank Luntz gives advice to congressional Republicans, he has got Google's perspective in mind. That's a huge problem. We wanted to talk to Luntz about all of this on the show tonight. Nothing personal, but it's interesting, and it's important. So we texted him an invitation this morning, but he did not respond. That's odd, since we've known him well for a long time. In 2019, for example, he tweeted us this greeting, which tells you a lot about the kind of person Frank Luntz is, quote, \"This Thanksgiving, let's give thanks to the men and women of the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the Intel Services.\" That's literally what the message says, it's on the screen. Even on Thanksgiving, Frank Luntz takes time to bow before the powerful. So, why does Frank Luntz remain a fixture in Republican politics at a time when the companies he works for are opposed to the Republican Party, explicitly so? Well, in part because he is particularly close to the House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy of California and has been since McCarthy entered politics. In an interview earlier this year, Luntz described Kevin McCarthy is a personal friend. And that relationship gives Frank Luntz outsized influence over the Republican Party's policy positions. The big ones. Take the border crisis. Frank Luntz's view of immigration is very much like Google's view of immigration. America needs a lot more immigration right away, and anyone who disagrees with that is a racist. Now, rather than simply say that out loud, rather than make the case for his own opinions, Frank Luntz slyly dresses up his own personal opinions as social science. He'll conduct something called a \"focus group.\" That's a moderated conversation between several people that has in fact, no actual relevance to anything. It's just random people yammering. Your 90-second exchange with the UPS guy this morning meant more than a Frank Luntz focus group. And yet, purely on the basis of that irrelevant conversation, Luntz manages to make pronouncements about the country and how the Republican Party should respond to it. Most of those pronouncements as you can imagine, tend to comport perfectly with his own views, as well as with the views of Google executives. AXIOS recently reported on Luntz's findings about immigration. So what did Frank Luntz supposedly find out about immigration? Well, it turns out according to Frank Luntz that Republican voters in fact, are dying to give amnesty to as many foreign nationals as they possibly can. They're demanding it right away. It's a top priority for them. Watch."

We need these people. Now, that may be entirely true, or maybe it's not true. We can debate it. But Frank Luntz doesn't want to debate it, probably why he didn't come on tonight. He wants instead to pretend that his personal opinions are established fact and that the Republican Party had better listen to them and obey."

Passing the DREAM Act is an opportunity to make real meaningful progress. You see. Amnesty has broad bipartisan support. There's a national consensus in favor of opening the border so Republicans had better get on board because Frank Luntz's research proves they desperately want it. This is pretty close to fraud, actually. Who is served by it? That's always the question in Washington. Well, Frank Luntz's corporate clients are served by it, of course, but also the Democratic Party is served by it, a party whose priorities Frank Luntz's appears to support. Here he is back in 2012 telling the rest of us that according to his highly scientific surveys of a dozen people in some shopping mall somewhere, most Americans actually really want the government to take their guns away."

Most Americans are for that. Who does that sound like? It sounds a lot like Joe Biden, a man Frank Luntz has been friends with for a long time. Check out the note from Frank Luntz to Hunter Biden on Hunter's laptop. What you just heard in that clip were Democratic Party talking points. If you'd like more, there's this. This is an interview from last summer, in which Frank Luntz explains that the phrase \"law and order\" is somehow offensive to most Americans. Keep in mind that at the very moment Frank Luntz was saying this, American cities were on fire. People were dying. Why? Because there was no law and no order."

If that sounds a lot like something a corporate H.R. executive might say, you should not be surprised by that. As we told you a minute ago, Luntz's main business is not helping the Republican Party, no, his main business is working for left-wing companies that despise the Republican Party, are horrified by Republican voters and everything they believe. Frank Luntz's long list of corporate clients include Jeff Bezos's Amazon, Facebook, Nike, Coca-Cola, Disney, Delta Airlines, and the Chamber of Commerce. These are the people who pay Frank Luntz's bills. In his spare time, Frank Luntz tells Kevin McCarthy how to run the Republican Party. Now, you can do one, you can't do both. You can see the conflict here. And you wonder, how has this been allowed to continue?"

Of course, they're his clients. \"This left-wing cancel culture is out of control.\" He wrote mockingly. You've got to wonder if Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines sent him a bonus for that. We don't know, they should have. Either way, toadying for big corporations clearly pays well. Here is Frank Luntz showing off the replica of the Oval Office he had built in his home."

The question to ask, what's really going on here? Would you take medical advice for example from Frank Luntz? Should you have to? If you've listened to him recently, he very much wants you to take the vaccine. Vaccines are great. Only a crazy person wouldn't get the shot. Frank Luntz hasn't said a lot, however, about his longtime work for Pfizer. Hmm, that's weird. Nor does he brag about his work for Purdue Pharma. Remember that company? Purdue Pharma, those are the people that got rural America addicted to opioids. Kind of wrecked the center of the country. In 2003, as the opioid epidemic devastated the entire regions of the United States, Frank Luntz encouraged people to take more OxyContin. Are we making this up? No, we're not. Quote: \"I am a proponent of the pharmaceutical industry.\" Frank Luntz told PBS. \"I'm a supporter of a very famous medication right now, OxyContin, because I think that this is a miracle drug which allows people to get through the day.\" Now some people, Frank Luntz acknowledged, quote, \" ... want to see OxyContin taken off the market,\" but not Frank Luntz. He was taking money from Purdue Pharma, quote: \"I believe that there are things worth fighting for.\" Yes. Apparently. A lawsuit filed against Purdue Pharma by the State of Massachusetts in 2019 includes multiple references to Frank Luntz. According to that suit, Luntz and his company helped Purdue Pharma devise ways of quote, \"deflecting blame\" from Purdue's addictive drugs by stigmatizing people who become addictive. The State of Vermont filed a similar lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, and it also mentioned Frank Luntz. According to those lawsuits, Luntz proposed that Purdue Pharma adopt a strategy of emphasizing some quote, \"key messages that work.\" By the way, those words were spelled in all caps for emphasis. One of those messages and we're quoting, \"It's not addiction, it's abuse. It's about personal responsibility.\" Right? So your 19-year-old just died of a drug OD after Purdue Pharma flooded your town with addictive narcotics, but stop complaining. It's her fault she died. It's about personal responsibility. This is the guy Republican leaders just went to this week for quote, \"messaging guidance on hot topics.\" And you wonder why you no longer recognize the party that you vote for. Pedro Gonzalez is a senior writer with \"American Greatness.\" He joins us tonight. Pedro, thanks so much for coming on. Look, I don't want to be unfair to Frank Luntz, who is not an evil person, and I don't want to suggest that, and I don't think that he is the cause of the Republican Party's problems. I do think however, he's a symptom, clearly a symptom of them. What does the party's reliance on Frank Luntz who is a liberal tell you about their priorities? The leadership of the party? PEDRO GONZALEZ, SENIOR WRITER, \"AMERICAN GREATNESS\": Right. Well, in the 90s, we faced a crime wave and had a consensus about getting tough on crime that worked. It kept people safe. Today, as homicide rates soar to historic highs, we have a consensus from Republicans like Tim Scott with Joe Biden about getting soft on crime in part because guys like Luntz are advising policy. Democrats and their allies are going to continue getting everything that they want until the right learns to fight its own party and demands fighters for it. And I'll give you an overview of what Republicans are up to across the country. In Texas, Republicans, although they have the upper hand over Democrats there, they have sandbagged a transgender sports bill. The Texas Republican legislature is also dragging its feet on passing a bill that would prohibit the chemical castration of minors, and Republicans, excuse me in North Dakota following in the footsteps of Republicans, Asa Hutchinson and Kristi Noem, the Republican Governor there, Doug Burgum has vetoed a transgender sports bill. The Republican-led Senate there then upheld his veto. Recently, Josh Hawley was the only Republican to vote no against lunatic Mazie Hirono's hyper politicized hate crime bill, which of course, Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran was instrumental in putting together. Moran recently got endorsed by Trump, by the way. Republicans also took the idiotic position of condemning the left and Maxine Waters' intimidation of the Chauvin jury, and then celebrating the outcome of that trial and promising more soft on crime policies, which is the same exact thing the Democratic Party wants. And I don't think that it was an accident that on Wednesday night, when Tim Scott responded to Joe Biden, he had one short insubstantial, throwaway line about immigration, because congressional Republicans right now are talking with the Democratic Party about putting together an amnesty deal."

Let's just assume this is some sort of adversarial or foreign technology that several decades now has managed to leapfrog us and invade all 18 members of the Intelligence Community despite our best human intelligence signals, intelligence imagery, intelligence, yada, yada, yada, yada, right?

I thought Lue made a very solid point and I'm embarrassed I hadn't thought of it before which is this is among other things, whatever these objects are, a potentially very grave threat to nation states.

But if we're talking specifically on the issue of prisons, it came to my attention recently that there's a man who is accusing the State of Georgia for being negligent in protecting him in a men's prison, because he is claiming that he was raped by men in the men's prison. Now, I want to be very clear here, if that happened, that is horrible. And there's a Federal law on the books called the Prison Rape Elimination Act and its goal is to eliminate rape in prison. And if in fact, this man was raped in a men's prison, then he has every right to complain and to sue and to hold the Georgia prison officials accountable. Now, the difference here is that the man who is presenting this claim, quote-unquote, \"identifies as a woman\" or claims to have, quote, \"transgender status.\" And that phrase, \"transgender status\" has come to be in our public conversation quite frequently these days, because in part of some things that the Biden administration has done. But what I want to know is the Federal Department of Justice has weighed in on this man's case arguing that this man who was raped in a men's prison allegedly, again, if he did, if he was, then he has every right to complain about that. But the answer is not to transfer him into a women's prison and the Biden administration, the Justice Department is arguing that he should and what I want to know is, where is the Justice Department when it comes to a woman who was allegedly raped in a women's prison in the State of Washington by a man who the State of Washington was housing in the women's prison on the basis of his so-called transgender status? I also want to know where is the Biden administration when it comes in to reporting a woman in an Illinois prison who was allegedly raped by a man who was being held in the women's prison on the basis of his transgender status. I would also like to know, where is the Biden administration? Where's the Justice Department when it comes to the State of California, and the literally 261 applications that came from male prisoners to be held in a California women's prison between January and March of this year? Two hundred and sixty one between January and March of this year is approximately three a day, applications filed by male prisoners to be held in women's prison on the basis of their so-called transgender status.

And let's not forget immigration being front and center. And they want to actually memory hole Trump and the issues that he stood for an act like it never happened, when in fact, that's where most of the base is. You don't have 95 percent approval rating inside the base unless what you're promoting and the issues that you're talking about are popular with the base. There's a massive disconnect in which those inside the Republican -- leading the Republican Party view a lot of the voters and a lot of the base as they are useful idiots. Just put us back in power and then we're going to do whatever we want, whatever our corporate and donor class want us to do. You're just the useful idiots that put us back into power.

Some of these senators that have not actually been America First, they're going to get a shot at them in the primary. But the real question becomes, Tucker, are there going to be enough members in the House and Senate elected to actually enforce new leadership? No more Mitch McConnell, no more Kevin McCarthy. Let's have real America First leadership in the House and the Senate and then let's get a real America First back in the White House.
