Well, immediately after the show aired for the first time, its sponsor Coca Cola was flooded, inundated with notes of appreciation from thankful viewers. It was precisely what was needed at the time, a simple message in a child's voice reminding us that the season isn't about fancy trees or gifts beneath them. It's about the birth of the savior, Christ the lord. It's doubtful that any major network would green light a special like this today. It would be deemed too offensive or divisive or non-inclusive. Atheists would probably protest or sue. That's a real shame for our audience that is craving meaningful programming that speaks to the best of who we are and our most cherished values. But at least we will always have Linus. We'll be right back.",

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington. The president is poised to sign his historic tax cuts into law tomorrow. We'll tell you how he has reshaped the GOP straight ahead in \"The Angle.\" Plus, we will expose the strategy behind those frenzied Democratic warnings that the president shouldn't fire special prosecutor Mueller. And the Justice Department is asking the FBI some very tough questions about their investigation of that shady Uranium One Deal involving the Clintons. And at the U.N., the world condemning the United States for moving its own Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, but the president is taking names. A lot of people on that naughty list. So, what's his next move? And did Hollywood really just make a major film about the ultimate Kennedy scandal? We'll tell you which one. But, first, Trump, the great GOP unifier that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Do you remember those headlines about how Trump was going to irreversibly divide and destroy the GOP? Oh, there they are. Well, it turns out that the president may well be on his way to healing those divisions. Well, sure, there are still some policy disagreements, on the big issues, the unity of spirit and purpose is kind of remarkable, and it needs to be acknowledged. You think about where the GOP was in let's say 2008 or 2012, early 2016. And now think about where it is today. Once upon a time, the Republican leadership had little regard and minimal respect for the real estate mogul who crashed their party. Just remember the kinds of things the GOP leadership had said about Trump."

I was told by multiple congressional sources that the president worked the phones tirelessly to get this tax bill done for the American people. He has been intimately involved in remaking trade policy to benefit the American worker as well, and, of course, his efforts to revive the economy seem to be paying off. Home sales hit their highest level in 10 years. Stock market breaking all kind of records and, of course, he delivered that tax break. Everybody loves a winner and now the president has turned some of his fiercest critics into allies. Listen to them now."

      "utterance": "Not only is that a stunning reversal of their view of the president's style, but he has converted them or at least cowed them on a number of key issues. So, for instance, when is the last time a prominent Republican really complained about Trump's efforts to renegotiate NAFTA or challenge China? And in case you didn't notice Mitch McConnell now sounds like Jeff Sessions on immigration. Defying expectations again, the president has pulled his party toward the conservative populist movement that swept him in to office. His detractors are now realizing that the Trump way is the only way forward. It's finally, finally dawned on them. There is simply no constituency for the GOP of open borders, endless wars, and those lopsided trade deals. You want to know who the dividers are today in the GOP? I will tell you who they are. You see them there. The Bushes, Jeff Flake, Mitt Romney, and other bitter globalists whose time has frankly come and gone. Like the ghosts of Christmas past, they're wandering the halls, making noises but no one is listening. This is a Trumpian party now. And that's THE ANGLE. To discuss, I'm joined by Fox News contributor and former Congressman Jason Chaffetz in Utah and here in the studio in Washington is Attorney Richard Goodstein, who has advised most Democratic presidential candidates going back to 1984. And in New York, Guy Benson, political editor of townhall.com and a Fox News contributor. Great to see all of you. Merry Christmas, happy holidays. So, Richard, you just heard THE ANGLE. What do you think? He was going to be this guy who ripped the party apart, divisive, brash, all those things. But to see what happened yesterday, with all of these former detractors and you saw just a smattering of them. What a reversal?"

Everything they said, all the tape they ran about ObamaCare, you could replay now. OK? But they got it done. It's wildly unpopular. Just like he is, historically so. So, I mean, you know, in the generic ballot, Democrats are way ahead. I think we have to kind of see what's going to happen in the 28 elections, pretty much every single election that's happened since Donald Trump has won has been plus 20 or so for the Democrats."

They lost, they lost big, Hillary Clinton's numbers are even lower. If the race were won again, Donald Trump would win by even bigger numbers. He did help unite the party. After the Republicans did the proverbial political face plant by blowing it on Obamacare, they finally realized that maybe we ought to come together and the president did work hard behind the scenes. And the Democrats, what are they going to run on? We figured taxes should be higher. How dare the Republicans cut your taxes? They have got nothing to run on other than generic ballot."

He comes in and he is hammering people for when are you going to get me a bill? What are you going to do on this?

Not just for the Republican Party, but for the American people and for long held conservative goals. This a tax cut for 80 percent of Americans. This is major tax cut for corporations to make our numbers way more competitive in the world. That's something even Obama was for and Democrats all skedaddled Trump championing that idea now. But also in the bill was getting rid of Obamacare's individual mandate. That's a huge deal, drilling in ANWR. Republican after that forever and they got it in one bill."

If what he did on ANWR, the tax bill, the deregulation, Gorsuch, 12 circuit judges if that's not conservative, I don't know what is conservative. I worked for President Reagan. That's stuff is pretty conservative, don't you think? Well, the judges I think are probably the absolute highlight of the presidency so far. One other point, Laura, I think you have to evaluate everything that the administration does, action by action. There has been a lot of the good things recently today, Nikki Haley's speech, I know you are going to get to it later in the show. That speech standing up for American interest before the U.N. was like a fist pump moment. That was awesome. That was powerful. That was moral courage and clarity. That's a high point ending the year for the Trump administration. So, yes, I'm a Trump skeptical conservative, but I'm not going to sit here and close my eyes to big important victories and we have several to cheer about."

The Democrats are happy they won those. Let's move to what the resistance is planning all of you. There was a hilarious piece in the L.A. Times today. I screamed laughing like at 9:00 in the morning when I was doing my radio show. The title is protesters stash bull horns and hot chocolate just in case Trump fires Mueller. All right. Jason, I have got to go to you on this. I'm not kidding you in Washington, Houston, L.A., they have resistance headquarters and dashing off their signs and their little supplies, their power bars because they actually think Donald Trump is going to fire Mueller and they want to be ready for the moment.

I thought we were supposed to be dead from net neutrality being repealed. Look, I agree. If Trump fires Mueller, that will touch off protest not just from the hard left. I don't think Trump is going to do it. It's not in his interest. It's going to look terrible. All we sit here and talk about is Trump going to fire Mueller over and over again.

They are actually hoping he will do just that. Now that the credibility of the Russia probe is tarnished after all the bombshell reporting we have been doing on this show. Across a couple of great news outlets, the anti-Trump bias of the investigators is off the charts firing Mueller may be the Democrats only hope at this point. There is only one problem for them. The president isn't falling for it. He outsmarts them every time.

You just wrote a piece that things you are concerned about in this investigation. You still respect Mueller and Rosenstein. You have some issues, but I want to start on this dramatic dire series of warnings we are hearing from the Democrats about firing Mueller. The president said he is not going to fire Mueller.

We hear from the White House's lawyers and president's lawyers not going to do it would just be terrible. We don't need another Saturday night massacre. Should Bob Mueller have been appointed? It's a serious question. I would say in May we should not have a special counsel. We over criminalize so much of life and our politics together. We need to stop that.

They are wrong about firing Mueller. They have just been wrong. It's not because I am smarter than they're that I have been right and they've been wrong. They put hope over reality. I'm just an analyst. I'm calling it as I see it. It's easy to be right if you are objective and call it the way it is. I think what's happening the both sides are playing the refs. Trump side is playing smarter. What they are doing is keeping pressure on Mueller. They are questioning his integrity. They are challenging whether he had conflicts of interest. They are questioning whether he should have gotten a warrant. They are hoping that since they are putting pressure on him, he has such concern about his reputation that he may lean over backwards in a close case to support the Trump side, and the other side of playing the refs. They are just saying if we push hard enough and say he is going to fire him, he is going to fire him, he is going to fire him, maybe we will goad him into firing him.

So, I'm very deeply concerned about the timing. President Clinton's speech for half a million dollars in Russia the Russia connection. I have always been in favor of transparency.

Russia's involvement in economy and then make recommendations from how to stop Russia from influencing our democracy.

The idea of Clinton getting half a million dollars, George Bush the 1st got fees like that when he spoke in Japan. Former presidents get, big, big fees when they speak.

And 128 countries voted for the resolution, Just nine states bravely opposed it, and 35 milquetoast abstained. Let's analyze it with Lawrence Korb who was assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration and is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and in New York, Carrie Sheffield a political analyst and former reporter for \"Politico\" and \"The Hill.\" Great to see both of you. Larry, let's go to you. We had Clinton, Obama, Bush, all said they were going to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. A big deal for them to say it, a big deal to pledge it, they didn't do it. Trump does it and they go bananas at the U.N. today."

Basically you have got a lot of other countries, Arab countries in the region who have established relations with Israel. The other problem that Trump was by threatening people to do stuff and then he is not going to do it. There is no way he is going to cut off aid to Iraq or Afghanistan, Egypt and Jordan. Even the Israelis don't want him to do that. So I think twice you undermine American credibility and American ability to get things done."

Laura, you heard it here, in my opinion Nikki Haley's speech was the iron lady. It was the American modern day iron lady. I was so proud of her. It was amazing.

They said no. This is what the Memphis city council did. They decided to turn the parks, the two parks where these statues are, into private property. They gave the mayor permission to sell the public park to a private 501C3. They did that in one day in the morning. That afternoon they were lifting the statues off."

The show aired 52 years ago on December 9th, 1965, and it remains one of the most popular Christmas specials in television history. But do you know the one scene that almost didn't make the final cut because network execs were worried it would turn viewers off? The one that was the most touching, the most moving, and the most enduring of all, the one where Linus reads the story of the nativity from the book of Luke to a Charlie Brown who had forgotten the true meaning of Christmas."

And there were the same country shepherd abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by light. Lo, the angel of the lord came upon them. The glory of the lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, \"Fear not, for behold I bring you tidings of great joy which will be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David a savior, Jesus Christ the lord. And this shall be a sign unto you, you shall fine the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in the manger.\" And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men. That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown."

As radio host Lee Habeeb recently reminded us, \"Peanuts\" creator Charles Schultz pushed back against the network suits who were upset about that scene, and even some of his collaborators, and he insisted that it not be cut. Schultz was not only a creative genius, but he was a Sunday school teacher and he knew the American audience. Well, immediately after the show aired for the first time, its sponsor Coca Cola was flooded, inundated with notes of appreciation from thankful viewers. It was precisely what was needed at the time, a simple message in a child's voice reminding us that the season isn't about fancy trees or gifts beneath them. It's about the birth of the savior, Christ the lord. It's doubtful that any major network would green light a special like this today. It would be deemed too offensive or divisive or non-inclusive. Atheists would probably protest or sue. That's a real shame for our audience that is craving meaningful programming that speaks to the best of who we are and our most cherished values. But at least we will always have Linus. We'll be right back."
