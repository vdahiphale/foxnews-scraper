According to Ben Rhodes, in 2009 when Obama went to Riyadh, the Saudi king gave each staffer a pile of jewels and the first couple got a hundred thousand pounds worth of bubbles which were accepted and then sent to the national archives. That beats a washer and dryer on Price is Right. But even back then we knew Saudi Arabia, they were different but they were allies and allies can suck. So may be the bosses' son had Khashoggi off or maybe not, which is it? Think hard. It's a card game.

Middle East progress, a chance for peace in Palestine and Israel, the ability to influence oil prices, who knows? For sure it will be more than a pile of dumb jewels. All right, Dana, this is another example of what I say we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.

We're not going to do that. And so, his lawyer is Bill Burke. He's being represented -- Bill Burke -- full disclosure, a good friend of mine.

OK, fine. Like, we're not going to do that. And they move on. When they say that this is what happens in a dictatorship, no, what happens in a dictatorship is that the prosecution actually happens.

It's just so interesting that now the New York Times has gone from stories where they actually thought they were going to find collusion. Now they've decided, well, we didn't find the collusion we've been looking for. So now they're writing outrage stories about things he might have said that might have happened, and now you have cable news heads exploding over this. I don't see the story. He didn't prosecute anybody.  He didn't do anything about it. It's not a story if somebody says, oh, yeah, I'm going to do this and then nothing actually happens.

Oh, these are his adversaries. He was saying it because he had legitimate concerns about Hillary Clinton and bleaching a server, and taking a hammer to a server and saying, listen, I gonna -- you know, I think this should be looked into.  And that was a point that resonated with every American sitting at home saying what Comey did seems unreasonable. What she did seems unreasonable.  And it was a selling point for him to say this doesn't look right how this went down and I think it should be looked into.

His venting is defined by thinking out loud and wondering of what possibilities is out there that could solve something that bugs him. And then somebody says something to him and he goes OK. Then he finds something else. Trump is a salesman and a businessman. And what do you do when you enter a new job? You ask a bunch of questions. Some of the questions are incredibly stupid. And that is why Donald Trump is different than anybody in the media, because the media is too insecure to ask stupid questions. It's almost a superhero power that Trump has, his willingness not to feel shame when he's wrong and when he asks a dumb question. Hey, can I prosecute her? You can't prosecute her. Oh, OK. There's this kind of amnesia that I read about where you forget whatever it's absorb that same day, so every new day is new. The media has Trump amnesia. They wake up every day as if it's the first day of the presidency and they freak out. In fact, I don't know why his critics are so fat, because they're always up in arms. They should be so fit. They should be so fit because they're always like this, screaming. They should be like on the cover of Men's Health. Instead, they're just bloated.

If you erase Trump from today, you'd have the largest peacetime expansion probably in history. Dramatic declines in poverty and violence worldwide. Aside from Syria, Afghanistan, things are looking pretty good. There's a lot of prosperity. There's a lot of fresh ideas and new technology. It's a simpler but somehow complicated life with technology. So my point is, despite this, there's a sense of doom around the corner. Everybody thinks something awful is happening even though the physical evidence is telling you there's optimism everywhere and the reason is it's because all of this is a psychological problem.

So now you're pissed off over the Saudis after decades of human right abuses and terror enabling? This is what gets your goat? According to Ben Rhodes, in 2009 when Obama went to Riyadh, the Saudi king gave each staffer a pile of jewels and the first couple got a hundred thousand pounds worth of bubbles which were accepted and then sent to the national archives. That beats a washer and dryer on Price is Right. But even back then we knew Saudi Arabia, they were different but they were allies and allies can suck. So may be the bosses' son had Khashoggi off or maybe not, which is it? Think hard. It's a card game. If you say the prince is guilty, you're committing poker suicide by folding while holding all the best cards. Sure, playing your moral ace might please everyone in the media, but winning their approval wins American nothing. It's just waste of great opportunity. But hold off and say maybe, maybe not. Maybe not, you come out ahead and the pot you want to win impact your country's happiness. If you spent your life playing this game, keeping your cards close and waiting, you know America has the Saudis over a barrel, millions of barrels, really. And in negotiations that means you can get something big from them that you couldn't get before. Like what? Middle East progress, a chance for peace in Palestine and Israel, the ability to influence oil prices, who knows? For sure it will be more than a pile of dumb jewels. All right, Dana, this is another example of what I say we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens. Like if the Saudis don't offer America something really big, then you can go back in six months and say they killed that guy. He can't hurt -- he's got that option."

So if he wants to maintain that this a strategic ally, if he wants to come at it from the angle of a businessman, I think that's all OK to an extent, but you have to acknowledge that there's a whole bunch of people looking at this that want the message sent that if a regime violates human rights extensively they expect an American president to have a reaction to that that's substantial and makes you feel like, you know, he cares about our economic interests but he also cares about the value of the whole country - -"
