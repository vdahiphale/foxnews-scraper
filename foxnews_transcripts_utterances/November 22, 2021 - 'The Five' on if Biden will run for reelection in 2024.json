You see a guy who looks pretty measured, open-minded, and thoughtful person. And when you look at him testify too, what do you see? You see someone who scared for their life, crying real tears. And honestly someone who was there in Kenosha that night to help, not to harm. But the media makes him look like some vigilante who is on some racist killing spree just using his white tears in order to literally beat the murder up. So why do we have this? So, it's because they do character assassination and psychological warfare. This kid is 17, turned his whole phone over to the prosecution. Now a phone is really a window into someone's personality. At 17, the prosecution didn't bring up a meme, a group text, an account that he was following, there was nothing to make this kid look racially motivated at all. Yet the media, knowing this, still continue to slander him as a white supremacist. That's malicious and reckless obviously. And then it's the drumbeat of lies. That this guy state lines with an illegal assault rifle to, you know, vigilante justice. These are debunked lies. So that's basically a disinformation campaign on the American people. They are laying siege to the American people's brain. And that's the most toxic thing you can do to a population. And so, the American people now know this. And they are basically going through a detox of mainstream media. They are cleansing. They are taking CNN out of their diet. They're taking MSNBC out of their diet. Now when they're presented with facts from a reputable source, they don't trust that, they are suspicious of these facts. They're broken up with them. We are on their own, we are single now. We're going to do our own journalism. We are going to look online and we're going to find the facts for ourselves. And then it's a huge shift in the way this country has gone. And that's why the legacy media is so scared because they can see their power falling away and they've become so desperate in trying to hold it on. And that's how you see the lies keep piling up.",

He, in talking about prosecutorial misconduct, but at the same time talking about the right to self-defense and articulating it so well from what I've seen so far. And testifying brilliantly the better than probably any witness I've seen in 30 years. We realize that this kid in the future, may have a lot to offer in terms of society. As long as he uses his life in a way that he is shown us that he would as a police explorer and a fire cadet. And someone who is a life guard and someone who wanted to be a medic. I think he is a giving kid. I think that what's not giving is the media. The media will never forgive this young man. They will never allow him to live the life that he wants to lead. He will never be safe. There are people who believe that he is a white supremacist, that we are all white supremacists. That the jurors I'm sure are all white supremacist, the judge and every one of us are white supremacist. And I feel badly for him, because I think he's not going to be able to live a normal life in that regard. But having said all of that, the law, the facts, the evidence were clear. This is a classic case of self-defense. And what's better than anything I have seen is the video. And we are now in an age where technology is giving us a bird's-eye view of what is happening to crime or to crime victims and crime on the street. We are seeing them in real time, we are seeing what they are doing. We've got witnesses with phones.

And it's proven time and time again. That's like, that's just what people do. What they are saying, those talking heads, are that white people want to hurt you. I mean, that's what they -- I mean, it's like they are roaming the world. But anyway -- you know, there will be critics that say, do not make Rittenhouse into a hero. And I get it. But these are the people that have been kept saying that Jacob Blake was an unarmed good Samaritan helping out his family. This is from the people who are engaging or encouraging people to march on behalf of a dead pedophile. You know, there are two people that died at the hands of Kyle Rittenhouse. The disturbing trend is not how happy we are that they died, but how little their crimes mattered to the left and to the people that are calling them, you know, martyrs and something. These were not black activists. One was a pedophile; another was a spouse abuser. These are the worst people on the planet. And they went after the wrong guy and they paid for it. This is why the media keeps asking the same question, if Kyle was black would he be treated differently? We've heard that from a lot of people. But those are people who are using their only singular race lens. If Kyle -- the fact is, if Kyle was black, he would be our nominee for the president for 2024, because we see everything through the self-defense lens. We don't -- we -- everybody here on this table it's like -- where are my glasses? It's like we're the optometrist where we're looking at an issue we got better? Is this better? Is this better?",

That's why everybody on MSNBC and their viewers were shocked that this verdict was such a surprise, because how could this be? Didn't he killed two black people? Isn't he a white supremacist? How did -- how did this happen in this unjust world? It's because no, because you are relying on the one race lens. If you had a number of other ones at your behest, if you have those self-defense lens, you could have actually seen this.

They might be going after that person. I might be with my son or my daughter. And I may try to restrain him or her and asked him to please stop.

But that's not the least of it. This guy, in all of these charges, he's a batterer, he's a drug addict, he's been carrying a gun since he was 18 years old and then he got all the benefits of the criminal justice system.

      "utterance": "It's eye opening, let's put it that way. So, when you watch Rittenhouse on Tucker, you don't see the way the media has characterized. You see a guy who looks pretty measured, open-minded, and thoughtful person. And when you look at him testify too, what do you see? You see someone who scared for their life, crying real tears. And honestly someone who was there in Kenosha that night to help, not to harm. But the media makes him look like some vigilante who is on some racist killing spree just using his white tears in order to literally beat the murder up. So why do we have this? So, it's because they do character assassination and psychological warfare. This kid is 17, turned his whole phone over to the prosecution. Now a phone is really a window into someone's personality. At 17, the prosecution didn't bring up a meme, a group text, an account that he was following, there was nothing to make this kid look racially motivated at all. Yet the media, knowing this, still continue to slander him as a white supremacist. That's malicious and reckless obviously. And then it's the drumbeat of lies. That this guy state lines with an illegal assault rifle to, you know, vigilante justice. These are debunked lies. So that's basically a disinformation campaign on the American people. They are laying siege to the American people's brain. And that's the most toxic thing you can do to a population. And so, the American people now know this. And they are basically going through a detox of mainstream media. They are cleansing. They are taking CNN out of their diet. They're taking MSNBC out of their diet. Now when they're presented with facts from a reputable source, they don't trust that, they are suspicious of these facts. They're broken up with them. We are on their own, we are single now. We're going to do our own journalism. We are going to look online and we're going to find the facts for ourselves. And then it's a huge shift in the way this country has gone. And that's why the legacy media is so scared because they can see their power falling away and they've become so desperate in trying to hold it on. And that's how you see the lies keep piling up."

      "utterance": "You know, I think that when you watch Kyle Rittenhouse you see a young boy who's turned into a man after a course of events that would change any of us. He, in talking about prosecutorial misconduct, but at the same time talking about the right to self-defense and articulating it so well from what I've seen so far. And testifying brilliantly the better than probably any witness I've seen in 30 years. We realize that this kid in the future, may have a lot to offer in terms of society. As long as he uses his life in a way that he is shown us that he would as a police explorer and a fire cadet. And someone who is a life guard and someone who wanted to be a medic. I think he is a giving kid. I think that what's not giving is the media. The media will never forgive this young man. They will never allow him to live the life that he wants to lead. He will never be safe. There are people who believe that he is a white supremacist, that we are all white supremacists. That the jurors I'm sure are all white supremacist, the judge and every one of us are white supremacist. And I feel badly for him, because I think he's not going to be able to live a normal life in that regard. But having said all of that, the law, the facts, the evidence were clear. This is a classic case of self-defense. And what's better than anything I have seen is the video. And we are now in an age where technology is giving us a bird's-eye view of what is happening to crime or to crime victims and crime on the street. We are seeing them in real time, we are seeing what they are doing. We've got witnesses with phones. We are now closer to justice than we've ever been in the history of this country where we had to rely on people's memories, et cetera, et cetera."

And it's proven time and time again. That's like, that's just what people do. What they are saying, those talking heads, are that white people want to hurt you. I mean, that's what they -- I mean, it's like they are roaming the world. But anyway -- you know, there will be critics that say, do not make Rittenhouse into a hero. And I get it. But these are the people that have been kept saying that Jacob Blake was an unarmed good Samaritan helping out his family. This is from the people who are engaging or encouraging people to march on behalf of a dead pedophile. You know, there are two people that died at the hands of Kyle Rittenhouse. The disturbing trend is not how happy we are that they died, but how little their crimes mattered to the left and to the people that are calling them, you know, martyrs and something. These were not black activists. One was a pedophile; another was a spouse abuser. These are the worst people on the planet. And they went after the wrong guy and they paid for it. This is why the media keeps asking the same question, if Kyle was black would he be treated differently? We've heard that from a lot of people. But those are people who are using their only singular race lens. If Kyle -- the fact is, if Kyle was black, he would be our nominee for the president for 2024, because we see everything through the self-defense lens. We don't -- we -- everybody here on this table it's like -- where are my glasses? It's like we're the optometrist where we're looking at an issue we got better? Is this better? Is this better?"

I have a good lens for self-defense. We can shift these things. But if you just have one prism and that's race, then you're going to miss this entire story. And that's what happened. That's why everybody on MSNBC and their viewers were shocked that this verdict was such a surprise, because how could this be? Didn't he killed two black people? Isn't he a white supremacist? How did -- how did this happen in this unjust world? It's because no, because you are relying on the one race lens. If you had a number of other ones at your behest, if you have those self-defense lens, you could have actually seen this.

And I hope that to the extent he wants us to learn about that. I hope we are able to. Two, I listen to both the president and the vice president, they're both lawyers, both have tried cases. They said at the way they wanted to say it and they both accepted the verdict. They had some commentary and I wasn't surprise by that. What I'm most sort of taken aback by, as I think about this going forward, and I think about my own like and I think about going into a grocery store or restaurant and someone coming in, perhaps with a grievance, with a server or clerk or manager, someone in one of those places, and they might have a weapon. They might be going after that person. I might be with my son or my daughter. And I may try to restrain him or her and asked him to please stop.

I don't know who was the lowest person on the totem pole who went to court on this case, but that person is in big trouble. No, it's you, the D.A. is in big trouble. And I'll tell you why. This is the rap sheet. OK? It's got I here -- I say I understand to have 50 pages. What you don't know in addition to what we know from the news, and that is that he had a felony charged against him in July of 2020. He was already out on bail, had another felony charge against him on November 2nd, and he has been violated for bail, and then he goes to court on November 5th and they give him bail of a thousand dollars. But that's not the least of it. This guy, in all of these charges, he's a batterer, he's a drug addict, he's been carrying a gun since he was 18 years old and then he got all the benefits of the criminal justice system. But he's cause strangulation against one woman, then he causes the strangulation against another woman or the same woman. This time it has to be a felony and they force the prosecutor to file a felony. But you go through this and through all the police arrests, there's no prosecution. So, this guy has used the system, the D.A. is the person who is at fault here, not the bail law that you would allow a guy who just jumped bail to give them a thousand dollars bail is ridiculous."

I think under the rubric of reform, we let our brains spill out of our skulls. It's like we don't release piranhas into an aquarium of goldfish. And it's not just with bail reform, it's stuff like this. It's also interesting how the stories -- depending on what narrative they sell are turned off or turned on.

Quite literally, they are liberals who just got mugged by reality. Because they vote in the people that allow the policies that allow for this to happen. This is the story of disincentives. You know, if you remove the disincentives for crime, you get more crime. And the brazenness is a direct rebuke of the leftists who dismissed the consequences of their policies. If you thought like 10, 20, or 30 years ago we would decriminalize theft or establish a number $900, that would be the very worst part of a radical strategy to undermine a free market in society. And yet that's what we're -- that's what's happening right now is we're watching -- this is -- this is the decriminalization of theft, you know. And it's like, it's happening -- it's no longer happening in those parts of the neighborhood that you don't go to. That was Walnut Creek. I go there a lot, San Francisco. That's the exact same thing that happened in Soho. You have to go out -- the local government has to pay for this and it's -- if you keep voting in these losers, it's on you."

The cars were so close so that these guys, those looters could run out and get into the cars. A lot of stores have done what Fox has done in the front. You have these concrete pillars so that they can't actually park in those areas and make a quick exit. There should be a video of every car, every license -- and they should have cameras obviously. I'm sure they do in all the stores. But the problem is that you now have, if you've got a car, you've got the ability to maybe get a search warrant if you know the guy has got a record and try to find out where some of these items are. But here's the bottom line. It's not just changing the law, it's getting people in to prosecute crime.
