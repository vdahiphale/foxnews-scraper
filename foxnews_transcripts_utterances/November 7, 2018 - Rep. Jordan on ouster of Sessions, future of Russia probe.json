Why are states like Vermont and Massachusetts that send Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to the senate now turning to Republicans to run their respective state houses? Massachusetts reelected the very popular Republican Charlie Baker there to the governorship, a whopping 66 percent of the vote, his Democratic challenger got 33 percent in that race. Then go to Vermont, where they reelected Republican Phil Scott to be the governor, 55 to 40.4 percent. Joining me now, Republican governor of nearby New Hampshire who won reelection last night, Chris Sununu, and his father, former governor and former White House chief of staff, John Sununu. Welcome to both of you. Good to have you here. I'm going to go by Chris and John because if I call you Governor Sununus we might get a little bit confused. So, Chris, let me start with you. What's the secret, why do you think, you know, your fellow New Englanders are sort of voting for that kind of split?",

It isn't about a political rhetoric, it's really about asking and demanding results of your elected officials. So, here in New Hampshire it was embraced. It ultimately the money came in and you now, just a few hundred thousand dollars can have a huge effect here in New Hampshire. And they put a lot of money. The Democrats spent a lot of money here. This is a first in the nation primary, they know this is the first stop. Basically, this morning we woke up, we had 20 Democrats waiting at the border actually coming in and running for president this morning, that's how aggressive they're going to be here.

And then at times wildly contentious news conference, President Trump saying that he could probably get some good things done with Nancy Pelosi if she doesn't make it all about investigations.

So, there is likely more to come as the president will undoubtedly rearrange some more deck chairs as presidents often do around this time in their presidency.

They can issue subpoenas and press for information here. But President Trump won big by expanding his majority in the Senate. So, he's got room to run. And the votes to push through a new Attorney General who may reign in the special counsel. Before the president's post-election news conference, many in the mainstream media were claiming he'd have to spin bad news. But instead, the president entered made clear he feels more emboldened now.  Lashing out what he called investigation fatigue. Boasting his critics have nothing on him. Adding he's happy with most of his cabinet who could make big changes elsewhere. The president deferred at the news are on whether Sessions was out, but within moments, we learned the Attorney General was gone. You see Sessions here bidding the Justice Department farewell with Matthew Whitaker, who's now acting Attorney General. Whitaker has said Hillary Clinton should be investigated, and that probing the president's finances is out of bounds. He's now overseeing a Mueller probe. This is what he told CNN last year."

Who has the authority over Special Counsel Mueller's investigation? We'll be holding people accountable.\" Well, Nadler and Senator Chuck Schumer are suggesting, this could raise more questions about obstruction. But it was chief of staff John Kelly who called Sessions as if to show this was just normal house cleaning.

Plus remember, Rosenstein has signed off on a renewal of that FISA warrant to surveil Carter Page. And also remember, Republican Devin Nunez has been wanting to get more FISA documents declassified.

And Mr. Sessions won't appoint one. I don't like special counsels, but you tell me how we get the answers from what the FBI and the DOJ did, particularly about the Russian investigation.  How are they going to investigate themselves? So, we don't know what's going on over there. He won't appoint a special counsel, and we said a long time ago. If you're not willing to do that, you should probably step down. I think it was appropriate the action that was taken today by the President of the United States. Remember Martha, he appointed John Huber, the U.S. Attorney to look into a lot of this. We have not got one single report from Mr. Huber about what he's done. Where is that -- where is that information? This happened months and months ago when he named John Huber, the U.S. attorney from Utah to look into this. We haven't heard one thing. So, I think this is the right move today."

They are going to investigate everything. It will be not -- you don't have to take my word for it, take their words as you just played. They're going to do this. And what I'm concerned most about is the thing we were just talking about.  The idea that the Clinton campaign pay the law firm who paid Fusion GPS, who hired a foreigner who talked to Russians to put together a fake document called a dossier that was used as the basis to spy on President Trump's campaign the idea that, that investigation will be dropped. That was the worst thing I've ever seen from the federal government, the idea that, that will be dropped to do all these other things that Maxine Waters and Jerry Nadler and Elijah Cummings and Adam Schiff are talking about.

Have we reformed welfare yet? Have we secured the border yet? There's lots of things we got to get done yet.  I think that had an impact on what took place just yesterday in the election. Now, one thing I also know is where President Trump went, there were good results. So, look, we got to match his intensity, that's what I want to do.

But what happened, we all remember the shovel-ready jobs program with the stimulus under President Obama and then he said, it turned out they weren't shovel-ready as they were supposed to be.

We have a huge infrastructure deficit. There's work that needs to be done in every state in America. What we need is the federal government to be a real partner, provide resources and get that work done.

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Why are states like Vermont and Massachusetts that send Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to the senate now turning to Republicans to run their respective state houses? Massachusetts reelected the very popular Republican Charlie Baker there to the governorship, a whopping 66 percent of the vote, his Democratic challenger got 33 percent in that race. Then go to Vermont, where they reelected Republican Phil Scott to be the governor, 55 to 40.4 percent. Joining me now, Republican governor of nearby New Hampshire who won reelection last night, Chris Sununu, and his father, former governor and former White House chief of staff, John Sununu. Welcome to both of you. Good to have you here. I'm going to go by Chris and John because if I call you Governor Sununus we might get a little bit confused. So, Chris, let me start with you. What's the secret, why do you think, you know, your fellow New Englanders are sort of voting for that kind of split?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU, R-N.H.",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know if it's about voting for a split. Governors implement change, governors work with individuals that actually design and craft ideas to get better results for citizens. It's not just about approving in a policy and a funding. Governors really have a connection. They are able to affect change for individuals and that's just why, especially Republican governors have been very successful not just here but across the country."

      "speaker": "JOHN SUNUNU, FORMER N.H. GOVERNOR",
      "utterance": "I think it is two different messages. Most of the governors you talked about are governors who are really not traditional long-term politicians. They come -- Charlie and Governor Chris have some out of the private sector, they made things work there, they came into government, they make things work here, the people liked it. And that's why they reelected them. They got results and New England voters really do like results."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, Chris, talk to me about, you know, President Trump lost the House to the Democrats last night. When you look at that situation, New Hampshire, you know, they took both houses. Are there any issues do you think where you align, where you line up?"

      "speaker": "C. SUNUNU",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, you know, I don't think last night was a referendum on the president, I think last night it was really a referendum on the idea that people really believe their voice has -- their vote has a voice. They have a say, they connect with candidates one on one, they expect results whether it's from a governor or from someone in the House of Representatives or from the Senate where the Republicans did very well. I mean, we had governors' seats across this country that people thought were going to go Democrat. Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Florida and Republicans retained those seats because we are getting results. It really does matter. You know, we talk about retail politics and retail management, that really matters to voters and that's something that's carrying on. Also, how you run your campaign I think is very important. We stayed positive. You know, I don't, I didn't run a single attack ad on TV. We really talk about the results and getting those results for the people in New Hampshire and that's what people responded to."

      "speaker": "J. SUNUNU",
      "utterance": "Martha, let me add this. What really made a big difference in the House races around the country last night is I really do think the Republicans were out funded tremendously. The Democrats really have generated a great machine for raising money and money is still the mother's milk of politics. We saw that in our congressional race here as the candidate in the first district got close, virtually tied -- Mrs. Pelosi put about $800,000 in the last week and that opened up the gap. So, Republicans have to get smart and figure out how they can compete with the Democrats on the federal races raising enough money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, it's interesting, the president suggested today in that news conference that if certain Republican candidates had embraced him, as the way he put it, and allowed them to, you know, talk about his agenda and perhaps have him campaign with them that the outcome might have been different for them. Do you agree with that? In places like New England? In place like New Jersey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "C. SUNUNU",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, look. Well, I mean, I'm only speaking here in New Hampshire specifically. I mean, we had two candidates that very much supported on the congressional side at least, very much supported the president's agenda. I am a supporter of the president as well. I think he's done some incredible things and it's about results, right. When you look at tax cuts and when you look at what he is done internationally, when you look at what he has done with the new NAFTA deal, which is very important to the people of New Hampshire getting a deal with Canada -- that's a great benefit to the state of New Hampshire here and that was embraced. It isn't about a political rhetoric, it's really about asking and demanding results of your elected officials. So, here in New Hampshire it was embraced. It ultimately the money came in and you now, just a few hundred thousand dollars can have a huge effect here in New Hampshire. And they put a lot of money. The Democrats spent a lot of money here. This is a first in the nation primary, they know this is the first stop. Basically, this morning we woke up, we had 20 Democrats waiting at the border actually coming in and running for president this morning, that's how aggressive they're going to be here. So, they knew that holding those congressional seats was quite critical and they had to spend the money to do it."

    {
      "speaker": "J. SUNUNU",
      "utterance": "Martha, there's a way to support the president's policies if you're uncomfortable with his style, you can say that. If you're uncomfortable with his rhetoric you can say that. If you're uncomfortable with his tweets you can say that. But endorse his policies, endorse the results, say you -- he needs some voices in Congress to support getting those results. I just think those candidates that he indicated did not support him just weren't, really didn't take the time to figure out how to have your cake and eat it too, and I think you can do that."

Why are you wasting them for this performative this silliness to do this stuff? And now the White House gets to keep the story going which is what we are at war with the lying press, the enemy of the people, aren't you the enemy of the people? Who cares? Who on earth cares, except for the fact that it serves the interest of both this administration and that reporter."

Who better to ask than Dr. Deepak Chopra, author of \"You Are the Universe.\" It is great to have you here. Thank you so much."

What do you recommend in terms -- you know, you got both of these political sides entrenched in the way that they believe is the way forward. And I interviewed someone earlier tonight who basically said yes, we are to negotiate, we want to come together, but, you know, laid out a number of ways and places where he would refuse to negotiate."

      "speaker": "CHOPRA",
      "utterance": "So, Martha, traditionally, in all democracies, there is a healthy tension between conservatives and liberals. It's contained conflict. And actually, is a good thing. But when it becomes a divisive, quarrelsome, contentious, hostile, full of anger and rage, then it's destructive for the country. I think right now, everybody, both conservatives and liberals want healing. They want jobs, they want safety, they want a sustainable country. So, there is a shared vision. Only the means of the vision are opinions are different. If we have shared vision, emotional and spiritual connection, work hard in our own communities through volunteering and some reflective self-inquiry, what do we really want for our country, for our children, for our grandchildren? For the world? Because we are part of the world. We can't escape that. So, if we ask those questions -- and there is diversity. America is built on ideas and diversity, that's the strength of this country. We never run out of ideas. In fact, there is an infinity of creative ideas to make America great again. And it's on its way."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So how do you build the bridge, as you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHOPRA",
      "utterance": "Focus on what you want, not on what you don't want. It's that simple. What do we want? Do we want more peaceful, just, sustainable, healthier, joyful nation? So let's together share that vision, and then together, come together and see how we can do it. It's called emergence. When you have transparency, you have open systems, you have open dialogue, you have no hostility. A shared vision -- emergence happens. It's been happening throughout history."
