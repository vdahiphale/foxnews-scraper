Charles was also, like me, a huge baseball fan. And last night, Charles was honored at Nationals Park in D.C. So, you know, people outside of Fox ask me about Charles.

So, once a week, I would get on the phone with Dr. Krauthammer and I would transcribe his talking points about Bill's topics for that night. And then, I would absorb the talking points and I will go to the bar later and repeat them as if they were my own to sound smart. And I loved doing it. And I also remember for years I would DVR Special Report, and then I would fast forward to the all-star panel at the end, fast forward through you, no offense. And then I would just listen to Charles. And what the difference with Charles compared to any other commentator when he spoke, everything went quiet and you listened. And you never interrupted Charles. Not even O'Reilly interrupted Charles. And that's a pretty tall order. Even my liberal mother liked Charles Krauthammer because he had a way about him.

And it shows the kind of the depth of his power because he was honored by George W. Bush, the nationals, Benjamin Netanyahu. I had friends texting me randomly, I'm so sorry to hear about Charles. He really had such a great impact. I remember the first time I met him face to face. I was in the D.C. bureau and I just come back from one of those crazy Watters' World and I was all cocky and I rolled into the green room and Charles in that kind of low tone says, Jesse, thank you so much for allowing me to be in your world.

If you actually allow someone in to the end of your life, so they can celebrate you, and let you know what you've meant to them while you're still living, that is so incredibly profound, and it is such an amazing gift that very few people are capable of giving so many people and he was able to do that. He had the confidence and he had enough respect for himself, his audience, and his very close friends and colleagues here at Fox. And I think we will be forever grateful for that. Not only for so many people having the opportunity to reach out to him, but also as an example to other people that you can take this on with a degree of positivity and comportment that we rarely see. And I hope people see that as an example.

And so, when you meet him maybe you didn't know. And I remember one of my -- one of my buddies made a joke about should Charles go on Dancing with the Stars. And I said you were such an A-hole, and he had no idea. He's a huge fan of Charles after Tucker was on. He had no idea that Charles Krauthammer was in a wheelchair. You know, he's a very serious dude. He's very funny. But the one thing that was interesting about him is that he never let this -- whatever happened to him in his life actually affect him.

We see people that are dealing with inner demons. And I think that's why he's so inspirational is because he has every excuse to hate life. Every excuse. Did the opposite. He embraced it.

And he would be like cracking jokes and open with so many folks, just very warm. And, by the way, Jesse, going to a baseball game with Charles was, literally, people coming up to him because he gave structure to so much conservative thought. A lot of conservatives felt, hey, this is the guy. This is the intellectual that is able to frame conservative thought in such a way that the liberals and the left has trouble with it. That they finally feel that here is an intellectual of the right. Some people call them neo conservatives. But it was Charles who talked about the Reagan doctrine in terms of America globally standing up for freedom, for security. He talked about a Bush doctrine in terms of going in to war.

But you learn that the learners who own the Washington Nationals love Charles. So, here we are, you know, you go in Charles -- specially made van going down South Capitol Street and here we are -- I want you to take a look at that picture again, that's Charles on the big screen over the stadium last night as the Nats were playing the Orioles, and there was a moment of silence. But if you drove then and you think, oh, my God, is this guy going to crash this van?

The mourning is over, the chiva is done. And if you're a conservative you should be optimistic. I think, you know, it will snow in hell before the DOJ is going to go after her.

      "utterance": "Charles is the leading conservative thinker of his generation to many. He touched so many of our lives right here at the Fox News Channel. I've got to tell you, I often found myself on the opposite end of the opinion fence from Charles Krauthammer. That was the case for just about a decade on Special Report. Charles was also, like me, a huge baseball fan. And last night, Charles was honored at Nationals Park in D.C. So, you know, people outside of Fox ask me about Charles. I think it's very hard sometimes to explain to them how he touched so many of us because, I think, oh, how could all you guys know him? But Jesse had a very special relationship. Jesse, explain."

      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I was the producer for \"the O'Reilly Factor\" for many years and it was my great honor to produce Charles Krauthammer for about five of those years. So, once a week, I would get on the phone with Dr. Krauthammer and I would transcribe his talking points about Bill's topics for that night. And then, I would absorb the talking points and I will go to the bar later and repeat them as if they were my own to sound smart. And I loved doing it. And I also remember for years I would DVR Special Report, and then I would fast forward to the all-star panel at the end, fast forward through you, no offense. And then I would just listen to Charles. And what the difference with Charles compared to any other commentator when he spoke, everything went quiet and you listened. And you never interrupted Charles. Not even O'Reilly interrupted Charles. And that's a pretty tall order. Even my liberal mother liked Charles Krauthammer because he had a way about him. He was so rational and so respectful. He was never disagreeable. And you could always kind of as a liberal disagree with him but not hate him, and he was never ever attacked if you ever realized from the left. And it shows the kind of the depth of his power because he was honored by George W. Bush, the nationals, Benjamin Netanyahu. I had friends texting me randomly, I'm so sorry to hear about Charles. He really had such a great impact. I remember the first time I met him face to face. I was in the D.C. bureau and I just come back from one of those crazy Watters' World and I was all cocky and I rolled into the green room and Charles in that kind of low tone says, Jesse, thank you so much for allowing me to be in your world. And he said it with a wink and a smile. It just really made me laugh."

    {
      "speaker": "KENNEDY, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, there's something so incredibly positive about what he did, which was he opened a window of mourning and let people in on the knowledge that he did not have long left in this world. And there's something so sweet and honorable about that because if you think about it, the only time we really talk about people in these glowing terms is after they pass. If you actually allow someone in to the end of your life, so they can celebrate you, and let you know what you've meant to them while you're still living, that is so incredibly profound, and it is such an amazing gift that very few people are capable of giving so many people and he was able to do that. He had the confidence and he had enough respect for himself, his audience, and his very close friends and colleagues here at Fox. And I think we will be forever grateful for that. Not only for so many people having the opportunity to reach out to him, but also as an example to other people that you can take this on with a degree of positivity and comportment that we rarely see. And I hope people see that as an example. And they're not ashamed of passing on to the next realm because, you know, as people of faith, and there are a lot of people of faith here, we embrace the afterlife but we're terrified of dying. And there was such bravery and strength that Charles showed going into that."

He never was self-pitying. Greg?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "No, I mean, that's -- he had to face something every day that was beyond his own disability. It was people that he met that weren't aware that he was disabled until they met him. And because he always -- when he was shot at Fox, you know, you couldn't tell that he was in a wheelchair, and I think that was his choice because he didn't want to be -- he didn't want that as any kind of interference. And so, when you meet him maybe you didn't know. And I remember one of my -- one of my buddies made a joke about should Charles go on Dancing with the Stars. And I said you were such an A-hole, and he had no idea. He's a huge fan of Charles after Tucker was on. He had no idea that Charles Krauthammer was in a wheelchair. You know, he's a very serious dude. He's very funny. But the one thing that was interesting about him is that he never let this -- whatever happened to him in his life actually affect him. And in a weird way it turned into an asset for him because it made him a man of ideas because he was limited -- he was in a chair for his entire life and he made his achievement come from here. Everything was about ideas. And the other thing I would just mention is that we do live in a time where more people are healthy and they live longer, there's less disease, there's less poverty, but we have this -- we have an increase in suicides. We see people that are dealing with inner demons. And I think that's why he's so inspirational is because he has every excuse to hate life. Every excuse. Did the opposite. He embraced it. I don't think I could be that man. I honestly do not think I could be 10 percent of Charles Krauthammer."

      "speaker": "CANDANCE OWENS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Exactly everything that you guys said here. Despite his disability he will be remembered as a man of great fortitude. You know, his character, his strength, his virtue. People from both sides of the political aisle coming together and honoring this man show you that he was a person of tremendous character. And, look, he was happy with his life. I think that that's the most wonderful thing. The wonderful take away here is how happy and content he was with the life that he lived."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, interesting for me because I knew him for so long. I knew him before Fox even. And I'll say two things about Charles. One is that the sense of spirit and human kindness that came from Charles Krauthammer was no pretend. You know, you introduce him to people at Fox and they will be like, oh, Charles Krauthammer. And he would be like cracking jokes and open with so many folks, just very warm. And, by the way, Jesse, going to a baseball game with Charles was, literally, people coming up to him because he gave structure to so much conservative thought. A lot of conservatives felt, hey, this is the guy. This is the intellectual that is able to frame conservative thought in such a way that the liberals and the left has trouble with it. That they finally feel that here is an intellectual of the right. Some people call them neo conservatives. But it was Charles who talked about the Reagan doctrine in terms of America globally standing up for freedom, for security. He talked about a Bush doctrine in terms of going in to war. He gave the framework. And going to baseball, Jesse, with him, not only did you see the people were thanking him, conservatives thanking him for doing that. But you learn that the learners who own the Washington Nationals love Charles. So, here we are, you know, you go in Charles -- specially made van going down South Capitol Street and here we are -- I want you to take a look at that picture again, that's Charles on the big screen over the stadium last night as the Nats were playing the Orioles, and there was a moment of silence. But if you drove then and you think, oh, my God, is this guy going to crash this van? But you get to Nationals Park and he had the best parking spot, Jesse, because the learners had a parking spot for him in the stadium. And I always thought, gee, how come I can't get this."

The mother took the child away from the father, away from other children in Central America, not any asylum reason but just to have a better economic life.

This is all about demonization. The confirmation bias has steered the media into lying over and over again which is why no one trusts them. And why Time is now thinner than Donnie Deutsch's spine. I want to bring up Donnie Deutsch because we didn't mention him in here, but he said that all Trump supporters are no different than Nazi prison guards if you support him on immigration. So now, he's deemed everybody evil. You have to understanding when you call somebody a Nazi you're giving them -- you're giving other people license to hurt them. So, that's what Donnie Deutsch is doing. And I've not heard a peep from MSNBC about this. That is dangerous stuff."

What he did here is really tremendous bringing out these families, these angel families. We never hear the left's outrage. We never hear the names of all of the families that were separated permanently, as he said, permanently from their children because of illegal immigration. This is why their outrage is never taken seriously. And, look, let me say on behalf of all conservatives. Nobody wants to see a parent separated from their child. That is awful across the board. That's not what we're saying here whatsoever. But the selective outrage here is what needs to end."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

But I think that the problem here is the context, Jesse, which is that, in fact, the crime rate among illegal immigrants is lower than there is crime rate among people who are born natives of our country.

And when you have zero tolerance policy there's really no discretion that they can use. And, you know, they have to become very good like instant in the field psychologists trying to discern if people are coming to this country because they're scared, they're hurt, and they're desperate, or if they really mean to do people harm. And, you know, we have so many layers of bureaucracy that are completely damaged that are not functioning properly and a lot of that rests on the shoulders of these ICE agents. So, for Cynthia Nixon to say that they're a bunch of terrorists I think is incredibly shortsighted and naive because they're torn between an administration that's having a tough time messaging and a Department of Justice who's saying the opposite of what they're told to do by homeland security. So, I think, you know, they really are between a rock and a hard place because they are the front line. And we have to find a better way of allowing people into this country who want to work, and if that means changing the immigration laws, Democrats that are stopping hysterical about this whole thing and craft some immigration policy that makes things less chaotic --"

So, when she's quiet or when she's laying low for a while, you know, things start spinning and they start, you know, flushing out all these conspiracy theories. The jacket would have been easier if she had explained it, she didn't. It's obviously a provocative statement. There's no way Melania wore that to say I don't care about migrant kids. And for the media to impugn her motives and her character is ridiculous. Everybody knows Melania cares about the migrant families. Everybody knows she has a heart and she's going down there to show she has heart and to check in on how these migrant kids are being treated. With that said, you know what? She could have done without the message on the back of the jacket and that would have been fine. It was a little distraction. The media is always going to try to harm her because they don't like her husband."

The message is, \"I really don't care. Do you?\" is the message and somebody goes, look what you have on your jacket. I really don't care. And that's it. And the thing is because her actions are actually counter to the message. I mean it's like she really doesn't care about this. No, actually she tweeted that she didn't like the separation and she went down there to visit. So her message -- her actual actions are not what the deed is. So, I think it was some kind of -- it was a manufactured intentional trigger to set off the mind readers in the media, what kind of evil person would do this, you know, but there she is, doing good.

Now, these people who are marginalized, I mean, if you probably add them all up, there is marginalized people than non-marginalized people. But if you keep treating marginalized people like children, they are going to remain marginalized. I think every adult in this country can hear something and be okay and not have to run to mommy. Like you said, they have defended the KKK, the Westboro Baptist Church, the worst people in the world. They protest at military funerals.

And people said well, that's the ACLU. They have to stand up for the First Amendment rights of free speech. But in the current environment, people are now having second thoughts saying wait a second. You are really standing up for hate speech and guess what? Hate speech is a legitimate part of speech. Now we know you are not allowed to yell fire in a crowded theater. I don't think they have ever tried to defend that. And so the question becomes at what point are they simply becoming an arm of people who are acting in an un-American, in fact, antithetical to American values way, and should the ACLU be putting money into defending that kind of speech.

And so it becomes the application of subjective group think. And that becomes the marginalizing principle now because if you have certain aspects that you no longer defend, because you are worried that they are going to offend certain people, that means that it is an unbalanced application of what your charter is meant to do and what the ACLU was meant to do in the first place. And that means if they really do apply these new standards, these new politically correct standards, and there are a lot of people who despise some of the things that the ACLU has defended in the past.
