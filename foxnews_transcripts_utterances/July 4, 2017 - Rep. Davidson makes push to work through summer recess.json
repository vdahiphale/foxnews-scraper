But the part that is not there is, when you say recess, a lot of people think, well, you're just on vacation. That simply means that it's not in session. So a lot of the people that don't want a recess to happen are people that really wait for a long time to get events scheduled on your calendar back in the district. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, really, if you are going to represent people, you have to meet with them and know what their issues are. So, for most of my colleagues, and certainly for, as a new guy, we try to get five to seven events in, in a day and really get out and talk to constituents. But that really highlights it and frames it.",

We're on a path where we don't have a budget number. We're talking about tax reform. We haven't finished health care reform and we have got a debt ceiling that we're running up against.

Yes. There were several competing plans. But it really was much harder to get a consensus. And I think that's really where the Senate is. I believe they will pass a bill because they have to.

It's like trying to compare Windows and Mac. And, you know, Windows found that just to try to make it look like Mac isn't enough. You have to change some other things.

And it really ends this tax on global profits and shifts it to destination-based. And so when you pull that away, it gets pretty complicated and it really involves a shift back from this new logic that is in the Republican blueprint to a different logic that is really the traditional.
