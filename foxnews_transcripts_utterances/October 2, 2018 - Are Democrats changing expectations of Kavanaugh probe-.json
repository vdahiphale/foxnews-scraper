But, the bottom line is she did the absolute best with what she was given and the investigation in that closed world. She used a preponderance of evidence standard which is the lowest. And note this that to bring charges as a prosecutor, the standard for that is that you have reasonable belief that the charges are supported by probable cause. And then also admissible evidence is supported by beyond the reasonable doubt and that it's in the interest of justice. So, she used, basically, the lowest possible standard, giving it the lowest bar to cross and still found it insufficient.

Whether it was about plane travel, she only has a fear of flying when it's not on vacation. The polygraph, she wasn't sure when it was. She said it was a devastating experience, but there were two questions. The claim that she never got a lawyer -- an offer from the Republicans, like Grassley to take -- to have the meeting over there. Giving notes to reporters. Changing bystander to not bystander. There's a lot -- I'll be diplomatic and say inconsistency to her, otherwise, credible testimony. That's how you talk apparently.

On TV you can say, yes, this accusation is disqualifying, but when you get home it's \"What if they come for me? This is nuts.\" Politicians, celebrities, media, so many have been accused of something. Want to bet they feel their pain was unjust? Matt should ask his friends: \"Hey, Ben, were you ever accused of something, and was it unjust?\" Imagine how many of them fight back tears and anger. It will be quite a performance. Maybe Matt can mock that, too. So Dana, I find it interesting, because this whole case really comes down to memories: one woman's memories, a man's memories, uncorroborated evidence about the memories. Matt Damon just proved what a memory -- how valuable a memory is. He cannot remember -- he cannot remember what he just said, maybe a year, two years ago about the #MeToo movement.

So you can be mean to Canada and be nice to North Korea. He sees the individual desires of each leader.

But, 56 percent think he's being -- this is part of a political smear campaign. And -- I can't remember the other number. So you're going to see some more polling on this. There are basically four senators now that this comes down to, Murkowski, Flake, Collins, and then, Manchin. And President Trump was in West Virginia over the weekend. There's incredible pressure on Senator Manchin because his constituents and a number that is like astronomical, want Brett Kavanaugh to be confirmed. I think a risk for Brett Kavanaugh this week over his nomination, for him personally, is that now the hearing is done, now we've got this FBI investigation, as you said, Democrats saying, well, that's not good enough. Senator McConnell saying today, we will vote this week. And, in the meantime, you basically have dead air for Brett Kavanaugh. President Trump speaking so passionately about his nominee today from the Rose Garden helps fill that gap a little bit, but the news cycle move so fast. President Trump has a rally tonight. He's got one again tomorrow. How long can he keep this going? It's really important, I think, for the nominee and for President Trump to keep it in the news on their terms."

This was outsourced by the senate judiciary committee Republicans for her to do a job. So, of course, she's going to issue a report. And I'm also hearing a lot of backlash from other prosecutor saying, well, this wasn't a proper investigation and that's not the appropriate standard. But, the bottom line is she did the absolute best with what she was given and the investigation in that closed world. She used a preponderance of evidence standard which is the lowest. And note this that to bring charges as a prosecutor, the standard for that is that you have reasonable belief that the charges are supported by probable cause. And then also admissible evidence is supported by beyond the reasonable doubt and that it's in the interest of justice. So, she used, basically, the lowest possible standard, giving it the lowest bar to cross and still found it insufficient. So, I found the report absolutely telling and that she should be given a lot more credence than she is."

I think it's absolutely become tribal. And the latest polling what you see is an uptick in terms of the number of Republicans who are backing Kavanaugh previously. By the way, amazing to me they didn't back Kavanaugh to the extent they backed Neil Gorsuch. This is not a popular nominee. But now, in the midst of the tribal warfare you see it ticks up, and it ticks up among Democrats as well. The key question for me, though, in terms of what we go forward is what is the standard? Because what we've seen is now -- I think it's four people who knew Kavanaugh either in high school or college are saying he wasn't forthcoming and truthful about his drinking. So, if you hold to this standard, now you're going to get Democrats who are going to say this is a matter of character for someone we're putting on the court for a lifetime appointment and this guy was lying about his drinking."

This is now the coliseum in which we turn to the crowd on whether or not if they give the thumb-up or the thumb-down. They didn't just move the goalpost here. They've just turned over the game board because they knew they were in trouble. To the point about the -- if he's lying about booze, what else is he lying about argument. Well, it's clear that Dr. Ford lied about a number of things as well. You can call them inconsistencies. That's the nice polite way of saying lies. Whether it was about plane travel, she only has a fear of flying when it's not on vacation. The polygraph, she wasn't sure when it was. She said it was a devastating experience, but there were two questions. The claim that she never got a lawyer -- an offer from the Republicans, like Grassley to take -- to have the meeting over there. Giving notes to reporters. Changing bystander to not bystander. There's a lot -- I'll be diplomatic and say inconsistency to her, otherwise, credible testimony. That's how you talk apparently. So, if his lies about booze, which I do believe he fibbed about his drinking because he's talking about his drinking in front of his wife and kids. And I'm sorry, I do the same thing. When my wife asks me how much I drank over the weekend while she's away I say not much, honey. And she goes, yeah, right. So, the fact is, those lies have nothing to do with the actual accusation. But since we're talking about alcohol abuse, let's talk about the media and the Democrats who are obviously alcoholics because they completely blacked out the last five days. They do not remember that the third accuser has a history of lying and sexual misconduct claims, lying about her employment, lying about her education. But they don't seem to remember the Avenatti bombshell from last week, which is now a bombshell that she lied about her background. But that's somehow -- they blacked out about that -- they blackout about the Rachel Mitchell's memo. We're covering it. The only reason we're covering it, because no one else is because they blacked out. These are huge things that the media cannot remember because they don't want to remember it. It's disgusting."

Katz, the woman that's representing Dr. Ford was recommended by Dianne Feinstein. Katz also represented the third accuser who's now being represented by Avenatti.

Do when NAFTA was being reformed, and when Trump had taken negotiations off the table with Trudeau and there was a bilateral agreement -- bilateral agreement for a second with Mexico, the press was all over it. And rightly so, because those were big deals. And then today when the agreement is come to fruition, there's nothing. And instead they're going after that shinier object. So how did you feel about this? Can you speak to that?"

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "People are bored by tariffs and trade, because boring stuff is important; and that's the problem. Because you have to go slow with important things. And if you remove the Supreme Court soap opera, what do you have in this country? You have peace and prosperity, which is why the media and the left are chasing the Kavanaugh story. About trade and tariffs, Trump gets something that I didn't get, and he's giving people a class in this as a salesman, which is that you leverage relationships with your allies while you engage talks with your adversaries. So you can be mean to Canada and be nice to North Korea. He sees the individual desires of each leader. That's the system of a salesman in which the individual desires of the people you're talking to matter for that moment."

And we'll see if Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are going to do what they've been saying they want to do for decades, which is to renegotiate NAFTA. I'm just waiting to hear Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders give the president a round of applause, because these people campaigned for the presidency on renegotiating NAFTA. And now Donald Trump has done it, and all I hear is silence."

And you stop and think about, \"Wait a second. What is going on here? What is the reality of the deal?\" So I will say this. You know what? I think union folks have some big complaints about NAFTA. Did want -- Jesse was right. The Bidens, the Obamas, all those people wanted some kind of renegotiation, but I don't think they were talking about, \"Oh, we were going to have something for the dairy farmers here.\""

Also, they have chocolate Mentos there and we don't, and we really need to figure that out. And then this is our final picture. It's our 20th anniversary. Thanks, Peter, for a great trip.
