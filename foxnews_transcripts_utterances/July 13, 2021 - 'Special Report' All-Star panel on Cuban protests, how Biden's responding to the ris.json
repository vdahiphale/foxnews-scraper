So, what we know is defunding the police doesn't work, this bond reform doesn't work, these so- called progressive prosecutors don't work. I got a really crazy novel idea. How about actually enforce? You'd be shocked Bret at the -- at the gun laws we currently have. But they don't do any good if the federal prosecutors aren't actually enforcing them. So, how about we start there?",

I don't think that there is as much of a gap as we think that the leader of the Democratic Party has never been for the funding the police. He convened a group of law enforcement officials to talk candidly, to talk seriously, and broadly about how to address this issue. The Democratic nominee in the largest city in the country that has witnessed and experienced some of the great crime reductions over the many years. And I might add, I would agree with Trey, gun prosecution should go back up. But during the Biden administration, excuse me, the Obama administration, crime, and violent crime rates were down in a lot of cities. But they're going up now, and it causes -- it calls for a different set of reactions. So, I was encouraged by this meeting. I'm encouraged by even the willingness to listen to some of the bail reform changes that must happen. I think there were some who we're well-intentioned of wanted bail reform, but it's not working. It's putting criminals and putting violent people back out on the street. There has to be a better way to achieve with some of those who wanted bail reform to achieve without endangering our communities as we -- as we certainly have. And finally, we should go after ghost guns. They're right about that, and I hope they continue, continue that pursuit.",

So, it's really just about enforcement. If you're a gang banger, Bret, and you get popped for illegal possession of a firearm, you can be booked out same day back on the street. And when it is time for sentencing, if a liberal D.A. only recommends one year instead of the three to seven, and the public defenders says OK, let's just go 10 days, liberal judges is going to slice it in a half and give them six months. So, he's paroled in six months back out squeezing the trigger and comes into contact with the law enforcement that's under siege by liberal activists. So, unless we're not talking about incarceration and prosecution, I don't believe this is a serious issue with the Democrats. Joe Biden's doing great on COVID, big numbers in terms of approval. But with crime and the border, he's in his 30s. And you add critical race theory to that, you add gas prices of that, eventually, the COVID thing is going to become not an issue anymore. And he's got some stuff that's just really just right there at the edge waiting to take him down. So, he needs to fix this quickly. But I don't see it happening.",

So, if you can't do that, and look, let's be fair, most of this crime is state and local. But when you have Democrat members of Congress talking about the police the way Rashida Tlaib, and Omar, and AOC, talk about the cops, then, it's going to trickle into the federal system.

We're told not all 67 House Democrats left the state capitol, just enough to deny Republicans the quorum they need to pass the controversial elections bill. Because under the Texas constitution, at least a hundred of the 150 House members must be required or must be present for a vote for any legislation to get passed. The election reform bill would ban drive thru and early overnight voting in addition to creating new I.D. requirements for those who want to cast their ballots by mail.

But there are not many Republican politicians who want to speak out against Donald Trump, not because they think he should lead their ticket in 2024 or about that they can win with him, but because they believe that his following is still sufficiently strong in the party that they dare not oppose him publicly. That is, I think will where he stands. When he said in that speech, you just heard some of the last phrases from that speech, he was talking about, we're going to do this, we're going to do that. It's not entirely clear if by \"we\" he means the party and him at the head of it, or if he just means the party. I think an awful lot of things are going to happen between now and 2024 which will determine whether he's in any shape to run or not. But he's still there, and he's still at the center of things.

I think a lot of rank-and-file Republican politicians and a lot of rank- and-file Republican voters wouldn't mind a bit if he went away. They could then pick up his agenda and run on it. The Biden administration to date seems to have left them plenty of opportunity. The president, the former president outlined a lot of them in his speech on all kinds of issues, crime, immigration, and on down the list. And so I think the party feels it could be a in a strong position. They're afraid to buck him, but they're afraid they will lead them to a defeat, which is what they feared the first time. And then he did lead them to a defeat the second time. So that's, I think, where they are. But he shows no signs of going away, we will see what happens if he gets indicted or something like that.

      "utterance": "When you know, Bret, gun prosecutions went down under President Obama with Vice President Biden right there beside him. I mean, I want your viewers to focus on the group that constantly calls for more gun laws. Gun prosecutions went down when they were in office. So, what we know is defunding the police doesn't work, this bond reform doesn't work, these so- called progressive prosecutors don't work. I got a really crazy novel idea. How about actually enforce? You'd be shocked Bret at the -- at the gun laws we currently have. But they don't do any good if the federal prosecutors aren't actually enforcing them. So, how about we start there?"

      "utterance": "Well, first off, congrats to Jesse on the book. And thanks for having me on. I don't think that there is as much of a gap as we think that the leader of the Democratic Party has never been for the funding the police. He convened a group of law enforcement officials to talk candidly, to talk seriously, and broadly about how to address this issue. The Democratic nominee in the largest city in the country that has witnessed and experienced some of the great crime reductions over the many years. And I might add, I would agree with Trey, gun prosecution should go back up. But during the Biden administration, excuse me, the Obama administration, crime, and violent crime rates were down in a lot of cities. But they're going up now, and it causes -- it calls for a different set of reactions. So, I was encouraged by this meeting. I'm encouraged by even the willingness to listen to some of the bail reform changes that must happen. I think there were some who we're well-intentioned of wanted bail reform, but it's not working. It's putting criminals and putting violent people back out on the street. There has to be a better way to achieve with some of those who wanted bail reform to achieve without endangering our communities as we -- as we certainly have. And finally, we should go after ghost guns. They're right about that, and I hope they continue, continue that pursuit."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, the country has been too permissive when it comes to all of these precincts in liberal America. The gun issues a dodge. We have the strictest gun laws in these cities. So, it's really just about enforcement. If you're a gang banger, Bret, and you get popped for illegal possession of a firearm, you can be booked out same day back on the street. And when it is time for sentencing, if a liberal D.A. only recommends one year instead of the three to seven, and the public defenders says OK, let's just go 10 days, liberal judges is going to slice it in a half and give them six months. So, he's paroled in six months back out squeezing the trigger and comes into contact with the law enforcement that's under siege by liberal activists. So, unless we're not talking about incarceration and prosecution, I don't believe this is a serious issue with the Democrats. Joe Biden's doing great on COVID, big numbers in terms of approval. But with crime and the border, he's in his 30s. And you add critical race theory to that, you add gas prices of that, eventually, the COVID thing is going to become not an issue anymore. And he's got some stuff that's just really just right there at the edge waiting to take him down. So, he needs to fix this quickly. But I don't see it happening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "You know, Trey, some media organizations at the beginning of -- as we were covering it here on Fox said, you know, we were blowing it up out of proportion that this really wasn't -- crime wasn't an issue across the country. And now there's this meeting at the White House, obviously, it's risen to the level politically, how does that fall? You know, as we get closer and closer to 2022?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I mean, there are lots of folks on the Democrat's side. Harold Ford included that they're really smart when it comes to politics. I mean, you look at Jim Clyburn and others, they want to hold on to the House, and they know that if the economy is OK, and COVID is OK, the public safety is the number one function of government. So, if you can't do that, and look, let's be fair, most of this crime is state and local. But when you have Democrat members of Congress talking about the police the way Rashida Tlaib, and Omar, and AOC, talk about the cops, then, it's going to trickle into the federal system. He gets to pick U.S. attorneys. Let's pick some that actually believe in putting people -- violent offenders in prison. That would be a great place to start. Quit with the progressive prosecutors, pick U.S. attorneys that actually believe in enforcing gun laws."

First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox Five in Atlanta with the funeral of the golf pro killed in a triple homicide at a course last week. Gene Siller was 46 years old. The man suspected of killing him and two others was arrested Thursday. Fox 40 in Sacramento as firefighters work in extreme temperatures across the west, struggling to contain wildfires. The largest blaze of the year in California raging along the Nevada State line. It has burned about 134 square miles so far. State regulators are asking consumers to voluntarily conserve as much electricity as possible to avoid any power outages in that region. And this is a live look from Tampa from our affiliate Fox 13 down there, the big story there tonight. As real lightning spoils part of the party for Stanley Cup Champion Tampa Bay Lightning. Shortly after the team's boat parade ended, severe weather force cancellation of the Riverfront Park ceremony. It's Tampa's third major sports title in just over a year. Congratulations.

      "utterance": "Bret, good evening. And this all happened by the way just four days into that special legislative session that began last Thursday and now, the majority of House Democrats, well, they once again have abandoned their posts. Dozens left Austin this afternoon on two private jets and flew to Washington D.C. where they plan to stay for the next couple of weeks until the clock runs out on this special session here in Texas. We're told not all 67 House Democrats left the state capitol, just enough to deny Republicans the quorum they need to pass the controversial elections bill. Because under the Texas constitution, at least a hundred of the 150 House members must be required or must be present for a vote for any legislation to get passed. The election reform bill would ban drive thru and early overnight voting in addition to creating new I.D. requirements for those who want to cast their ballots by mail. Democrats argued that that would disenfranchise lower income Texans and voters of color. Earlier today, Vice President Kamala Harris praised the move, listen."

Even accusing leadership of a failed response to coronavirus, for which the State Department was criticized after initially tweeting that was the reason not inept communist rule. In Miami's Little Havana, Calle Ocho filled up with hundreds, if not thousands of supporters in solidarity with the Cuban people.

The head of Haiti's police says five of the suspects are still at large, and at least three have been killed. No motive yet from officials or authorities. U.S. officials who recently arrived in Haiti, including representatives from the Justice and Homeland Security Departments met Sunday with Haitian officials.

British police investigating alleged racist abuse against three black players who failed to score on penalty kicks in England's loss to Italy in the European Championship final.

    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, Bret, I think he is going to be with us a while longer, maybe a good while longer. The strength in that straw poll there, that's the most conservative elements of the party. It isn't necessarily the sentiments of the entire party. But there are not many Republican politicians who want to speak out against Donald Trump, not because they think he should lead their ticket in 2024 or about that they can win with him, but because they believe that his following is still sufficiently strong in the party that they dare not oppose him publicly. That is, I think will where he stands. When he said in that speech, you just heard some of the last phrases from that speech, he was talking about, we're going to do this, we're going to do that. It's not entirely clear if by \"we\" he means the party and him at the head of it, or if he just means the party. I think an awful lot of things are going to happen between now and 2024 which will determine whether he's in any shape to run or not. But he's still there, and he's still at the center of things. And he is going to make news and have attention wherever he goes. That's the fact of life for Republicans."

They also had, as far as what he did with Twitter and how he talked about things, but also, Donald Trump on January 6th and the wake of that. As he talks more and more about the stolen election, how big a problem is that for Republicans as a party?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "I think it's a very big problem, Bret. I saw one poll not long ago that reflects what you were just talking about people in which a majority of Republicans said they would like to win with his policies. A smaller number said they would like to win with him leading the way. And I think that's basically where the matter now stands. I think a lot of rank-and-file Republican politicians and a lot of rank- and-file Republican voters wouldn't mind a bit if he went away. They could then pick up his agenda and run on it. The Biden administration to date seems to have left them plenty of opportunity. The president, the former president outlined a lot of them in his speech on all kinds of issues, crime, immigration, and on down the list. And so I think the party feels it could be a in a strong position. They're afraid to buck him, but they're afraid they will lead them to a defeat, which is what they feared the first time. And then he did lead them to a defeat the second time. So that's, I think, where they are. But he shows no signs of going away, we will see what happens if he gets indicted or something like that. That might change the calculus, or he needs to spend his time keeping his businesses together. We'll see about that as well."

But a number of the things that the Republicans want to do in the laws they are passing across the country and so on are things that are popular, and voter I.D. is very high on that list, Bret, as you suggest. I think it's politically really stupid to come out and criticize voter I.D.

Many are not, as the administration argues, displaced by violence, climate change, or corruption. Ecuador's homicide rate is lower than most U.S. cities. Brazil ranks among the world's wealthiest countries. Yet apprehensions from Ecuador are up more 200 percent, as well as Cuba, Brazil, Venezuela, and Nicaragua."

The 70-year-old Branson and five crewmates from his Virgin Galactic space tourism company reached an altitude of 53-and-a-half miles over the New Mexico desert. Branson's rival, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, plans his own flight to space next week. Up next, the panel on Cuba and Afghanistan, but as we go break, former Louisiana Democratic Governor Edwin Edwards died. Edwards spent four terms in the governor's mansion and eight years in federal prison after a corruption conviction. A family spokesman says he died of respiratory problems.

Let's bring back our panel, Trey Gowdy, Harold Ford Jr., and Jesse Watters, co-host of THE FIVE and author of the new book \"How I Saved the World.\" Harold, let me start with you. Obviously, some firm words from the president, secretary of state. Are there Democrats taking a little bit of distrance from this Cuban situation? How do you see it?"

      "utterance": "Let me be clear, I'm not one of those Democrats. I stand with the president in standing with those protesters against a decaying and corrupt and communist regime. I think any American, any American serving in public office has a responsibility to do this. I hope that those Democrats and Republicans alike who have not announced their unwavering support for those protesters, for those seeking freedom, that they will speak up soon and speak up with the same kind of passion they do for issues that bother them in other ways."

And am I optimistic that President Biden can somehow oversee a democratic revolution there, whether he has his hands off or is engineering it from behind the scenes? Absolutely not, if history is any guide. So I think if there is a revolution there, it will be bloody. But it has to come from the Cuban people. And it has to be timed perfectly. But after all of this time, I think I speak for all Americans, it's just maddening that you have a communist outpost 90 miles from the Florida Keys, and everybody here, especially in Florida, wants to see that country free."

      "utterance": "Well, I agree with Congressman Ford. And I would just add to this. Let's don't forget the Cuban government essentially engaged in acoustical warfare against U.S. diplomats. So the Cuban government, whatever bad can happen to them, I support what our role should be. I don't know, Bret, but I also didn't raise my hand to be the leader of the free world. So I'm not expected to have the answer. President Biden is. I'd like him to be as forceful as he can be on behalf of freedom-loving people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Trey, let me ask you this. Afghanistan, that handover is happening now. U.S. troops are going to withdraw this weekend. Admiral Kirby, the Pentagon spokesperson, saying that the counterterrorism effort is going to be over the horizon, and he said like the Libyan model. Your thoughts on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "I think I would pick another model. I don't know what he means by the Libyan model. Is Libya even a country anymore? Here's what I do know. We had some success, but both parties lost interest in Afghanistan. No one that I can recall won in Afghanistan. Alexander the Great fought to a draw and then got out thereof as quickly as he could. I just don't want the men and women who served in Afghanistan to have any ambiguity. We are grateful for your service, even if sometimes it's hard to tell what your service and sacrifice was for."
