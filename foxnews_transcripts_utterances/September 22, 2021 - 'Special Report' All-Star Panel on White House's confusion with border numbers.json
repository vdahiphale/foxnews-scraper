The biggest is the border crisis Del Rio, Texas, the Haitian immigrants. We know some have been released into the U.S. we don't know how many. The DHS has put out a statement saying \"Those who cannot be expelled under Title 42,\" that's the health ruling, \"and do not have a legal basis to remain are placed in expedited or full removal proceedings. Individuals who are not immediately repatriated are either placed in alternatives to detention, detained in an ICE facility, or released with a legal document, either a notice to appear in court or a notice to report to ICE office for further immigration processing. The document an individual receives is dependent on facility space and resources available to process.\" So you can process all of that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's messy. Let's bring in our panel, Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com, Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post.\" What about how this administration is handling this moment, Kimberley, especially when it comes to the border? KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  I think if you step back, one of the problems that Joe Biden just has in his presidency is he has yet to pick a spot. He ran as a moderate, right? And if you look out there, the vast majority of Americans want a secure border, and so that requires him to go and deal with this Haitian problem. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At the same time, he is trying to cater and has been from the beginning to progressives who are demanding policies that are behind the reason why we are having these surges, and the administration seems not willing to change track on those policies. And so you end up with the hits from both sides. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And until this president decides how he is going to govern, I don't see how that changes in any other issue as well as either.",

CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\":  I think it was a little unfair, and the usual hearings grandstanding, to sort of badger Secretary Mayorkas for those numbers now.

There are people moving through Mexico now hoping to get across the border. Although I think if you are against having more of this, you have to at least give the administration credit for doing enough deportations now to deter some people who are thinking about coming. There is some evidence in the reporting that migrants are telling their family members who are on the way that it's not such a good idea. Look, the bottom line here is we do not have law and policy in place to deal with the fact that a lot of people want to come to the United States on the one hand, and on the other hand, a lot of them don't meet the criteria for asylum. Unless and until Republicans get it through their heads that this isn't just something to exploit for political purposes, it's something we really need to do and they can work together with Democrats, and Democrats, on the other hand, get it through their heads that no, we can't have open borders, I think we are going to be stuck in this situation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The reason why maybe that's happening is because Border Patrol has told the administration that there is intelligence that there may be thousands more Haitians goings to the border. And when you have an administration that is standing up at press conferences, during briefings with reporters, and repeatedly telling the American people who are watching that they are not seeing what their eyes can clearly see with camps being set up, with people crossing the river and Border Patrol agents trying to do their jobs and stop them from coming, they can see what's going on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And in terms of what is happening on the ground, there is bipartisan agreement in places like Texas. You had yesterday Governor Greg Abbott with the mayor, who is a Democrat in Del Rio, coming together to address this crisis. The Democratic mayor of Del Rio has begged Joe Biden to visit the border. And the bottom line is until there is a policy change, rather than words from DHS Secretary Mayorkas not to come, that it's a dangerous journey for you, not to send your families, as long as the Biden administration allows family units to stay and for the bar for staying in the United States to be a simple statement of I fear for my life, I'm seeking asylum from my country, and I was persecuted, which is a very low bar, this will continue.

      "utterance": "Just a taste of the White House briefing today as the questions on a number of different fronts a little bit more pointed. The biggest is the border crisis Del Rio, Texas, the Haitian immigrants. We know some have been released into the U.S. we don't know how many. The DHS has put out a statement saying \"Those who cannot be expelled under Title 42,\" that's the health ruling, \"and do not have a legal basis to remain are placed in expedited or full removal proceedings. Individuals who are not immediately repatriated are either placed in alternatives to detention, detained in an ICE facility, or released with a legal document, either a notice to appear in court or a notice to report to ICE office for further immigration processing. The document an individual receives is dependent on facility space and resources available to process.\" So you can process all of that. It's messy. Let's bring in our panel, Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com, Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post.\" What about how this administration is handling this moment, Kimberley, especially when it comes to the border? KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  I think if you step back, one of the problems that Joe Biden just has in his presidency is he has yet to pick a spot. He ran as a moderate, right? And if you look out there, the vast majority of Americans want a secure border, and so that requires him to go and deal with this Haitian problem. At the same time, he is trying to cater and has been from the beginning to progressives who are demanding policies that are behind the reason why we are having these surges, and the administration seems not willing to change track on those policies. And so you end up with the hits from both sides. And until this president decides how he is going to govern, I don't see how that changes in any other issue as well as either."

      "utterance": "We don't have it as of yet, Chuck, but we know from authorities on the ground at the border that they estimate thousands of Haitian immigrants have been released into the U.S. on notice to appear, and we know how that goes. CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\":  I think it was a little unfair, and the usual hearings grandstanding, to sort of badger Secretary Mayorkas for those numbers now. But, yes, it would be helpful to know what the figures are. On the other hand, Bret, I think it's pretty obvious it's a lot of people. Furthermore, it's going to be more people. There are people moving through Mexico now hoping to get across the border. Although I think if you are against having more of this, you have to at least give the administration credit for doing enough deportations now to deter some people who are thinking about coming. There is some evidence in the reporting that migrants are telling their family members who are on the way that it's not such a good idea. Look, the bottom line here is we do not have law and policy in place to deal with the fact that a lot of people want to come to the United States on the one hand, and on the other hand, a lot of them don't meet the criteria for asylum. Unless and until Republicans get it through their heads that this isn't just something to exploit for political purposes, it's something we really need to do and they can work together with Democrats, and Democrats, on the other hand, get it through their heads that no, we can't have open borders, I think we are going to be stuck in this situation."

Katie, obviously they are concerned about border security. Tonight, NBC is reporting that the Biden administration is seeking a private contractor to operate a migrant detention facility at Guantanamo Bay with a requirement that some of the guards speak Spanish and Haitian Creole. That would be quite a turn for Gitmo if that, in fact, happens. And you wonder what the Democrat response to that will be."

    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "File that suggestion in the if President Trump did it, and I'm sure the media would have a very different take on that even suggestion of what's going on. The reason why maybe that's happening is because Border Patrol has told the administration that there is intelligence that there may be thousands more Haitians goings to the border. And when you have an administration that is standing up at press conferences, during briefings with reporters, and repeatedly telling the American people who are watching that they are not seeing what their eyes can clearly see with camps being set up, with people crossing the river and Border Patrol agents trying to do their jobs and stop them from coming, they can see what's going on. And in terms of what is happening on the ground, there is bipartisan agreement in places like Texas. You had yesterday Governor Greg Abbott with the mayor, who is a Democrat in Del Rio, coming together to address this crisis. The Democratic mayor of Del Rio has begged Joe Biden to visit the border. And the bottom line is until there is a policy change, rather than words from DHS Secretary Mayorkas not to come, that it's a dangerous journey for you, not to send your families, as long as the Biden administration allows family units to stay and for the bar for staying in the United States to be a simple statement of I fear for my life, I'm seeking asylum from my country, and I was persecuted, which is a very low bar, this will continue. This will absolutely continue, and we'll continue to see these horrific humanitarian situations playing out on the border."

Things are not settled at the border. We have just been through the whole list. There's a lot of downside to putting a president, any president, in front of the press, especially, as you pointed out, an aggressive press, and risking those questions and answers. I think they would rather have some good news to report before they went out and did another press conference."

Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, former Congresswoman and Army Reservist Tulsi Gabbard back deployment in Africa to go after Al-Qaeda affiliated jihadists. She will talk to us about the state of affairs today. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.
