Let's see if we share any of these. Now, this year, when we went down to the border and we brought you the ongoing chaos there. Much of this was caused by Biden's decisions. When he came into office, the President overturned Trump's Remain in Mexico policy. He threatened to end Title 42. That's the health measure that allowed agents to turn migrants away at the border. And he stopped construction of the wall. Well, less than a year later, Biden has found some border policies that work. He has reinstituted the Remain in Mexico policy, kept Title 42 in place, and he's authorized the construction of parts of the Trump wall. Congratulations. This little experiment at the border by the way saw more than 1.7 million migrants cross illegally this year. That's an all-time high. And those are only the ones the border agents encountered. Now, here's the wonderful news. You get to pay for their care and well being for years to come. Merry Festivus. Now, speaking of care and well being. I have a huge grievance over the emotive concern we have four people from foreign countries, like Afghanistan and these migrants, God bless them. But all the while we ignore the care and well being of our own veterans. When THE INGRAHAM ANGLE discovered a tent encampment on the streets of Los Angeles, a village of homeless vets unable to get into a facility donated for them. We were naturally enraged. And while the vets can now camp on the grounds of the facility, they are still outdoors and not in permanent housing. Meanwhile, Afghan refugees and illegal immigrants are housed at taxpayer expense in places like the Bethesda Hyatt Regency Hotel. Now, this misplaced concern needs correction in the new year. And I have a huge grievance against media misinformation. We hear that term a lot. The American people are not stupid. They can see what's going on, trying to convince them that inflation is good for us. And Joe Biden is the man he was 20 years ago. It is not working, guys. Not on any level. And here's another grievance. Stop trying to take credit for things that are not true, especially you, Jen Psaki.",

It has been the rise of the Americans, of the deplorables, of the parents who have said, no more.

They're not on offense. And, look, even President Biden admitted this week in the interview with ABC, that he has failed on the pandemic, that they should have done better. There was no strategy in place. And we also saw with Afghanistan that the decision making that - of that group, of that team, of that administration, they failed the Afghan people, they failed the Americans, they failed our Military.

Joining me now, Harmeet Dhillon, she's the civil rights attorney and managing partner at the Dhillon Law Group. Harmeet, the circuit courts were split on the constitutionality of these mandates.

So right now, that's the one where we are trying to get the Supreme Court to change the position of the lower court. What we are seeking is simply a ruling that is consistent with all of the statutory basis that covers OSHA. Namely that OSHA does not have the power. Congress never granted OSHA the power to mandate to employers to take a particular drug, to classify workers as hazardous substances in the workplace and to impose regulations without any kind of notice and comment and regulations that are frankly illogical. So these are the things that we're petitioning the court for. The court has agreed to hear to - to petitioners in this case.",

These are arbitrary, illogical, ineffective, and frankly, I think unsafe mandates even if they were permitted by Congress, which they aren't. And another point, Raymond, is that employers don't want to be in the position of getting into this information with their employees, because it actually puts them at legal risk. If you then go on to want to fire an employee who's doing a bad job, sleeping on the job, or whatever, you are suddenly going to be accused of disability discrimination if you are firing somebody who chose not to get vaccinated, or maybe didn't have the right number of shots.

But it's important to remember why it took this bill so long to pass in the first place. Not only was it opposed by the Biden administration, but corporate America didn't like it either. So how do you make sure the Biden administration rigorously enforces the law and corporations like Nike and Apple don't exploit the loopholes? For answers we turn to Steven Mosher, author of \"The Bully of Asia,\" and foreign affairs analyst Walid Phares. Thank you both for being here. Steven, even the president of the U.S.-China Chamber of Commerce admitted he doesn't know how they will implement this law or enforce it. Are you confident they can? STEVEN MOSHER, AUTHOR, \"BULLY OF ASIA\": No, I'm not confident the Biden administration will enforce any laws passed by the U.S. Congress, quite frankly. We've had laws on the books, Raymond, banning the impartation of goods made with slave labor since 1932, prison labor. It was passed because of the use of prison labor, slave labor in the Soviet Union, to keep those goods out of the United States. I testified two decades ago before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about prison made goods that were flooding into the U.S. even then. So these laws exist. We've got 2 million Uighurs in prison in eastern Turkestan, what the Chinese Xinjiang, right now, making goods for export in many cases. They are forced to work seven days a week. All it takes is the political will to enforce the old law on the books and now this new law. But that strength of will, especially when it comes to China, seems to be missing from the White House. You mentioned the Biden administration opposed this bill. It was only because people like Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Chris Smith that it was passed unanimously in Congress. It imposes sanctions on individuals, but you have to actually impose the sanctions. The Trump administration did that.",

WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP 2020 MIDDLE EAST ADVISER: You are absolutely right, but we have a much larger problem, which is the following. The Chinese leadership does not believe the Biden administration is going to implement serious sanctions, it's going to go after China, not just because of the Uighurs, others, Hong Long, and many other issues related to Chinese quality, because of many reasons we need to pay attention to, one of which is how this administration has conducted foreign policy near China. The withdrawal from Afghanistan was catastrophic. The Chinese saw that. What we are doing now with the Iran deal, the Chinese saw that, and also of course because of our domestic situation, which we can talk about.

Let's see if we share any of these. Now, this year, when we went down to the border and we brought you the ongoing chaos there. Much of this was caused by Biden's decisions. When he came into office, the President overturned Trump's Remain in Mexico policy. He threatened to end Title 42. That's the health measure that allowed agents to turn migrants away at the border. And he stopped construction of the wall. Well, less than a year later, Biden has found some border policies that work. He has reinstituted the Remain in Mexico policy, kept Title 42 in place, and he's authorized the construction of parts of the Trump wall. Congratulations. This little experiment at the border by the way saw more than 1.7 million migrants cross illegally this year. That's an all-time high. And those are only the ones the border agents encountered. Now, here's the wonderful news. You get to pay for their care and well being for years to come. Merry Festivus. Now, speaking of care and well being. I have a huge grievance over the emotive concern we have four people from foreign countries, like Afghanistan and these migrants, God bless them. But all the while we ignore the care and well being of our own veterans. When THE INGRAHAM ANGLE discovered a tent encampment on the streets of Los Angeles, a village of homeless vets unable to get into a facility donated for them. We were naturally enraged. And while the vets can now camp on the grounds of the facility, they are still outdoors and not in permanent housing. Meanwhile, Afghan refugees and illegal immigrants are housed at taxpayer expense in places like the Bethesda Hyatt Regency Hotel. Now, this misplaced concern needs correction in the new year. And I have a huge grievance against media misinformation. We hear that term a lot. The American people are not stupid. They can see what's going on, trying to convince them that inflation is good for us. And Joe Biden is the man he was 20 years ago. It is not working, guys. Not on any level. And here's another grievance. Stop trying to take credit for things that are not true, especially you, Jen Psaki."

But you know, I do think that in the midst of President Biden, really pushing the fact that those that are unvaccinated are going to have a very dark and very dreary winter. You know, I really remain hopeful. I really feel that there has been a rise of the American people that we are strong, that we are resilient, that we will fight back against what I see are forced vaccine mandates, and fight back against these unfair, really radical policies like CRT and this gender confusion that they're pushing on our schools. It has been the rise of the Americans, of the deplorables, of the parents who have said, no more.

HORACE COOPER, PROJECT 21 CO-CHAIRMAN: Well, first, let me say, Merry Christmas, because this is a wonderful time to celebrate the greatest gift of all. I wish that as we head into 2022, that people like our Vice President and other Americans actually took some responsibility for their actions. You know, it's said, that if you're digging a hole, and you're down to 28 percent approval rating, maybe you just stop digging. Maybe you should reverse course. There have been a myriad number of very, very bad policies. The great thing about America is: one, we've got some elections coming up; but two, it's our resilience.

What you - there's so much dysfunction happening in this White House, because you really don't know who's in charge. And in essence, when you're getting one negative poll after the other, when you have a president that you don't feel is strong enough to lead, when you've had one policy failure after the other, that puts an enormous amount of stress on the staff, because what's happening is that they're on defense. They're not on offense. And, look, even President Biden admitted this week in the interview with ABC, that he has failed on the pandemic, that they should have done better. There was no strategy in place. And we also saw with Afghanistan that the decision making that - of that group, of that team, of that administration, they failed the Afghan people, they failed the Americans, they failed our Military. And on the economy, this is the driving issue for the election next year. And all we keep hearing is inflation, higher food prices, higher gas prices.

Even though that's not a dose given in humans are recommended, it does raise some questions. So the drug molnupiravir from Merck should not be given to children or pregnant women, in my opinion. It can be life saving, so there could be a risk-benefit analysis to do there. But we've got paxlovid from Pfizer. It does not have the concern of mutagenesis, and it cut COVID deaths to zero.

So right now, that's the one where we are trying to get the Supreme Court to change the position of the lower court. What we are seeking is simply a ruling that is consistent with all of the statutory basis that covers OSHA. Namely that OSHA does not have the power. Congress never granted OSHA the power to mandate to employers to take a particular drug, to classify workers as hazardous substances in the workplace and to impose regulations without any kind of notice and comment and regulations that are frankly illogical. So these are the things that we're petitioning the court for. The court has agreed to hear to - to petitioners in this case."

And the idea that that's some kind of an appropriate barrier as opposed to, by the way, completely ignoring natural immunity, which clearly provides significant protection for many people. These are arbitrary, illogical, ineffective, and frankly, I think unsafe mandates even if they were permitted by Congress, which they aren't. And another point, Raymond, is that employers don't want to be in the position of getting into this information with their employees, because it actually puts them at legal risk. If you then go on to want to fire an employee who's doing a bad job, sleeping on the job, or whatever, you are suddenly going to be accused of disability discrimination if you are firing somebody who chose not to get vaccinated, or maybe didn't have the right number of shots. We don't something want to be in that position as employers. That's another harmful consideration."

Now, America should hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its atrocities and keep their goods made with slave labor out of our market. But it's important to remember why it took this bill so long to pass in the first place. Not only was it opposed by the Biden administration, but corporate America didn't like it either. So how do you make sure the Biden administration rigorously enforces the law and corporations like Nike and Apple don't exploit the loopholes? For answers we turn to Steven Mosher, author of \"The Bully of Asia,\" and foreign affairs analyst Walid Phares. Thank you both for being here. Steven, even the president of the U.S.-China Chamber of Commerce admitted he doesn't know how they will implement this law or enforce it. Are you confident they can? STEVEN MOSHER, AUTHOR, \"BULLY OF ASIA\": No, I'm not confident the Biden administration will enforce any laws passed by the U.S. Congress, quite frankly. We've had laws on the books, Raymond, banning the impartation of goods made with slave labor since 1932, prison labor. It was passed because of the use of prison labor, slave labor in the Soviet Union, to keep those goods out of the United States. I testified two decades ago before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about prison made goods that were flooding into the U.S. even then. So these laws exist. We've got 2 million Uighurs in prison in eastern Turkestan, what the Chinese Xinjiang, right now, making goods for export in many cases. They are forced to work seven days a week. All it takes is the political will to enforce the old law on the books and now this new law. But that strength of will, especially when it comes to China, seems to be missing from the White House. You mentioned the Biden administration opposed this bill. It was only because people like Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman Chris Smith that it was passed unanimously in Congress. It imposes sanctions on individuals, but you have to actually impose the sanctions. The Trump administration did that."

How do you ensure that they don't wash those goods and those items through other parts of China, move them through Hong Kong and then to the United States? WALID PHARES, FORMER TRUMP 2020 MIDDLE EAST ADVISER: You are absolutely right, but we have a much larger problem, which is the following. The Chinese leadership does not believe the Biden administration is going to implement serious sanctions, it's going to go after China, not just because of the Uighurs, others, Hong Long, and many other issues related to Chinese quality, because of many reasons we need to pay attention to, one of which is how this administration has conducted foreign policy near China. The withdrawal from Afghanistan was catastrophic. The Chinese saw that. What we are doing now with the Iran deal, the Chinese saw that, and also of course because of our domestic situation, which we can talk about. So Beijing believes that the Biden administration, though they signed off on this legislation, are not going to take the posture of fighting, politically fighting with China."

We are not in real good shape ourselves, but they're in very, very bad shape. And as far as sanctioning members of the Chinese Communist Party, last year during the Trump administration, they sanctioned Chen Quanguo, the party chief of Xinjiang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party's politburo, the first time a member of the politburo had ever been sanctioned. The order to illuminate the Uighurs, to commit genocide on the Uighurs in eastern Turkestan came from Xi Jinping himself, so he is the one who should be sanctioned.

Many of them rotting in Chinese prisons tonight. Gentlemen, thank you both, merry Christmas. A satanic display is featured next to a nativity in the Illinois state house. You will not believe this. Reverend Franklin Graham is here on what this says about the state of our country and what we should be focused on. Don't go away."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. Imagine walking into your state's capital during the week of Christmas and seeing this monstrosity. It's a so-called art display in Illinois depicting the satanic figure Baphomet as a baby. It sits right next to the nativity. It's so obvious what the Satanic Temple, the group who put this thing on, is doing. They are mocking religious expression and the nativity. Joining me now is Reverend Franklin Graham. He's president and CEO of Samaritan's Purse. Reverend Graham, merry Christmas. Your reaction to this blasphemous image at the Illinois capital?"

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, the devil has been trying to destroy Christmas for 2,000 years when King Herod sent his troops to Bethlehem to hunt for the baby Jesus to kill him. And so the devil has been trying to destroy Christmas ever since, and this is just another very sad attempt. But Christmas is about God's love. It's not about the Satanic Temple. It's about God so loving this world that he sent his son Jesus Christ to this earth to take our sins. Jesus died for our sins. He was buried. He rose again. He's alive. If we are willing to repent, turn from those sins, and put our faith and trust in him, God will forgive our sins and he's heal our hearts, and he'll invite us to be with him for eternity. But this is what Christmas is all about. It's about God loving this earth and loving you and loving me."

It's now about three in 10 adults who consider themselves religious-nons, which are atheist or agnostics or just nothing. Why is this happening? And what can the church do about it?"

    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the church has got a lot of work to do, and we need to be doing evangelism. We need to be sharing with people how they can have a relationship with God through faith in Christ. I'm not talking about religion. There's a lot of religion in the world. I'm talking about how you can have a relationship with God, and that's through faith in his son, Jesus Christ. So I think we've got a lot of work. I'm certainly not going to be out of a job, I don't think, because there's a lot of work to do. And I hope that pastors and churches across this country will be willing to preach and tell others how they can have that relationship with Jesus Christ."

I know our producer, every year she and her son stuffs their shoe box, presents are donated and delivered to children all over the world who may otherwise get nothing. How many gifts are you set to distribute this Christmas?"

      "utterance": "This year we've taken in just a little over 10 million, I think it's about 10.2 million shoe boxes, and this will be delivered to children in 110 different countries. And so it's an incredible program, and these are children who have nothing, children when you give them a gift, for many it's the only gift they've ever received in their life. And the joy and the hope that it gives them, and the fact that they know that there's somebody out there loves them, somebody out there hasn't forgotten them. And I want the children of the world to know the true meaning of Christmas, about God's love."

Samaritan's Purse is also putting a lot of effort, I know, into helping those devastated by the tornadoes in Kentucky and Arkansas. Franklin, you have hundreds of volunteers on the ground right now. What are you doing to help, what can viewers do to help, and how are you spending your Christmas Eve?"

They can go to our website, Samaritanspurse.org, and find out how they can volunteer or how they can be a part of helping this relief effort. But I'm going to be there Christmas Eve. We are going to serve a Christmas lunch to about 5,000 people. Ricky Skaggs is going to be with me, and we are going to serve from 11:00 to about 3:00 in the afternoon. And it's for everybody in the Mayfield area. They can come by and have a free lunch. And Ricky will play, and I'm going to say a few words to them. And so then we work on Christmas, we will have teams of people working through Christmas. We don't take Christmas off. The people up there need our help now, and I think it's important that we stay there true Christmas helping them."
