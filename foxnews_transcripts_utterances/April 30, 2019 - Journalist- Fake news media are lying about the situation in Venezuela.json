Two factions both claiming to be the legitimate government of the country. The beginnings of what could easily become a brutal Civil War. Meanwhile, thousands of miles to the north here in Washington, our foreign policy establishment pushes for American intervention -- U.S. troops in Venezuela. Yet, another conflict in a faraway place.

For that, we're going to go to Trace Gallagher who is -- actually, I'm correcting now, we're going to go right to Caracas, Venezuela and speak to Juan Carlos Lamas who is on the ground there.

Violence followed as people took to the streets, all across the country with erupting clashes between opposition supporters and armed military vehicles as protesters threw rocks and Molotov bombs, they were repelled by tear gas and water cannon. At one point, an armored car drove directly into a crowd, buses were set on fire here in Caracas and dozens of people have been reported injured across the country. The political situation meanwhile remains incredibly fluid.

What we do know is that Venezuela's current government has done a poor job of providing for its own people. Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves, yet it remains one of the most impoverished and the most dangerous places on the planet. That is beyond dispute. Everything else is up for debate. Will the overthrow of Maduro make Venezuela a more stable and prosperous country? More to the point, would it be good for the United States? Lots of people claims to know the answer to that, but they don't. They have no idea. If recent history is any guide, nothing will turn out as expected, few things ever do.

You will just do it.\" Assuming you are a good person, of course, if you don't care about families or the human race, if for some reason you despise human happiness and support genocide, then you will want to join Satan's team and embrace isolationism, the single most immoral of all worldviews. That is what they're telling you. That is what they are demanding you believe. Message is received. We've heard it before. But before the bombers take off, let's just answer a few quick questions starting with the most obvious, when was the last time we successfully meddled in the political life of another country? Has it ever worked? How are the democracies we set up in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, and Afghanistan tonight? How would Venezuela be different? Please explain and take your time. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Next, are we prepared for the refugees a Venezuelan war would inevitably produce? A study by the Brookings Institution found that the collapse of the Venezuelan government could force eight million people to leave the country. Many of them would come here. Lawmakers in this country propose giving them temporary protected status that would let even illegal arrivals live and work here, in effect, permanently as many have before with no fear of deportation. Are we prepared for that? Are we prepared to absorb millions of new Venezuelan migrants? All of them great people, no question, but many with little education or skills or English. Finally, how exactly is any of this good for the United States? Our sanctions on Venezuela have already spiked our gas prices, that hurts our struggling middle class more than virtually anything we could do, so what's is the point of doing that? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So our lawmakers can feel like good people? And if they are indeed good people, why did they care more about Venezuela than they care about this country? The one that they run. They are happy to send our military to South America at the first sign of chaos, but U.S. troops to our own border to stem the tide of a hundred thousand uninvited arrivals a month? \"No way,\" they tell us. That is crazy talk. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So what is the thinking here? To find out, we are joined tonight by Congressman Mario-Diaz Balart of Florida. Congressman, thanks very much for coming on. So I can see a lot of ways this would be helpful to factions within Venezuela, maybe to the country as a whole. How would intervening in Venezuela help your constituents, American citizens?",

He is now 76 and you know, I think he has got credit with a lot of Democrats for being a loyal Vice President to President Obama whom they all appreciated and he's been around a long time. He has been pretty liberal. He has fought on the side of the left on most issues and so he's got some standing and remember, you know, for all of the energy that's coming from the young wing of the Democratic Party from the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's and the rest, you know, most Democrats aren't young. They're older and know they're comfortable with Joe Biden. He is able to raise money, so he is going to be with us a while. Now, he has flamed out in the other two times he tried it. In 1988, he was found to have plagiarized huge chunks of a speech by British Labour leader, Neil Kinnock and that did it for him then. There were also questions about things in his resume and then and when he ran in '08, I guess it was '08, he finished fifth in Iowa and that was the end of him.

It's probably over. 20th Century Fox Television, which is now owned by the Disney Corporation says that while Smollett remains under contract with the network, it currently has quote, \"no plans to bring back his character on the show \"Empire.\"' Members of \"Empire's\" cast and crew recently signed an open letter calling for Smollett's return saying he is quote, \"filled with integrity and simply the victim of a racist justice system,\" like so many. We will continue to follow this story in the hope that maybe there is justice someday. Amazon is a high tech company, but when it comes to employee quality of life, they have a lot in common with -- I don't know -- the ancient Egyptians. Now, they have invented a computer that can fire people without any human input at all. Brett Larson of Fox News Headlines 24/7 is on our brave new world beat. He joins us with more on that, plus an update on all the ways Google can spy on you at home. Hey, Brett. BRETT LARSON, HEADLINES 24/7 ANCHOR: Hey, Tucker. This is how it starts. Google has some ideas on what you should wear and Amazon can now fire employees as you mentioned without the need for any human interaction. Now, we have already heard and seen the stories inside of Amazon's warehouses and the conditions those workers face, but as the online shopping behemoth continues to grow, it is placing an increased need on warehouse workers. Forget Spacely Sprockets. You are literally a cog in the wheel at an Amazon Factory where they use a system to track your productivity to the point that some workers skip bathroom breaks. There have also been reports that Amazon's delivery drivers are so pressured to keep up with demands of their job. They're not just skipping bathroom breaks or making use of their time behind the wheel to relieve themselves into bottles, they're actually doing that. They're also skipping stop signs and ignoring speed limits. And worse if the system decides a worker isn't meeting productivity targets, it will automatically issue a warning and even terminate employment. Though Amazon says, a supervisor can override this system. And Google filed a patent last week that shows the tech giant wants to do the thinking for you. The patent application describes a Home Assistant that would keep track of items you have worn for future suggestions. It lists the example of the Home Assistant telling the user quote, \"Why not try switching your black shoes for the tan pair you wore on Tuesday?\" And if you're wondering who left the dirty dish on the kitchen counter, Google will know the answer, quote \"Jane Doe placed the dish there at 1:23 p.m. on Thursday April 27th.\" This is all on par for Google of course. Google critics have described the company's business model as surveillance capitalism. We looked deep into that. The user is the product as Google uses your data and your everyday behavior to show you increasingly more relevant advertising. Apparently, maybe even some new roommates that will put their stuff away.",

So it doesn't make any theological sense. It doesn't make any sense other than the political use of Muslims as a prop to say they defend minorities and somehow absolve themselves of the guilt of whatever it is and ignoring actual Muslim issues related to the real Civil Rights fight of the 21st Century which is inside the mosques, inside Iran, Saudi Arabia and across the world where women are at the back of the mosques, not at the front of the mosques.",

The other networks are all over it. Breaking news. Well, tonight, the DOJ tells us in part, we're going to quote this, \"After the Attorney General received Special Counsel Mueller's letter, he called him to discuss it. In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General's March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading, but he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel's obstruction analysis.\" Of course, the entire report has now been released, so if we could just summarize it for you, is Trump a Russian agent? Many people said he was, it turns out, he is not. Not a Russian agent. Kind of what you need to know. Defeated gubernatorial candidate, Stacey Abrams of Georgia has announced she is not running for the Senate seat open in Georgia next year and she has not decided whether she is going to run for President or not, but she doesn't really need to run for anything, she's already considered a frontrunner to be for the 2020 Democratic Vice Presidential pick, no matter who the nominee is. And that's a little worrisome since Abrams seems a little delusional. We're not being mean, assess for yourself. In a new interview with \"The New Yorker\" magazine, Abrams says that she won her 2018 gubernatorial race against Brian Kemp. That she won. She is the Governor. The funny thing is though, she lost, in fact she lost by 55,000 votes. That's about 1.5 percent of all votes cast, but it doesn't matter. Abrams believes the right thing. She went to Yale, so apparently, the election must have been stolen. Three years ago, Donald Trump said he wanted to wait until the election to accept the results and that was taken as an attack on democracy and yet, by 2020 in the Democratic Party, admitting defeat will be treason or colluding with Russia. Things change fast. Handshakes for several thousand years probably since we left the caves or even before have been a sign of goodwill. Literally, they're depicted on pots from 500 BC, but now everything is changing. Everything is turned upside down and many things are being abolished because the woke generation just won't have them. A survey by the website Total Jobs found that many would like to see a ban of all physical contacts, complete physical contact, including handshakes in the workplace. This would be done in order to avoid any confusion over what contact is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Tammy Bruce has been around long enough to know what's acceptable. She is a radio host, President of Independent Women's Voice, sits in and this seat when I'm gone. She is our friend. She joins us tonight. I'd shake your hand, but it makes me a little nervous all of a sudden. Should we get -- do away with handshakes?",

It's a gesture about agreeing, it's about meeting, it's a sign that you can be trusted, part of it is, is that you're allowing that other person, yes, to take away effectively an archaic sense of the bill of the notion of it, your weapon hand, that you're suddenly -- you're not able to reach for a weapon or you would not be handling a weapon because you've been stopped from doing so. And you offer that in a friendly fashion, so that's instinctually it's key, but for women especially, men have always of course had done the handshake now as women entered the workforce and now, as we go into more jobs and have more important positions, that is a genuine gesture that men have enjoyed and now women are in exactly the same position and can deliver that same hand shake. Now, I personally have practiced my handshake. I think it's important to make sure that it's serious and it's a balance between being strong without hurting someone and it's secure and it matters.

And let me just tell you when it comes to a what is happening on the ground there, I can tell you, I was there for a month earlier this year. The opposition has no popular support. Juan Guaido proved today once again that he will only ride into power on the back of a U.S. tank and what's more? We hear about a humanitarian crisis there, Tucker, but we never hear is that is the intended result of U.S. sanctions which have targeted Venezuela since 2015, sanctions which according to a report that was released just last week by the Center for Economic and Policy Research has led to the deaths of 40,000 Venezuelans and will lead to the deaths of thousands more if these sanctions are not overturned. President Trump if he truly cared about the Venezuelan people and the American people for that matter, he would end the disastrous policy.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” widespread political violence erupted in Venezuela today. Two factions both claiming to be the legitimate government of the country. The beginnings of what could easily become a brutal Civil War. Meanwhile, thousands of miles to the north here in Washington, our foreign policy establishment pushes for American intervention -- U.S. troops in Venezuela. Yet, another conflict in a faraway place. Suddenly that looks entirely possible. We'll have much more on this developing story throughout the night, but we want to begin with an assessment of what exactly is happening in Venezuela right now. For that, we're going to go to Trace Gallagher who is -- actually, I'm correcting now, we're going to go right to Caracas, Venezuela and speak to Juan Carlos Lamas who is on the ground there. Oh there he is. Juan Carlos, thank you for joining us. What is happening?"

      "speaker": "JUAN CARLOS LAMAS, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well violent street battles have robbed it across the capital of Caracas after a very dramatic morning. Juan Guaido urged Venezuelans to take part in what he calls operation freedom in a final push to topple President Nicolas Maduro,. Guaido said he had the support of the brave soldiers in Caracas and he calls on the military to help him end Maduro's rule trying to encourage them saying that they will be on the right side of history if they were to support him. Violence followed as people took to the streets, all across the country with erupting clashes between opposition supporters and armed military vehicles as protesters threw rocks and Molotov bombs, they were repelled by tear gas and water cannon. At one point, an armored car drove directly into a crowd, buses were set on fire here in Caracas and dozens of people have been reported injured across the country. The political situation meanwhile remains incredibly fluid. May 1st, May Day, the traditional workers holiday comes tomorrow, schools and offices will be closed and no plans announced by the opposition so far to take to the streets in the following days."

What we do know is that Venezuela's current government has done a poor job of providing for its own people. Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves, yet it remains one of the most impoverished and the most dangerous places on the planet. That is beyond dispute. Everything else is up for debate. Will the overthrow of Maduro make Venezuela a more stable and prosperous country? More to the point, would it be good for the United States? Lots of people claims to know the answer to that, but they don't. They have no idea. If recent history is any guide, nothing will turn out as expected, few things ever do. But that has not stopped the geniuses in Washington, it has not even slowed them down. This afternoon, on a bipartisan basis, they agreed that the United States ought to jump immediately face first into the Venezuelan mess. Watch Florida senator, Rick Scott explain."

So we can make sure something happens now or we can deal with this for decades to come. If we care about families, if we care about the human race, if we care about fellow worldwide citizens, then we've got to step up and stop this genocide."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "All right, I just want to make sure that it is clear. \"If you care about families and you care about the human race, if you want to stop genocide, you will send your children to Venezuela to fight right now, without even thinking about it, without even weighing the consequences. You will just do it.\" Assuming you are a good person, of course, if you don't care about families or the human race, if for some reason you despise human happiness and support genocide, then you will want to join Satan's team and embrace isolationism, the single most immoral of all worldviews. That is what they're telling you. That is what they are demanding you believe. Message is received. We've heard it before. But before the bombers take off, let's just answer a few quick questions starting with the most obvious, when was the last time we successfully meddled in the political life of another country? Has it ever worked? How are the democracies we set up in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, and Afghanistan tonight? How would Venezuela be different? Please explain and take your time. Next, are we prepared for the refugees a Venezuelan war would inevitably produce? A study by the Brookings Institution found that the collapse of the Venezuelan government could force eight million people to leave the country. Many of them would come here. Lawmakers in this country propose giving them temporary protected status that would let even illegal arrivals live and work here, in effect, permanently as many have before with no fear of deportation. Are we prepared for that? Are we prepared to absorb millions of new Venezuelan migrants? All of them great people, no question, but many with little education or skills or English. Finally, how exactly is any of this good for the United States? Our sanctions on Venezuela have already spiked our gas prices, that hurts our struggling middle class more than virtually anything we could do, so what's is the point of doing that? So our lawmakers can feel like good people? And if they are indeed good people, why did they care more about Venezuela than they care about this country? The one that they run. They are happy to send our military to South America at the first sign of chaos, but U.S. troops to our own border to stem the tide of a hundred thousand uninvited arrivals a month? \"No way,\" they tell us. That is crazy talk. So what is the thinking here? To find out, we are joined tonight by Congressman Mario-Diaz Balart of Florida. Congressman, thanks very much for coming on. So I can see a lot of ways this would be helpful to factions within Venezuela, maybe to the country as a whole. How would intervening in Venezuela help your constituents, American citizens?"

We know that we have Chinese presence in Venezuela. So is that a potential risk for the national security interest of the United States? Absolutely. The question is, of that is the case, and you know, some may disagree that having all of those folks there is a problem, I don't. I think it is a national security threat to the United States. If that's the case, what steps should the United States do to protect our national security interest?"

It is the largest refugee crisis this hemisphere has ever seen and by the way, we spend a lot of time obviously focusing on the Middle East. There are more refugees that have left Venezuela than left Syria."

Look, the reason the Venezuelans are in Colombia and Brazil, again, you know, over three million have already left Venezuela and the forecast are that if the Maduro regime persists and that to the point that you were making, you are going to have another five million leaving. So that is caused by that regime. So it is in our interest if all we care about is stopping that from happening, we have to do what we can to make sure that that regime is no longer there."

But let me just ask you really quickly. Everyone in Washington bipartisan, not just you, lots of Democrats do, for these sanctions on Venezuela because the government is bad. I think the government is bad, I agree. Fine. But those sanctions have increased the price of gasoline for middle-class Americans because why exactly? How to they benefit from that?

That is in and of itself is something we should be concerned about. The second thing is, our interest there are not so crystal-clear. First of all, we don't need to control the Venezuelan oil market, which is on the minds of many people right now inside the beltway. We are a net exporter of oil, so we don't need to reassert our dominance in that market which we were dominant in for many, many decades. The second thing is, it's a lose-lose proposition for us. We are playing puppet master. We want to replace Maduro, the communist with Guaido, the socialist. Guaido is going to inherit all of the problems that brought Chavez to power, a huge under class, which wants to be permanently dependent upon the government and expects to be cared for. He has got to do that. If we are going to put him into power and keep him into power, we have to spend billions of dollars to keep him there. So we turn Venezuela into the 51st state effectively pouring resources into keeping him there. Over time our history in Latin America is a disaster. We will incur the hostility of the population. They will want us ultimately to leave and if he is viewed as a puppet, he is going to have trouble lasting."

Why is that not going to happen in 20 years from now with Venezuela?"

But here is what is important because the Congressman brought this up, all of the threats that he discussed are in Mexico. They are actually in greater numbers in Hezbollah, in terrorist organizations connected to the Middle East and Africa. They are greater and stronger in Mexico than they are in Venezuela. The Venezuelan army transships drugs."

He has got 15 percent support and the rest of the field barely even shows up in the numbers. So based on that poll anyway, the odds are pretty good that a year from now Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee. What will that mean for America?

Not like you. You should be nervous. In fact, just last week, Joe Biden, the same Joe Biden was praising Antifa -- in other words, violent lunatics in blackface masks are more moral than you are. All right, so what exactly is Biden's plan to make America more moral? A silly question. He doesn't have a plan. Just last month, he was attacking due process under the law as a tool of white male supremacy. Biden is the kind of guy who will say anything if he thinks it is useful. He probably doesn't even understand half of what he says. But he's winning anyway, and that raises a very interesting question about the Democratic Party and it has nothing to do with Joe Biden really. If there's one thing that unites Democrats in 2019, it's attacking people for their sex and their skin color. Just today, the leading progressive philosopher, Joy Behar, explained that even impoverished white men are in fact privileged, way more privileged than Oprah and must therefore be punished."

White male privilege is ubiquitous. Even white men with no privilege at all have that kind of privilege. All Democrats agree with that. But here's the funny thing, it's hard to understand. Democrats keep telling pollsters that they prefer rich white men for President, the most privileged white men for President. Today, it's Joe Biden, tomorrow it could be Bernie Sanders or Beto O'Rourke or Pete Buttigieg. It's probably not ever going to be Stacey Abrams or Al Sharpton -- ever -- in a million years, it will not be them. So what's going on here? Could it be that once again, the left is projecting?

I think right now Bernie Sanders probably has the best organization of all the candidates, but when it comes to identity politics, you know, people really care about issues first and foremost and yes, we care about representation, we care about equality, but as well as the issues.

B, Pete Buttigieg or whatever his name is, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana doesn't have any kind of organization. He came out of nowhere and the Party fell in love with him because he was a white man, he looks like to me. I don't really see another explanation. And why isn't Stacey Abrams, who just had the last election stolen from her according to Democrats, who went to Yale, why isn't she the front-runner? I'm asking a sincere question. I mean I believe in merit, okay, but the Democrats don't. They believe in race, so why is she not the front-runner, but these rich white guys are, for real?"

He is now 76 and you know, I think he has got credit with a lot of Democrats for being a loyal Vice President to President Obama whom they all appreciated and he's been around a long time. He has been pretty liberal. He has fought on the side of the left on most issues and so he's got some standing and remember, you know, for all of the energy that's coming from the young wing of the Democratic Party from the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's and the rest, you know, most Democrats aren't young. They're older and know they're comfortable with Joe Biden. He is able to raise money, so he is going to be with us a while. Now, he has flamed out in the other two times he tried it. In 1988, he was found to have plagiarized huge chunks of a speech by British Labour leader, Neil Kinnock and that did it for him then. There were also questions about things in his resume and then and when he ran in '08, I guess it was '08, he finished fifth in Iowa and that was the end of him. So he has never been a tremendously effective presidential candidate, but he's got more experience now. He is also older.

Now, we have already heard and seen the stories inside of Amazon's warehouses and the conditions those workers face, but as the online shopping behemoth continues to grow, it is placing an increased need on warehouse workers. Forget Spacely Sprockets. You are literally a cog in the wheel at an Amazon Factory where they use a system to track your productivity to the point that some workers skip bathroom breaks. There have also been reports that Amazon's delivery drivers are so pressured to keep up with demands of their job. They're not just skipping bathroom breaks or making use of their time behind the wheel to relieve themselves into bottles, they're actually doing that. They're also skipping stop signs and ignoring speed limits. And worse if the system decides a worker isn't meeting productivity targets, it will automatically issue a warning and even terminate employment. Though Amazon says, a supervisor can override this system. And Google filed a patent last week that shows the tech giant wants to do the thinking for you. The patent application describes a Home Assistant that would keep track of items you have worn for future suggestions. It lists the example of the Home Assistant telling the user quote, \"Why not try switching your black shoes for the tan pair you wore on Tuesday?\" And if you're wondering who left the dirty dish on the kitchen counter, Google will know the answer, quote \"Jane Doe placed the dish there at 1:23 p.m. on Thursday April 27th.\" This is all on par for Google of course. Google critics have described the company's business model as surveillance capitalism. We looked deep into that. The user is the product as Google uses your data and your everyday behavior to show you increasingly more relevant advertising. Apparently, maybe even some new roommates that will put their stuff away."

On this year's edition, Somali-American model Halima Aden posed in a burkini, that's a full body swimsuit worn by some Muslim women. Immediately, the press came out in strong support of this. It turns out that covering your body is a deeply feminist ideal. Today, the \"Today Show\" explained why that is."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASSER",
      "utterance": "Well, Tucker I have to tell you, this is insanity. I mean, as a Muslim, it's almost like the episode of \"Coddle the Islamist\" has now shifted from Congress to \"Sports Illustrated\" because it's almost -- let me give you the two perspectives. One, let's take the Muslim perspective. So you have a group, a constituency of Muslims that are conservative Orthodox that believe in not objectifying women, so are they a big subscriber base for \"Sports Illustrated\"? Are they sitting around waiting for the Swimsuit Edition to come out so that we can please that group? That doesn't make any sense and yet why not please the Conservatives among the Jewish or Sikh community or other faiths? It doesn't make sense other than that they have this bigotry of using Muslims for just sort of the clicks, if you will. Then let's look at the left's attitude about this. I thought they were the ones about women's rights and equality and not objectifying women? And the #MeToo folks, so how does this use of the hijab and the burqini in which it's used to torture women in Iran and Saudi Arabia, if they don't wear it, if they don't comply; it's a symbol of actual oppression now somehow the \"Today\" show folks think this is a symbol of equality and expression, I mean it really is irrational no matter which way you look at it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's so interesting though, it doesn't -- it seems political rather than religious. None of the people I see on television seem to even know anything about Islam or any religion. They're all completely secular, but they're using this as a political tool."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASSER",
      "utterance": "It's so true because it dehumanizes Muslims into thinking well, this individual might believe she is, you know, expressing herself through a burqini, but at the end of the day, you talk to most Muslim women that are conservative and wear hijab, they don't -- they think that she is being objectified, too, as much as the rest of the magazine is in this issue. So it doesn't make any theological sense. It doesn't make any sense other than the political use of Muslims as a prop to say they defend minorities and somehow absolve themselves of the guilt of whatever it is and ignoring actual Muslim issues related to the real Civil Rights fight of the 21st Century which is inside the mosques, inside Iran, Saudi Arabia and across the world where women are at the back of the mosques, not at the front of the mosques."

      "utterance": "This is a Fox News Alert, there are new reports that the Special Counsel Robert Mueller was dissatisfied with the Attorney General William Barr's summary of his report. The other networks are all over it. Breaking news. Well, tonight, the DOJ tells us in part, we're going to quote this, \"After the Attorney General received Special Counsel Mueller's letter, he called him to discuss it. In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General's March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading, but he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel's obstruction analysis.\" Of course, the entire report has now been released, so if we could just summarize it for you, is Trump a Russian agent? Many people said he was, it turns out, he is not. Not a Russian agent. Kind of what you need to know. Defeated gubernatorial candidate, Stacey Abrams of Georgia has announced she is not running for the Senate seat open in Georgia next year and she has not decided whether she is going to run for President or not, but she doesn't really need to run for anything, she's already considered a frontrunner to be for the 2020 Democratic Vice Presidential pick, no matter who the nominee is. And that's a little worrisome since Abrams seems a little delusional. We're not being mean, assess for yourself. In a new interview with \"The New Yorker\" magazine, Abrams says that she won her 2018 gubernatorial race against Brian Kemp. That she won. She is the Governor. The funny thing is though, she lost, in fact she lost by 55,000 votes. That's about 1.5 percent of all votes cast, but it doesn't matter. Abrams believes the right thing. She went to Yale, so apparently, the election must have been stolen. Three years ago, Donald Trump said he wanted to wait until the election to accept the results and that was taken as an attack on democracy and yet, by 2020 in the Democratic Party, admitting defeat will be treason or colluding with Russia. Things change fast. Handshakes for several thousand years probably since we left the caves or even before have been a sign of goodwill. Literally, they're depicted on pots from 500 BC, but now everything is changing. Everything is turned upside down and many things are being abolished because the woke generation just won't have them. A survey by the website Total Jobs found that many would like to see a ban of all physical contacts, complete physical contact, including handshakes in the workplace. This would be done in order to avoid any confusion over what contact is acceptable and what is not acceptable. Tammy Bruce has been around long enough to know what's acceptable. She is a radio host, President of Independent Women's Voice, sits in and this seat when I'm gone. She is our friend. She joins us tonight. I'd shake your hand, but it makes me a little nervous all of a sudden. Should we get -- do away with handshakes?"

    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Just think about living that way, right? It's like, \"Oh, what do you do?\" The fact is, handshakes are fabulous. It is an important -- especially for women in the workplace -- it's the first for many people impression you get of someone. Their sense of themselves, their confidence. It's a gesture about agreeing, it's about meeting, it's a sign that you can be trusted, part of it is, is that you're allowing that other person, yes, to take away effectively an archaic sense of the bill of the notion of it, your weapon hand, that you're suddenly -- you're not able to reach for a weapon or you would not be handling a weapon because you've been stopped from doing so. And you offer that in a friendly fashion, so that's instinctually it's key, but for women especially, men have always of course had done the handshake now as women entered the workforce and now, as we go into more jobs and have more important positions, that is a genuine gesture that men have enjoyed and now women are in exactly the same position and can deliver that same hand shake. Now, I personally have practiced my handshake. I think it's important to make sure that it's serious and it's a balance between being strong without hurting someone and it's secure and it matters. It is the first impression very often."

One, it says that there's no solution to some of the other issues we might find at work and that it's a zero-sum game.

It is unclear if anyone was hurt, but more than 70 people had been injured in various classes. If the military is standing by Maduro, it would be a staggering change of events considering Secretary of State Mike Pompeo say that early today, Maduro was headed to Havana quote, \"He had an airplane on the tarmac. He was ready to leave this morning as we understand it and the Russians indicated he should stay.\" The Russians and Cubans are Maduro's primary supporters and President Trump has now threatened Cuba with a quote, \"complete embargo and the highest level of sanctions.\" U.S. National Security adviser, John Bolton says what is happening in Venezuela is not a coup because the U.S. recognizes Guaido as a legitimate leader trying to take command of his military.

I don't think that she would be walking freely on the streets the way Juan Guaido is walking right now in Caracas. And I certainly think the news media would be calling it rightfully a coup. And let me just tell you when it comes to a what is happening on the ground there, I can tell you, I was there for a month earlier this year. The opposition has no popular support. Juan Guaido proved today once again that he will only ride into power on the back of a U.S. tank and what's more? We hear about a humanitarian crisis there, Tucker, but we never hear is that is the intended result of U.S. sanctions which have targeted Venezuela since 2015, sanctions which according to a report that was released just last week by the Center for Economic and Policy Research has led to the deaths of 40,000 Venezuelans and will lead to the deaths of thousands more if these sanctions are not overturned. President Trump if he truly cared about the Venezuelan people and the American people for that matter, he would end the disastrous policy. He would end the sanctions and he would look into John Bolton's eyes, into Elliott Abrams' eyes and Mike Pompeo's eyes and say, \"You are fired. You are leading me down a disastrous path, another war for oil,\" something that the President said he --"
