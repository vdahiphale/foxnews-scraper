We believe that that conclusion reached by the Department in 1973 still represents the best interpretation of the Constitution.\" Now, here is some of what they say and I want your significant input. They say among other things that \"The burdens imposed on a sitting President by the initiation of criminal proceedings, whether for official or unofficial wrongdoing, must be assessed in light of the court's long recognition of the unique position in the constitutional scheme that the office occupies.

Why did you fire Comey or Flynn? Did it have anything to do with the Russian investigation?\" All of those questions, intrude on the core functions of the President. They involve executive privilege - Article 2 privilege to fire anybody in the executive branch. He's asking questions about pardons and possible discussions of pardons while he was President. Those are all covered by executive privilege and by the unfettered pardon power which is in the Constitution. When you put it altogether, you end up with an illegitimate suit.

Welcome back. Joe diGenova, Dan Bongino. So, the Deputy Attorney General gives this really broad power to a Special Counsel to investigate interference by the Russians in our campaign, collusion with Trump world and the Russians, but basically says, \"Take the lead, if you find criminality, go ahead.\" The last time I checked, Hillary Clinton is not President. So, there's no bar under any memos from the Department of Justice to investigate her campaign and what she knew about the dossier and collusion with the Russians, through Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele, the DNC the same exact thing.

I have before me an October 16, 2000 memorandum for the Attorney General of the United States - a Democrat Attorney General, a Democrat Department of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel which as you, guys, know is the office that passes on Constitutional issues for the United States government, and they're also looking at a 1973 memorandum during the Nixon administration, same office. This is what they say in the opening paragraph. \"In 1973, the Department of Justice concluded that the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions. We've been asked to summarize and review the analysis provided in support of that conclusion and to consider whether any subsequent developments in the law lead us today to reconsider and modify or disavow that determination. We believe that that conclusion reached by the Department in 1973 still represents the best interpretation of the Constitution.\" Now, here is some of what they say and I want your significant input. They say among other things that \"The burdens imposed on a sitting President by the initiation of criminal proceedings, whether for official or unofficial wrongdoing, must be assessed in light of the court's long recognition of the unique position in the constitutional scheme that the office occupies. Given the unique powers granted to and obligations imposed upon the President, we think it clear that a sitting President may not constitutionally be imprisoned.\" And they go on and raise other issues. An investigation, the time it takes of a President undermining a President's credibility, not just at home, but abroad, and all of these issues that affect the function of an Article 2 President of the United States."

The appointment by Rosenstein of Mueller did not name a crime that was being investigated, it named nothing. This was a way for the Department under Rosenstein to avoid responsibility for conducting an inquiry. That said, it is quite obvious that any imposition on the President at this point does many, many bad things to the country and to the functions of the President of the United States. Article 2 vests in the President all executive power. He is the unitary authority of the executive branch. The President cannot be indicted, and so with no crime having been asserted in the appointment of the Special Counsel, how can he constitutionally investigate no crime? And it is fairly obvious, since the President is determined to be no target in the investigation, that all he wants to do is question the President. He will waste the President's time, but more importantly, he will waste the country's time, and it is an incredible burden on the President's exercise of his duties. I think he is illegitimate, and I think the President should fight to the very end any subpoena issued by the Special Counsel. It will be illegitimate ab initio."

I think Joe is right, this has been a witch-hunt from the start. But, I think the second thing that's going on here and I've been clear on this from the start, and I'd love to get your input on this as well. The people Mueller hired were very selectively chosen for the witch-hunt. Now, Andy Weissmann, Enron prosecutor, who we know from public e-mails has an extreme dislike for Donald Trump. He's Mueller's pit bull, number one. A couple of the other people he hires are fascinating. He hires Jeannie Rhee. Jeannie Rhee who represented people in the Clinton sphere. He hires as another one of his bulldogs, Aaron Zebley. Aaron Zebley who represented who? Justin Cooper, one of the Clinton aides who actually admits in a proceeding to smashing some of the Blackberries in the e-mail scandal. My point on this is, yes, number one impeachment, but number two, I think the entire Mueller operation, Mark is a smoke screen to keep the attention on Donald J. Trump and to keep the attention away from the crimes committed with the Clinton operation and potentially involved in the Obama-Gate spying scandal as well."

The idea that you can threat a sitting President with a subpoena to drag him in front of a grand jury, one of the things they say in the memorandum here is the reason - another key reason, why you cannot constitutionally or should not indict a sitting President is you're now leaving it to somebody who is wholly unattached from the body politic and responsible to nobody, but himself to determine the outcome of an executive branch official - the President of the United States whether he stays or whether he leaves. So, if he can't imprison a sitting President, why are you investigating him for crimes?"

      "utterance": "The question answers itself, actually, because what you have is an illegitimate basis for the investigation. You can't indict a President, so why can you question him by force of a subpoena? You cannot. And, in fact, the answer here is what Mueller is doing is he's investigating and using a grand jury subpoena, not for a criminal case, which the law says he cannot indict a President, but rather he's investigating to impeach. That is an unconstitutional position for him to be in. He cannot issue a grand jury subpoena for purposes of impeachment. That is an illegitimate and unconstitutional use of the grand jury power. And it seems to me that if he does want to issue a subpoena, the President has an extremely strong constitutional position that that subpoena is illegitimate from the very beginning. Example, among the 49 or 50 questions are questions like, \"What were you thinking when you decided to fire Flynn or fire Comey? Why did you fire Comey or Flynn? Did it have anything to do with the Russian investigation?\" All of those questions, intrude on the core functions of the President. They involve executive privilege - Article 2 privilege to fire anybody in the executive branch. He's asking questions about pardons and possible discussions of pardons while he was President. Those are all covered by executive privilege and by the unfettered pardon power which is in the Constitution. When you put it altogether, you end up with an illegitimate suit. It's an illegitimate putting. He doesn't have the power to investigate to impeach, and so Rosenstein's appointment is not only illegitimate, it's a constitutional farce and it's hurting the country."

Now, clearly that is not good enough for the Democrats right now, so not only are they setting as I said before, one path or impeachment. They are also setting up a path to politically bankrupt the President. Now, we all have a political bank account. I ran for office at one point, you know, you build it with positive credits, good speeches or whatever it may be. There is also a way to diminish that - negative advertising. This is an ongoing negative advertising campaign against the President. What Joe said is important, though. There is no predicate crime here, Mark. Not only could the Department of Justice handled well by the way, an investigation of counterintelligence investigation into Russian collusion, but the fact that there was no predicate crime to appoint a Special Counsel to investigate the President says to me this was meant as a political operation as well to diminish the political capabilities and to basically drain the political bank account of the President.

It has been taken away by this, and what's fascinating to me is, we go back to the beginning. This started out as a brazen plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton through the Obama Justice Department and the FBI, and then, if she lost, to figure out a way to frame Donald Trump and the people around him. What is tragic is that the system has allowed that to occur, and where we are today is the President is being distracted, constitutionally distracted from the performance of duties, North Korea, South Korea, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

Almost everyone agrees that the Director made serious mistakes.

Oh, Joe Biden's kid and John Kerry's stepson's friend, oh, and the Atlanta Council, one of the guys who sits on that, a guy named Dmitri Alperovitch, he is a CTO of a company called CrowdStrike, the very same company that analyzed the DNC servers for the so-called hack, which still hasn't been proven by the FBI. I know those webs are complicated without a chart in front of you, all you need to know is this."

      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "Up to $25 million. Pinchuck - but the point I am making on that is, it's interesting that they are investigating Pinchuk for a speaking fee, a six-figure speaking fee to Donald Trump, perfectly legal on its face, right? But we seemingly avoided all of the connections to the Clinton Foundation, CrowdStrike, the natural gas company, Joe Biden's kid and John Kerry's stepson's friend."

      "utterance": "And further to your point, why is he investigating connections with Russians period. The issue is interference in the election and collusion in the election with the Russians, not business relationships with Americans have with Russians and Chinese and all, you know, all over the world?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DIGENOVA",
      "utterance": "But if he's doing that, though, if he has exceeded his mandate and is investigating those business relationships, then there's just no doubt that the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign should be subject to the same intrusive investigative techniques that he's using against the Trump campaign because we know that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee funded the fake Steele dossier, which used Russian sources, former Russian KGB people, current Russian government officials to smear Donald Trump with fake information. Why isn't that being investigated? That seems to me to be the key interference in the United States Presidential campaign in 2016. The dossier for which CNN just got an award at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. If it's such a big deal, if they are giving out awards for the dossier leak, why isn't it being investigated by Mueller? And the answer now seems to be clear, all of the Clinton supporters who are now lawyers on Mueller's staff are simply preventing that from happening. I think the Mueller operation is such an embarrassment to the Department of Justice and for all of us who have a deep respect for Federal law enforcement. The combination of Comey and Mueller has become a symbol of embarrassment for Federal law enforcement."

The Kremlin and Russian intelligence sources. So, let me get this straight, we now know the Russians colluded with a British spy to help Hillary and the investigations into Donald Trump? I mean, we're really living in bizarre circumstances."

We'll be right back. Welcome back. Here's the bottom line. The kryptonite for all of this is the dossier. You get to the bottom of the dossier, you drag down the whole FISA issue and Comey. You drag down Rosenstein who extended it and approved it, you drag down the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC that paid for it, you drag down Mr. Clapper who was pushing it, Mr. Brennan who was pushing it - all the secretive activity that was going on, top echelons of the Obama administration. You drag down the Obama administration. Isn't that why they don't ever want to get to the bottom of the dossier?"

      "speaker": "BONGINO",

These were not official channels, this is the intelligence operation being run against the candidate Trump, one was being run through the United States Senate - John Brennan, Harry Reid - John Brennan the CIA Director, Senator Harry Reid and Dianne Feinstein's staff, that operation by the way is still going on through some of her former staffers. The second channel, notice by the way, I'm not talking about official intelligence channels, the second channel was the State Department. Diplomats and bureaucrats who are running an intel-op against President Trump being run through Victoria Nuland and Jonathan Winer who has already acknowledged, by the way, both of them Clinton acolytes, they have already acknowledged their roles..."

That unmasking was illegal and unconstitutional, then they leaked the names of people who were unmasked purposely to embarrass them and then they leaked telephone conversations of the President of the United States shortly after taking office with foreign leaders. That is the scandal. What Mueller is doing is nonsense, utter legal nonsense. The scandal was the coup d'etat that started during the election by the Obama Justice Department and National Security apparatus, and it has not stopped until this day. Look at Brennan, look at the viperous things being said by a former Director of Central Intelligence, and he's not the slightest bit embarrassed."

He's moved into heavy constitutional territory and Congress must be involved in protecting the Constitution even as oversight for anything that is where it has oversight. The problem is you have committees like the Senate Judiciary Committee devoted to protect Mueller which sends exactly the wrong message. You guys have been terrific.
