This is unacceptable.\" What a narc. Transit officials thanked her, but of course, social media backlash ensued. And I get it. Even though eating on a train is banned, no one likes a tattletale. But then the writer's publisher a book company halted printing of the lady's book citing her thinking on a black worker. Now did you see new variable? Yes. If things weren't already a barrel of nonsense, the outrage addicted media had to add race to this mix. So, California cold-blood books who stop the printing say they hope Natasha learns that black women feel the effects of systematic racism the most. So, there it is. Everything that makes the present day a drag, all wrapped into one story. Annoying busybodies who use Twitter to exercise power, government employees breaking rules we got to follow, and of course, knee- jerk instantaneous calls of racism. The only thing that could make the story more annoying and more depressing and more stupid as if somehow the producers here work Maroon 5 into it. Well done. Well done. All right, Dana, I don't think the story needed a racial component, but why not throw one in, right?",

But also just to conversational significance in the way that we talk about an unborn child, because the Left goes to great lengths to dehumanize that unborn child in a woman's stomach, right. They say that it's a lump of cells, they say that - a CNN commentator recently said that an unborn child is not a human, right. And they do that because it's easier to abort something if you dehumanize it and you take away the fact this is a unique life living in a woman's womb.

So that's wrong. They are misinterpreting her; they're taking it out of context and we should all have sympathy for her because people do that to us on THE FIVE all the time. They will take something we say whether it's a joke, and then they'll put it on a blog and say Jesse says everybody should die. And you were talking about your hair, that you dye your hair.

And the reason she doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt is it's not that, it's not just the words that she chooses to use that are under scrutiny, it's also the policies that she chooses to support. She supports a one-state solution, she's also been called out by members of her own party for supporting the boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement which Jerry Nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee and Bradley Schneider said that basically is asking for the elimination of Israel. So, it's not just the words that she is using, it's her policies that she supports. And if you want to look at an area where the Democratic Party is deeply divided it's on the issue of Israel. I mean, remember Steny Hoyer going to the AIPAC's stage and calling out Omar and Tlaib, and these freshman members of Congress and their progressive viewpoints that many views as anti-Semitic."

It seems to me the Republicans are creating controversy and President Trump is taking the lead, because he sees some political advantage in this and trying to portray and smear her as somehow anti- Semitic. I mean, we can have arguments about the history, totally legitimate, but I, you know, I just take my hat off, Greg. Exactly right. This woman was talking about the potential bond between Palestinians and Jews something you almost never hear about. Because she said in fact, who had to give up their land not voluntarily. She made that very clear not voluntarily, but people who gave up land to create the safe haven that is Israel for Jews post-Holocaust. That's what she said, and yet, here we are back to the same all refrain that somehow the first Palestinian-American in the Congress along with a woman who has come from Somalia or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Latina woman, women of color somehow demonized here conveniently, not only by Trump but by the number two and number three Republicans in the House again for a political advantage. To me, I just -- I think that this is excessive. I don't think this is right. I don't understand how it's going on."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",

All of you who are trying to silence me will fail miserably. I will never allow you to take my words out of context too push a racist and hateful agenda. The truth will always win.\" And what I think about that is the truth on the history side, that's where -- that's where the truth should lie."

Well, someone very smart one time told me never to invoke the Holocaust unless you absolutely have to, because you never want to use in an analogy, you never want to compare your political opponents to Hitler or to Nazis. And you definitely don't want to compare the suffering of Jews during the Holocaust to the suffering of any other people. And she kind of almost did that in a way. So, the facts that Jesse Watters is giving us advice to anybody else on how not to be offensive, let that sink in, Representative Tlaib, because we've come a long way. But looking at the context of what she said, she was more clumsy than she was anti-Semitic. But there was a little anti-Semitism strain in there. And that's about revising the history of the Holocaust. And it is a slippery slope, because when you talk about what Greg said, the Palestinian leadership did not welcome --"

Yet, what Democrats want to do is move us entirely off of fossil fuels which mind you, it makes up, you know, over 80 percent of the United States energy consumption. But pertaining to the rustbelt states, like, have fun going out to Michigan, Wisconsin and talking about how you're essentially going to get jobs there, jack up energy prices which mind you, disproportionately impacts lower income Americans. So much so what you got union groups like AFL-CIO putting out statements condemning the Green New Deal and talking about the fact that it's a threat to jobs, a threat to families in the way that they live their life.

On the same weekend that they are doing Green New Deal stuff, in Illinois they are planning to introduce a bill into the legislature to tax people that bought an electric vehicle $1,000 apiece per year.

But then the writer's publisher a book company halted printing of the lady's book citing her thinking on a black worker. Now did you see new variable? Yes.

We just saw one when people were saying oh these NFL players, why they kneel, let's not watch the NFL for a while. Well it worked for a while, but that's their right, they can watch what they want or not watch.

But I'll say one thing that's interesting about the Heartbeat Law to me is that it gives full legal rights to unborn children, right. And so obviously there's a legal significance to that. But also just to conversational significance in the way that we talk about an unborn child, because the Left goes to great lengths to dehumanize that unborn child in a woman's stomach, right. They say that it's a lump of cells, they say that - a CNN commentator recently said that an unborn child is not a human, right. And they do that because it's easier to abort something if you dehumanize it and you take away the fact this is a unique life living in a woman's womb. And so I think there's a shifting in the way that we converse about abortion, particularly on the heels of Ralph Northam's comments as well as the Newark law regarding third trimester abortion."

I mean it's also interesting, there are a lot of interesting levels to this, William H Macy, her husband, he apparently knew about the deal, but he's not - I don't understand why he's not under any penalty here. The second thing to say is, look this system is rigged against everybody, it's particularly rigged against people of color and the poor in America, because you can see it's the legacies, it's people with big money who get into the best schools and it's supposed to be about achievement, I wish."

It took so long, emotions went up and down as the ball went up and down, and Leonard had time to squat down and wait for the outcome. As you can see the arena went crazy, but so did people outside the streets of Toronto. It was the first buzzer beater in game seven in NBA history.

I guess it's salmon season out there, so they come to eat, they come to play and to put on a show. But I mean I'd rather watch it on video than be in that fishing boat for sure.
