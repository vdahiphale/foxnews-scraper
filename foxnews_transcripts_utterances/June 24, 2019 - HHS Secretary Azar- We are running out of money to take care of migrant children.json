Remind America that those who are on track to be deported this week were given all of the process they were due under U.S. law. None of us could ignore a court order with impunity, but the new radicals running the Democrat Party think illegal immigrants should be able to do just that and a lot more, frankly. Mr. President, most of America is with you. According to a new Gallup survey, immigration ranks as one of the most important issues facing us today. A few weeks ago, people who were chastising the President for threatening tariffs against Mexico, remember, unless Mexico started getting serious about stopping the massive flow from Central America. Well, this is a tweet from a reporter in Mexico. \"Breaking, Mexico has deployed almost 15,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to curve immigration flow. An additional 2,000 National Guard elements have also been deployed across the country's southern border with Guatemala and Belize.\" Never seen anything like this. The President's instincts immigration are right. This newfound cooperation from Mexico is only happening because the President defied all the experts who've been wrong all along. And on interior enforcement, now is not the time to hesitate. There seem to be no honest brokers left in today's Democrat Party after all. What is their aim? Well, it's to demonize Trump and demoralize his base. On the one issue, other than the economy, that is his most potent, immigration. President Trump must not allow this to happen, and instead, continue to focus on America first in restoring safety and security at our Southern border.

People talk about JonBenet Ramsey and the pageants, and they thought that was sexualization, 1996.  Look at where we are all these years later, and this is being celebrated by a local -- it's very tough. And it's all about the children and protecting children. I think everyone, every mother and every father, it's about protecting children. We don't want anyone bullied, and we don't want kids to be sexualized at a young age. It's just wrong.",

Anyone in this administration, who is not on board with strong, consistent, fairly applied measures to address this crisis, deter future border crossers and deport those who've lost their cases, should quit or be fired. We have no time to spare. The message is simple. We have limited resources and we must devote them first to Americans in need. Remind America that those who are on track to be deported this week were given all of the process they were due under U.S. law. None of us could ignore a court order with impunity, but the new radicals running the Democrat Party think illegal immigrants should be able to do just that and a lot more, frankly. Mr. President, most of America is with you. According to a new Gallup survey, immigration ranks as one of the most important issues facing us today. A few weeks ago, people who were chastising the President for threatening tariffs against Mexico, remember, unless Mexico started getting serious about stopping the massive flow from Central America. Well, this is a tweet from a reporter in Mexico. \"Breaking, Mexico has deployed almost 15,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to curve immigration flow. An additional 2,000 National Guard elements have also been deployed across the country's southern border with Guatemala and Belize.\" Never seen anything like this. The President's instincts immigration are right. This newfound cooperation from Mexico is only happening because the President defied all the experts who've been wrong all along. And on interior enforcement, now is not the time to hesitate. There seem to be no honest brokers left in today's Democrat Party after all. What is their aim? Well, it's to demonize Trump and demoralize his base. On the one issue, other than the economy, that is his most potent, immigration. President Trump must not allow this to happen, and instead, continue to focus on America first in restoring safety and security at our Southern border. Coming up, it was a big weekend for our favorite 2020 Democrat fanatics, and they didn't disappoint. Has Mayor Pete reached the end of the road? Dan Bongino and Hahn debate it in moments."

And, by the way, there is this false narrative that somehow we are trying to keep these kids with us for a long period of time. Our goal at HHS is to have these kids with us for zero days if we could. We don't want any kids in their care. We have actually decreased the average number of days a kid stays with us from over 90 days down to 44 days. That is how fast we are trying to get the kids out to sponsors, family members here in the United States. So we don't want any kid with us one day longer than they have to be."

You've seen it at HHS across a whole bunch of issues, and I think that's another issue this administration has to hit. We have to talk about what's going on with prescription drug crisis. If I hear from one more person of the cost of prescription drugs, the president said he was going to deliver. Today, I'm looking at Twitter. The president could be delivering on this.

He's only nine-years-old. Look at him, how he talked in that video.  There is something not real about it. And kids are too young to know about sexuality, to know about gender, to have all of these things thrown at them, oftentimes in school. They are being taught things that really they don't understand these things at this age. And it is totally messing them up. And when they get to be teenagers, when they have puberty and they start thinking for themselves about what they want, that is when things are really going to come home to roost because they're going to feel suicidal and so on. They don't understand. All they know is that he's getting a lot of attention for this and his parents are happy. What it has to do with, for the most part, parents like to think that they are being progressive, and really what it has to do with is his some psychological issues that the parents have that they're projecting onto their child."

Tiana Lowe, the reporter for The Washington Examiner who spent five days in Omar's district joins me now.

However, I went back and found some misdemeanor and petty misdemeanor filings from the Hennepin County courthouse which showed that she and Ahmed Hirsi, who she said that she had been split up at the time, were living at the same residence in the Cedar Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis."

But we didn't necessarily have official records proving that she and Ahmed Hirsi were living together in what was effectively a common- law marriage for the entirety of adult life. Again, it is fully possible that in these traffic proceedings and in these misdemeanor charges that we obtained that it was just by default that it listed the same address. But the fact is that reporters have been asking Omar to be explain why she was married to one man and living with another for years on end repeatedly misconstruing the situation, or just straight up rejecting the free press' inquiries into her marital history.

There is a very realistic position where if money was tight and if the divorce was amicable, sure, I could see all three of them living in a house if he couldn't afford to rent somewhere else. That would be a very easy thing to explain away. But instead there has been repeated attempts to deflect the press and repeated attempts to malign the press and impugn our motives as racist.
