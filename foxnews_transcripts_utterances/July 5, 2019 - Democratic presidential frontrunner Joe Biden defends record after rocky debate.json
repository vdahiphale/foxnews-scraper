This reveals to everyone the fact that this had been kind of a sham from the beginning which is what all Americans in both parties have rejected and haven't liked, this idea that this is prearranged, that he's the one who is supposed to get it.

I was heading back from Charleston, South Carolina, after doing our proud American coverage there and feeling extra patriotic on the heels of that. Anyway, I thought I was having a spiritual experience. And I think if you're an American watching this and it didn't matter how you felt about the president before this speech, it was beautiful. It was incredible. The critics that saw there, the Democrats saying, oh, he's just doing this for himself. He's throwing himself a parade. He didn't say anything about himself. He spoke about decorated military veterans. He talked about astronauts. He talked about civil rights leaders. He talked about American exceptionalism. He put politics aside for this. I was impressed. You remember when he was on the campaign trail in 2016 and he said I'm going to be so presidential when I want to be. I'm going to be boring. Well, he wasn't boring, but he certainly presidential. He left his slings and arrows for a campaign rally on another day and another time and place. And I thought it was very appropriate, had the perfect tone."

That was nothing like a Trump campaign rally. They talk about multiple things. The crowd is much rowdier when it comes to -- Trump talks a lot about himself and not America, and his greatness as well. And I think the president showed that he was willing to put politics aside and talk about what's best for the country and how to move forward. A lot of people said that it was boring because he gave a history lesson. I think it's important that we remember our history so we don't repeat it as well. There was some critics that talked about the military and the president flexing when it came to showing our great military. Look, this a president that has been very restrained when it comes to military force. So if he wants to flex to show the world this is how you defend freedom. This is -- this is what we have to offer, I think that is to be applauded instead of sending our military into harm's way."

That's part of the natural process here. The Natural Parks Service, I think, we had an estimated of about $2 to $2.5 million, nobody was clutching their pearls in 2016 when the National Parks Service spent $30 million for their own 100 year anniversary. And, you know, that -- but I think all of that is a distraction. I think what you've got here are -- and when they worry -- worrying about the president talking about himself, there's only one group of people talking constantly about Donald Trump, and it's the Democrats. He is still in the building mode. He has condominiums in their head and it's the most affordable living situation. Bernie Sanders wants affordable living, he's living in their heads for free. There is no rent. So this is -- I think there's a lot of projection going on. He is the center of their universe. You may disagree with this. But you have to admit, they think they're going to win the presidency based on obsessing about Donald Trump. And as they do it -- like maybe you've even been changed a little bit about what happened yesterday.

So I think, honestly, the president did a great service to the military in respecting that fact and not going into a partisan angle when he was talking. I watched the entire thing. And I kept waiting for him to, you know, go hard to his base or whatever, and he never did it. I mean, I heard everybody from Jackie Robinson to John Glenn talked about in these speeches. And even for me these names start coming up. And you remember these powerful, powerful Americans, and entrepreneurs, and great talents that could only have succeeded like that had they lived in our country and had a military as strong as ours to protect their right to become great baseball players, or astronauts, or actors, or all the great people he was naming. So I thought he did a great job by staying right on the message. And to say me it was almost like a history lesson, a refresher course going through every single branch of the military, pointing out great people that did great things. And then here comes the actual hardware. Flying right over the top of the Washington Monument, and you're like wow. I mean, I think for Americans, for me it was a moment of pride to see all of that come together in one moment. And also, I think around the world, they're watching that going, yeah, they've got a lot of -- America is no joke. And look at how our principles of this country have developed so many incredible Americans. I mean, we've invented rock and roll. We've invented country music. We've invented R and B.

That's how other people were going to rise and challenge him as the frontrunner. It's exactly what Kamala Harris did. She took command on the stage, and it's the reason why we've seen her jump ahead in the polls. I think what you're seeing there is he's trying to strike the right tone. He doesn't want to be too aggressive in trying to take her out. And he says he's not going to play that game. Maybe he can have his surrogates, his aides, you know, plant stories and go after her in that fashion. But I think he wants to remain as if he's above the fray. That he's the frontrunner."

And so, now, Biden is having haymakers thrown at him. You wouldn't have seen that in the past couple of elections. Nobody talked like that. Smacking somebody in the mouth or anything like that. But, you know, it looks like to me Biden -- I said this earlier, he's been left as in he can't go -- I don't think it's in his nature to go that left.

First one was with Trump, and now this one. Is that he didn't expect to be held accountable. He didn't expect someone else in that lineup to say something harsh, or to maybe tell the truth, or what they saw as the truth because, gosh, they know each other. This reveals to everyone the fact that this had been kind of a sham from the beginning which is what all Americans in both parties have rejected and haven't liked, this idea that this is prearranged, that he's the one who is supposed to get it. And he's got that kind of demeanor. Now, I agree, the Democratic voter is not the Democrat or the liberal on twitter. It is someone who is much more quiet and who's watching. But then, if that is the case, then he should have no problem. But what he knows is that Kamala Harris is going to cast herself as that. So, he knows he's not running against Sandy Ocasio-Cortez. He's running against, you know, Kamala Harris who's going to shift. No one is going to be running in the end in the general as on the left, but they've got to pander in a certain way. So, I think, Joe Biden and then, just ultimately what people don't like is -- and I don't think he understands the irony of complaining about Trump being the divider and then trying to, you know, disembowel him with his -- you know, he's a racist. I punched these guys in the mouth. Nobody wants that, and especially when it's not natural. When it's -- when you're trying to a play a role in certain way."

So, people are going to be looking to punch again at Joe Biden. He better figure out how to deal with this.

There's not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of these United States at this very hour, Frederick Douglass, unquote.

But to go back to the Douglass quote, I think there're both sides that are getting this whole thing wrong. First of all, he was talking to Republicans and telling them that we're not living up to the ideas of this country. He was a Republican. And then he talked about his love of this country. And despite America not living up to his ideas, it was the Constitution that he used as his greatest defense, and I think that's where we need to get back to.

They've been making money and so a lot of people see this as an expression of American values. That if you kneel in protest and you have a legitimate protest, there's nothing wrong with it. So that's the other side of it. I hear what you guys are saying, but I think that there are lots of people who say Nike apparently has tapped into this, especially among the younger generation.

And now Lawrence, even if you think it should be painted over, there's this huge debate. Some people are wondering even about the cost of $600,000. Painted during the Depression, was meant to introduce difficult subjects, broaden - it was considered radical at the time, broadening out the image of Washington, involving the death of Native Americans, slavery and yet now it's too sensitive.

So I'm going to be on Fox & Friends - my favorite show, tomorrow morning at 7:30 Jedediah is pregnant and I'm doing a prenatal fitness segment, because I've become a women's fitness specialist since moving to Australia and personal trainer group fitness instructor. I teach mums and bubs fitness classes there they call it. And I also have an online fitness business where you can work out with me at home. Strong sexy mammas with two \"M's\" dot-com strongsexymammas.com. He's a picture there of my husband and my sweet baby boy Brooks. And I realized we have unique needs after having kids. Anyway, tune in to Fox & Friends tomorrow at 7:30."
