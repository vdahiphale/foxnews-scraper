Reuters reported they left late last night, Christmas night. A Reuters reporter traveling with the president says that they kept the curtains drawn on the flight and the light off throughout the duration of the plane ride to Iraq for security. President Trump and the first lady then spent approximately three hours on the ground. The president gave remarks, a speech, to troops for about 20 minutes at Al Asad Air Base, which is west of Baghdad. This is the president's first time trip to visit troops in a combat zone since taking office. It comes on the heels of the president drawing down troops in Syria and Afghanistan. The president has long been critical of the war in Iraq.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi telling USA Today President Trump says - - quote -- \"We're going\" -- this is her quote, paraphrasing in her mind what he said. She said this -- quote -- \"The president says we're going to build a wall with cement and Mexico is going to pay for it. Well, he's already backed off the cement.

But just last week, the White House was willing to support a bill that would have funded the government through about mid- February that didn't have money for the wall. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president was going to support that. And it was actually a lot of prominent conservatives, like Laura Ingraham on this channel, in fact, who were very disappointed in that, and actually led Trump to change his mind yet again and say, no, we need a wall. So the Democrats have seen that the president will support a funding bill that doesn't include the wall. And they're not budging. And while they're not budging, the White House keeps coming down and down. The original bill had $5.7 billion for a wall. Now, as you just noted, the Republicans are offering up something less than $3 billion. The Democrats, they have stood pretty firm on their $1.3 billion for border security, not a wall. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, while they don't move, the Republicans keep moving. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But, yes, you just need something, and I think he recognizes that. I think part of it, though, by him backing down on the rhetoric, I think Democrats are seeing that as a sign of weakness.

According to MasterCard, they said it climbed higher at 5.1 percent. You have Amazon as well, Amazon releasing a statement, not providing any exact numbers, but Amazon saying that they added tens of millions of new Prime subscribers and free trial people that signed up, as well as sold a million of their own products. Think like the Echo and a few other products too. So that's helping show that consumer confidence is still there. We don't know the breakdown of the numbers on whether it has to do with credit cards that are fueling this growth. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, nonetheless, people are shopping. As we know, today is a huge sale day. Other contributing factors to this market rally, according to the guys that are around me -- and some of them are saying they don't even know why.

However, many traders still tell me it's still a fragile growth market. This could be just a temporary upswing. I just want to end on the price of oil at the moment, the fact that, in October, it was $75 a barrel. Right now, we're seeing it higher today, $46.22, still much lower, but definitely an upswing, helped the energy sector. May not be so good for gas drivers. I know, as of this morning, the average was $2.31 a gallon.

But I think, politically, going forward, the reason you need more than just the wall in the discussion is because, as long -- as long as there are some people that have enough power to prevent something from happening, the only thing that gets them to allow you to do something is to give them something they want.

Outgoing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis didn't make the trip today with the president. Now, while the president says he's withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, those special operations troops could be used in the future to carry out any raids in neighboring Syria. Officials say U.S. special operations forces could carry out raids similar to the one that killed Osama bin Laden. And since the -- U.S. artillery on Iraq's border with Syria has been shelling ISIS positions around the clock. The last known ISIS stronghold is the city of Hajin, located not far from the border and within range of those cannons. At its height in 2014, ISIS controlled an area the size of Ohio. In President Trump's first year in office, airstrikes against the terrorist group increased 33 percent. Roughly 40,000 bombs were dropped on ISIS last year, Trish. Today, the group holds only 1 percent of the territory it once held. But despite all these gains against ISIS, the situation in Iraq remains tense, one of the reasons the president and first lady had to fly in on a secret mission and only stayed on the ground at a U.S.-controlled air base west of Baghdad for only a few hours. President Trump said he wished he had the opportunity to meet the new Iraqi prime minister. They couldn't meet because the security situation.

But, of course, in the middle of the shutdown, in the middle of this back and forth, the president and first lady took an unannounced trip to Iraq. Reuters reported they left late last night, Christmas night. A Reuters reporter traveling with the president says that they kept the curtains drawn on the flight and the light off throughout the duration of the plane ride to Iraq for security. President Trump and the first lady then spent approximately three hours on the ground. The president gave remarks, a speech, to troops for about 20 minutes at Al Asad Air Base, which is west of Baghdad. This is the president's first time trip to visit troops in a combat zone since taking office. It comes on the heels of the president drawing down troops in Syria and Afghanistan. The president has long been critical of the war in Iraq. He told reporters traveling with him, though, that he has no plans to remove U.S. troops from the country. As for the partial government shutdown, President Trump remains adamant, saying that the only way that this is going to end is if he received funding for some sort of physical barrier at the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats are saying that it is impossible to know exactly what the president wants here. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi telling USA Today President Trump says - - quote -- \"We're going\" -- this is her quote, paraphrasing in her mind what he said. She said this -- quote -- \"The president says we're going to build a wall with cement and Mexico is going to pay for it. Well, he's already backed off the cement.

But just last week, the White House was willing to support a bill that would have funded the government through about mid- February that didn't have money for the wall. The president was going to support that. And it was actually a lot of prominent conservatives, like Laura Ingraham on this channel, in fact, who were very disappointed in that, and actually led Trump to change his mind yet again and say, no, we need a wall. So the Democrats have seen that the president will support a funding bill that doesn't include the wall. And they're not budging. And while they're not budging, the White House keeps coming down and down. The original bill had $5.7 billion for a wall. Now, as you just noted, the Republicans are offering up something less than $3 billion. The Democrats, they have stood pretty firm on their $1.3 billion for border security, not a wall. So, while they don't move, the Republicans keep moving."

I mean, you go from the concrete wall to what -- the president's even tweeting out pictures of metal slats that he was saying, the pointed-tip slats that a lot of people also made fun of. But, yes, you just need something, and I think he recognizes that. I think part of it, though, by him backing down on the rhetoric, I think Democrats are seeing that as a sign of weakness. And they're saying, OK, well, he's now willing not to have a wall. He's willing to have slats. What is it next? So they're playing this, and, of course, they're playing up the clock, because, in January, they take over the House of Representatives. And it will be even harder then."

You have got the Dow, the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 way up today. But if you look back from their all-time highs, well, maybe not doing quite so well. Let's go to FOX Business Network's Kristina Partsinevelos for a look at all of it. She's at the NYSE. And she has insight into what people really liked out there today -- Kristina."

      "speaker": "KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Trish, what a swing from Monday, when you saw the Dow down 653 points, today closing well above 1,000 points, 1,600-point difference right there. So you're seeing a lot of movement. Traders here, everybody seems to be in a little bit of a better mood. I'm not sure if it's the leftover food and all the drinks and last night, but, overall, what is pushing these markets higher? You have got possibly retail sales, the fact that retail sales climbed higher. According to MasterCard, they said it climbed higher at 5.1 percent. You have Amazon as well, Amazon releasing a statement, not providing any exact numbers, but Amazon saying that they added tens of millions of new Prime subscribers and free trial people that signed up, as well as sold a million of their own products. Think like the Echo and a few other products too. So that's helping show that consumer confidence is still there. We don't know the breakdown of the numbers on whether it has to do with credit cards that are fueling this growth. But, nonetheless, people are shopping. As we know, today is a huge sale day. Other contributing factors to this market rally, according to the guys that are around me -- and some of them are saying they don't even know why. There's so many things going on. You had Kevin Hassett, the White House economic adviser, who was on FOX Business earlier today, and also spoke to The Wall Street Journal, stating that, don't worry, Jay Powell is not getting fired, he's 100 percent safe, the president will not be letting go of the chairman of the Fed. So you have got that as a positive factor contributing to markets. However, many traders still tell me it's still a fragile growth market. This could be just a temporary upswing. I just want to end on the price of oil at the moment, the fact that, in October, it was $75 a barrel. Right now, we're seeing it higher today, $46.22, still much lower, but definitely an upswing, helped the energy sector. May not be so good for gas drivers. I know, as of this morning, the average was $2.31 a gallon. It may be climbing up in the near future, but still nowhere near those highs and October -- back to you, Trish."

Now, just remember, we were negative early in the session. So we made new lows and a higher close. That's very positive, but a lot of this seems to be a short squeeze today. You need some follow-through on this. Now, we could also see some additional price pop potential, with the president -- talking about this is good time to buy, he could also construct some certainty with some trade sentiment or maybe some deal. That would give this market another boost to the upside."

    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Yes. It just fascinates me, Rebecca, because the markets tend to run, what, six to nine months in advance of the economy. And so investors are always trying to predict where the economy's heading. And I would just say, in this particular case, there's nothing out there that tells me, six to nine months down the road, we're actually going to be in some kind of recession, which is what you hear a lot of people on a lot of different networks talking to, almost a little bit of glee in their in their voice, I would add to that. But I don't see the recession happening, because I think that the fundamentals are just too good. So, if I'm right, does the market catch up?"

So, obviously, his strong economy, his good fundamentals, the great labor market, the great GDP numbers that we have had this year, they're not going to give him any credit. So any time the market is volatile, oh, it's all Trump's fault. What's really happening is that we do have strong economic fundamentals. They are there, the labor market, GDP growth, but we do have a lot of geopolitical things going on, the trade, obviously, with China. That's looming. That 90-day truce is winding down, obviously a lot of uncertainty in Washington, as you just mentioned in the last segment. So we have a lot of uncertainty. And investors like certainty. So the market is just -- I think it's just mixed signals, like, what's going on? Obviously, two-thirds of our economy are consumer, so low gas prices are great for them, not so good for energy stocks. So you just have a mixed bag of all these things going on, Trish."

      "utterance": "Definitely. So I agree with you that the market is a leading indicator, for sure. And I think that whether the economic numbers and the fundamentals are sustainable, is going to be determined by strength in the credit markets. You have the Fed reducing the balance sheet on autopilot at $50 billion a month, $600 billion next year. You have -- we don't know what's happening with rate hikes next year. So those things are all going to put pressure on servicing the debt. As long as the system can service the debt, then these economic numbers are sustainable."

      "speaker": "KNUCKMAN",

But if you look at the numbers, the EPS growth for 2018 works out to maybe 20 percent for S&P 500 stocks. That's an incredible growth rate. Companies are doing extremely well, and you -- like you keep talking about, the fundamental facts remain. This is not a systemic problem.

Thank you so much to all of you. We will have much more on the president's surprise trip to Iraq, and what he had to say about his decision to pull troops out of Syria. That's coming up. And as Congress battles over the wall, Customs and Border Protection agents are now taking some new safety steps after a migrant child died while in U.S. custody. We have all the details for you.

Customs and Border Protection will now give medical checks to all migrant children. So, how does this change what is going on in Washington over funding for a border wall? Does it? Let's go right now to Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies. Jessica, it's tough. A lot of these kids are coming from circumstances that are less than ideal. They're -- they're in a challenging environment. They're coming here not necessarily in the best health as it is. How do we -- how do we help them, while simultaneously making sure that we do have that strong border?"

So it's really, really tough for the Border Patrol and the federal government to deal with situation. This is a really new phenomenon in illegal migration, with people bringing their kids and essentially using them as a deportation shield or ticket into the country. And what -- the Border Patrol has now checked everyone in their custody. And they have pledged to be doing more thorough medical examinations when - - in the future with kids that they apprehend, but it's -- this is not going to fix the problem. The problem is that our policies entice people here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, bingo. And this is what nobody wants to talk about, Jessica. It's the law of unintended consequences, which we confront all the time in economics. And the unintended consequence here is, by creating a scenario that makes it easier for people to come across the border with children, by enticing them, as you say, here, then you're actually creating a scenario that does endanger them in other ways that wouldn't exist if you didn't put that out there, dangling it out there to begin with. In other words, Jessica, if their parents knew there was no chance that they were going to be able to come into this country illegally, would the parents not take the kind of risks that they're taking?"

And it ought to be an alarm bell for Congress to say, look, we have got -- we cannot let this continue. It's wrong to let this continue. We need to provide the president and the federal government with the resources to secure the border and also to make the changes necessary to the law."

But what you're saying is something different. You're saying, no, this is actually a humane thing to do, because, by discouraging, by having the kind of security there and discouraging these families from coming here, and taking such insane risks with their own children, they will be better off?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAUGHAN",
      "utterance": "Well, they need to understand the message that they're not going to succeed, that, if they try to come here, it's not going to be worth turning over their life savings and their lives and especially their children to criminal smuggling organizations, and that they're -- they're not going to end up with what -- the jackpot of being allowed to live in the United States. That's the only thing that's going to keep people home. We're also providing foreign aid to these countries to try to change this dynamic. And that might help as well. But, really, it -- they need to understand the message from the government, do not do this. It's not going to work. You're not going to succeed. Please don't put your family at risk in this one."

Here with reaction to all of it, I have on the phone right now North Dakota senator-elect Republican Kevin Cramer. Good to have you, sir. He is saying, look, whatever it takes, however long it takes, he wants that wall, he wants the funding for the wall. We just heard from a Democratic congressman who says, all right, no way he's going to get it. He'd like to see meaningful immigration reform. I'm sure you would like to see that too. But this wall here and the semantics surrounding it is preventing you guys from getting anything done. Where does it go?"

      "speaker": "KEVIN CRAMER, R-N.D., SENATOR-ELECT",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a good question, Trish. First of all, thank you for the opportunity. And let me tell you, from what I pick up around North Dakota -- I have served in Congress now for six years -- and I just won a seat in the United States Senate largely over this issue. The people of North Dakota want a wall. They want a barrier of some site - - of some type, and both for its practical use, as well as the symbolism of it. But, clearly, that's not the only issue. I mean, we have lots of immigration issues. And a comprehensive reform probably makes the most sense."

      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "But, in order to get there, right, you got to get to first base."

      "utterance": "Right. Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "And first base for this president and for many of your constituents, as you just explained, is that wall. People want that symbolism. They want to erect a barrier to send a message, effectively, to anyone thinking of coming here illegally that you better not. It's going to be that difficult. So, if you don't get that, what shot do you have at the rest of it? And shouldn't the Democrats want the rest of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRAMER",
      "utterance": "The Democrats should want the rest of it. Unfortunately, we are living at a time when it seems like every negotiation begins with all or nothing and ends with all or nothing, which usually ends up with nothing. And you have a lot of people saying what they will never do, which is, rule number one in politics is never say well you will never do this. At least that's what John Boehner taught me. And I think -- I think it's proven to be pretty true. But I think, politically, going forward, the reason you need more than just the wall in the discussion is because, as long -- as long as there are some people that have enough power to prevent something from happening, the only thing that gets them to allow you to do something is to give them something they want. And therein has been the problem for at least the six years I have been in Congress. In fact, we have gotten to a point now where ,if I want three out of the four things that are before us, but I don't want the fourth thing, it seems like I'm willing to -- and I'm just not speaking for me personally, but in Congress -- we're willing to give up the three things we want. And we have got to stop looking for losers in every situation. We can have winners and losers."

      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Because there's a whole lot of posturing here. And what is sacrificed is the policy that's ignored as all this posturing happens. But speaking of posturing, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer are making it very clear where they are. The president's making it very clear where he is. Ultimately, if this is some kind of bad game of chicken, who succeeds, in that who has the most to lose?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRAMER",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes, it's a great question. And I think that's what everybody is, of course, trying to analyze. And I don't think -- I think it's hard to get a read right now, because everybody's enjoying Christmas. The government is not as shut down as it has been in the past. In other words, there's not the personal pain, if you will, being inflicted on the voters, the taxpayers, the constituents that there would be in a total shutdown. And when you're visiting family and friends for the holidays, you're not really thinking about whether the USDA Rural Development program is being funded. And so I think what will happen is, when the pressures start coming from the constituents themselves -- and maybe that's not until after January 3 - - Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker of the House, so she's relieved of that political pressure, we have a divided government, where compromise is required to get something done, as opposed to just a nice ideal, my sense is that it could go on a little while, but I think that you do have the ingredients for a deal in the not-too-distant future."

But you know what? As much as we look at that, right, that $5 billion, there's another number out there that's kind of a big deal. And it's fast approaching $22 trillion. We're talking about a whole lot of money. I want to go to former economic adviser to President Reagan Mr. Art Laffer. We just spend, spend, spend, and there's not a whole lot of accountability there. It needs to change at some point, Art, right? Or what is -- what is the long-term consequence?"

But what you said is exactly correct, is, these people don't bear the consequences of their own silly actions. And what we have to do is make them personally responsible for it, not just at the polls. But my suggestion is, you should put all these politicians on commission. If they don't cut it, they get their pay cut. And just like the rest of us, if you borrow too much, you're going to get a problem in your budget too. And these guys don't bear the consequences of those actions. And I think they should."

At 4 percent growth, you gave them double their pay, 5 percent growth, triple their pay, 2 percent growth, no pay whatsoever, and 1 percent, they owe the money they would have gotten paid. They will never vote this way ever again. That's how you put them on incentives. It makes perfect -- that's what we do with companies all day long, stock option plans and..."

And I think people in Washington right now, I think the administration is very focused on technology. And that's where their focus should be, and how we can have laws that protect technology. And, by the way, it's not just to China. It's to other companies as well. You shouldn't be able to steal someone's private property, whether you're Chinese, American, Italian or whatever. And those protections should be put into place and should be enforced by the government totally."

      "speaker": "LUCAS TOMLINSON, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Trish. There's over 5,000 U.S. troops currently deployed to Iraq and received a surprise visit today by their commander in chief. Most of those troops are assigned to train and advise the Iraqi forces. There's also special operations troops there as well. Outgoing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis didn't make the trip today with the president. Now, while the president says he's withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, those special operations troops could be used in the future to carry out any raids in neighboring Syria. Officials say U.S. special operations forces could carry out raids similar to the one that killed Osama bin Laden. And since the -- U.S. artillery on Iraq's border with Syria has been shelling ISIS positions around the clock. The last known ISIS stronghold is the city of Hajin, located not far from the border and within range of those cannons. At its height in 2014, ISIS controlled an area the size of Ohio. In President Trump's first year in office, airstrikes against the terrorist group increased 33 percent. Roughly 40,000 bombs were dropped on ISIS last year, Trish. Today, the group holds only 1 percent of the territory it once held. But despite all these gains against ISIS, the situation in Iraq remains tense, one of the reasons the president and first lady had to fly in on a secret mission and only stayed on the ground at a U.S.-controlled air base west of Baghdad for only a few hours. President Trump said he wished he had the opportunity to meet the new Iraqi prime minister. They couldn't meet because the security situation. He says he hopes to have a visit with him at the White House some time next year -- Trish."

It's kind of interesting, right, that we're leaving Syria at the same time we're -- we're bombing Syria and taking out the likes of a couple hundred ISIS fighters. What's really going on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT MANN, FORMER U.S. GREEN BERET",
      "utterance": "Yes, hi, Trish. Thanks for having me on. It's not uncommon when you are going to pull out of an area to saturate it with some kind of disruption, airstrikes or surgical strikes or something like that. And it can have an effect. And let's be clear. The bombings and the surgical strikes by commandos have had a profound effect on disrupting ISIS over the last couple of years. But if we have learned anything, I think, in this almost 20-year war, is we just can't defeat groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda by conventional strikes alone. It just doesn't work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, the challenge, of course, is that this is money that comes out of every American taxpayer's pocket, and you have to be incredibly selective about where you are in the world, right, because we don't want to be paying for wars that we don't want to be in, and we don't want them to drag on forever. And we do hope that some of our European allies pick up some of the slack here. But it was 2,000 troops 2,200 troops, to pull just that fewer number out, I know you have got some real concerns about it, as do a lot of people. Explain."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I think part of the problem, Trish, is that the narrative that's out there right now is that we don't want to be the world's policeman, we don't want to do nation-building. And, frankly, that's a Cold War era set of metrics. I mean, what we're talking about here is denying strategic safe haven to a global terror group that has proven track records of projecting violence inside the United States when they have unfettered safe haven, right? And if we don't take that on, and we don't deny them that safe haven, then the odds are they're going to be able to strike again. And the second thing I worry about is, when we do pull out of here, this is a narrative victory for ISIS. This is their chance to stand up and say to jihadists all over the world, look, we outlasted the great Satan. Come on back, and let's fight it out."

      "speaker": "MANN",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, look, I don't like saying it. My oldest son is going into the military in combat arms. And so this is hard for me to say. But I believe a persistent presence with the right kind of advisers on the ground in sanctuaries like Syria and Afghanistan, where we can train locals to stand up and fight back and push these groups out, that's the only way we're going to win this thing. And if we don't have the patience to do it, then we're going to read it on the back end."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "You know, Scott, I find it interesting, only because, well, certainly, General Mattis echoed that viewpoint, and certainly presented it to the president on multiple occasions. And that's partly why he's not there now. We also know that John Bolton, of course, feels very strongly about the U.S.' need to lead in that hegemonic sense and to really preserve our place in the world as the policeman. So -- so, what motivated him here, you think?"

President Obama pulled out of Iraq with a precipitous pullout, and now this. And I think all three of those approaches are flawed. We need to listen to the folks who fight these wars and who understand that this is a multidecade endeavor, and it's not a police action."

That is what it is today, as you point out, 77 straight days. It was -- what was it, $2.36 a week ago, $2.55 a month ago. So we have had a steady decline and a steady rebate, fuel rebate, if you will. We will see if that continues. We had a huge run-up in oil today. What a day this has been, a trading day, up 8.6 percent on oil prices today. So we will see if it continues. Where is it cheapest for gas? That would be the state of Missouri. We're at $1.88 the average gallon of gas in Missouri. And the cheapest gasoline anywhere, if you want to drive there, you got to go to Oklahoma City, $1.61 at the Food Mart on 44th Street in Oklahoma City. And that is absolutely good news, Trish."
