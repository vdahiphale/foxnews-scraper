This year airstrikes have sharply reduced as fewer ISIS targets remain on the battlefield. Today, ISIS only holds 1% of the territory once held in Iraq and Syria. Despite the gains against ISIS, the security situation in Iraq remains tense, one of the reasons the President's visit remained secret and the President and First Lady only spend a few hours on the ground at a U.S. controlled air base west of Baghdad in the middle of the night. The President spoke to Iraq's new Prime Minister over the phone. Security concerns prevented a face to face meeting but President Trump hopes his Iraqi counterpart can visit the White House next year.",

Its construction was started by community members and mothers whose sons died in World War I, and it was completed by the American Legion. A lower court has ruled that the cross should be removed because it violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution, which, of course, reads quote, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" But an amicus brief filed by 30 states says the Supreme Court, quote, \"should reverse the lower court's call for its destruction as it's place in our national tradition and broader cultural context make clear the Bladensburg memorial honors both the servicemembers it was built to honor and the constitutional ideals, including in the First Amendment they died to defend.\" And West Virginia's attorney general, who led to the group of 30 states in challenging the lower court, said, quote, \"We owe a great deal of gratitude to the brave men and women who sacrificed everything for our country. Honoring that sacrifice with memorials that include religious symbols does not violate the U.S. Constitution and is one of the many freedoms these men and women fought to preserve.\" Now, the challenge to the 93 old cross began with the American Humanist Association, a nonprofit atheist organization that has, of course, Lisa, filed similar lawsuits across the country.

And we think, just as you indicated, that the purpose of this memorial is to honor the war dead. We know when the peace cross was first put together, this was done to honor 49 individuals who fought in World War I, and they were commemorated. Across the country, there are memorials very similar to this. But you have to look at the context in which of these memorials are set up. The states and individuals have the right to commemorate the dead. And that's different. That is not a purely religious purpose. Quite the opposite, that is a secular purpose. And so we think this fits very cleanly within the Establishment Clause jurisprudence. We think that the court can clarify this a little bit going forward. But I think that this peace cross was done with private funds, this peace cross was unchallenged for almost 90 years. It has been part of the fabric, the historic tradition within the community.

And they said, well, you know what, one said, I don't like the rhetoric that President Trump uses and the other one said, we're not going to give President Trump victory. And so what I'm telling you is, it is politics, Lisa. That's the problem is they don't want President Trump to have a victory and in so doing, they're preventing this country from having the safety. When I hear people, just today even some more people from the border telling me, Andy, they're crossing our property, we've got to have - we've got to have border wall and you know what, that's what we need to do, not politics, we need good policy which includes a border wall."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, what's happening is when an asylum seeker comes across the border, we do an immediate little evaluation and then they end up staying, we can't keep them longer than 20 days and so we can't process them because the influx is so great, I mean there's thousands upon thousands. And so for instance, in in the Phoenix metro area, there's been almost 4000 of them released since October until about two weeks ago, that's the total from two weeks ago that are coming here seeking asylum, they're released into the interior, we pay for them to go wherever they want to go because we can't afford to hold them. And that's what's happening is catch and release and we're giving them a notice, please come back we say for your court hearing to prove that you really are someone who qualifies and you know what, almost 90% of them don't even qualify for asylum yet they're already here in this country, most of them never go back for the hearing, that's what's going on with the asylum policy that we have today."

    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, if you can keep them in Mexico which by the way has offered asylum like for instance, the caravan, most of the silent seekers, they've offered them asylum. If you keep them there then it gives us time to process them before they get released into the interior because once they're released in the interior, they're effectively lost until they commit a crime or something like that where we can actually track them down and I.C.E. can can get hold of him except for unless there's a sanctuary city that's not going to cooperate with I.C.E.. So we have all kinds of obstacles that keep us from actually controlling the folks that are coming into our country. That's why the Mexico basically keeping them there until they're ready to come in or qualified to come in is so important because it's going to reduce the number of people who come into this country illegally that we can't track, we can't - that we don't know who they are."

As of the beginning of December it was according to the Department of Homeland Security, more than 10 years since the child had died in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Now two children have died in the space of a month, the latest an eight year old boy, Felipe Alonzo-Gomez first taken into custody around 1:00 PM on December 18th near El Paso, Texas. The boy and his father were according to CBP officials given regular food, water, and welfare checks before being transferred to the Alamogordo border patrol station on December 23rd. On the 24th at around 9:00 AM, an agent noticed the boy was coughing and his eyes were glossy and was taken to a nearby hospital. At 12:45 PM, he was diagnosed with a simple cold and given Tylenol. Around 30 minutes later though, his fever had spiked to103 degrees. He was held for further observation. But 90 minutes after that at about 2:50 PM, he was released from the ER with a prescription from Amoxicillin and ibuprofen. The boy and his father were taken to a temporary CBP holding facility where at 7:00 PM fully paid vomited. But according to CBP his father said the boy was feeling better and declined further help. At about 10:00 PM, Felipe was again nauseas and was being taken back to the hospital when he vomited again and lost consciousness. Hospital doctors could not revive Felipe. He was pronounced dead at 11:48 PM on Christmas Eve. The CBP Commissioner called it a tragedy and says, agents do all they can."

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen today announced a series of steps designed to identify sick children more quickly and get them help, she's asked the Centers for Disease Control to investigate the uptick in sick children crossing the border. The U.S. Coast Guard Medical Corps will assist CBP's medical programs, more medical professionals have been requested from the Department of Defense and most immediately old children apprehended by CBP will now get a more complete medical assessment as soon as possible. The issue here what does as soon as possible mean. It's obviously undefinable and frequently, Lisa, having been on both sides of the border, I've seen this, you get these agents who are working in very small teams frequently coming across groups of very large groups of illegal immigrants in remote areas of the border.

You have to worry about the smugglers, the bandits, I mean, there's a lot of things that goes into this.

We spoke briefly, he said he didn't know where his parents were. At that point, I said, okay, you know, be careful, you know stay safe and everything and he walks back to the area where he's being detained. And I said, grab some cookies and he grabbed cookies, there's cookies around, they were able to give him cookies. He said, thank you and I gave him some juice but there was other kids that were out there watching movies that are being taken care of and that's in just our detention facility, that's not the actual detention facility where they're being held you know at for longer periods of time.

And the problem is the lack of access to those resources in their own countries to be able to come over here and that is a problem. I practice it first-hand, I see it first-hand. It's a major problem, the wait times are years and years so yet, to them, it's worth the risk to come over here because that's the only chance when you get to try to ask for asylum."

There's a right way to do it and there's a wrong way to do it and it certainly isn't you know, crossing the border illegally, jumping a fence. They could easily you know, ask for asylum in the areas where they're at, they can go to the embassies of the U.S. there, they were given some type of asylum within Mexico, they refused to take it, there's a way that they can enter the United States through the ports of entries and they don't do that. I mean, I understand. I understand that you know, they're going through rough times, I get all that but you know what? There's a right way to do things and the wrong way. If you come to my home, you need to knock on my door, not break in through my window, it's that simple. And it has nothing to do with the race, it has nothing to do with what political aisle you sit on, the reality is we need to secure our borders, we need to have security and the people that are elected in political positions need to start caring about the United States citizens and the people that truly represent."

So U.S. Customs and Border Patrol says that they just caught two more members of MS-13 gang and two convicted and previously deported sex offenders trying to cross the border. So Saman, why is there this downplaying that somehow criminals cannot be in the midst of these caravans. Obviously the bulk of the people trying to get over here aren't bad people but why is there this downplaying that somehow bad people aren't in the mix. Secretary Nielsen said, I think it was a while but not too long ago, saying that there are 600 criminals among the caravan so why is there a downplaying of something that just seems like common sense?"

You know what, I mean people remember that. Those children were treated, they were separated from their families, this is something that's been going on for a long time. I'll say it again, it's a systematic issue, I wasn't - I'm not attacking DHS or USCIS.

U.S. officials want ISIS and its ideology have spread to other continents including Europe and Africa where terror attacks have been launched in recent days. In Iraq not all U.S. troops are training local forces. The U.S. artillery on Iraq's border with Syria has been shelling ISIS positions around the clock in eastern Syria. The last known ISIS stronghold is the city of Hajin located within the range of those cannons. At its height in 2014, ISIS controlled an area, the size of Ohio. During President Trump's first year in office, airstrikes against the terror group increased 33%, roughly 40000 bombs were dropped on ISIS last year. This year airstrikes have sharply reduced as fewer ISIS targets remain on the battlefield. Today, ISIS only holds 1% of the territory once held in Iraq and Syria. Despite the gains against ISIS, the security situation in Iraq remains tense, one of the reasons the President's visit remained secret and the President and First Lady only spend a few hours on the ground at a U.S. controlled air base west of Baghdad in the middle of the night.

Thousands of foreign fighters not flooding into the Middle East. Iran has been put on notice. I actually think his record speaks for himself. If it had been any other president, any other president except Donald Trump, people would be trumpeting this as the triumph of two years of successful foreign policy in the region."

The reason the president has done this, has made this statement, and quite honestly, I think it could have been done in a way that was maybe a little more time and collaborative with some of the other decision-makers that he is going to have implement this -- it was unveiled rather quickly. But the reason he is doing it is because he is trying to shift the U.S. away from what has been going on since I was a sophomore in college, which is we invade countries, we stay in those countries, we never leave those countries, and we are then responsible for rebuilding, for training, for funding, for preventing security collapse, during Iraq, during Afghanistan. He does not want that to be true in Syria. They are obviously very real concerns about our Kurdish allies. There's also the possibility of an ISIS resurgence. But there's always going to be downsides to not having the single greatest military in history of the world in a country holding it together. We are never going to reach a point where it is a better thing for us not to be in a place like Syria. So I think the president is trying to do what he can with the realities of the timetables he has."

This notion that somehow if we can hold onto peace and Syria, we will provide space to participate in the political sentiment. There is not going to be a political sentiment. Syria is owned by the Iranians and the Russians. That is not going to change unless somebody wants to fight World War III over it. Sensible people will say, look, the issue we have with the president is not to say we are going to transition our footprint in Syria. It makes perfect sense. It is how we do that. And I think quite honestly, the way the president announced it, and we still don't really understand what the plan is for Syria, that's what I think has created a concern. Do it in a way that we don't sacrifice the gains that we made and we can con.. to protect our interests. Look, the day the president announced we were leaving Syria, we have actually increased our military activity since he said that. So obviously, we are not just walking away. So I think there is a bit of too much stress here. And the same thing in Iraq. We're in Iraq. We're doing advise and assist mission. We're keeping it so we don't have to go back. And I think we'll keep a footprint in Afghanistan. But the same thing, we are not there permanently. We're providing an advise and assist mission. So I think this president is really trying to walk a line between running away from things the way Obama did and trying to solve problems by invading countries the way we did in the previous administration."

This is a case that focuses on just one memorial in Maryland, but it could have far-reaching consequences impacting monuments across the nation, including some at Arlington National Cemetery. The memorial at the center of this case is a cross that honors World War I veterans in Bladensburg, Maryland. Its construction was started by community members and mothers whose sons died in World War I, and it was completed by the American Legion. A lower court has ruled that the cross should be removed because it violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution, which, of course, reads quote, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" But an amicus brief filed by 30 states says the Supreme Court, quote, \"should reverse the lower court's call for its destruction as it's place in our national tradition and broader cultural context make clear the Bladensburg memorial honors both the servicemembers it was built to honor and the constitutional ideals, including in the First Amendment they died to defend.\" And West Virginia's attorney general, who led to the group of 30 states in challenging the lower court, said, quote, \"We owe a great deal of gratitude to the brave men and women who sacrificed everything for our country. Honoring that sacrifice with memorials that include religious symbols does not violate the U.S. Constitution and is one of the many freedoms these men and women fought to preserve.\" Now, the challenge to the 93 old cross began with the American Humanist Association, a nonprofit atheist organization that has, of course, Lisa, filed similar lawsuits across the country.

      "speaker": "PATRICK MORRISEY, R-W.V., ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "A couple of reasons. First of all, thank you for having me on. It's a very important issue because if the Supreme Court doesn't reverse what just happened in the fourth circuit, we could be dealing with a situation where hundreds of memorials across the country may be forced to be torn down. And we think, just as you indicated, that the purpose of this memorial is to honor the war dead. We know when the peace cross was first put together, this was done to honor 49 individuals who fought in World War I, and they were commemorated. Across the country, there are memorials very similar to this. But you have to look at the context in which of these memorials are set up. The states and individuals have the right to commemorate the dead. And that's different. That is not a purely religious purpose. Quite the opposite, that is a secular purpose. And so we think this fits very cleanly within the Establishment Clause jurisprudence. We think that the court can clarify this a little bit going forward. But I think that this peace cross was done with private funds, this peace cross was unchallenged for almost 90 years. It has been part of the fabric, the historic tradition within the community. And there is really no reason to tear it down from a legal perspective."

All right, so \"If this gravestone is bulldozed to the ground, it's only a matter time before the wrecking ball turns on Arlington National Cemetery and the hundreds of memorials like this one across the country.\" So I want to know what you think of that, Fred. And also not only that, you look at awards that are given out, military awards. You've got the Army's distinguished service cross, the Navy cross, the Air Force cross. Do you want all those removed as well? Are those not OK with you?"

It is unmistakable. And when it is illuminated at night, all you see is this cross floating in the darkness. You don't know it's supposed to be a war memorial, you can't tell. And in fact the war memorial aspects of it are so small and so minor, they are dwarfed by the size of the cross. In fact, when I first saw --"

We know that the inscription on the memorial is a secular in nature, talking about valor, talking about honor. You can actually have a memorial whose purpose is mostly secular. In fact, if you go back and you look at how many individuals who came back from World War I were honored, they were honored by crosses, and there are poems, there are stories that talk about the rows of crosses that were set up. And it's meant to honor the dead. So you can really distinguish that. So it really I think takes a stretch to say this is purely for religious purposes. I think that the history bears out that this is primarily for secular purposes. And that, once again, if this cross were allowed to fall, then you could see Arlington, some of the cross there in trouble. In my home state of West Virginia, whether you are in Elkins, whether you're at the state capital, there are number of capitals that could fall because this starts to stretch First Amendment jurisprudence and not the way the founders intended."

We only challenge the one that is a 40-foot tall Latin cross."
