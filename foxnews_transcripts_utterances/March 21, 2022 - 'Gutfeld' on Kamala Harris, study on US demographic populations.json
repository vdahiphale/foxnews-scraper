      "sentences": "Good evening, I'm Geraldo Rivera. You know, one challenge to do in the news these days is not treating the war like every other story, as entertainment. Here we make the news entertaining, perhaps better than any show that ever came before it. Largely due to me. And that our competition over at CNN is as fun as a case of crabs. And not the ones that are delicious with melted butter. But now we run headfirst into daily atrocity. And I don't mean facing a hangover Kat in the hallway. Ukraine is war and it's ugly, with grim imagery and relentless horror stories. But the news requires standard narratives and if you veer off the beaten track, God help you. Other issues demanded the same solemn treatment. ISIS, pandemic death polls, a Kamala Harris speech. I mean, what about the significance of the passage of time, am I right?",

      "sentences": "She is truly a national treasure, if by treasure, you mean, embarrassment. But, you know, bad news often becomes relentless news. And I get your mail and I get your tweets, so I understand. But the news dictates the mood. It's like those mass shootings, we stop everything to go live to the scene and we repeat the same 90 seconds of information, mainly because it's all the information that we have available. It's not the reporters fault. It's the unstoppable predictability of the editorial loop. So it's the number of injured, dead, locations, city shooter repeat. Then comes the coverage of the coverage as the media turns into its usual circle of self- reflection. That's where I come in. That's my job. See? I figure the news is really 30 minutes total or the same time it takes Jimy Failla to steal a jacket from a homeless tramp. But like a Vegas casino, cable news never closes, which is why commentary rules. If it weren't for bozos like me, you would have a lot of silence. But when I was a kid, a new -- the news was like 30 minutes in the morning, a recap at lunch, another 30 during dinner. Unless something big happened like the Kennedy assassination, the moon landing or Marcia Brady going braless. Who could forget that? And life went on as usual. We played outside, got tuberculosis and shoveled snow year round. CNN change that. Now we have pretty much the same quantity of news but we have to add a lot of hamburger helper to feed a family of 330 million or six Brian Stelters. CNN showed it was possible and also showed us how it could destroy a country. Play the George Floyd video two times an hour for months and you do more to undermine the fabric of a country than any foreign disinformation. Why look for good news when you can binge watch home movies of the worst moments of your life? One news story becomes like a potato where you can figure it out so many ways to prepare it. Oh Groton, mashed, fried, but usually half baked. First you report it, then you wonder how it affects the economy, the climate, the disadvantaged, the children, the economic climate for disadvantaged children. Unless of course their father is Hunter Biden. Then you turn it back on the media, which is my specialty. As the media reports the story what is the media actually saying? I mean, other than it's Trump's fault and you're racist, sexist and homophobic. In media commentary, we're so high on the smell of our own farts. Baked beans are an aphrodisiac. That is disgusting. But in war, we get -- poor Charlie. But in war, we get serious as it gets ugly. We lose the theme music we drop the cute segments, we come in with breaking news graphics. Now it's nearly a month of this nightly grim routine. Bomb strikes, rubble, refugees, the dead, rinse and repeat. We care too much else because none of us have any real insights, except maybe for Kilmeade and that's only because his male pattern baldness is in the shape of Belarus. Sometimes in my job, I run across stories that seem too on the nose. So, we use phrases like reportedly or some say, like the waitress who finds a racist note under receipt, or an actor beaten by Trump supporters that night, or the idiot son of a president losing his laptop somewhere. Well, that story turns out to be legit. Which is why they tried to suffocate it like Rosie O'Donnell is sitting on a Chihuahua. There were others out of Ukraine, the Phantom jet fighter down in Russian jets. Sailors refusing to surrender. But the only thing real that we know of is the brutality. War is bad. And the longer it goes, the worse it gets. But sadly, it makes a great miniseries. It's the greatest show on earth if you're lucky enough to live here and binge watch it like a Netflix offering. But most importantly, it revives the old truth about T.V. news. If it bleeds it leads. But that just makes me wonder where it's leading me. I hope someplace else other than World War III.",

Here's how to deal among the suggestions. Take the bus. Don't buy in bulk. Try lentils instead of meat. At least that explains how the buses will run on natural gas. But also the article written by an apparent professor of economics offered this advice. You might want to rethink those costly pet medical needs, it may sound harsh but researchers actually don't recommend pet chemo which can cost up to 10 grand for ethical reasons. Yes. Rescuing dogs is so 2020. Way to combine Michael Vick with Jack Kevorkian. Of course, is everyone who's already crapping on this article has pointed out, those making under 300 grand a year is pretty much everyone in the country. So, that's the real bad news. Elites think people making under 300 G's are broke losers. The worst news is with inflation, they soon will be. But it does raise the question, who's behind all this lobbying for lentils?

      "utterance": "Good evening, I'm Geraldo Rivera. You know, one challenge to do in the news these days is not treating the war like every other story, as entertainment. Here we make the news entertaining, perhaps better than any show that ever came before it. Largely due to me. And that our competition over at CNN is as fun as a case of crabs. And not the ones that are delicious with melted butter. But now we run headfirst into daily atrocity. And I don't mean facing a hangover Kat in the hallway. Ukraine is war and it's ugly, with grim imagery and relentless horror stories. But the news requires standard narratives and if you veer off the beaten track, God help you. Other issues demanded the same solemn treatment. ISIS, pandemic death polls, a Kamala Harris speech. I mean, what about the significance of the passage of time, am I right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "-- about the significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time. So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time. And there is such great significance to the passage of time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "She is truly a national treasure, if by treasure, you mean, embarrassment. But, you know, bad news often becomes relentless news. And I get your mail and I get your tweets, so I understand. But the news dictates the mood. It's like those mass shootings, we stop everything to go live to the scene and we repeat the same 90 seconds of information, mainly because it's all the information that we have available. It's not the reporters fault. It's the unstoppable predictability of the editorial loop. So it's the number of injured, dead, locations, city shooter repeat. Then comes the coverage of the coverage as the media turns into its usual circle of self- reflection. That's where I come in. That's my job. See? I figure the news is really 30 minutes total or the same time it takes Jimy Failla to steal a jacket from a homeless tramp. But like a Vegas casino, cable news never closes, which is why commentary rules. If it weren't for bozos like me, you would have a lot of silence. But when I was a kid, a new -- the news was like 30 minutes in the morning, a recap at lunch, another 30 during dinner. Unless something big happened like the Kennedy assassination, the moon landing or Marcia Brady going braless. Who could forget that? And life went on as usual. We played outside, got tuberculosis and shoveled snow year round. CNN change that. Now we have pretty much the same quantity of news but we have to add a lot of hamburger helper to feed a family of 330 million or six Brian Stelters. CNN showed it was possible and also showed us how it could destroy a country. Play the George Floyd video two times an hour for months and you do more to undermine the fabric of a country than any foreign disinformation. Why look for good news when you can binge watch home movies of the worst moments of your life? One news story becomes like a potato where you can figure it out so many ways to prepare it. Oh Groton, mashed, fried, but usually half baked. First you report it, then you wonder how it affects the economy, the climate, the disadvantaged, the children, the economic climate for disadvantaged children. Unless of course their father is Hunter Biden. Then you turn it back on the media, which is my specialty. As the media reports the story what is the media actually saying? I mean, other than it's Trump's fault and you're racist, sexist and homophobic. In media commentary, we're so high on the smell of our own farts. Baked beans are an aphrodisiac. That is disgusting. But in war, we get -- poor Charlie. But in war, we get serious as it gets ugly. We lose the theme music we drop the cute segments, we come in with breaking news graphics. Now it's nearly a month of this nightly grim routine. Bomb strikes, rubble, refugees, the dead, rinse and repeat. We care too much else because none of us have any real insights, except maybe for Kilmeade and that's only because his male pattern baldness is in the shape of Belarus. Sometimes in my job, I run across stories that seem too on the nose. So, we use phrases like reportedly or some say, like the waitress who finds a racist note under receipt, or an actor beaten by Trump supporters that night, or the idiot son of a president losing his laptop somewhere. Well, that story turns out to be legit. Which is why they tried to suffocate it like Rosie O'Donnell is sitting on a Chihuahua. There were others out of Ukraine, the Phantom jet fighter down in Russian jets. Sailors refusing to surrender. But the only thing real that we know of is the brutality. War is bad. And the longer it goes, the worse it gets. But sadly, it makes a great miniseries. It's the greatest show on earth if you're lucky enough to live here and binge watch it like a Netflix offering. But most importantly, it revives the old truth about T.V. news. If it bleeds it leads. But that just makes me wonder where it's leading me. I hope someplace else other than World War III."

And that is -- so now you actually have people who are able to provide images, and it's not from CNN. It's actually from people who are they're experiencing it by themselves. So to me, that is the most believable thing. Like they have the phone, they're filming it, and they're have -- they like put it out there on their feet.

People don't think of being cavalier about that but the effect that has on us in terms of what we're witnessing in our phone every day, I am concerned, we're becoming desensitized. Because we're seeing things you're not supposed to see. You know, like, I grew up in an era where the only way to see certain things was to go out and do them. You know what I mean? Like if you actually, you know, wanted to see someone fight a stripper, you had to show up, get past the bouncer and punch your stripper. Now, you type it into Google. Now you type it into Google, they're like, did you mean a brunette stripper or a blonde strip -- you know what I mean? And I just feel like we have too many options at our disposal.

Here's how to deal among the suggestions. Take the bus. Don't buy in bulk. Try lentils instead of meat. At least that explains how the buses will run on natural gas. But also the article written by an apparent professor of economics offered this advice. You might want to rethink those costly pet medical needs, it may sound harsh but researchers actually don't recommend pet chemo which can cost up to 10 grand for ethical reasons. Yes. Rescuing dogs is so 2020. Way to combine Michael Vick with Jack Kevorkian. Of course, is everyone who's already crapping on this article has pointed out, those making under 300 grand a year is pretty much everyone in the country. So, that's the real bad news. Elites think people making under 300 G's are broke losers. The worst news is with inflation, they soon will be. But it does raise the question, who's behind all this lobbying for lentils?

A new study, Americans were asked to guess the percentage of various groups in the United States. And like my clothes at one of Hemmer's hot tub parties, our guesses were completely off. For example, people thought nearly a third a third of the country was gay. The actual number, 80 percent; no, I'm kidding, three percent. Transgender people were estimated to be 21 percent of the population when it's allegedly 0.6 percent, in reality. Perhaps some of the non-binary people may have been counted twice. Study participants guessed that Jewish people were 30 percent of the country when they're actually closer to two percent. I didn't know that. And African Americans were estimated at 41 percent, compared to 12. I haven't seen this many exaggerations since January 6th."

West, West had his Instagram account suspended for 24 hours after he directed a racial slur at Trevor Noah, who'd been criticizing West's treatment of ex-wife Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson. Apparently, West has been harassing them on social media. Davidson is best known for being the new boyfriend of Kim, and the former boyfriend of everyone else.
