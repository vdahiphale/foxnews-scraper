      "sentences": "Great show. Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" We have so much happening tonight. So much ground to cover. Let's get right to it. Leaks, of course, coming from James Comey's book. What we see now is if this is that if this is all they have, they've got nothing. It's like petty and insignificant issues and it's more like mean girls gossip than blockbusters. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, will the next House speaker be a Trump conservative or another D.C. insider swamp monster? Reince Priebus gives his analysis in an exquisite of interview. Plus, we are going to get his first reactions to the big Comey dud. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, Congress holds an emergency hearing on illegal immigrant caravan that's heading to the United States and it's coming here from Mexico after shocking reports emerge. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the man who called the hearing, Congressman Ron Desantis, has stunning details. By the way, Michelle Malkin is going to stop by. She's going to expose the dark forces trying to suppress free speech in our latest installment of \"Defending the First.\" You do not want to miss this. We are going to name names. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, was the raid on Trump's personal attorney just a proxy move by Mueller in his fishing expedition? That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Do you hear that drip, drip, drip sound? Those are the nonstop leaks coming from the offices of the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York which on Monday as we know executed that raid on the home, the work, and the temporary residence of Trump lawyer, Michael Cohen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } From unnamed sources with knowledge of the investigation, we learned that the search focused on documents related to porn star, Stormy Daniels, and that potential crimes may include bank and wire fraud along with campaign finance violations. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, yesterday, there were more leaks that investigators were scouring for information related to, and I kid you not, the \"Access Hollywood\" tape. And a new report today in the New Yorker alleging possible payments to a Trump Tower doorman and others during the campaign. Bottom line, right now, as things are, Russian collusion seems to be a faint memory. After all the hype about that Trump Tower meeting with Don Jr. and the Russian attorney, all after all of the \"hide the ball\" tactics that the DOJ used applying for that FISA warrant. And you think about it, after all the speculation about Trump's relationship with Russia, Mueller has come up with goose eggs. Now, Team Trump is properly worried that Mueller is just using the southern district of New York as a proxy to do their dirty work. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, have the New York agents vacuum up a whole bunch of stuff in Cohen's files on the president's personal business deals, again, arguably outside the scope of the special counsel's jurisdiction, and then shoot it back over to us if it's helpful to our cause and going after the president. That way, Mueller gets credit for initially going to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, with the information in the first place. What do you think we should do with this, Rod? But he gets none of the downside by being the guy who executes the search warrant against the president's personal attorney. Never happened in the history of the country before. Now, remember, last summer, President Trump said that the effort, any effort by the feds to look into his personal finances is mm-mm. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

With me in studio, Joe diGenova, former U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C.

This is about gathering information for impeachment. It's not about information for criminal cases, but here's the problem. The problem is from the beginning, this investigation has been illegitimate, and that's because Rod Rosenstein had no authority to appoint Bob Mueller. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Rod Rosenstein had multiple conflicts of interest.

He cannot be supervising Mueller. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Guess what?

Leaks, of course, coming from James Comey's book. What we see now is if this is that if this is all they have, they've got nothing. It's like petty and insignificant issues and it's more like mean girls gossip than blockbusters. Plus, will the next House speaker be a Trump conservative or another D.C. insider swamp monster? Reince Priebus gives his analysis in an exquisite of interview. Plus, we are going to get his first reactions to the big Comey dud. Also, Congress holds an emergency hearing on illegal immigrant caravan that's heading to the United States and it's coming here from Mexico after shocking reports emerge. And the man who called the hearing, Congressman Ron Desantis, has stunning details. By the way, Michelle Malkin is going to stop by. She's going to expose the dark forces trying to suppress free speech in our latest installment of \"Defending the First.\" You do not want to miss this. We are going to name names. But first, was the raid on Trump's personal attorney just a proxy move by Mueller in his fishing expedition? That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Do you hear that drip, drip, drip sound? Those are the nonstop leaks coming from the offices of the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York which on Monday as we know executed that raid on the home, the work, and the temporary residence of Trump lawyer, Michael Cohen. From unnamed sources with knowledge of the investigation, we learned that the search focused on documents related to porn star, Stormy Daniels, and that potential crimes may include bank and wire fraud along with campaign finance violations. Now, yesterday, there were more leaks that investigators were scouring for information related to, and I kid you not, the \"Access Hollywood\" tape. And a new report today in the New Yorker alleging possible payments to a Trump Tower doorman and others during the campaign. Bottom line, right now, as things are, Russian collusion seems to be a faint memory. After all the hype about that Trump Tower meeting with Don Jr. and the Russian attorney, all after all of the \"hide the ball\" tactics that the DOJ used applying for that FISA warrant. And you think about it, after all the speculation about Trump's relationship with Russia, Mueller has come up with goose eggs. Now, Team Trump is properly worried that Mueller is just using the southern district of New York as a proxy to do their dirty work. In other words, have the New York agents vacuum up a whole bunch of stuff in Cohen's files on the president's personal business deals, again, arguably outside the scope of the special counsel's jurisdiction, and then shoot it back over to us if it's helpful to our cause and going after the president. That way, Mueller gets credit for initially going to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, with the information in the first place. What do you think we should do with this, Rod? But he gets none of the downside by being the guy who executes the search warrant against the president's personal attorney. Never happened in the history of the country before. Now, remember, last summer, President Trump said that the effort, any effort by the feds to look into his personal finances is mm-mm."

When an unelected and largely unaccountable band of hyper-partisan attorneys loyal to the previous president and maybe even Hillary Clinton, they are able to spend millions of your tax dollars in search of a crime merely to undo the results of a presidential election. That's the thing that should worry us, and that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction, in Raleigh, North Carolina, is Sol Wisenberg, who is the deputy independent counsel in the Bill Clinton investigation. With me in studio, Joe diGenova, former U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C. Joe, the more you look into what happened with the execution of that warrant against Cohen and the thinking now and it took me a while to get there, that this was all just a big pretext to vacuum up more personal information from the president that they couldn't otherwise get. JOE DIGENOVA, PARTNER, DIGENOVA & TOENSING: Definitely pretextual search warrant designed to gather up information, as you said, Mueller ponded off on the Southern District of New York because he didn't want to appear to be touching it, but this is his dirty work. This is about gathering information for impeachment. It's not about information for criminal cases, but here's the problem. The problem is from the beginning, this investigation has been illegitimate, and that's because Rod Rosenstein had no authority to appoint Bob Mueller. Rod Rosenstein had multiple conflicts of interest. He wrote the letter and the memorandum firing James Comey. He was party to conversations with the president and others about the firing of James Comey. He is a witness in this case. He cannot be supervising Mueller. Guess what? He isn't. He is letting Mueller do whatever Mueller wants to do. That's a disgrace. It's an embarrassment. Jeff Sessions should fire Mueller -- should fire Rosenstein tomorrow, tomorrow. Tomorrow he should fire Rosenstein."

You have been nice enough to have me on your show several times. I think your viewers now know I call it like I see it. I will admit to you I'm a little biased here because I have known Rod for 21 years. I know of nobody in the Department of Justice with more integrity than Rod Rosenstein. It doesn't mean that he or anyone else in the department, including Bob Mueller, is immune from criticism. If they have done something that's wrong, go ahead and criticize them. I'm just telling you what I'm telling your viewers, I know nobody with more integrity, and I will tell you something else. There are three things about Rod that I keep hearing, not on your show come about by anchors and other shows and none of them are accurate. One is that Rod is a liberal Democrat. He is a lifelong mainstream Republican. Two is that Rod and Comey were good friends. As far as I know, they weren't friends at all, much less close friends.

Criminal activity be investigated. No crime or criminal activity was stated in the memorandum appointing Mueller that's because there was no crime. Rod Rosenstein pointed Mueller to get rid of a hot potato. It had nothing to do whatsoever with criminal activity. He didn't want the responsibility, like Jeff Sessions had done, by appointing Mr. Hubert to investigate crimes inside the Justice Department about FISA. Rod should have done that. He didn't do that. He appointed a special counsel where none is justified under those regulations. As far as I am concerned, this isn't about integrity or anything else. It's about doing your job. It's about being able to carry out the duties of the deputy attorney general. And I've known Rod a long time. I don't know him as well as you do, and I don't know anything about the things you were talking about, these various relationships. I do know this.

There does have to be a criminal investigation. It's now clear. Remember the charter says that Mueller could look into anything in the investigation that James Comey announced when he testified before Congress. It's now been made explicitly clear that Comey, if you want to criticize somebody, I am all for criticizing Comey. Comey had already launched a criminal investigation of several matters, including two very important matters relating to Paul Manafort, whether he had colluded and taken money from the Ukrainian ex-president. There was clearly already a criminal investigation."

And it looks to me like you guys are a lot more experience than I am on this. I haven't practiced law in a long time, but it looks like an investigation in search of a crime that they hoped was committed by the president of the United States or the candidate himself. That's why going to vote we started with, they ran out of steam on this Mueller collusion argument. They ran out of steam so then they had to go to the Southern District.

The Supreme Court has said pretextual searches are OK if you -- you can have probable cause to look for something even if you are really looking for something else.

Is it possible to use an attorney as a shield to protect information? Do people do that? I imagine they do. I'm not saying that was done here.

What we know about James Comey, and you said it, the things he did before the election were wrong and it goes back to the Bush administration when he grand standard on one of the intelligence programs we had and created this whole drama about himself when there was a program the FBI had previously approved that the Justice Department previously approved, and then James Comey had this dramatic moment at a hospital to reverse everything the Department of Justice previously did.

He could have run again, gotten to the minority, and then resigned, but it wouldn't of been honest to the people that were there. So I don't see any other way. When you go to pancake breakfasts, Laura, and I know you know politics and you do all these things too. But when you go to pancake breakfasts for 20 years in these little towns that you represent, it's very difficult to ask people to put up four-by-eight yard signs all over the district knowing that coming January you're only going to say I'm out of here, and then you have to go home and live with the people that you just lied to, there's just no way around it. The other thing I would say privately in talking to Paul, and I know him well and we talk a lot.

I think it's so important, Michelle for the people watching FOX tonight to see and understand what this all is really all about. And I want to start with George Soros. George Soros has funded leftwing groups, as you've pointed out, the Center for American Progress. I think we have a graphic. Can we see it please? The Color of Change. People for the American Way, Media Matters Action Network connected with Media Matters. There we have all those organizations. Tell us, Michelle, which are the worst offenders and enemies of free thought and free expression?"

      "utterance": "Media Matters has been at the forefront of the speech squelcher's who are highly organized, incredibly disciplined, and obviously deeply funded not only by George Soros but a number of leftwing foundations. And I think it's really important to note that so many of these outfits are tax-exempt, that they enjoy so much largess as a result of IRS laws, and that under Democratic administrations, the definitions of 501C3s and C4s have been stretched so that these blatantly partisan political organizations have cast themselves as somehow educational or social welfare groups. So you have Media Matters that has gone after every prominent conservative effective voice in the public square, and they will use any pretext. These people do this for a full-time living. And as a result, it is undeniable, Laura, and you and I fought in this arena for so many years now in talk radio, on broadcast, and, yes, on social media where it has been so important for independent conservative voices to get their messages out. And we know that the encroachment of these censors and these bullies in the public square has left an undeniable cloud over the First Amendment and free expression."

      "utterance": "Michelle, people say, well, this is all the free marketplace of ideas. Everyone else, they want to complain about someone who says something, they do that, and that's part of the democratic process too. And so each side has their own opinions and one side wants to -- whatever they are doing. You have these corporations that just wilt, though. They just wilt. They get 100 emails from some leftwing activists and they wilt. Meanwhile millions of conservatives are like, are you kidding me? It makes no sense."

      "speaker": "MALKIN",
      "utterance": "Yes, and in some cases these supposedly back lash that elicits this feckless response from corporations that just don't want any bad publicity sometimes constitutes a couple tweets, right? And so then you have the Media Matters and Color of Changes of the world that exploit their social justice status. They have an absolute immunity shield to go after conservatives for expressing mainstream thought and opinion. And that's what people need to know about the agenda. The agenda of these leftwing character assassins is to marginalize mainstream thought."

      "utterance": "What did you think of that Joe diGenova, Sol Wisenberg debate about Mueller, Comey, the investigation? I think it would make a great weekly segment, don't you? Tweet me, what do you think about it, @IngrahamAngle. See you on radio tomorrow morning. We'll be back here tomorrow night. That's all the time we have right now, so sad. But now we have Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team to take it from here. And they have a fantastic show on tap as always.
