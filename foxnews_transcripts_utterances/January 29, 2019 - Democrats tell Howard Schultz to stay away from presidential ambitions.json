      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" One of the great secrets of Washington, something we don't tell anybody outside the city is that the only people who really benefit from the presidential primaries are the political consultants who work in them. The candidates themselves almost always finished the experience sadder, poor and humiliated. The public, meanwhile hates the whole thing. They get to spend half a year tormented by the white noise of 30-second attack ads. Only the consultants really seem to enjoy themselves and why wouldn't they? They walk away rich. For them, it's a great deal. So they've got every incentive to recruit new suckers to the game. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The latest mark is a billionaire called Howard Schultz. He's the former CEO of Starbucks. A pair of slick consultant somehow convinced Howard Schultz that he could be President, so over the weekend, he announced he made it in the race. Here's the twist. Schultz who is an entirely conventional affluent Liberal said that he is not planning to run as a Democrat, but instead as an Independent. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, Democrats were horrified by this. \"Boycott Starbucks\" started trending on Twitter. Michael Bloomberg denounced Schultz. Some on the left were so angry, they screamed at Howard Schultz when he went in public. Watch what happened at a book event last night. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

They just all feel obligated to pretend he did. Nobody wants to be rude about it. And yet, Shultz's problems aren't really related to what he believes his political positions. His views are really indistinguishable from Nancy Pelosi's views. Schultz's sin is running third party. That's a threat to the one thing that Democrats actually care about, and no, it's not fighting climate change or preserving a woman's right to choose or even protecting those noble undocumented migrants that are always lecturing you about. In the end, Democrats are pretty flexible and all of that stuff. They're just talking points. They're transactional bargaining chips to keep their coalition together, whatever. What Democrats really want, what they're not kidding about, at all, is political power - the right to run things, the right to be in charge, power; and they want it so bad they can taste it. Poor hapless Howard Schultz and his overfunded midlife crisis just got in their way, so they have to crush him. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } At least one Democrat was honest enough to admit this.",

Maybe get some ideas that appeal to actual voters or something like that. The irony is that the very people who are the most upset about Howard Schultz entering the presidential race, are the very same ones who've been yelling at you about how vital democracy is and how they're the defenders of democracy, and yet somehow three candidates on a single ballot is just way too many for them.

They called her an agent of Russia for daring to do that. They never charged her for that crime, though. So she's free to join us tonight, and she is. Dr. Jill Stein with us now.

We need non-corporate choices and people-powered choices. And we can have those choices without fear of splitting the vote. There is a win-win solution here. It's called ranked choice voting. The State of Maine just passed it. It's used by millions of voters around the country. So it really makes obsolete this whole issue of the struggle between, \"Well, can we have choices or do we have to force people into two pigeonholes --\" the majority of voters, almost 60% of voters, they're saying that we need a new independent political party because they're tired of being thrown under the bus by the other two, whether we have Democrats or Republicans, it's not working out so well for everyday working people who --",

And then, of course, the mayor of New York doing the same thing, making the same proposal. That one would stretch out over and apply effectively to 2021 and apply to everyone, of course, conveniently just after the 2020 election. So they're campaigning on this. It's a big campaign dynamic. But it's California and New York saying exactly the same thing that there should be universal healthcare and it should apply to whoever is in our borders. Now, that is impossible, and it would - and you can look at, we can use historically, not just Venezuela, but you can look at even as controlled socialist framework like this destroy civilizations. It destroys cultures. It destroys countries. And it does so because it's unsustainable, and yet the left has nothing else to offer. So what they do is they promise free things, they print out more money. You've got like in Venezuela, I think the inflation rate at this point is 80,000%. And it's unsustainable. So when Kamala Harris says this, and she said it in that clip, that it's a human right. Now, when you're saying that, this then presumes that the supply of it, the presenting of healthcare, if it's a human right, then it means if you choose to not give people that healthcare as a doctor, as an individual, you then are violating those people's human rights.

We begin with border barriers in Tunisia and Jordan. Democrats voted to pay for those walls, so obviously, they're okay. Israel has walls, too, everywhere basically protecting its borders with Egypt and Gaza and the West Bank and Democrats won't criticize those walls. Meanwhile, Pakistan has a massive fence, a wall really on its border with Afghanistan. It's designed to combat smuggling, terrorism and illegal immigration, and yet, Pakistan still gets plenty of American aid, so that wall is fine, too. Even peaceful Denmark has a wall it turns out. It's 43 miles long. It's on the German border. It's meant to keep pigs out, so it passes the morality test. Here in the U.S., it turns out we have plenty of moral walls, too. Just this Sunday, Kamala Harris announced her campaign for President for security. Huge swathes of the streets of Oakland, California were blocked, walled off, you might say with her own security at stake. Senator Harris had no problem with this. They were moral walls and there are many more moral walls. Benny Johnson of \"The Daily Caller\" has set out across America to find more of them.

Hundreds of reporters and editors at places like \"Huffington Post\" and BuzzFeed lost their jobs, victims of systemic changes to their industry. No matter what you think those sites, it's sad. Anyone who has lost his job knows, it's very tough. Now those journalists suddenly have a lot in common with millions of other Americans -- factory workers, loggers, retail clerks, coal miners -- all of them and many more have seen their way of life disappear, thanks to technology or outsourcing or private equity. This kind of thing has been going on a long time. Now in previous cycles, what we used to call creative destruction, journalists had ready advice for newly unemployed blue collar workers. Just learn to code. Coding is the future. Stop whining and embrace it. Here's a selection of headlines you might remember on that subject. This one is from NPR, \"From Coal to Code: A new path for laid off miners in Kentucky.\" From \"Wired,\" the tech evangelist magazine. \"Can you teach a coal miner to code?\" From CBS News, \"Out of work coal miners find new work in computer industry.\" And this from Bloomberg, \"Appalachian miners are learning to code.\" And from the venerable \"New York Times\" \"The coders of Kentucky.\" See, it's that simple. Let's say you spent 30 years making a solid middle class living in a paper mill in northern New Hampshire. Then one day, the mill shuts down, sold for scrap to China. It happened a lot, but no problem. Just learn to code. Everyone in Brooklyn is doing it. Well, coding was never a real solution to any of this, obviously, but it had the effect of making journalists feel even more self-satisfied, and of course, that was the point, it's always the point actually. Fast forward to this month. Someone on Twitter came up with a pretty brilliant piece of advice for all those laid off journalists trying to figure out what to do with their lives. Learn to code. Perfect. Suddenly \"learn to code\" was everywhere on Twitter. But journalists didn't see the humor in this at all. A former \"New Yorker\" employed called Talia Lavin called the phrase quote, \"Far right hate. People who went to Wesleyan shouldn't have to learn to code so they can play into the censorship authorities at Twitter,\" who immediately concluded that asking someone to learn to code might be quote, \"targeted harassment.\" But only when it's directed at people who used to work at BuzzFeed. For the paper mill guy in New Hampshire, coding is still the future. Well, Barstool Sports, probably the best set in the internet, Dave Portnoy runs it and he has become a scourge of the modern NFL. The NFL does not appreciate that. They have banned Barstool from all NFL events for years, and that includes the Super Bowls Media Day. So last night, Portnoy snuck into the Media Day event anyway, but he was spotted and kicked out and charged with criminal trespassing. Dave Portnoy, fresh from prison apparently joins us now to tell us what it was like. How did you wind up charged with criminal trespassing? I thought you were a legitimate website operator?",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" One of the great secrets of Washington, something we don't tell anybody outside the city is that the only people who really benefit from the presidential primaries are the political consultants who work in them. The candidates themselves almost always finished the experience sadder, poor and humiliated. The public, meanwhile hates the whole thing. They get to spend half a year tormented by the white noise of 30-second attack ads. Only the consultants really seem to enjoy themselves and why wouldn't they? They walk away rich. For them, it's a great deal. So they've got every incentive to recruit new suckers to the game. The latest mark is a billionaire called Howard Schultz. He's the former CEO of Starbucks. A pair of slick consultant somehow convinced Howard Schultz that he could be President, so over the weekend, he announced he made it in the race. Here's the twist. Schultz who is an entirely conventional affluent Liberal said that he is not planning to run as a Democrat, but instead as an Independent. Well, Democrats were horrified by this. \"Boycott Starbucks\" started trending on Twitter. Michael Bloomberg denounced Schultz. Some on the left were so angry, they screamed at Howard Schultz when he went in public. Watch what happened at a book event last night."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, in fairness, the heckler did make some solid points. The last thing we need is another egomaniacal Davos moron running the country into the ground. If you sincerely thought Barack Obama did a great job as President, you'd probably be perfectly happy with Howard Schultz at the helm. The problem is, nobody really thinks that Obama did a great job as President. They just all feel obligated to pretend he did. Nobody wants to be rude about it. And yet, Shultz's problems aren't really related to what he believes his political positions. His views are really indistinguishable from Nancy Pelosi's views. Schultz's sin is running third party. That's a threat to the one thing that Democrats actually care about, and no, it's not fighting climate change or preserving a woman's right to choose or even protecting those noble undocumented migrants that are always lecturing you about. In the end, Democrats are pretty flexible and all of that stuff. They're just talking points. They're transactional bargaining chips to keep their coalition together, whatever. What Democrats really want, what they're not kidding about, at all, is political power - the right to run things, the right to be in charge, power; and they want it so bad they can taste it. Poor hapless Howard Schultz and his overfunded midlife crisis just got in their way, so they have to crush him. At least one Democrat was honest enough to admit this."

      "utterance": "Well, the media we're watching and taking notes. Even now, you still hear people refer to the Press Corps as Liberal, but of course, they're not Liberal in any recognizable sense of the word. Genuine Liberals would welcome Howard Schultz into the race. More candidates, more opinions, more diversity of thought. May the best ideas win. That's what an actual Liberal would say. That's not with the media are saying. They're not Liberals. They're loyalists. They're party people. Diligent worker bees toiling from the benefit of their Democratic Party masters, so of course they parroted the line precisely. Michelle Goldberg of the \"New York Times\" who embodies this called Schultz's run reckless idiocy. She didn't even mention his views about anything, she doesn't care, it's irrelevant. \"The Daily Beast\" all but accused Howard Schultz of racism because that often works as a line of attack, quote, \"The Starbucks music store under Howard Schultz was painfully white,\" read a story today.

      "utterance": "Oh, Trump might benefit. Well, there's another way to look at the Democratic hysteria over Howard Schultz getting in the race, and Mark Cuban, of all people summed it up pretty well today. Quote, \"If 21 months before an election, you don't believe your candidate's platform is strong enough to win an election with independent candidates, you might want to rethink who you support.\" Yes, you might want to do that. Maybe get some ideas that appeal to actual voters or something like that. The irony is that the very people who are the most upset about Howard Schultz entering the presidential race, are the very same ones who've been yelling at you about how vital democracy is and how they're the defenders of democracy, and yet somehow three candidates on a single ballot is just way too many for them. You get the strong feeling they prefer to see just one candidate on the ballot. That way they'd win every time. Voters couldn't screw it up with their dumb opinions. We've seen all of this before. Many times Ralph Nader went through it when he dared to run third party in 2000. Jill Stein experienced it when she ran in 2016 on the Green Party ticket. Remember that? They called her an agent of Russia for daring to do that. They never charged her for that crime, though. So she's free to join us tonight, and she is. Dr. Jill Stein with us now. Dr. Stein, thanks very much for coming on. You'd think that the party of diversity would be for more diverse views, but they're not. Why is that?"

We've got two parties and they're both working for corporate masters and the fossil fuel giants and the big banks and Wall Street and war machine and so on. So that's not my opinion that that the Democrats are the party of diversity. But let me say, voters deserve more choices. And in the last election, we saw over a hundred million voters - the largest block of voters is not voting because they're not being represented by the system. So we really do need more choices. We need non-corporate choices and people-powered choices. And we can have those choices without fear of splitting the vote. There is a win-win solution here. It's called ranked choice voting. The State of Maine just passed it. It's used by millions of voters around the country. So it really makes obsolete this whole issue of the struggle between, \"Well, can we have choices or do we have to force people into two pigeonholes --\" the majority of voters, almost 60% of voters, they're saying that we need a new independent political party because they're tired of being thrown under the bus by the other two, whether we have Democrats or Republicans, it's not working out so well for everyday working people who --"

Why do they have to crush people, accuse them of being Russian agents, if they have a different view?"

In the last election, we had two candidates who were the most disliked and untrusted in modern history and 75% of voters were screaming for open debates. They wanted to hear from the Libertarian and the Green. They wanted to hear a debate about, for example, our war machine which is going full speed ahead right now. The last tax day, the average taxpayer gave over $3,500.00 practically to the war machine and $40.00 to the EPA. They give us clean air and water. How's that working out for us? Not so well."

But let's explore why he's not doing that, because there's another guy in there named Michael Bloomberg who has far more experience, how has demonstrated a record of actually creating constituencies and moving agendas for, who has devoted years and years and years of blood, sweat, tears and money to progressive causes like climate change and like gun control, who was a mayor for 12 years of the largest and most diverse city in United States and he has a lot more money than Howard Schultz.

You just don't like it because his getting in might hurt the party, and I wonder if voters might think like, \"Who cares about your dumb party? What are the ideas you're proposing?\" Do you see what I am saying? Maybe it should be about the issues and not the party."

Right now, there is no viable room for a third party candidate to run. I studied this extensively in 2012. Mike Bloomberg studied this extensively in 2016. Ironically, the nation is so divided right now that at this point in time with President Trump in office, a vote for against President Trump needs to go to a candidate that actually has a chance of winning. There is no conceivable place for someone in the middle right now between the two parties. We are so divided that there's actually ironically no room left. So get in the process. Get with one of the two political parties. Put your hat into the ring. Let's have an honest debate. The reason why this is so important, Democrats are so upset about it is, the future of the country is at stake. The future the climate, the future of the country, the future of the environment, the future the economy, the future of undocumented workers."

Anyone who is actually paying attention realize, once you have the chance of winning the Republican Primary, he has a 50/50 shot at being President. Let's do the math. Just listen to me for once. Listen do the math. Let's say he runs, Schultz runs as an independent. There are at least a hundred electoral votes who would definitely go from Liberal states like California, like New York for the Democrat. There at least 175, 180 electoral votes who go from hardcore southern states, right-wing states in the west and the south. That's over 280 votes. There's no room left. That would mean that no one got a majority. No one was able to get a majority in the Electoral College and now it would be passed to the House of Representatives.

And we've already seen - and when we think about what the Democrats are planning to do, we've seen this in California with Governor Gavin Newsom announcing that they already had Obamacare open for illegal aliens. And then he announced that it would apply to everyone in the state, regardless of whether you were there legally or not. And then, of course, the mayor of New York doing the same thing, making the same proposal. That one would stretch out over and apply effectively to 2021 and apply to everyone, of course, conveniently just after the 2020 election. So they're campaigning on this. It's a big campaign dynamic. But it's California and New York saying exactly the same thing that there should be universal healthcare and it should apply to whoever is in our borders. Now, that is impossible, and it would - and you can look at, we can use historically, not just Venezuela, but you can look at even as controlled socialist framework like this destroy civilizations. It destroys cultures. It destroys countries. And it does so because it's unsustainable, and yet the left has nothing else to offer. So what they do is they promise free things, they print out more money. You've got like in Venezuela, I think the inflation rate at this point is 80,000%. And it's unsustainable. So when Kamala Harris says this, and she said it in that clip, that it's a human right. Now, when you're saying that, this then presumes that the supply of it, the presenting of healthcare, if it's a human right, then it means if you choose to not give people that healthcare as a doctor, as an individual, you then are violating those people's human rights. So it comes down into quite a totalitarian framework about what the government is going to tell people to do and what it says they deserve."

They want to encourage the influx in; part of that is because of course, it's political. You've got the number of people who are in the House of Representatives are based on the population of the state. So the more people that move in, whether they be citizens or not, equates to maybe more members of the House of Representatives. So it has a number of fronts to it, but it appeals to the far left part of the base. And so it's about the politics abandoning any kind of normal sensibility for the American people.

So for those of you keeping track of the theology at home, we offer you now a brief tour of walls the Democratic Party has deemed perfectly moral. Walls that have received an indulgence. We begin with border barriers in Tunisia and Jordan. Democrats voted to pay for those walls, so obviously, they're okay. Israel has walls, too, everywhere basically protecting its borders with Egypt and Gaza and the West Bank and Democrats won't criticize those walls. Meanwhile, Pakistan has a massive fence, a wall really on its border with Afghanistan. It's designed to combat smuggling, terrorism and illegal immigration, and yet, Pakistan still gets plenty of American aid, so that wall is fine, too. Even peaceful Denmark has a wall it turns out. It's 43 miles long. It's on the German border. It's meant to keep pigs out, so it passes the morality test. Here in the U.S., it turns out we have plenty of moral walls, too. Just this Sunday, Kamala Harris announced her campaign for President for security. Huge swathes of the streets of Oakland, California were blocked, walled off, you might say with her own security at stake. Senator Harris had no problem with this. They were moral walls and there are many more moral walls. Benny Johnson of \"The Daily Caller\" has set out across America to find more of them. And as you might have guessed, a huge number of the most moral walls we have protect the homes of Democratic donors. Here's a selection of them."

He had no ties to an extremist group and he had no clear motive except for a vague desire for infamy. Vegas police, meanwhile, wrapped up their investigation a long time ago, and at this point, it looks like we may never know why Paddock did what he did. But the FBI has given up and you can't really blame them. They had much more important things to do like raiding the homes of unarmed perjury defendants in the Mueller probe.

So John, look, my bottom line hope is that you could live in a country where you could have a conversation about assimilation in English, and whether or not they're important. The response to Tom Brokaw makes it absolutely impossible for any decent person to have any opinion on this at all, and it makes it impossible to solve our problems if we can't have a conversation about it."

      "speaker": "JOHN DANIEL DAVIDSON, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Well, exactly. It's like you say, it used to be an unremarkable thing to talk about the melting pot as an American ideal. The idea that from many, we are one and we come together from all different countries, all different backgrounds and we become Americans. And of course, language is one of the things that binds us together as a as Americans. But there are other things that bind us together as Americans, too. And that's not to say that because we have a melting pot that you have to abandon all aspects of your own culture. Those cultural aspects feed into the American life and the American culture that we have and make it richer and make it better and that shouldn't be controversial, and it shouldn't be scandalous to suggest that learning English is part of assimilating and it's part of what immigrants should strive for. There's nothing controversial about that and there should have been nothing controversial about what Tom Brokaw said."

      "utterance": "Of course not and you'd think Brokaw out who is a Liberal by the way would be given the benefit of the doubt, but he was ceremonially slayed instead. But I wonder if the people pushing this - and by the way, nobody is pushing for anyone to give up their own culture or their identity. That's insane. Only to participate in a common identity, which is not a racial category. It's a culture that binds us together as Americans from different backgrounds and races and religions. But what do we have in common is the question. Why is there such an organized caucus against having anything in common? What is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVIDSON",
      "utterance": "Well, for the left, the whole idea of assimilation cuts against the idea of identity politics. Identity politics necessitates that everybody's kind of stay in their lane and keep their racial or ethnic identity as the number one most important thing about them. And to the extent that you view assimilation as a positive thing, as a good thing, as something that helps immigrant communities get ahead economically or achieve more in terms of education. It's to be viewed as a negative thing. They want to hold on to discrete identities and not assimilate and this is the opposite for example of what we see in Europe, where you have massive numbers of unassimilated immigrant communities, especially Muslim communities that have fared very poorly in European countries partly because they don't adopt the cultural norms, they don't adopt languages. They don't achieve highly in education and in business in Europe, and they stay in these sort of segregated enclaves. That is the opposite of what we want for this country, but that seems to be what the left would like in terms of what their identity politics dictates for us."

It was great to see you. I'm sorry to cut you short. Thank you. Barstool Sports' Dave Portnoy, one of the heroes to the show was just kicked out of the Super Bowl Media Day. Expelled. Threatened. There he is right there. He'll join us after the break to tell us why?"

      "utterance": "Well, the past couple of weeks have been pretty awful for American journalists. Hundreds of reporters and editors at places like \"Huffington Post\" and BuzzFeed lost their jobs, victims of systemic changes to their industry. No matter what you think those sites, it's sad. Anyone who has lost his job knows, it's very tough. Now those journalists suddenly have a lot in common with millions of other Americans -- factory workers, loggers, retail clerks, coal miners -- all of them and many more have seen their way of life disappear, thanks to technology or outsourcing or private equity. This kind of thing has been going on a long time. Now in previous cycles, what we used to call creative destruction, journalists had ready advice for newly unemployed blue collar workers. Just learn to code. Coding is the future. Stop whining and embrace it. Here's a selection of headlines you might remember on that subject. This one is from NPR, \"From Coal to Code: A new path for laid off miners in Kentucky.\" From \"Wired,\" the tech evangelist magazine. \"Can you teach a coal miner to code?\" From CBS News, \"Out of work coal miners find new work in computer industry.\" And this from Bloomberg, \"Appalachian miners are learning to code.\" And from the venerable \"New York Times\" \"The coders of Kentucky.\" See, it's that simple. Let's say you spent 30 years making a solid middle class living in a paper mill in northern New Hampshire. Then one day, the mill shuts down, sold for scrap to China. It happened a lot, but no problem. Just learn to code. Everyone in Brooklyn is doing it. Well, coding was never a real solution to any of this, obviously, but it had the effect of making journalists feel even more self-satisfied, and of course, that was the point, it's always the point actually. Fast forward to this month. Someone on Twitter came up with a pretty brilliant piece of advice for all those laid off journalists trying to figure out what to do with their lives. Learn to code. Perfect. Suddenly \"learn to code\" was everywhere on Twitter. But journalists didn't see the humor in this at all. A former \"New Yorker\" employed called Talia Lavin called the phrase quote, \"Far right hate. People who went to Wesleyan shouldn't have to learn to code so they can play into the censorship authorities at Twitter,\" who immediately concluded that asking someone to learn to code might be quote, \"targeted harassment.\" But only when it's directed at people who used to work at BuzzFeed. For the paper mill guy in New Hampshire, coding is still the future. Well, Barstool Sports, probably the best set in the internet, Dave Portnoy runs it and he has become a scourge of the modern NFL. The NFL does not appreciate that. They have banned Barstool from all NFL events for years, and that includes the Super Bowls Media Day. So last night, Portnoy snuck into the Media Day event anyway, but he was spotted and kicked out and charged with criminal trespassing. Dave Portnoy, fresh from prison apparently joins us now to tell us what it was like. How did you wind up charged with criminal trespassing? I thought you were a legitimate website operator?"

      "utterance": "Yes, well, we are but when you challenge authority, you need to challenge Roger Goodell, it generally ends up with a lecture, sometimes behind bars, sometimes with police officers. In this case we had 10 guys that looked like they work for the FBI with little NFL lapel pins thinking they're the toughest guys in the universe trying to rough me up."

I'm one of the few people that challenges Roger Goodell's power which is absolute and if you disagree with Roger Goodell, it's like the old Gestapo, you end up in the bottom of a well somewhere. That's how he operate, but we continue to challenge him and he continues to try to shut us down."

      "utterance": "So you're disobedient. That's your crime? Okay. That was my first question. Second question is, how dumb is Roger Goodell? So if you're going to arrest somebody, hassle somebody, you probably shouldn't make that person the head of Barstool Sports. It actually isn't smart PR is it?"

      "speaker": "PORTNY",
      "utterance": "He's one of the dumbest humans that has ever left. He's a rock. He has no brain. It's like an old Atari game just bouncing back and forth. There is no win for when you hassle us. There is no win. If you put cuffs on us so we go to jail, it's a national media story. They knew that. Once they escorted us out, they were like, \"Now what are we going to do with this guy?\" He probably wants to go to jail, because he will be on every newspaper in the cover. And the police officers who were down there and the SWAT teams, when they hear why I am being detained, they can't believe it and they're talking to the NFL like, \"You are really wasting our time with this guy,\" and the NFL and all of these suits are saying, \"We've got to prosecute him. We've got to prosecute him.\" So Roger Goodell - if he just said, \"Hey, here's your credentials.\" It's a non-story. But he's so stupid. He's just the stupidest leader that we've ever encountered. It's really embarrassing."

His father, and he was in the NFL system forever, so he got this cushy job that probably 50% of Americans can do. He has the least skills for the highest paying job of any human whoever lived, but the owners don't want to screw up the money train. The money is coming in despite this guy because we love football, but all he does is cause controversy. An ant could do his job. Literally."
