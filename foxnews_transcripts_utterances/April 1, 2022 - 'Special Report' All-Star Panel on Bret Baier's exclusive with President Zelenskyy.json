This is Ben Domenech aforementioned. And, you know, it's been a while since we have been in the studio. So, we are getting the kinks out. Ben, let me talk to you about this interview and what you took away from it. BEN DOMENECH, \"THE BEN DOMENECH PODCAST\": Well, there were a couple of things. One, it really stood out to me the question that you asked pointedly about the China relationship here and Zelenskyy lacking really an answer other than to say that the United States needed to be part of that conversation, enabling that conversation to happen. They are the elephant in the room. We saw Lavrov go and meet with his counterpart in China this week, along with his counterpart in India. The truth is that Russia, it would not be doing what they were doing without that backing and the permission coming from their biggest backers in China. Zelenskyy didn't really have an answer for that. He also though was pressing the case as he has been doing repeatedly for heavier weaponry. They want to add steel to the pines of the porcupine here. They know that is something that they need in order to have any real prospect of negotiated peace.",
