Perkins says of the incident -- quote -- \"This underscores how political correctness has scaled the walls of our nation's military and left unrestrained threatens our national security.\" Witchy Woman And finally, Delaware Republican Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell's campaign has apologized to Wilmington radio station WDEL after threatening to crush it with a lawsuit."
