Because what you saw under President Obama was a really obvious cooling off of what's described as the special relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. -- the relationship the queen and the president talked about. I was very conscious that working for David Cameron in 10 Downing Street, he was very aware of that. He realized that President Obama prioritized the relationship with the E.U. even with Germany. But what President Trump is making clear in his attitude even in the way he dismissed Sadiq Khan's criticism and hit back.

He is a stone-cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.\" There was a random smattering of protests around Buckingham Palace today, but a large protest is scheduled tomorrow to march from Trafalgar Square to number 10 Downing Street, where President Trump will meet for the last time with British Prime Minister Theresa May. She is going to step down as prime minister on Friday. Among the things that the president will be speaking to May about will be his idea of how the U.K. should go about Brexit. He is promoting the idea of what's called a no-deal Brexit, which means that the United Kingdom would not have a deal with the European Union to get out sometime before the end of October. President Trump, saying cut a free trade deal with the United States because we will more than make up for whatever trade gap is left from you're not having to deal with the E.U. Trade will feature high on the agenda as will national security, in particular, Martha, President Trump is going to stress to Theresa May the importance tomorrow of not using Huawei products made in China as part of the U.K.'s new 5G system. Because if -- the president believes and a lot of national security officials in the United States believe that if Huawei from China, gets into the core and maybe even the peripherals of a 5G system, everything that flows through that system will eventually be able to flow right to China, basically giving them the keys to the kingdom when it comes to any intelligence that comes out of the U.K. Martha?"

Great to see you tonight reporting from London this evening. And, you know, there's been a lot of sort of chittering around all the outsides of the social side of this. And Meghan Markle, and what the president said, and all of that insults as John Roberts' just reported between the president and the mayor of London. But this is a very big moment as we have -- you know, set up for you here in terms of what's going to happen next with the United Kingdom. The economy not doing great there, the people very divided. The future is very uncertain in the United Kingdom right now. So, let's bring in Steve Hilton, host of \"THE NEXT REVOLUTION\", and our resident British expert. Geraldo Rivera, Fox News correspondent-at-large, and Robert Wolf, former economic advisor to President Obama and a Fox News contributor. Gentlemen, thank you so much to have all of you here. Steve, just off the top, you know, your thoughts on today as you watched all this. I think the most significant thing that there is actually not so much the reception that President Trump is getting from the Brits, it's his attitude towards the Brits. Because what you saw under President Obama was a really obvious cooling off of what's described as the special relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. -- the relationship the queen and the president talked about. I was very conscious that working for David Cameron in 10 Downing Street, he was very aware of that. He realized that President Obama prioritized the relationship with the E.U. even with Germany. But what President Trump is making clear in his attitude even in the way he dismissed Sadiq Khan's criticism and hit back. But even then, in the second tweet, he said, \"I love the U.K. and I want to make this relationship work.\" What he's really doing, I think is making the special relationship special again. And I think that's great for both countries."

And I'm not sure he knew it was long ago and far away, saying that she would leave the United States and move to Canada if he was elected in 2016. He reacted that, that he didn't know she was nasty. I mean, my goodness, here is the most popular -- one of the most popular people on earth. Obviously, if he knew that she was the Duchess of Sussex, and -- you know, the mother of the new prince, I think he would have responded a little differently. I like that he, he doesn't let any insults go unresponded to, but sometimes you got to be very careful. Sadiq Khan had it coming, you know, he's a very -- he is nasty or, at least, he's been very nasty to President Trump. In so far, as Brexit in the U.K., it's a very, very sensitive line that he has to walk. You know, he doesn't want to interfere until the Brits what to do. You know, a hard exit. I mean, Steve knows let -- a lot better than I do. But what do you do about Ireland and all those other questions? You know, it's a morass for him to get in. I love that he stayed on script for the pomp and circumstance the relationship with Prince Charles seems pretty good even though Prince Charles is this big climate change guy and the president obviously is not. So, I'm heartened. I think the business aspect tomorrow will be more telling than today's pageantry. But I'm glad that today's pageantry went off without a hitch."

So, it wasn't surprising that we wanted to do large block trades away from bilateral trades And it would -- and the truth is those would have been the smartest things to do for both us and the E.U. as well as us, and Asian on China, because we would have been trading with 85 percent of the world with -- I would call, fair labor agreements and fair environmental agreements. With respect to -- I think what President Trump is said kind of putting out there the idea of a non-Brexit exit, I think that would be brutal for the U.K. business. You're already seeing that they moved to number two, and financial services they were number one for many years that's 12 percent of their business. New York took it over.

And not have to be ruled by regulations and deals done by unelected unaccountable bureaucrats in the E.U. And remember that the trade situation is just as it is here. There's a deficit between the U.K. and the E.U. And so, the idea that by doing the no-deal Brexit, Britain is somehow going to lose out is just not serious. No-deal Brexit, the hard Brexit, whatever you want to call it, that was actually the only realistic version of Brexit on offer, because it really get -- gave Britain the independence and the national sovereignty which is what people wanted to see."

I keep waiting for him to -- you know, tweet something about like, \"Oh, well, the queen told me this about Brexit, or about her feelings about Huawei or anything.

He said -- so he was asked what would happen if in the process of an abortion, they failed to kill the infant before they were fully born, and he said well, we'll make that infant comfortable and then the doctor and the mother will make a decision. Well, that sure sounds like infanticide in ordinary Americans. So it's amazing the Democrats have made this such a requirement. There are -- last year, the Democrats for life endorse two members of the Senate Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia and four, count them, four Democrat candidates for the House, two incumbents Collin Peterson of Minnesota, Dan Lipinski of Illinois, and two challengers.

He was at the Human Rights Campaign dinner lauding LBGQT rights. And suddenly he said he's not where he's supposed to be. I mean, Bernie was taking a shot at the -- at the marriage equality and gay rights flank of the Democratic Party. It would -- it would have been better if Biden hadn't been someplace that people could identify. Second of all, Bernie, we can't go back. Well, what is Bernie? Bernie is the epitome of let's return to the great ideals of socialism. The guy who honeymooned in the Soviet Union is telling us that we can only go forward. Are we going forward towards a five-year plan? Are we going forward to that great utopia of socialism, the Soviet Union? I mean, this guy is a lefty who hey is ignoring the lessons of history and wants to take us back to what socialism did and so what socialism failed at. So it's an interesting lecture but it's a sign of what's coming. I was at a conference, the Milken Conference in Los Angeles a couple of weeks ago. I took it as a warning sign. Neera Tanden, head of the Center for American Progress, sort of an establishment Democrat, big Hillary Clinton person, Jim Messina co-chairman of the Hillary super PAC and I were on a panel. And they both said, well, if somebody goes after Biden, if any Democrat goes after another Democrat, there's going to be a price to be paid. And the message was clear, the establishment is not going to tolerate attacks on Joe Biden, but they're coming and he's going to -- it's going to be a test for him particularly between now and June as to how he handles."

The Hartford occurrence says the bags and some items inside were stained with Jennifer Dulos' blood. The same surveillance video shows the estranged husband girlfriend Michelle Troconis leaning out and pass near the window of the Ford and either placing something on the ground or picking something up. Even more damning when Dulos went missing police search her New Canaan home and found a large quantity of physical evidence including multiple human blood stains on the garage floor and the blood splatter on the walls. There was also evidence that someone tried to clean it up. Quoting, \"based upon the crime scene processing, investigators came to the consensus that a serious physical assault had occurred at the scene and Jennifer Dulos was the suspected victim.\" Traconis and Dulos both appeared in court though neither entered a plea. The two apparently became romantically involved about a year before Jennifer Dulos filed for divorce where documents say the couple has been involved in a bitter custody battle over their five children ages 8 to 13. And that Jennifer Dulos said she was, quote, \"terrified for her family's safety\" especially since discovering the gun, \"since my husband has a history of controlling volatile and delusional behavior.\" Fotis Dulos is pushing back saying his wife has mental health issues.

And his job was essentially to provide cover for the army soldiers that were going ashore and trying to climb the bluff edge at Omaha Beach. There is a passage in there where he says as he's doing this, he had this very kind of real understanding that for the first time he was thankful he was in the navy and not in the army because he was seeing these soldiers being gunned down by the Germans on the bluffs above. It's just some of the very striking images that he wrote about."

      "utterance": "So, this is actually the closing of the journal that a 16-page journal. He wrote so many love letters to my grandmother day after day. And it was clear he was very nervous about his first-born child and her safety even though he didn't know for certain that he was ever going to make it back to meet them. So, he closed the journal like this. \"As I leave this time, I now have my son waiting with his mother. Waiting for me so that I may come home to help bring him in a world of what we all hope shall be peace amongst all men. Fighting so that he and his loved ones shall never have to bear the scars of war. Yes, I have a great deal to live for. And somehow, I have a feeling that I shall come back to the both of them. But if it's God's wish that I do not I shall leave with a prayer that my son shall live a better life, and a safer life in his world than the life lived in the world of his father.\""

      "utterance": "Well, I mean, we were so fortunate that late in his late he had a realization that he wanted to go back to Normandy one more time. He had been once. He was approaching 80. And we all, my mother, my uncle and my dad went back and we went on June 6, the morning of June 6, 2003. And stood on the beach with him. And he remembered so much about that morning. And told us so many stories we never had heard before. It was a very powerful trip. And we, now after I've written the story that ran in the Washington Post magazine, I've heard from so many people who are related to the veterans, people who were either in the D-Day attack or in World War II in another capacity. And never heard the stories that their relatives had endured for good reason. I think I feel lucky and my family feels lucky that my grandfather late in his life felt like he wanted to talk about it. And he made it very clear that he wanted to go back to Normandy because he owed it to the guys who didn't make it back."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. As our D-Day coverage continues we will take you with us to France for a very special event celebrating World War II veterans. An amazing scene as those veterans met the actors from the show \"Band of Brothers\" which did an extraordinary job of recreating some of these moments. That's next."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, HBO's hit show \"Band of Brothers\" is really a must-watch classic for anyone interested in this period. It's very accurate. It's an inspiring depiction of D-Day and the events during World War II that followed. But it also had an unexpected impact on the actual World War II veterans reminding them of moments from their past and bringing them closer to their fellow soldiers and friends and their family. So, we interviewed the \"Band of Brothers\" actors who were so moved by their own roles in the series that they came to Normandy to mark the 75th anniversary of D-day. For veterans and their family members it was an emotional reunion to be back at Utah Beach reliving memories from their past. Watch this."

They drop into darkness and they are scattered all over Normandy and the confusion and the things that they went to. Their stories are, tend to be a little more horrific and a little bit more heroic."

      "utterance": "The actors though, to a man tell you that this was a bigger responsibility than just having an acting role. It was playing somebody who is really a hero. And they really dove into their roles and they got to know the men still alive or if the guys had passed away, they would research the man who passed away. So, this was a real big burden for them. This is something that they had to get right because the men would be watching and a lot of them are still alive so they had to nail it."

Well, it was something for my country."
