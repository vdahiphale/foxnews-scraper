I look, and her embassy is funding George Soros' groups in Ukraine. George Soros is sort of an ideologue. You go through all these things, there is a big body of record that shows she is not allying with the president. The president didn't need any reason at all to fire her. It's a contrived argument.",

That is the focus of tonight's Angle. Last week we saw Democrats finally vote on that sham investigation they had been pursuing in secret for weeks. Now this impeachment inquiry - thinks about it, it would knock the wind out of any other President, but not Trump. In fact the dramatic effect of their cheesy impeachment prequel was blunted days before the vote when Trump announced a successful and daring Special Force's mission to take out the ISIS leader Al-Baghdadi. Then it was six days later, the week ended with blockbuster economic numbers."

The latest \"New York Times\" Sienna Poll showing that the top two rising Democrat candidate Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are losing to Trump in most swing states. Who could have guessed that Middle America wouldn't be thrilled to pieces with a socialist from Vermont or full Native American who pretend she is not a socialist?

This is New York magazines big liberal magazine's latest anxiety filled headline. Check it out. And then there was this attempt at a wake-up call from an old liberal, Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. He wrote if the goal was to damage President Trump by formalizing the impeachment inquiry, its mission accomplished, unaccomplished for House Democrats. If anything the vote solidifies Trump's hold on power. Come next year Trump will have an impeachment victory and quite possibly a solid economy. The Democrats will have what? Back in January folks kind of thought it was odd when I said in another angle that I took Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez seriously. It wasn't that I agreed with her views, but that I saw her quickly becoming the fought leader of the party. The Democrats have gone in the direction I predicted and it is slowly but surely backfiring on them. The never-Trumpers, Liberals, they're forever accusing us Republicans of selling are sold to Trump. How many times we read that tired old line? That is blatantly false. Trump and the GOP on a variety of issues have compromised. Issue is like a number of troops that should be deployed overseas. Trade deals that at one point he wanted to do pull completely out of like NAFTA. The woman who sold her soul is the woman with the gavel. She cannot go to her voters next November and brag about all of her accomplishments because she will have none. Impeachment isn't going to do anything to make America's lives better and she knows that. Passing the USMCA, infrastructure, prescription drugs, that would have but she refuses to do it. This frantic rush to satisfy the people on the left, to impeach Trump has only empowered the crazy and it swamped any other agenda they could have had or platform. Wait a second, Bernie didn't interrupt the cheers. I thought they were all against that chant. Of course that feigned outrage on their part when Trump folks chanted that about Hillary.

I don't think the President really has very much to worry about. They're focusing on obstruction of Congress and there is no such thing. It's not a crime. Obstruction of justice might be crime, at certain circumstances but obstruction of Congress that's called checks and balances. That's called separation of powers. When Congress tells you, you have to do something and you think that the Executive Authority tells you can't do it, you go to court. If the court decides you have to do it, then obviously if you fail to comply with the order of the highest court after all review is done, then you are obstructing but to refuse to comply with a congressional subpoena when there is a plausible claim of executive privilege is simply an exercise in checks and balances and good for the constitution."

They're trotting out a lot of kind of more liberal, legal scholars like Michael Gerhardt at UNC who says tonight, there is no provision on the constitution that protects anyone, including the President or anyone in the Executive Branch from disclosing criminal activities or abuses of power.

Third, the President's advisors and his conduct of foreign affairs and the internal communication and advice from his advisors are particularly in the White House Counsel's Office. Those are things that clearly protected by Executive Privilege and the notion that Congress can demand people to release or reveal the President's foreign policy, internal deliberation that is just insane. It's a direct threat on the independence of the Executive from Congress and it's an attempt ultimately to change our system of government from one where the President was elected by the people to one where he is merely accountable and chosen by the House of Representatives.

For example he signed on the form that he was a firsthand witness of this and yet in the complaint he acknowledges that he had no firsthand knowledge of the conversation. There's other things that we need to go to the bottom of what this guy. Who illegally leaked the information to him? He falsely complained in his complaint that he gathered this information in pursuit of his job duties.

I think that becomes clearer and clearer every single day and people understand that Democrats are so desperate because what are they going to run on? Look at what this President has done Laura 6.7 million new jobs created under Donald Trump. You saw that the October jobs report just came out, 223,000 new jobs added. You just saw tonight, I mean look at his rally. How can you compete against that? They can't do it so they're trying to throw impeachment at him, but at the Trump Campaign we are welcoming that because internally we have seen the numbers for President Trump go up. Thanks to Nancy Pelosi calling for impeachment. Three-point since she called for this impeachment nonsense. Voters aren't buying it. They're feeling every single day the results of Donald Trump in office and so we're just capitalizing on that. You know we have the ability to have the President out there around the country like you saw tonight talking about the great things he's done.

These are all the economic models that show a track record, a really good one of predicting who wins the White House. The forecast from Yale, Ray Fehr, Oxford Economics, Moody's Analytics are based on Trump being boosted at the ballot box by steady economic growth historically tight labor market and limited inflation.

They are scared to wear a hat or a shirt supporting him out there. They're also scared to talk to pollsters and they're not being honest with them. To us those numbers don't mean a whole lot.

Your response, Rich?"

And the Democrats, FDR, JFK, they all had nationalist tendencies, but the Democrats turn their backs on nationalists and went in the more cosmopolitan direction. And the Republican Party, too, lost touch with nationalism. So that's why this force was there for Donald Trump to pick up. And it's a natural force. It's a powerful force. It's a very old force. Efforts to eradicate it throughout history have always failed. And that last clip you showed right before I came on about, oh, he's white and he's a nationalist. So was Alexander Hamilton, so was Abraham Lincoln, so was Teddy Roosevelt. And it's really disgusting, Laura, to have encountered this in the earlier reaction to my book that there are a lot of people on the left, as you know, if they're not accusing someone else of bigotry, they'd be rendered practically mute."

You are a very openminded editor because you put all sort of points of view on the conservative spectrum, which is fine, even though some of it is a very small spectrum. Nevertheless, you put that out there. So they, along with people on the left, try to blanket, make a blanket statements, oh, this is giving aid and comfort to the worst of the worst, the racists, the nativists, the people who don't like immigrants. Your reaction to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that's completely wrong. Nationalism is the doctrine that a distinct people united by culture and history should govern a distinct territory. That's it. In more practical terms, as you're alluding to, you put your own people's interest first and you put your nation's interests first. And true nationalism, it's a loyalty above tribe and ethnicity and any sort of subnational divisions. And you look throughout our history, it's the nationalists who are pushing for greater civil rights, whether it was Lincoln or nationalists in the 20th century. So this is a smear and a misunderstanding, and one reason I wrote the book, I want Trump supporters to understand why all the arguments are wrong, and I want people who are skeptical or opposed to Trump also to read the book and realize they're wrong about this."

Angela Merkel a couple of weeks ago said that she was sad to report that multiculturalism is failing -- has failed in Germany. You're seeing big protests today in Greece over the influx of more refugees into Greece. Sweden is in turmoil, political turmoil because of refugees.

We need the whistleblower's name, we need who they are, and they need to be cross- examined under oath about any biases they may have. Number two, we need to look at whether or not Hunter Biden corruptly engaged in lobbying. Did Joe Biden asked the prosecutor to be fired because he was investigating his son?

Every Republican senator that signed on my resolution saying the process wasn't fair, we should continue to prosecute the people prosecuting the president.

He starts working his dad's contacts at the State Department, Tony Blinken, one of the closest advisors to Joe Biden in their entire lifetime. He has a few meetings with him in 2015, something big happens in Ukraine, 2016. The Ukraine prosecutors raid Hunter Biden's boss's home. February, 2016, a few weeks later, Hunter Biden's lobbyists are at the State Department saying you need to stop these corruption allegations, Hunter Biden is on the board. We need your help. A couple of days after that, Hunter Biden's business partner meets with John Kerry, and then not too long after that, Joe Biden fires the Ukraine prosecutor that he knows was investigating his son's company. That's it in a nutshell."

Legal teams for Burisma, their own document indicating that everything that Democrats are telling you, and by Democrats I mean the media, too, about this case is not true. Think about it, one of the myths he debunked last week in one of his stories which I read -- John, well done -- was that the Burisma case was closed down. So don't worry, Joe Biden couldn't have been influencing the case because the case wasn't open. That's just not true. That's not backed up by actual facts, Laura. And the media which previously was interested in this case, \"Politico\" and even \"The Washington Post\" at one point before Biden became a candidate, now mysteriously that Biden is a threat to Trump, or they perceive him to be a threat to Trump, has backed off their coverage."

March of this year, I'm sitting, I pick up a phone call. It's a career diplomat, someone who has been a career diplomat their entire life. He said you won't believe what the Ukraine ambassador just did. There is an election in Ukraine in three week and she just gave a speech calling for the removal of an official in Ukraine. That's against the foreign affairs manual. So I start digging into Marie Yovanovitch. Who is this person? It is kind of interesting she did this. I find out in 2018, Pete Sessions, the chairman of the House Committee writes a letter to Mike Pompeo, she's badmouthing Donald Trump. I look, and her embassy is funding George Soros' groups in Ukraine. George Soros is sort of an ideologue. You go through all these things, there is a big body of record that shows she is not allying with the president. The president didn't need any reason at all to fire her. It's a contrived argument."

And it's certainly worth entertaining. If Marie Yovanovitch and George Kent had anything to do with a list of people who should not be touched by the local Justice Department, then it's worth looking into.
