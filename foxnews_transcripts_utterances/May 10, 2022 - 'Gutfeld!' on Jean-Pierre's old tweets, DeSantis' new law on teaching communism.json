      "sentences": "So as you know, talking about a stolen election can get you into trouble. It's the equivalent of shouting fire in a crowded theater. Except you can actually shout fire in a crowded theater. Especially if there's a fire and you started it. Even more if you're a Democrat and you're about to become White House press secretary, something tells me you'll get a pass on this. Karine Jean-Pierre. Sounds like the goalie for the Montreal Canadiens. Is that a real team? Well, anyway, she's been tapped to replace Jen Psaki. But did you know she once falsely claimed that the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election was actually stolen? I know. Since when do Democrats care about theft? But I get it, when someone gets a fancy job embarrassing tweet surface like a bloated corpse in the East River. I remember when this show started, someone started leaking these erotic videos I'd made back when I needed the money. True, I was the one leaking them. I just felt they needed a wider audience. But Jean-Pierre's tweet matters because that sort of thing would disqualify anyone who isn't a lefty. Back on April 2nd, 2020, she tweeted, reminder Brian Kemp stole the gubernatorial election from Georgians and Stacey Abrams. Of course, no Dem has called this an attack on democracy, a claim they're always making against Republicans. But they wouldn't know democracy if it bit them in their elitist butts. But she's merely echoing exactly what the Dems get away with saying already. Which tells you it's only a crime if a Republican does it. You know, like marrying your brother. Who hasn't? You've married a lot. Well, maybe only once. Never mind. You haven't heard much of it, but Stacey Abrams filed a federal lawsuit over Georgia's management of elections, and the trial actually began last month. You could say the lawsuit is an attempt to undermine the integrity of Georgia elections. But like a plane full of passengers during the safety demonstration, no one's listening. They're too busy trying to find gas and baby formula, which causes gas. Anyway because she's a Dem that stuff doesn't matter, mainly because the press is on her side. They go together like peanut butter and jelly, pizza and beer, nipple clamps and Cheez-Whiz, and they want elections as secure as the border. Think about that. Now, as you know, Psaki's leaving her job to go to work at MSNBC so she can now lie while sitting down. Now, if you don't know the network, it's the news station that makes the Weekly World News look like Face the Nation. But I guess someone has to do the work they pay Rachel Maddow for.",

So as part of her new job, she'll be dealing with all of these racist Fox News reporters, especially our own dumb S.O.B., Peter Doocy. Oh, he's so racist. It's funny that Psaki is scheduled to leave her job Friday where she will end up right where her replacement was when she said we were all racist. I call it the circle of strife. Like Shemp and Curly, they just switched roles. Stooges Reference, Kat. But I guess that's what Democrats mean by both sides. So, will the new face of the administration face questions about her hatred for Fox News? Maybe. But only from people at Fox News. Assaults on the press are another one of those things that can only come from Republicans. But I should point out, we're not racists. We're just kicking all of their asses and they're out of ideas. So that's why they call us racist. And as long as you're on the right side, meaning the left side, you can say anything you want. But unlike the left, we won't try to stop you.

      "utterance": "So as you know, talking about a stolen election can get you into trouble. It's the equivalent of shouting fire in a crowded theater. Except you can actually shout fire in a crowded theater. Especially if there's a fire and you started it. Even more if you're a Democrat and you're about to become White House press secretary, something tells me you'll get a pass on this. Karine Jean-Pierre. Sounds like the goalie for the Montreal Canadiens. Is that a real team? Well, anyway, she's been tapped to replace Jen Psaki. But did you know she once falsely claimed that the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election was actually stolen? I know. Since when do Democrats care about theft? But I get it, when someone gets a fancy job embarrassing tweet surface like a bloated corpse in the East River. I remember when this show started, someone started leaking these erotic videos I'd made back when I needed the money. True, I was the one leaking them. I just felt they needed a wider audience. But Jean-Pierre's tweet matters because that sort of thing would disqualify anyone who isn't a lefty. Back on April 2nd, 2020, she tweeted, reminder Brian Kemp stole the gubernatorial election from Georgians and Stacey Abrams. Of course, no Dem has called this an attack on democracy, a claim they're always making against Republicans. But they wouldn't know democracy if it bit them in their elitist butts. But she's merely echoing exactly what the Dems get away with saying already. Which tells you it's only a crime if a Republican does it. You know, like marrying your brother. Who hasn't? You've married a lot. Well, maybe only once. Never mind. You haven't heard much of it, but Stacey Abrams filed a federal lawsuit over Georgia's management of elections, and the trial actually began last month. You could say the lawsuit is an attempt to undermine the integrity of Georgia elections. But like a plane full of passengers during the safety demonstration, no one's listening. They're too busy trying to find gas and baby formula, which causes gas. Anyway because she's a Dem that stuff doesn't matter, mainly because the press is on her side. They go together like peanut butter and jelly, pizza and beer, nipple clamps and Cheez-Whiz, and they want elections as secure as the border. Think about that. Now, as you know, Psaki's leaving her job to go to work at MSNBC so she can now lie while sitting down. Now, if you don't know the network, it's the news station that makes the Weekly World News look like Face the Nation. But I guess someone has to do the work they pay Rachel Maddow for."

I think the difference is as they have been, they are all in on being state T.V. for Donald Trump and so they will continue to give them misinformation. The danger is so, yes, you have Asian-Americans right now whose lives are seriously in danger."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Ah. Well, at least you didn't parody Mary Poppins. But I remember those days, you know, when the left actually did care about Asian-Americans, not so much anymore. Now that Asian hate crimes erupted and the culprits aren't in MAGA hats. Why bother reporting them at all? So as part of her new job, she'll be dealing with all of these racist Fox News reporters, especially our own dumb S.O.B., Peter Doocy. Oh, he's so racist. It's funny that Psaki is scheduled to leave her job Friday where she will end up right where her replacement was when she said we were all racist. I call it the circle of strife. Like Shemp and Curly, they just switched roles. Stooges Reference, Kat. But I guess that's what Democrats mean by both sides. So, will the new face of the administration face questions about her hatred for Fox News? Maybe. But only from people at Fox News. Assaults on the press are another one of those things that can only come from Republicans. But I should point out, we're not racists. We're just kicking all of their asses and they're out of ideas. So that's why they call us racist. And as long as you're on the right side, meaning the left side, you can say anything you want. But unlike the left, we won't try to stop you. It's the best way to make you look stupid."

But I think the whole thing is so -- like so exposes the fraud of what they do because people have tuned it out now. They don't care that it's racist. You're -- now you're saying people are sick of me and you feuding about fashion that people are sick of being told things are racist that clearly aren't racist.

Students will learn about Lenin, Stalin, Castro, Mao Zedong, Jane Fonda. Once again, Bernie Sanders is left out. Students will also learn how people under those regimes endured, \"suppression of speech poverty, starvation, migration, and systemic lethal violence.\" Sounds like Portland, Oregon. Of course. DeSantis has already gone after Disney in recent weeks positioning himself as a leader in the culture war. He really made Pluto his bitch.
