And then you also have on the OpSec side, the Operational Security side, he is doing this on F.B.I. devices. It's hard to imagine somebody who was a 20-year veteran of the F.B.I. being that stupid. And I think that that's also -- is there a level of incompetence that can get you fired from the F.B.I.?",

It's clearly a political position that they have not necessarily agreed with. But part of being a great leader is being able to recognize the value of other people, but certainly of feminism. It is supposed to be about all women, and opening the doors to whomever we want to become and whatever we want to do for living.

They're not what they say they are, and this is a good example of that. So of course, they'll highlight people that they agree with. They will not highlight women like Margaret Thatcher or Melania Trump, who the entire feminist movement has worked very hard to ignore. They are the \"Mean Girls\" celebrating themselves. So it doesn't take much guts to be there and to experience and enjoy your progressive privilege, to have that protection, that largess, and to look at -- to put your nose up and sniff it everyone else.

The average home price in Montgomery County is more than $400,000.00. Building new cheap homes in liberal areas is almost impossible. So instead, the county is trying to cope by allowing residents to open new apartments in their basements or backyards. More than 1,500 residents of Montgomery County signed a petition denouncing the plan. They said it would quote, \"Alter the appearance, density and value of our neighborhoods.\" Oh, they complain it would make their community feel like slums or fill them with unfamiliar strangers. In other words, if we give them a taste of what has been happening to the entire rest of the country with their approval, \"Not in our neighborhood,\" they said though.

You saw it, so the headline was fine. It describe what happened. But online, the left went crazy -- even crazier than usual. Cory Booker, apparently still running for President accused The \"New York Times\" of somehow putting lives at risk. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- the pampered moron that she is -- said the paper was enabling white supremacy through cowardice. So of course, the paper caved. Later versions of the article were headlined, \"Assailing hate, but not guns.\" Mark Penn is a former adviser of Bill and Hillary Clinton. He joins us tonight. Mark, I'm worried because I think every country, this one particularly, deserves, you know two sides that are both sane and capable of rational conversation.

In almost every single case, they accuse you of exactly what they're doing, and this week was no different. In the wake of two horrifying mass shootings, they've been telling us the President is a hater. \"He is using race to divide us,\" they scream. \"It's wrong.\" Well, they are right about the second part, it's definitely wrong. They are using race to divide us. That's a core tenant of the left. Identity politics is the process of dividing people on the basis of immutable characteristics, factors they can't control. And that's what the Democratic Party is at this point. It's an identity politics party. They promise some Americans reparations, they denounce others for their skin color.

In the early 2000s, there was a book that was created by a bunch of Democratic strategists, the emerging Democratic majority and basically the argument was, look, in order for there to be a Democratic base, we have to organize, particularly women, people of color, gay folks, and tell them two things. One, you're persecuted, irrespective of whether or not you are; and second, that America is fundamentally bad, right? So if you convince enough people that those two things are true, then the individuals who are responsible for your persecution and for making America bad -- the white folks, the patriarchy men, usually straight folks -- they're the enemy and they're the bad. So the only way to rectify that is to bring all those folks down. Now we have seen folks like Castro now that the seeds of that vitriol, of that disgusting rhetoric, now rear its ugly head, but it's not of course just Mr. Castro. You were highlighting others in the intro. We can do more of them. I mean, New York's Democratic Governor, Andrew Cuomo said America has never been that great.

Now, of course, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has since come out, saying no, actually, he's probably a pretty good guy, in fact, he is. And then, of course, less than about six or eight months ago, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the illustrious socialist came out and said that if you are a Trump supporter, specifically a white poor rural person, she is tired of hearing about you. She is tired of hearing about your story. All right, what she wanted to hear about were black and brown folks in cities who embrace intersectionalism, whatever the hell that is. The point is the left which used to embrace the working class has now gone down this identity politics baloney that if you don't fit, not only are you out, but you're the enemy. Right? So let's take this to its logical conclusion, brother, you've highlighted it. Its violence. Right? I mean, that's the ultimate fear. But in the meantime, what are we going to get?

She didn't say, \"I want to be the first Finnish Professor at Harvard.\" And Beto O'Rourke didn't say my name is Fritz, \"I'm Fritz O'Rourke because I want to take advantage of all this white privilege.\" And people don't trail their names or put compound names. And what's the force around ancestry.com? Or 23AndMe? It is to find some background in this racially intermingled and assimilated society that we don't know exist, and maybe we can find something that's not white that we can translate into careerist advantage in the fashion of Elizabeth Warren or Beto O'Rourke or Rachel Dolezal. And so it's kind of a construct, and when you say white supremacy, it serves for very wealthy liberals. And I think wealthy -- and it's a class thing -- wealthy minorities that says, \"I'm authentic, even though I have privilege. That doesn't count because I'm saying that guy in Bakersfield or that poor white guy in Appalachia is a deplorable, or he's a clinger and he has privilege and therefore --\" And it also has career advantages, obviously, and we don't even talk about class anymore, Tucker. I mean, here we are, just think of it. We have Cory Booker, who is a child of two IBM executives. And we have Kamala Harris, who has all the intellectual privilege in the world, both her parents were PhDs. And we have Elizabeth Warren who faked an ID, an ethnic identity, who is a Harvard professor. And they're yelling about all these people who supposedly have the privilege that they have. And it's sort of -- it's become an identity policy for wealthy people in the media, politics, and academia that once you say that you're virtuous, and you're spotting races under every bed, and he has supremacy and you have privilege, you can say almost anything. And look what's happened to the presidential race. We have Cory Booker, who just last week threatened to beat up the President of the United States. We have Biden who said he wanted to beat up the President of the United States. We had Elizabeth Warren who has said all sorts of things and we had Kamala Harris say that she wanted to get out of an elevator without an alive Donald Trump in it. She wanted him dead. It's as angry as people got with Barack Obama's healthcare and all that rhetoric, typical white person get in your faces, punish your enemies, take a gun. I don't remember any mainstream Republican candidate, not one, not a Romney, not a McCain, not anybody, or Mitch McConnell saying, \"I'd like to beat up the President of the United States. And they do that because they're virtuous because they've established this identity politics, an insurance policy, if you will. And it's tragic, because, why these elites are doing this in the real ground level. People are intermarrying, they're intermingling, they're assimilating, and they're trying to make America what it is.

If you Google his name on page one, you'll find the Reverend has said repeatedly being gay is enough to send you to hell. Keep reading and you'll find that Reverend Fowler also believes homosexuality and child molestation are comparable sins. And yet, presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both staunch supporters of LGBTQ rights were front and center this week at Sunday's services. Last month, Bernie Sanders held a Town Hall at the church. A California political science professor who has written about LGBTQ rights and religion and politics says quote, \"No one is saying that you can't be an LGBTQ rights supporter and also visit houses of worship. But visiting a house of worship where the religious leaders are not supporters is a choice, and it sends a message that those views are not abhorrent.\" Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders haven't yet addressed the issue, but Kamala Harris campaign told the \"San Jose Mercury News\" that her quote, \"Support and advocacy for LGBTQ equality has been unwavering throughout her career. She will continue to visit houses of worship across the country to address congregants about the pressing issues we face as a nation.\" Equality California, an LGBTQ rights group says the candidates should have used the opportunity to educate the pastor on the importance of supporting the LGBTQ community.

The least we could do to remedy this is to make certain the people responsible for the fiasco pay some price for what they did. F.B.I. agent Peter Strzok was fired after he was caught sending politically biased text to his girlfriend, Lisa Page. Now Stzrok is suing the F.B.I. saying he should not have been fired in the first place. Buck Sexton is a former C.I.A. analyst and hosts \"The Buck Sexton Show,\" which is excellent, and he joins us tonight. So Buck, on what grounds is he suing? BUCK SEXTON, HOST, \"THE BUCK SEXTON SHOW\": Well, I think you have to ask the question, what does it take to get fired from the F.B.I.? Because yes, the grounds he is suing on is that his First Amendment rights are being violated here. That he was essentially just another guy in government expressing an opinion and also his due process rights, he says have been violated as well. Here is the reality. He wasn't just a guy saying, \"I don't like the President,\" and doing normal F.B.I. stuff, you know, looking at cases of kidnapping and terrorism. He was investigating the President of the United States and the whole Russia collusion hoax, as we now know, and saying this stuff on official devices. So you really have a double whammy here. You have two things. On the one hand, it is how could this guy have ever thought it would be appropriate when he's involved in the most politically sensitive investigation, probably of my lifetime, I can't think of anything that would be equivalent to be waxing philosophical about how anything would be better than this guy that he is investigating, becoming President of the United States. And then you also have on the OpSec side, the Operational Security side, he is doing this on F.B.I. devices. It's hard to imagine somebody who was a 20-year veteran of the F.B.I. being that stupid.

We should ask General Flynn if Agent Strzok deserves to be treated like he is somebody that didn't do anything that's really that bad here. Also, by the way, just the perception of the F.B.I. matters. And you know, if the F.B.I. and the Intelligence Community were a stock, it would have been dropping since Trump came into office because of stuff like this.

You know, if they had any guts, which they don't, they would write a book about the greatness of Margaret Thatcher. That is undeniable. It's clearly a political position that they have not necessarily agreed with. But part of being a great leader is being able to recognize the value of other people, but certainly of feminism. It is supposed to be about all women, and opening the doors to whomever we want to become and whatever we want to do for living. But of course, there -- as you've said, throughout the show, you know, you're talking about a lot of people who are frauds, right? They're not what they say they are, and this is a good example of that. So of course, they'll highlight people that they agree with. They will not highlight women like Margaret Thatcher or Melania Trump, who the entire feminist movement has worked very hard to ignore. They are the \"Mean Girls\" celebrating themselves. So it doesn't take much guts to be there and to experience and enjoy your progressive privilege, to have that protection, that largess, and to look at -- to put your nose up and sniff it everyone else. But it's also a message, Tucker, about who really counts, that you will only count if they, you know, touch you and decide that you're a person who is worthy of their attention. They are passe. They are of course, an example, of what is not feminism and what women should not become. And that is why Hillary Clinton did not win, and we will have a woman President and that woman will be conservative, and she will do a good job being the President."

And now they're working very hard to make sure the undeserving, those who do not conform to the liberal agenda are pushed aside. And I think that this is more than anything, this is about Chelsea. And of course, she will be disappointed. Chelsea has the potential, I suppose of delivering, but only if she becomes I think her own person.

The average home price in Montgomery County is more than $400,000.00. Building new cheap homes in liberal areas is almost impossible. So instead, the county is trying to cope by allowing residents to open new apartments in their basements or backyards. More than 1,500 residents of Montgomery County signed a petition denouncing the plan. They said it would quote, \"Alter the appearance, density and value of our neighborhoods.\" Oh, they complain it would make their community feel like slums or fill them with unfamiliar strangers. In other words, if we give them a taste of what has been happening to the entire rest of the country with their approval, \"Not in our neighborhood,\" they said though.

This morning the paper's print headline summarized the President's speech in El Paso and Dayton this way, quote, \"Trump urges unity versus racism.\" That's what the President did. You saw it, so the headline was fine. It describe what happened. But online, the left went crazy -- even crazier than usual. Cory Booker, apparently still running for President accused The \"New York Times\" of somehow putting lives at risk. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- the pampered moron that she is -- said the paper was enabling white supremacy through cowardice. So of course, the paper caved. Later versions of the article were headlined, \"Assailing hate, but not guns.\" Mark Penn is a former adviser of Bill and Hillary Clinton. He joins us tonight. Mark, I'm worried because I think every country, this one particularly, deserves, you know two sides that are both sane and capable of rational conversation. If you believe that \"The New York Times\" is carrying water for right wingers or white supremacists. You're delusional, I think."

      "utterance": "Well, look, you could think that either headline was okay. But the process of the headline that was factually correct and frankly, was unifying after these horrifying events would then be complained about by one political faction and changed. That is an astounding development in journalism. I've never seen it maybe it's happened before. Why don't they just run the headlines in front one -- why don't they the run the headlines before AOC before they run them down and not get into the situation? I've never seen anything like this. I mean, that would be the way to go to avoid this kind of trouble. Is that journalism today? I don't think so."

      "utterance": "Well, so isn't the appropriate response -- well, I know I've been in it for 28 years, I know the appropriate response, which is like, \"Up yours. It's our paper. We will write the headlines we want. And we're going to tell the truth, whether you like it or not,\" whatever happened to that attitude?"

    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, and that was the old \"New York Times\" that I knew. I used to complain when I was working with Hillary and Bill about the headlines all the time, I never got one changed. Maybe I got a paragraph six graph down changed, but you know, they were the paper of record. They said how they saw it. And that was that. To actually bend after it is printed to a political faction is to cave in a way that I think will haunt them for some time to come."

    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, what's changed is, one, there is social media, but regardless of the social media, the paper wanted to please a constituency, and they weren't willing to stand behind their own headline, and were then willing to change it for that constituency. That is incredible."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It is incredible. It is incredible. So I mean, you've been in Washington an awfully long time and known a lot of people in power here. Have you ever seen anybody under 30 with this much political power as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?"

    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "No. It's not political power. You see, Pelosi is right. Pelosi runs the House, but when it comes to media power, right, and the influence across our culture and society, she is a phenomenon that is really quite powerful. I mean, she could change a headline on \"The New York Times.\""

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, it's like a child with a firearm. It's just -- she is scary. I'm glad I'm not a Democratic leader. I'm glad I'm not Nancy Pelosi. It's probably the first time I ever thought this. I mean, how would you like to have to deal with that? I almost feel sorry for Pelosi - - almost. Mark Penn, great to see you."
