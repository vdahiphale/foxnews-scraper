      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” All right, take a seat, pour a cocktail. We're about to blow your mind. For more than 30 years, Nancy Pelosi, as you well know, has represented the single most liberal congressional district in America and she has always seemed perfectly suited for the job. Name the issue, no matter what it is: from abortion to climate change to affirmative action and Nancy Pelosi has the party approved doctrinaire left position on that issue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She's a walking liberal stereotype, or so we thought. In fact, it was all a pose. It was a sham identity designed to cloak a darker reality beneath. You thought Nancy Pelosi was a guilty white liberal who regularly sends money to the annual NPR pledge drive, didn't you? No. In fact, Pelosi is a committed racist, a hardened bigot. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She would be running the ladies Klan auxiliary if they had one in San Francisco. Kind of shocking, actually. How do we know this? Simple. Watch the way Nancy Pelosi dismisses fellow Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "\"It's like five people.\" Actually, it's four people. But of course a racist would get the number wrong. Pelosi was referring to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley or as Pelosi doubtless thinks of them, the four morons of the apocalypse. Pelosi does not like them. She has made that clear and Ocasio-Cortez having thought about it a lot, think she knows why. In a recent interview with \"The Washington Post,\" Ocasio-Cortez accused Pelosi of quote, \"singling out newly elected women of color.\" Get it? Yes. Pressed to explain yourself later, Ocasio-Cortez noted that Pelosi has attacked these women of color despite, quote, \"knowing the amount of death threats that we get.\" I think it's just worth asking why. Yes. Okay. That's a rhetorical question. Obviously, she knows why. Why else would you imperil someone's safety? Well, because you wish them harm. Because you're a crazed bigot. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that's who is running the Democratic Party right now. Quick. Someone weren't Al Sharpton and the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, we've got a racist third in line to the presidency. Maybe we're being too literal about this. What are the odds in real life that Ocasio-Cortez actually believes that Nancy Pelosi is a racist, or that Joe Biden is a racist or for that matter that Donald Trump is a racist? What are the chances she really thinks that? Probably about zero. The first thing to know about the cries of racism, you hear incessantly from the left, they are totally insincere. No one is saying it actually believes it. The point isn't to get rid of racism. The point is to seize power and it works. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Denouncing someone as racist is a kind of rhetorical stun grenade. For a moment, the accused just stands there, off balanced and looking bewildered. That's when you scoop up the loot and run. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Grievance politics is a kind of smash and grab operation, and it's highly effective. It's no surprise that the left now justifies its entire political program in the name of fighting bigotry. America has been accused of racism, therefore we must, I don't know, picket. Give up our guns, empty our prisons, and legalize drugs. Give up the First Amendment. Pay for someone else's abortion. Tear down our borders. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, we're not allowed to ask about citizenship on our census form. Because of racism. See how it works? Yes. The question is, how did Nancy Pelosi fall for this? She has been working this game so long herself. You'd think she would have seen it coming. But apparently she didn't. Heather Mac Donald is the author of \"The Diversity Delusion\" and she joins us tonight. Heather, nice to see you tonight. Are you surprised having followed this whole line of argument for so many years and so closely? Are you surprised that Pelosi and Biden for that matter are both being denounced as racist right now? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And that works wonderfully on a college campus. You accuse the President of racism, he immediately crumbles and orders another million dollars in diversity and bureaucracy. You accuse a corporation of racism, and it folds as we saw with Nike and the preposterous claim that the Betsy Ross flag is racist.",

Alex Jones, InfoWars are on that list. So is Louis Farrakhan, so is Milo Yiannopoulos, and others whose only crime is the views they hold that Facebook doesn't like. Want them murdered?

We've updated our community standards to be more clear about that.\" Thank you, Facebook. We're happy about that. Happy that Facebook is no longer tolerating violent threats against political dissidents. Of course, they're still silencing them. Well, one group they aren't silencing though was Antifa. Al-Qaeda and ISIS may get more headlines, but in America, Antifa has become the terror group that poses a much greater threat to your rights than maybe any other in the country.

And so I started this nonprofit last year. It was approved by the IRS for nonprofit status earlier this year. And we aim to fill the gaps that the Civil Rights community doesn't fill, like the ACLU no longer cares about First Amendment issues, certainly not for people on my side of the spectrum. But this is not a partisan organization. It's simply there to help people who are ignored. So Andy Ngo is the first client of PublisuLex. We are also hoping to help people who are being marginalized by Big Tech and oppressed by the government. And so, you know, I've sued the City of San Jose, I've sued Google. We're looking at legal action in Portland, and so all of these things are things that are dear to my heart, and hopefully, there will be many attorneys joining me to help take these cases.",

Ultimately, I'm very skeptical of anything that doesn't really impact what they're doing with respect to the immunity that they have from lawsuits under Communications Decency Act, Section 230. And so I think that to me, as an attorney, I think the first thing that needs to get done is to rein in those definitions and make sure that only the speech that was meant to be protected when the statute was passed, is what is protected. Now, it's really gotten out of control, Tucker, the courthouse doors are virtually barred to anybody who wants to sue for their rights, even with breach of contract, antitrust issues, anything like that.

      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” All right, take a seat, pour a cocktail. We're about to blow your mind. For more than 30 years, Nancy Pelosi, as you well know, has represented the single most liberal congressional district in America and she has always seemed perfectly suited for the job. Name the issue, no matter what it is: from abortion to climate change to affirmative action and Nancy Pelosi has the party approved doctrinaire left position on that issue. She's a walking liberal stereotype, or so we thought. In fact, it was all a pose. It was a sham identity designed to cloak a darker reality beneath. You thought Nancy Pelosi was a guilty white liberal who regularly sends money to the annual NPR pledge drive, didn't you? No. In fact, Pelosi is a committed racist, a hardened bigot. She would be running the ladies Klan auxiliary if they had one in San Francisco. Kind of shocking, actually. How do we know this? Simple. Watch the way Nancy Pelosi dismisses fellow Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "\"It's like five people.\" Actually, it's four people. But of course a racist would get the number wrong. Pelosi was referring to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley or as Pelosi doubtless thinks of them, the four morons of the apocalypse. Pelosi does not like them. She has made that clear and Ocasio-Cortez having thought about it a lot, think she knows why. In a recent interview with \"The Washington Post,\" Ocasio-Cortez accused Pelosi of quote, \"singling out newly elected women of color.\" Get it? Yes. Pressed to explain yourself later, Ocasio-Cortez noted that Pelosi has attacked these women of color despite, quote, \"knowing the amount of death threats that we get.\" I think it's just worth asking why. Yes. Okay. That's a rhetorical question. Obviously, she knows why. Why else would you imperil someone's safety? Well, because you wish them harm. Because you're a crazed bigot. According to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that's who is running the Democratic Party right now. Quick. Someone weren't Al Sharpton and the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, we've got a racist third in line to the presidency. Maybe we're being too literal about this. What are the odds in real life that Ocasio-Cortez actually believes that Nancy Pelosi is a racist, or that Joe Biden is a racist or for that matter that Donald Trump is a racist? What are the chances she really thinks that? Probably about zero. The first thing to know about the cries of racism, you hear incessantly from the left, they are totally insincere. No one is saying it actually believes it. The point isn't to get rid of racism. The point is to seize power and it works. Denouncing someone as racist is a kind of rhetorical stun grenade. For a moment, the accused just stands there, off balanced and looking bewildered. That's when you scoop up the loot and run. Grievance politics is a kind of smash and grab operation, and it's highly effective. It's no surprise that the left now justifies its entire political program in the name of fighting bigotry. America has been accused of racism, therefore we must, I don't know, picket. Give up our guns, empty our prisons, and legalize drugs. Give up the First Amendment. Pay for someone else's abortion. Tear down our borders. By the way, we're not allowed to ask about citizenship on our census form. Because of racism. See how it works? Yes. The question is, how did Nancy Pelosi fall for this? She has been working this game so long herself. You'd think she would have seen it coming. But apparently she didn't. Heather Mac Donald is the author of \"The Diversity Delusion\" and she joins us tonight. Heather, nice to see you tonight. Are you surprised having followed this whole line of argument for so many years and so closely? Are you surprised that Pelosi and Biden for that matter are both being denounced as racist right now?"

I disagree slightly with you to say that people don't believe this. I think what we're witnessing is the most dangerous import from the academy into the real world. Students are taught from the moment they arrive on campus two things and two things only reliably, which is that the most important thing about themselves is their group identity, defined productively by gonads and melanin and that racism and sexism based on those characteristics are the defining features of American society. It's hard to believe that when they face any kind of disagreement, they reflexively accuse their ideological opponent of bigotry and hate. And that works wonderfully on a college campus. You accuse the President of racism, he immediately crumbles and orders another million dollars in diversity and bureaucracy. You accuse a corporation of racism, and it folds as we saw with Nike and the preposterous claim that the Betsy Ross flag is racist."

It is an attempt to shut down any kind of dialectical search for truth, and to occupy the sole allowable ideological ground. And that's a recipe for a society to halt dead in its tracks and go in reverse."

That is what America is about; that we have the right, we have the freedom to debate our opinions. The alternative to debate is violence. It is an act of narcissism to think that everything is about yourself to immediately say, \"Well, it must be because of my gender and race that I'm being disagreed with. And you must be a bigot to disagree with me.\" No, that is not the case. These are issues that deserve to be threshed out in the public forum. And again, if they are not, we are approaching a totalitarian state very quickly."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAC DONALD",
      "utterance": "Well, the average person has to simply reject the racism charge. All of us have to start working on alternative explanations for our reality. Racism is no longer the predominant characteristic of America. If it ever was, it was a part of it, it was never the defining feature, but it certainly is not -- this still remains a land of opportunity. The alternative explanation is that there are profound behavioral differences, choices that individuals make that determines social outcomes. We have to fight back against this narrative, Tucker, because if they win, we lose our civilization. We lose meritocracy, and we lose freedom."

So we need to go to those communities that all of those politicians are talking about, and work with and identify grassroots leaders who are black in there, who use the principles of our founders, as the principal means, who deliver themselves, redeem themselves from self- destructive behavior, from drugs and alcohol. And because they are the living witnesses that America is defined by its promise. For example, we have with -- in the face of racism, we've built hospitals, we built insurance companies, hotels. These are the stories of how we achieved against the odds. We had 20 blacks, who were born slaves, who died millionaires, some of them actually went back into those plantations and purchase them, where they were enslaved and even took in the families of the slave masters. So if blacks were able to achieve these great feats in the presence of race -- raw racism, the jury racism, then right they can be used today. So these same principles are in our lives. But we must give voice to the people suffering the problem to speak for themselves, every one of those white and black candidates do not live in those communities suffering the problem, and therefore they cannot speak of it."

The crime wave ended thankfully. New York and other major cities became livable again. Real estate prices went up. Everyone benefited. The poor and vulnerable, most of all.

But 50 percent of all prison inmates, that's not, you know, nonviolent offenders, that's a wholesale prison break. They would completely change this country forever. The crime rate would spike, there's no way around it. And that's why no one has ever proposed that before."

And the idea behind that, like I said, all 20-plus Democrats running for the presidency don't have the exact same policy on that. But most of them agree that there are low level offenders right up to depending on what their platform is, what you reference, but that, again, being the nation that incarcerates the most people in the world, we probably could survive letting some of those people out. There is an entire industrial complex built on prison labor and incarcerating people who are predominantly marginalized people."

If you look at the migrant crisis in Africa, people aren't dying by the hundreds crossing the Mediterranean to get to Europe, because they're trying to get to America.

You don't throw that much money at a situation with no strings attached to it. There has to be a master, somebody that decides how this money is spent. If you don't, they are going to steal it. And whether it's Puerto Rico, or Houston or New Orleans, any place else in the world, or in the United States where we have these disasters, we can't just throw money, we have to control the money.

      "utterance": "For three months, Facebook's community standards explained to users that they were not allowed to advocate violence unless it was toward Alex Jones or someone else Facebook didn't like. Starting in April, up until this week, Facebook community standards stated that users could not advocate extreme violence or post death threats, quote, \"Unless the target is an organization or individual covered in the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations Policy.\" It was that, while Facebook's Dangerous Individuals and Organizations list is simply a list of people and groups Facebook doesn't like. Alex Jones, InfoWars are on that list. So is Louis Farrakhan, so is Milo Yiannopoulos, and others whose only crime is the views they hold that Facebook doesn't like. Want them murdered? Well, Facebook said that was fine. We contacted Facebook about this policy yesterday. They replied by telling us they had changed their policy and provided this statement to us. Quote, \"We don't allow credible threats of violence against anyone. Our intent was to cover things like calls for the death penalty or support for military action against violent actors. We've updated our community standards to be more clear about that.\" Thank you, Facebook. We're happy about that. Happy that Facebook is no longer tolerating violent threats against political dissidents. Of course, they're still silencing them. Well, one group they aren't silencing though was Antifa. Al-Qaeda and ISIS may get more headlines, but in America, Antifa has become the terror group that poses a much greater threat to your rights than maybe any other in the country. Journalist, Andy Ngo learned that the hard way last month when they nearly killed him, as he attempted to cover an Antifa protest in Portland. Watch."

Now, a new legal fund aims to combat both of these threats to your liberties. Harmeet Dhillon is an actual Civil Rights attorney and the founder of publiuslex.com. She joins us tonight. Harmeet, great to see you."

      "speaker": "DHILLON",
      "utterance": "Well, Tucker, I've been a Civil Rights attorney for most of my career, over 25 years and I saw a real gap in the Civil Rights establishment, which is that when it comes to increasingly First Amendment rights in general, but particularly the rights of anybody who is anywhere on the right, or anybody who is marginalized and not part of the popular woke movement, there's no place for them in the Civil Rights community. And so I started this nonprofit last year. It was approved by the IRS for nonprofit status earlier this year. And we aim to fill the gaps that the Civil Rights community doesn't fill, like the ACLU no longer cares about First Amendment issues, certainly not for people on my side of the spectrum. But this is not a partisan organization. It's simply there to help people who are ignored. So Andy Ngo is the first client of PublisuLex. We are also hoping to help people who are being marginalized by Big Tech and oppressed by the government. And so, you know, I've sued the City of San Jose, I've sued Google. We're looking at legal action in Portland, and so all of these things are things that are dear to my heart, and hopefully, there will be many attorneys joining me to help take these cases."

      "speaker": "DHILLON",
      "utterance": "It was very interesting. There were a lot of people from across the sort of Twitter verse, different walks of life and so forth. But what they had in common was a passion for free speech and making sure that their voices are heard. And so we had some great conversations privately, and also with the bigger group about what was happening and some great Members of Congress. We talked about potential legislative analyses. Ultimately, I'm very skeptical of anything that doesn't really impact what they're doing with respect to the immunity that they have from lawsuits under Communications Decency Act, Section 230. And so I think that to me, as an attorney, I think the first thing that needs to get done is to rein in those definitions and make sure that only the speech that was meant to be protected when the statute was passed, is what is protected. Now, it's really gotten out of control, Tucker, the courthouse doors are virtually barred to anybody who wants to sue for their rights, even with breach of contract, antitrust issues, anything like that. You know, Big Tech has got its finger on the scale, and they own a lot of politicians and a lot of think tanks in D.C., and so it's an epic struggle."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

Harmeet Dhillon, you're one of the very few people standing in opposition to the totalitarian impulses of Big Tech and we're grateful for that. Good luck with this."

Google at the very top of that list. Well that's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. DVR it if you can figure out how to operate that and if you can, send us a note, we will be absolutely impressed.
