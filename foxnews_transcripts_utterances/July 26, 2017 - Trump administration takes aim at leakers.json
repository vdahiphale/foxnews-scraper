Second, what I heard him say is that he is glad that now he can protect the communication staff, and especially those junior staffers from people who were trying to get them to leak on their behalf. To me, that's what he was saying is that, that was coming from outside of the communications jobs. So that he's trying to once, to get some solidarity with his communications team which sounds good.

And look, Secretary Kelly said back in April that we are facing terror threats as high as 9/11. So, at a time we are facing such great threats, why would we want to undermine intelligence sharing with our allies that could potentially keep America safe? So, of course, it's an important issue.

Seven Republicans joined all Democrats earlier in a 45-55 vote, defeating the plan. So, I just want to read the names of the Republican senators who voted against repealing ObamaCare. Susan Collins in Maine, Shelley Moore Capito in West Virginia, John McCain Arizona, Rob Portman Ohio, Lamar Alexander Tennessee, Lisa Murkowski Alaska, and Dean Heller of Nevada.

I think about these seven senators that you just read their names about their decision and Peggy Noonan on Saturday on her Wall Street column said something very interesting about how when you are on the ground and in your own state, you are looking at the topography of the politics and that in the last eight years, with President Obama, lots of things changed. And that people have more anxieties and they don't expect change in Washington to be good for them. And so, I think what we end up with now is that there's really not a strong Republican Party of smaller government. Its variations on the team of bigger government and how government should actually work. And that is disconcerting to a lot of conservatives who think that we should just taken this opportunity to repeal it and move on. That's obviously not going to happen here but I think what they're doing is reacting to their constituents."

Attorney Chris Gowen also told FOX News that his client seen here with former President Clinton had received a green light to travel abroad from the U.S. attorney's office weeks before.

Caterpillar, shutting down after promising, they are shutting down here and moving to Mexico, the steelmaker, CTF electronics, even Ford is still moving their focus operations to Mexico."

It is true that Foxconn has made promises before and those plans did not get billed, but this is all being done in Paul Ryan's district, the town of Janesville and some really good news for Foxconn there. They are some great employees. These guys want to work and because the government has been thinking about this ahead of time, there has already been some worker retraining being done. So this plant apparently won't open until 2020. That means that there is plenty of time to try to get as many workers as possible in that area that they can higher, up to speed, so they can ask to do those jobs."

These are $54,000 a year salaries, this high tech manufacturing. It's everything that people have been talking about wanting to do. Keeping jobs in America is President Trump's core message or one of them, to help him win reelection and I think sometimes these swing state blue state voters that may be lean Democrat a little bit, come election day, maybe they will think Trump is obnoxious and his style is a little annoying into his twitter is out of control -- Russia is crazy but he delivers results that help my family put food on the table and send my kids to college, I think that is going to be the key to his reelection."

He did have a strong message to manufacturers in this country. To those workers, that worker base, he was going to help them and get the help that they needed. That was the message and we have signs of optimism, the national association of manufacturers, and a 20 year high in terms of optimism. The most optimism we have seen since July 2007, we saw job growth exceed expectations in July. I think 220,000 jobs -- there are reasons to be optimistic now. If you can just deliver when working with congress on things like tax reform and health care, then I do think he has a strong message for the voters in 2020, particularly in regards to the economy."

If we are going to investigate what went on with Russia, how in the world you leave the Democrats out of it and how do you leave Hillary Clinton out of it? The Republicans run the show. It's time for the Republicans to start acting like it. Politics is what it is. The Republicans don't appear to want to play the game."

At the show they are able to govern. I think one of the reasons that initially at least that the committee did not go after the Hillary Clinton and the Attorney General than is President Trump upon himself upon winning election, when he did his first interview said I don't plan to hurt her. I think she is gone through enough. He is very magnanimous and everybody thought that was so Presidential. To go back now, maybe it's possible and there is some talk that Bob Mueller's investigation is also bleeding into what the Democrats may have done, and if that happens, basically everyone would say everyone does it and they are dirty or maybe they'd find nothing at all. But I do think if you step back from those investigations, that is most important one. This is the best opportunity to get tax reform so you can get more Foxconn, but actually Americans owned companies wanting to expand in America, but the tax reform piece is the most important thing and it's got to put all their weight behind in September."

What always happens in Washington is Democrats they overreach and then Republicans always seem to under deliver. Right now, Democrats right now want to basically throw Trump in jail. And Republicans won't even look into the Clinton foundation. The Democrats socialize the health care system and Republicans can't even repeal and replace. The Democrats open the border wide open and their people in the house that won't even fund the border wall. So, right now, I think what you see is Democrats treat politics like life and death and Republicans treat it like a parlor game. At the Democrats will smear and destroy evidence. They will criminalize your behavior. And Republicans will run away from a headline in \"the Washington Post\" because they are afraid of bad press. They need to stick to our guns. Voters put Republicans in control of the government for a reason. And they want to have the Republican Party to deliver. If they don't deliver, what are they good for? He has a quarterback in Donald Trump. He is got a great arm. He throws a long ball. If you don't have anybody blocking it for him in the house and senate, the guy will get stacked all day.

Justin Trudeau was horrible, because not only to be seen recently with the pay out to a terrorist at $10.5 million and an embarrassing formal apology and a stupid statement about somehow he is creating a moral society and you have to be a moral society even when things are unpopular.
