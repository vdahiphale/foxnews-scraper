Her name was Mollie Tibbetts. Cristhian Rivera faced to judge today where he was slapped to the $5 million bond after he admitted to police that he had followed Mollie on her daily jog down a rural farm road before he claims he blacked out and says he later came to with Mollie's blood-soaked body in the back of his truck. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, how did he manage to get here and go undetected for years?

The President took a lot of heat as you noted at the start of his visit to the U.K. for declaring a trade deal might be hard to do because Prime Minister Theresa May was pushing a soft Brexit plan that would not really cut ties with the European Union as promised. The President adding to the Sun newspaper at the time that a ousted foreign secretary Boris Johnson who had just resigned to protest that Brexit plan might make a good Prime Minister, left out of the massive criticism of the President that followed is he may have been a little salty over the fact that he was greeted by that giant balloon known as Trump baby as part of hundreds of thousands of protesters in London. And the man who replaced Johnson as foreign secretary, you just noted Jeremy Hunt said at the time he understood the President's style telling you in an interview that the President likes deal. So if you do the deal, he'll be your friend, if you don't he'll take you on. But it doesn't mean he'll end the special relationship with the U.K. over a short-term disagreement, an idea that much of the mainstream media here back at home seemed to miss.",

Her name was Mollie Tibbetts. Cristhian Rivera faced to judge today where he was slapped to the $5 million bond after he admitted to police that he had followed Mollie on her daily jog down a rural farm road before he claims he blacked out and says he later came to with Mollie's blood-soaked body in the back of his truck. So, how did he manage to get here and go undetected for years? Earlier today, his equally shocked employer spoke out."

Well, we heard from the employer there, of Rivera, and they raised a lot of questions when they initially said that they used the federal E-verify system to screen Rivera, then they retracted their statements today saying that they did not. And he's not who they thought he was. And developing late today, a federal immigration official also tells Fox News that Rivera never submitted a request for DACA and that there is no record that he has any immigration status in this country. Earlier today, 24-year-old Christian Rivera was led into the Poweshiek County Court. You might hear the bells in that court behind me. He appeared in stripes prison garb and shackles. I was able to ask Rivera if he killed Mollie Tibbetts, and he did not respond. He remain stone-faced. In court, the defense said the case has become so political, they wanted the media banned. Saying even the president has commented on this case. The judge denied the request to ban the media today, but there could be a ruling to ban media at future proceedings. Representatives from the Mexican Consulate were in court today, afterwards, we spoke to them. They say that they feel that Rivera was treated fairly and that the translations were done well. Today, Fox News sat down again with a representative from the lead investigative agency in this case, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. Rick Rahn tells Fox News that the investigation into Rivera might not be over."

The President of the United States, he made a promise to the American people. He is going to support, he is going to close the borders, he's going to build the wall, and he is going to secure the American people. This is part of why he did that. This is part of why he won. The American people have rejected more of this, more blood on politician's hands. He has said, and he offered a deal on DACA. The Democrats want this issue politically more than they want a solution and that's a fact. So, I -- if I was advising this president, I would say tell Mitch McConnell to go nuclear.

Cohen pled guilty in federal court yesterday to charges that include two counts of campaign finance violations. One of the big questions, as we move forward, is what impact might this have on the Mueller probe if Michael Cohen continues to expand his memory and talk to them. Earlier, I spoke with Michael Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis."

And yet, we know from the tape that your client made surreptitiously that they discussed it before the payment was made. But, I want to go to the larger question of whether or not it was a campaign finance violation. You seem to be assuming that it was. Michael Cohen said it was, but others are saying that there's no way to connect the two in a clean direct way."

Former Election Commission Chairman Hans von Spakovsky said this is not a violation because this was not a campaign-related offense. This is the former head of the FEC Commission. He says Cohen pled guilty to it, Cohen paid it, but then Cohen was reimbursed by Trump and a candidate can spend as much of their money as they want to on their campaign."

And the law doesn't make a distinction between money that from a campaign that is for the principle purpose of politics which is what the prosecutors found. There's no distinction between as Mr. Trump said campaign funds or personal funds. Both are subject to one limits and two disclosure. Neither of those occurred for the very reason that Mr. Trump didn't want anybody to know about $130,000 of hush money to Miss Daniels and he asked Mr. Cohen according to the prosecutors --"

In fact, you said yesterday that he used the exact words that the prosecutors told him to use in terms of -- at the direction of the President those payments were made to influence the campaign of 2016. So those are the words that Michael Cohen used when he pled guilty. If he had not agreed to use those words, would he have been able to get the sentence that he got or have made this plea at all, or was it incumbent upon him using those words?"

We all heard what Michael Cohen said in court, but whether in terms of how it relates to the President and the campaign, you know, it I think this is based on other people's legal assessment of whether or not it says cut and dry as you say it is. But you know, obviously, his credibility is a question. I mean, he lied about his taxes, he owes the U.S. government about 1.4 million in taxes according to the prosecutor who spoke yesterday. He lied about the bank situation, about the taxi, so why should people take him at his word now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I wouldn't ask anyone to take him at his word. The prosecutors developed a case with evidence of members of his campaign. If you read the entire information put out by the prosecutors, members of his campaign, members of the Trump Organization all document, that the money was paid right before the election and the prosecutors brought charges that Mr. Cohen was motivated for political reasons to pay hush money and that Mr. Trump is named as the person who directed -- that's their word -- and coordinated -- that's their word. Now you can argue about how jurors would come out. I completely agree with you. I never used the words cut and dried. I believe you did twice, I didn't. I said reasonable inference. Inferences can be debated, that's what juries are all about."

The conventional wisdom back in July was that maybe President Trump was meddling in British politics, maybe he was blowing up key alliances like NATO, but now even the foreign minister is pointing out that President Trump's foreign policy seems to make some sense. The President took a lot of heat as you noted at the start of his visit to the U.K. for declaring a trade deal might be hard to do because Prime Minister Theresa May was pushing a soft Brexit plan that would not really cut ties with the European Union as promised. The President adding to the Sun newspaper at the time that a ousted foreign secretary Boris Johnson who had just resigned to protest that Brexit plan might make a good Prime Minister, left out of the massive criticism of the President that followed is he may have been a little salty over the fact that he was greeted by that giant balloon known as Trump baby as part of hundreds of thousands of protesters in London. And the man who replaced Johnson as foreign secretary, you just noted Jeremy Hunt said at the time he understood the President's style telling you in an interview that the President likes deal. So if you do the deal, he'll be your friend, if you don't he'll take you on. But it doesn't mean he'll end the special relationship with the U.K. over a short-term disagreement, an idea that much of the mainstream media here back at home seemed to miss."

      "utterance": "No. And with this President, you get a lot of fireworks. He's pretty good at that but I think you have to look at the substance and actually one of the things that happened as a result of that trip was that we had a good discussion with the President about the plight of the white helmets in Syria. And after that measures were taken, the U.K., the U.S., Israel and other allies working together and we got those very, very brave people out of Syria. We saved their lives. And the reason we do that is because we don't agree on everything. I mean, we don't agree with the President's position of tariffs on steel and aluminum which is affecting British companies, but fundamentally we share values and fundamentally we want a world in which democracy, freedom, human rights are respected. We want that for our children, our grandchildren going forward. So that's why we can work together."

He said, well you know, if I can't work with the U.K., I'll work with the E.U. Whoever gives us the better deal is who we want to deal with. So are there carve-outs in those tariffs that you have -- that you have been able to achieve and where does that stand?"

That's what the president is enthusiastic to do and I had good discussions about that today at the White House so we think it's possible. And I think the important thing is that you know, right now we're in a world where there's a lot of instability, a lot of threats to the -- to the international order that we've all grown up with and you need countries like Britain and America to stand together. And one of the things I did today which I will remember for a very long time was I met some very brave American diplomats who were expelled from Moscow because the United States stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Britain when we had a chemical weapons attack on our soil, it expelled 60 diplomats. And you remember when your friends do something like that, and if we're going to keep the world safe then countries like Britain and America that share so many values, we have to stand together."

That began with the states asking to see the contract that the new Miss America is going to sign. Fiduciary responsibilities, lack of transparencies and taking stakeholders' words and suggestions into play like they were promised. And so the bullying behavior that has also ensued not only on the former Miss America front and how Gretchen has dealt with us, but now finally hearing about it from Cara, that's kind of the tipping point where we are like, you know what? Enough is enough."

And first of all, we really shouldn't be the one sitting here as former Miss America speaking. Carol Mund should be doing all TV appearances. Not Gretchen Carlson, not myself, not Caressa, not Theresa. But we are only here because our voice is the voice for Cara. And Cara actually sent all the former Miss America a private e-mail. She did not letter -- e-mail a letter of grievance because she tried to speak to board members and she was silenced and told not to speak and keep it in the family. Which to me, as a principal and as a leader of a private Catholic school and nonprofit, by the way, I know that there are grievance policies that should be in place and she wasn't able to get her grievances across."

But Caressa, you know, just to continue to get to the bottom of it, can you give some examples of what you think is wrong with the organization and why you would like to see these people removed? I know that 23 states, I believe state organizations have also called for the removal of these individuals, so clearly, there are some specific grievances. If you could, you know, sort of give people at home a sense of some examples?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. So there have been some dictatorial changes made to the organization, specifically people are thinking about the swimsuit competition that has been removed. And that was removed because the board of directors voted for it to be removed based on the information that was given to them by Gretchen and Regina that we would lose potential sponsorship and our on-air partner if we continue with the swimsuit portion of the competition. We found out that wasn't the truth. When the state has asked for contracts and to see things in regarding the spending and all of that, they've been denied over and over again. So there's just been a lack of transparency and all the things that were originally promised to us that we were so hopeful for when Gretchen took the seat. As a sister and as someone who has lived under the crown we expected more from her. And so we feel like, along with Gretchen and Regina and the board they are all complacent and allowing this kind of behavior to continue and so we believe that what's best for the organization at this point is for them to step aside and allow us to move forward in a better light."

The contestants now that are going to Atlantic City or who the focus should be on. The 51 contestants are scared to death. What I'm worried about is 30 states are totally against this leadership. They have zero confidence. Twenty one Miss America's -- 22 started, now there's 30. There are 21 Miss America that are calling for the full board resignation and 20,000 people in a petition that have signed and they are not able to get off unless the board either votes off the two and then steps off and resigns gracefully, or there is a coup. But that can't happen. So really the power is in the board of director's hands right now and sadly, it's a difficult decision because two former Miss Americas are on that board and the chair just happens to be a former Miss America that we voted in and we apologize for putting her in because we did not think it would turn out this way. That one person would try to single-handedly break down a 97-year-old institution. So Miss America is relevant as you can see from all the accomplished women that have come out and spoken.

A stunning fall from grace for former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez, the former tight end once played in a Super Bowl alongside Tom Brady, raking in a $41 million contract when he was drafted by the Patriots. But he was charged and convicted of first-degree murder soon after. And then tragically, took his own life in prison last year. So now a new book by his lawyer is depicting the turmoil in Hernandez's final year. Here now is Jose Baez, author of, \"Unnecessary Roughness, Inside the Trial and Final Days of the Aaron Hernandez.\" Jose, good to have you here."

      "utterance": "You have -- you are well known obviously for representing Casey Anthony who a lot of people believed was guilty. A lot of people believe that Aaron Hernandez was guilty in the death of Odin Lloyd. We have video here of his mother weeping and holding his bloodied shirt. The car that was rented that was brought there, was rented by Aaron Hernandez and he was at the scene. Why do you believe he didn't do it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAEZ",
      "utterance": "Well, because three people identified him as being someplace else and three other independent witnesses identify the person that was actually in the car as having long hair with corn rows. That's not Aaron Hernandez, I think the evidence was overwhelming that he was innocent and that's why the jury acquitted him. So, and just to clear that up, I didn't represent him in the first case."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAEZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, I have a reasonable doubt that he was guilty on that case. Because I think, well, what a lot of people don't know was he was prosecuted under what's called the joint venture theory which means the prosecutor doesn't know who pulled the trigger. There were three individuals that were there. Four men went in and three came out. The other two had extensive criminal records, and based on what I've seen, I thought that there was a reasonable doubt in that case. Now I didn't represent him there so I'm not as intimately knowledge and involved with that case, so that's all I can say, is that I have a reasonable doubt that he committed that. I know he didn't commit the second case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this. You know, he is a complicated person, obviously enormously talented on the football field. But also he was a troubled guy with a lot of issues. He was picked very low in the draft, and some people believed that it was because of that because people didn't necessarily want to take him on. But you have a soft spot for him based on your relationship with him in prison."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAEZ",
      "utterance": "I do. I think Aaron was somebody that's completely misunderstood and that's what my book is really a different view of him. We know the story line. Story lines has been told a million times. What this book is that it shows a different perspective of him. I got to know him very well not only by being with him but by also reading thousands and thousands of text messages. He was the type of person that couldn't say no to people if someone needed something or wanted something. He was a kind individual that would always -- he was a big kid, a big goofy kid, nothing like the gangster thug that people are trying to portray him as, or ultimately did portray him as. You can't tell a book by its cover and this cover was pretty hard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It's complicated. You have a lawsuit against the NFL on behalf of his daughter."

    },
    {

      "utterance": "Why, what are you accusing them of?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAEZ",
      "utterance": "This is the -- this is a lawsuit for loss of consortium for his daughter. This still stems from the issue of CTE for which the NFL deliberately withheld from its players the information that they had that shows that tackle football and head injuries, repeated head injuries cause the severe brain damage which is the direct linked to suicide for which he died."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAEZ",
      "utterance": "I don't because I have that reasonable doubt. But my knowledge and I say this with the disclaimer, my knowledge on that case is limited. So all I can say is based on looking at the case -- you know, I'm a lawyer and I look at it from a certain perspective. And the perspective that I see it in is, even if the prosecutor -- the prosecutor can't even tell you that he pulled the trigger. So you have to have some doubt there. His overt acts are completely explainable for which he was convicted because of evidence that didn't come in that case."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },

      "speaker": "BAEZ",
      "utterance": "He was being hunted by a drug dealer at that time which is why he carried a gun everywhere he went, which is why he had these people around him all the time. And that's what this book -- the book does, it kind of puts it in perspective how one case led to the other and how he ultimately ended up where he was."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "It's not even fake news because it's not news. There's nothing there. I mean, Omarosa is a joke. MSNBC became the punch line. If you had a video that was teased up like that and you didn't deliver at the end your viewers would hate you. And you would vet it though, beforehand on the story. They just threw that out there and went with it because they are both using each other. I do find it funny that when O'Keefe has a little video or audio that he wants to play MSNBC won't air it because they say it's edited or doctored but they will just take anything Omarosa puts out there."

OK, so the old one is on the left side of your screen and the new one is on the right and they are free and roaming in Africa, which is a beautiful thing. But I have a nostalgic connection to Barnum's Animal crackers because my mom used to buy them for me when I was little to keep me quiet in the grocery store and sit me in that little thing in the front and put the string around your hand and I could eat them while we were shopping. So I don't see why they had to change it."

They are just trying to sell crackers here and when you think of circus animals in cages, you don't think of delicious food. OK. You don't think of good food at all actually. So they are just saying there's no circus anymore. These are like cage free crackers. You know, whey are roaming free."
