      "sentences": "You probably don't remember that from last year, huh? So glad I kept the tape. All right. Welcome to The decade of lower expectations where Joe Biden hears applause when he makes it through lunch without leaving his teeth stuck in a sandwich. Low expectations, it's the new black. First there San Francisco where the City Paper asks earnestly, should residents and businesses tolerate burglaries as part of a city -- part of a city living and focus instead on barricading homes? It's a fair question. The thing about burglars, they're probably just looking for bread. As AOC once said about hordes of organized retail looters. You remember the riots, right? Hundreds of looters running out of stores with loaves of sourdough in boxes that for some reason had Nike logos on them. Maybe that's why car theft is soaring in San Francisco, there might be bread in there. That's why murder is way up. People are foolishly defending bread. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Oh. And if you can't tolerate that, maybe it's you who is the problem. What do you have against theft? If you have property privilege? Don't you see that you having that wallet lords over that man with a knife who doesn't have a wallet? But I guess that's what they mean by reimagining public safety. Criminals don't rob people, people have stuff that needs robbing. Meanwhile, the media has taken the low expect -- expectation bar to a new low. They point out that rising inflation is really a good thing. So get used to it. It's the exact thing I used to tell myself back in college when the rash kept returning. MSNBC tried vainly to explain why inflation is a good thing. But less people bought it than tickets to see the movie cats. They explained that Americans can only pay more for heating oil, gas and food if they first of course have more money. Except all that printed money makes it worth less. Require you to spend more of it for the same stuff. The argument that Americans are buying more because they have more is just like Biden claiming 3.5 trillion costs zero. It doesn't add up. If only the price of peanut butter was as low as his I.Q. Keeps up. And now heating costs unlike Joe's approval ratings are expected to skyrocket. His own energy secretary warned that Americans will have to pay more to heat their homes this winter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So what does Joe do? Closes more pipelines because that worked with the Keystone, rights? Slapping restrictions on fracking didn't help either. Energy independence is now as over as Mayor Pete's paternity leave. Thank God he lost the baby weight. So even amid a global energy crisis, they want to shut down the L 5 pipeline from Michigan to Canada. And when they told the press about the L 5, he just yelled bingo. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He's more out of loop than Kat at a convent. I know what that means. So why does Joe Biden close pipelines? Because they give you gas. Which is his problem, not ours. Really the only pipeline he should be shutting is the one that runs from his stomach to his ass. Talk about lower expectations more like lower intestinal expectations. You know, it's bad when the British Royals only takeaway from that climate meeting was that Joe's farts were the longest heard in recorded history. And louder than the maiden Flight of the Conchords. The Duke of Windsor, more like breaking Windsor. Camilla Parker Bowles, more like Joe Biden's bowels. Eric Swalwell must be green with envy or broccoli. Either way he needs to up his fiber intake because while Joe may not outsmart you, he will outsmart you.

Their two primetime hosts are currently accused of various things from groping to even more groping, but maybe their heart of hearing. When their boss said all hands on deck, they heard all hands on -- you know the rest. So why are the media and politicians embracing low expectations? Well, it takes the pressure off them to do the actual work. The politicians don't have to solve the problems and the hacks at CNN don't have to call them on it for not solving the problems. Just get the American people to accept failure and we could all put it on cruise control. But more important while you're expected to lower expectations they don't, they can afford any hardship.

Welcome to The decade of lower expectations where Joe Biden hears applause when he makes it through lunch without leaving his teeth stuck in a sandwich. Low expectations, it's the new black. First there San Francisco where the City Paper asks earnestly, should residents and businesses tolerate burglaries as part of a city -- part of a city living and focus instead on barricading homes? It's a fair question. The thing about burglars, they're probably just looking for bread. As AOC once said about hordes of organized retail looters. You remember the riots, right? Hundreds of looters running out of stores with loaves of sourdough in boxes that for some reason had Nike logos on them. Maybe that's why car theft is soaring in San Francisco, there might be bread in there. That's why murder is way up. People are foolishly defending bread. Oh. And if you can't tolerate that, maybe it's you who is the problem. What do you have against theft? If you have property privilege? Don't you see that you having that wallet lords over that man with a knife who doesn't have a wallet? But I guess that's what they mean by reimagining public safety. Criminals don't rob people, people have stuff that needs robbing. Meanwhile, the media has taken the low expect -- expectation bar to a new low. They point out that rising inflation is really a good thing. So get used to it. It's the exact thing I used to tell myself back in college when the rash kept returning. MSNBC tried vainly to explain why inflation is a good thing. But less people bought it than tickets to see the movie cats. They explained that Americans can only pay more for heating oil, gas and food if they first of course have more money. Except all that printed money makes it worth less. Require you to spend more of it for the same stuff. The argument that Americans are buying more because they have more is just like Biden claiming 3.5 trillion costs zero. It doesn't add up. If only the price of peanut butter was as low as his I.Q. Keeps up. And now heating costs unlike Joe's approval ratings are expected to skyrocket. His own energy secretary warned that Americans will have to pay more to heat their homes this winter. So what does Joe do? Closes more pipelines because that worked with the Keystone, rights? Slapping restrictions on fracking didn't help either. Energy independence is now as over as Mayor Pete's paternity leave. Thank God he lost the baby weight. So even amid a global energy crisis, they want to shut down the L 5 pipeline from Michigan to Canada. And when they told the press about the L 5, he just yelled bingo. He's more out of loop than Kat at a convent. I know what that means. So why does Joe Biden close pipelines? Because they give you gas. Which is his problem, not ours. Really the only pipeline he should be shutting is the one that runs from his stomach to his ass. Talk about lower expectations more like lower intestinal expectations. You know, it's bad when the British Royals only takeaway from that climate meeting was that Joe's farts were the longest heard in recorded history. And louder than the maiden Flight of the Conchords. The Duke of Windsor, more like breaking Windsor. Camilla Parker Bowles, more like Joe Biden's bowels. Eric Swalwell must be green with envy or broccoli. Either way he needs to up his fiber intake because while Joe may not outsmart you, he will outsmart you. What's happening to me?"

CNN happily defends Joe saying there's nothing he could do to reduce the energy prices? Yes. Because increasing drilling and not blocking pipelines just isn't possible. But CNN, they have a lot on their plate. Their two primetime hosts are currently accused of various things from groping to even more groping, but maybe their heart of hearing. When their boss said all hands on deck, they heard all hands on -- you know the rest. So why are the media and politicians embracing low expectations? Well, it takes the pressure off them to do the actual work. The politicians don't have to solve the problems and the hacks at CNN don't have to call them on it for not solving the problems. Just get the American people to accept failure and we could all put it on cruise control. But more important while you're expected to lower expectations they don't, they can afford any hardship. Deffund the police, no problem. They got hired security. They're closing the nearby Walgreens, cool. My assistant picks up the generic Viagra for me. That was just an example. Gas costs more, my driver Jeeves takes care of that after he rubs my feet and jelly.

Like say I go to bed at 3:00, I get up at you know, 2:00. So, as long as you get your eight hours, then you're good. You got to get your full eight. But uh, you know, as you get older, when you're younger, you can be a little more wild, but as you get older, you tend to, you got to get that -- if you're going to be active, you got to get that eight hours in. So, it was always been instilled, you just, again these studies go. There's no point to him. It's ridiculous.

You know what I mean. A new survey finds that people have an even more disgusting lack of boundaries with their pets than I even imagined. And I imagine a lot of things believe me. So, 97 percent, that's almost 100 percent, Kat, admitted that they always let their pets lick them. One in five admitted to sharing their meals, and one in 20 admitted that they will even share the bathtub, but only if they've had a few daiquiris first. It's like my neighbor used to say, Steve, until one has loved an animal a part of one soul remains unawaken. Fun fact, I was the flower girl when he married his horse. Kat, in terms of dating single woman with a cat, fine; but single woman who bathed with her cat No."

The last thing I want is the dog looking at me going, and you go out there. I'm not going out. There you go. You sit right here. My legs are asleep. I have to wait.
