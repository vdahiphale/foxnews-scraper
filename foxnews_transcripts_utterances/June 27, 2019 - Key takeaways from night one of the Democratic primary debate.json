The President reacting to that saying, \"Seems totally ridiculous that our government and indeed country cannot ask a basic question of citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important census, in this case for 2020. I've asked the lawyers if they can delay the census, no matter how long until the United States Supreme Court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter.

I think the Commerce Secretary has enormous discretion over what's in the census and the census has long asked questions about citizenship between 1820 and 2000, all but one census asked at least some Americans about citizenship or place of birth. Citizenship is a part of many statutes, like the laws that allow Americans to be eligible for benefits or not. And it's not a crazy idea for the U.S. government to know how many U.S. citizens are in the U.S. Nevertheless, they've got to go back and try to find some other reason. As far as the gerrymandering case is concerned. Look, the founders of the country knew that state legislators were partisan, and they gave them the power to draw districts.

The President reacting to that saying, \"Seems totally ridiculous that our government and indeed country cannot ask a basic question of citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important census, in this case for 2020. I've asked the lawyers if they can delay the census, no matter how long until the United States Supreme Court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter. Can anyone really believe that as a great country, we are not able to ask whether or not someone is a citizen. Only in America.\" From President Trump overseas. Let's bring in our panel here in Miami. Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics, cofounder and president; Mo Elleithee, the Executive Director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and in Washington, Byron York, chief political correspondent of \"The Washington Examiner.\" Byron, let me start with you. Thoughts on this ruling both the census question and also gerrymandering?"

And the administration actually had some reasonable arguments. I think the Commerce Secretary has enormous discretion over what's in the census and the census has long asked questions about citizenship between 1820 and 2000, all but one census asked at least some Americans about citizenship or place of birth. Citizenship is a part of many statutes, like the laws that allow Americans to be eligible for benefits or not. And it's not a crazy idea for the U.S. government to know how many U.S. citizens are in the U.S. Nevertheless, they've got to go back and try to find some other reason. As far as the gerrymandering case is concerned. Look, the founders of the country knew that state legislators were partisan, and they gave them the power to draw districts. And I think that's the basic fact that determined this ruling."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

And so there was a pretty big disconnect there when you've got serious party operatives conspiring with folks to actually create that kind of an environment. But look, ultimately, Byron is right.

They helped themselves a bit. They didn't really change the overall contours of this race. Biden is still front runner, and no one challenged him last night.

Joe Biden is obviously not just the leading candidate, but thought to be the centrist candidate, but centrism didn't really show up much last night, when you look at issues like guns and taxes and healthcare and immigration. There just wasn't a whole lot of it.

      "utterance": "I think he probably -- look, in these debates, the question is always about expectations, right? Do you meet expectations? Or do you exceed them or fall below them? He fell far short of expectations last night and the candidates who are ganging up on him. I think we're hoping to sort of claim his spot in that sort of middle of the pack."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Right. The other thing tonight, we don't -- haven't factored in are these other candidates who we haven't heard a lot about. For example, Marianne Williamson, the author, who has a different approach to a lot of things. She tweeted out after watching last night, \"I need to learn Spanish by tomorrow at nine,\" after seeing the last debate. What about Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang? And how they are factored in."

      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "These are the sort of wild cards and these are the folks that again, they're looking at this as they need to have a moment. So they're going to be I think, extra risky in maybe some of the chances that it takes to try and garner attention, because they're languishing. And if they don't perform here, they may not make the next debate or the fall debate. So back to Beto though. I mean, if you looked at the media narratives, part of this is about the narrative, the media narratives that comes out of this. There's not a single Democrat or liberal or even media organization that I could find this morning that said he did well. In fact, the only person who thought he did well was him. He gave himself an A minus."

      "utterance": "Yes. All right. Byron, wrap it up. 30,000 feet, are we looking more tonight at the battle inside of the Democratic Party between the two sides of the party and whether it goes more progressive or it goes more centrist?"

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. That is if Joe Biden really, really shows up. Just one thing, you mentioned his name, Andrew Yang is a really interesting guy. He'll be the person to watch. Now, the Biden-Bernie dynamic is going to be huge, but I would also pay a lot of attention to Kamala Harris. She's a very strong candidate, she has not been really shining lately. She had a big start. Pete Buttigieg will be polished because that's what he is. But I think Harris may really be somebody to watch."
