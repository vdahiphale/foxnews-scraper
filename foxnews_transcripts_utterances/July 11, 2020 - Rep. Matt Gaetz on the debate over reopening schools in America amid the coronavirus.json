      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. Let's get right to it. My open. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Do you feel safe? Do you feel safe? I live in New York and something has happened that is as predictable as the sun rising tomorrow morning. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } New York City, once the safest big city in America, one of the world's major commercial, financial and cultural centers will revert to the crime ridden days of the 1980s. Not just New York, soon major cities near you will return to their troubled days of lawlessness. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Whether you are right or left, believe me. Understand this. Lawlessness without police equals crime and murder. The safest big city, New York is now regressing to the bygone days of graffiti, drugs, gangs, guns, murder and mayhem. And you can thank one man -- one man -- Warren Wilhelm, Jr, known today as Bill de Blasio. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is the face of the return of crime. This is the face of the man who without a doubt is the most incompetent, inefficient and inept mayor to darken the halls of Gracie Mansion. His response to the May 25 murder of George Floyd like everyone else was outrage. But his answer to the George Floyd murder was to let New York City burn. He cut the NYPD's budget by $1 billion. He supported a Police Reform Bill that tied the hands of police with no training under these new restrictions, and he ordered stand downs while crimes occurred across the city. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But then again, he's always had a problem with the police. I said it three years ago. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Dead cops. When do we want them? Now.\" He called the protesters throwing garbage cans and bottles at police peaceful protesters.

      "sentences": "Now, as New York City devolves into chaos, de Blasio turns a blind eye. Macy's flagship store in Herald Square was looted by criminals, not protesters, criminals breaking in with hammers and coming out with stolen goods. Arsonist and looters on Fifth Avenue hit an empty Chanel, Gucci Balmain. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The universal question -- where were the police? Where are the arrests? Where are the perp walks? I'll tell you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The police were given a stand down to not engage and a minimal number of cops were deployed. The upshot. As cops stand down, criminals become emboldened and as for you, taxes will clearly go up not just for the cleanup, but because businesses can no longer afford nor would they necessarily want to be in a city where they are not protected from crime. In fact, one high end New York City store is suing for failing to stop the looting. The owner of that store says that after paying taxes, the city owed a duty to the stores to protect them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He says that the city had Intelligence, but did nothing about it. He, like many New Yorkers believes his taxes go to the NYPD and that the police were told to stand down. But the big stores were not the only stores. Looters stormed small businesses, many minority owned, many shuttered now for good because of the protesters. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Since George Floyd's death, more than 700 police officers have retired from the NYPD and the department is now limiting the number of how many can retire each week. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why? The police have a target on their backs and they know it. They're being told to stand down and they're not being given any guidance on the new law passed by the City Council. I actually told you about a hero two weeks ago, a Deputy Inspector and Precinct Commander, ironically from the 46th Precinct known as the Alamo, who retired because he was not given any guidance as to how his officers should respond in light of the new limitations on their ability to arrest. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The irony here is rich. The 46th Precinct that he left known as the Alamo was dubbed in the 1980s as the most dangerous square mile in America. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the new rules restrict police actions regarding arrests and what part of the defendant's body they're allowed to touch. Picture this -- 35,000 New York City police officers each with a gun, not one -- not one has been trained on how to effectuate an arrest under the new guidelines where you can and cannot touch the perp. Police will face certain prosecution if the arrest is not made properly. De Blasio also disbanded the Anti-Crime Undercover Unit which directs undercovers to areas where crime occurs pursuant to a Comstat, which is a colorblind pinpoint screen that identifies crime concentrations that help drive down the city's crime rate and literally revolutionize policing around the world. Now, no more stop, question, frisk. No more police concentration in those crime ridden areas and the ones most afraid, the minority community in the inner cities who live with crime day and night. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You ask the black and Hispanic clergy, they are terrified of what is to come. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The cops that were protecting them are gone. They've been told to stand down. They can't engage. They can't touch suspects. And I've been told repeatedly now by NYPD cops that if a suspect resists, the cops will let them go because they haven't been trained on what to do in that circumstance. The rookie school has been canceled. Morale is down. And for many, the exit from the NYPD cannot come soon enough. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But it gets even worse. Democrat de Blasio and his ilk are working together to defeat law enforcement totally. Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, you remember him, the one who forced nursing homes to take corona infected patients, thus leading to the deaths of the highest number of seniors in the country. He signs a bill giving everyone involved immunity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He's pushed for no cash bail, so-called bail reform, as a result of which most defendants are released as soon as the paperwork is done. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Add New York City Democrat District Attorney Cy Vance to this trifecta. Vance pushed for all crime to have no cash bail. And in an interoffice memo, he instructed his assistant DAs to go soft or dismiss cases against protesters, and instead told his prosecutors to be proactive and build cases against the cops who arrested the protesters. These three Democrats create a recipe for a return of New York City to the crime ridden 80s when the headlines looked like this. This one from this week. It doesn't look so different, does it? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Consider this. For 40 years, New York City education and social services budget was more than half of the total city budget. The NYPD previously at eight percent is now five percent. The correlation of defunding police and the increase in homicides is predictable. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In fact, already homicides have skyrocketed. There is a 206 percent increase in shooting victims last week, over the same week, last year. And if you're not angry enough, take a listen to this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. Let's get right to it. My open. Do you feel safe? Do you feel safe? I live in New York and something has happened that is as predictable as the sun rising tomorrow morning. New York City, once the safest big city in America, one of the world's major commercial, financial and cultural centers will revert to the crime ridden days of the 1980s. Not just New York, soon major cities near you will return to their troubled days of lawlessness. Whether you are right or left, believe me. Understand this. Lawlessness without police equals crime and murder. The safest big city, New York is now regressing to the bygone days of graffiti, drugs, gangs, guns, murder and mayhem. And you can thank one man -- one man -- Warren Wilhelm, Jr, known today as Bill de Blasio. This is the face of the return of crime. This is the face of the man who without a doubt is the most incompetent, inefficient and inept mayor to darken the halls of Gracie Mansion. His response to the May 25 murder of George Floyd like everyone else was outrage. But his answer to the George Floyd murder was to let New York City burn. He cut the NYPD's budget by $1 billion. He supported a Police Reform Bill that tied the hands of police with no training under these new restrictions, and he ordered stand downs while crimes occurred across the city. But then again, he's always had a problem with the police. I said it three years ago."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "De Blasio's anti-cop sentiments are deep rooted, in 2014 when two cops were assaulted and seriously injured on the Brooklyn Bridge as protesters chanted, \"What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want them? Now.\" He called the protesters throwing garbage cans and bottles at police peaceful protesters. He normalized police hatred, telling us that he told his son to be cautious of police."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Now, as New York City devolves into chaos, de Blasio turns a blind eye. Macy's flagship store in Herald Square was looted by criminals, not protesters, criminals breaking in with hammers and coming out with stolen goods. Arsonist and looters on Fifth Avenue hit an empty Chanel, Gucci Balmain. The universal question -- where were the police? Where are the arrests? Where are the perp walks? I'll tell you. The police were given a stand down to not engage and a minimal number of cops were deployed. The upshot. As cops stand down, criminals become emboldened and as for you, taxes will clearly go up not just for the cleanup, but because businesses can no longer afford nor would they necessarily want to be in a city where they are not protected from crime. In fact, one high end New York City store is suing for failing to stop the looting. The owner of that store says that after paying taxes, the city owed a duty to the stores to protect them. He says that the city had Intelligence, but did nothing about it. He, like many New Yorkers believes his taxes go to the NYPD and that the police were told to stand down. But the big stores were not the only stores. Looters stormed small businesses, many minority owned, many shuttered now for good because of the protesters. Since George Floyd's death, more than 700 police officers have retired from the NYPD and the department is now limiting the number of how many can retire each week. Why? The police have a target on their backs and they know it. They're being told to stand down and they're not being given any guidance on the new law passed by the City Council. I actually told you about a hero two weeks ago, a Deputy Inspector and Precinct Commander, ironically from the 46th Precinct known as the Alamo, who retired because he was not given any guidance as to how his officers should respond in light of the new limitations on their ability to arrest. The irony here is rich. The 46th Precinct that he left known as the Alamo was dubbed in the 1980s as the most dangerous square mile in America. And the new rules restrict police actions regarding arrests and what part of the defendant's body they're allowed to touch. Picture this -- 35,000 New York City police officers each with a gun, not one -- not one has been trained on how to effectuate an arrest under the new guidelines where you can and cannot touch the perp. Police will face certain prosecution if the arrest is not made properly. De Blasio also disbanded the Anti-Crime Undercover Unit which directs undercovers to areas where crime occurs pursuant to a Comstat, which is a colorblind pinpoint screen that identifies crime concentrations that help drive down the city's crime rate and literally revolutionize policing around the world. Now, no more stop, question, frisk. No more police concentration in those crime ridden areas and the ones most afraid, the minority community in the inner cities who live with crime day and night. You ask the black and Hispanic clergy, they are terrified of what is to come. The cops that were protecting them are gone. They've been told to stand down. They can't engage. They can't touch suspects. And I've been told repeatedly now by NYPD cops that if a suspect resists, the cops will let them go because they haven't been trained on what to do in that circumstance. The rookie school has been canceled. Morale is down. And for many, the exit from the NYPD cannot come soon enough. But it gets even worse. Democrat de Blasio and his ilk are working together to defeat law enforcement totally. Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, you remember him, the one who forced nursing homes to take corona infected patients, thus leading to the deaths of the highest number of seniors in the country. He signs a bill giving everyone involved immunity. He's pushed for no cash bail, so-called bail reform, as a result of which most defendants are released as soon as the paperwork is done. Add New York City Democrat District Attorney Cy Vance to this trifecta. Vance pushed for all crime to have no cash bail. And in an interoffice memo, he instructed his assistant DAs to go soft or dismiss cases against protesters, and instead told his prosecutors to be proactive and build cases against the cops who arrested the protesters. These three Democrats create a recipe for a return of New York City to the crime ridden 80s when the headlines looked like this. This one from this week. It doesn't look so different, does it? Consider this. For 40 years, New York City education and social services budget was more than half of the total city budget. The NYPD previously at eight percent is now five percent. The correlation of defunding police and the increase in homicides is predictable. In fact, already homicides have skyrocketed. There is a 206 percent increase in shooting victims last week, over the same week, last year. And if you're not angry enough, take a listen to this."

I thought the black community was particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus? And what about all you guilt bullies? The ones who told us that if we go out that we're going to infect Grandma. So, is it okay for protesters to get grandma sick, but the rest of us can't? So Bill, you've decided to take away my safety, my protection, my security, my business and my liberty. I've got news for you. You don't have that right. You took an oath to support the Constitution and as a public official, the first order of government is the protection of its citizens. You don't have the right to tell the police to stand down and to violate the oath that they took. You don't have the right to tell cops who want to go out to protect and defend us that they're not allowed to exercise their authority. And I don't care what your Marxist leftist socialist comrades tell you. This is the United States of America, and in the United States of America, we outlaw crime, and we pay police to support law and order. You, Mr. De Blasio, by not supporting law and order are a menace to law abiding, taxpaying residents of New York City. You are so out of sync with the rest of us and so far from the fundamental values upon which this country was founded, that the best thing that can happen to you is that you be impeached and crawl back into your Marxist leftist socialist hole.

Judge, you realize most of this self-observed crime by police officers where they see it. It is not by uniformed police officers. Why? Because you don't commit a crime in front of a uniformed cop. You commit in front of a guy in plain clothes because you don't know he is a cop. Then they stop it. They were the ones taking these people off the streets. They disbanded that. Years ago, they dismantled street crime. Now they're engaged in -- they're doing this use of force guidelines, where it's like you have to give a guy a massage before you can arrest them now.

You're not allowed to use any kind of a body weight restraint. Do you have any idea how absurd that is? I spent decades of my life in control tactics in the Secret Service and the NYPD? When someone doesn't want to be arrested, I watched -- I'm not kidding. I know we're short on time now. I watched a 12-year-old girl in a Brooklyn Hospital nearly take out two ESU cops, SWAT cops in New York because she did not want to be taken. That's not a joke and it was not a reflection on the cops. She did not want to be taken. She was a 12-year-old girl. They had to restrain her. Tell me how you're going to handle that with a 30-year-old? A 220-pound guy on drugs? What are you going to do? You're going to massage his neck and give him a head rub before you lock them up? What planet does de Blasio live on? Why would a cop arrest anyone? Have a nice day sir, you don't want to get arrested. Hard pass. Take off. See you later."

Police officers, we should be able to handle ourselves. We should be trained. But let's make no mistake here. It's the bad guy that determines the use of force, not the cop. If a cop acts out and he does something he shouldn't do, there are CCRB complaints and some of them will be put in jail like the guy in the George Floyd case. But the bad guy determines the use of force and when you're fighting for your life, you can throw all that fancy crap and training manuals.

And of course, parents should be empowered with in-person instruction option at public school with the sanitation and requisite social distancing and testing that is necessary to ensure that that, in fact, is a safe environment. But we should also do more to make sure that parents can keep more of their own money to raise and educate their own kids how they choose. Education should not be a government run monopoly, and we should end the war that's gone on between public instruction and homeschooling for far too long."

What does that mean? You go part time and then other kids go the rest of the time? How does -- how does this impact kids in their learning?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "We've seen a real impact to learning and learning gains as a consequence of coronavirus. Digital learning is not an end all be all, and when you don't have in-person instruction for some students, there really is an impact. So, we've seen innovations like block scheduling, for example used before, but in Florida, we're going to use sentinel testing and surveillance testing to make sure that we catch outbreaks sooner. And then we're going to improve the physical plant of schools so that we have more hand washing stations and sanitation stations, because ultimately, we've got to protect not only the students, but we've got to protect the teachers and instructors as well. But the answer isn't just to wave the white flag of surrender. Instead, we should innovate. We should ensure that we've got more access to charter schools and private schools and even homeschooling. That'll take some of the pressure off of public schools and allow us to achieve our learning objectives."

      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "There may be some teachers that need the opportunity to retire early. Of course, we don't want people to make choices that they feel are unsafe. But I think with the right amount of testing on the front end, with the right amount of, I think, sanitation and social distance where applicable, we can keep teachers safe and we can ensure that students are not vectors for the disease. One thing we've learned during coronavirus is that young people who do not fear the disease are not going to comply with lockdowns and sheltering in place orders. And so, if they're going to be out and about, let's make sure they're learning and getting something of value as a consequence."

These are anarchists come out, and I believe that's a church right there, they just come out and decide they're going to destroy something. Where did they get the right?

There are more than a half a dozen Antifa members from up in Portland that are going to be facing a Federal judge and I think prison time as a consequence of organizing these things. But the great irony, Judge Jeanine, is that the organizers of Black Lives Matter who pledge allegiance to the destruction of America have a lot more in common with the Confederate generals that they hate than they would like to admit because it was in fact, the Confederacy that initially wanted to kick out Federal officials who wanted to destroy America and change it to something different. I think America was worth defending in the 1860s, and she is certainly worth defending today."

Kennedy. The list is endless. The amazing thing is the only original thought he seems to have had is when he claimed that he went through college on a full ride scholarship and carried a double major and all these other things he didn't do.

But what does it tell you about the economic plan, too? Is this an admission that number one, you know, he knows that the economy is President Trump's strong point?

You look at his history, with the exception of helping Hunter Biden make a lot of money when he was overseeing Ukraine and China, the fact is, this is somebody who has never been an executive, who has never led or made anything who, you know, still has his 1960s Corvette, but he bought it with government revenue. This is somebody who's become quite rich, but in fact has never done what President Trump has done, which is build an industry, understand industry, understand the economy. You know, President Trump doesn't need a fancy plan that he got from somebody else to say the basics of lowering the impediments to growth have created the Trump economy that brought us to great prosperity, and that as we get through this pandemic, will bring us back to great prosperity. That's what the President is selling because that's what he knows how to do."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it was courageous, and it's classic Donald Trump. President Trump looks at an injustice. He looks at many people who were caught up, snared by Mueller in a false investigation that there but for the political witch hunt, the President would not have been there. And he looks and says at 67 years old, when people are being released from prison in massive accounts, this first time offender, who, in fact is only going to jail because he was involved with the President. They couldn't get the President. And so he commutes it. But he doesn't do it the way President Clinton did it on the last day in office, you know, so that it has no political effect. He does it in front of everyone and says it wasn't right. And that's why I'm commuting the sentence. He did the same thing to a great extent with Michael Flynn and others. But he also did it with a great many people, African-Americans and others with his Criminal Justice Reform. This is a President who has used commutation pardon and legislation to bring fairness to the system as he sees it, and he is open and straightforward and honest about it. He doesn't do it you know, after an election in the dark of night. He does it straight forward because that's the kind of person he is."

You know, Dave, this letter to me is fascinating, because you have all of these liberals who are saying, you know, we refuse any false choice between justice and freedom. We cannot have an intolerant society and they go on and on in this letter about you know, that people have to accept opposing views. I just find that hysterical because as someone on the right, we've had our views censored for several years now. What's your take on this?"

However, most of the people on there who are lefties, liberals, progressives, whatever you want to call them. They've been pretty much silent as the mob has come for anyone that's right leaning. I mean, we know right now what during this show that there are people at Media Matters who are waiting for you, Judge Jeanine or me to say one word wrong so that they can send a mob and try to cancel advertisers. They do this with Tucker. They do this with everyone on the right. And it's like, where were you guys? So what's happening now is that although it's late, it's like they're suddenly seeing their universities crumble because Princeton and Harvard and Yale, they're all having massive problems. We all see it. And we know that all the statues are coming down as you were talking about earlier, and they're suddenly going, oh, the mob is starting to show up to my university and take down my statues and they may show up at my house. So, I better speak up. But I have to tell them, it's a little too late. And I'll just say one other thing which is, a couple of the people on the list have tried to cancel me.

We're stronger united, aren't we?"

And that's what actually my whole book and my political evolution is about, because I was on the left and then as I saw the left failing consistently on free speech, failing to stand up for the liberal principles that it purported to believe in. What I suddenly found was, whoa, look at this. There's all of these people on the right, these conservatives and libertarians who I may have some political disagreements with. That's fine. You read my book, you know, we disagree on some stuff, but that's okay. But what do we believe in? We believe in the Constitution. We believe in free speech. We believe in free expression. We believe in capitalism. We believe that fundamentally America is a good experiment and that's all it is. It's an ongoing experiment. And yes, I think they're really afraid of being called conservative. That in liberal circles that is still the scariest thing. Oh, you're suddenly friends with conservatives. You must be a conservative. And they've got to get over that because the ivory tower is crumbling, and it's going to crumble right on top of their heads."

They don't want to hear people on the right. I never heard people on the right say, I don't want to hear from that person. I don't think that they should be allowed to speak at my child's university. I mean -- and we know from the time that Donald Trump was elected, that you become -- you know, people unfriend you. They don't want you to be -- they don't want to communicate with you. People I've had at my wedding don't talk to -- my children's weddings, actually, they don't talk to me anymore. And it's not usually the right or the left. I mean, the intolerance is on the left.

It all kind of sounds right. Everyone I disagree with is a racist. Well, that sounds pretty good. That's pretty lofty. Once you accept those ideas, you know that if you then walk away from it, you will be called a racist. So it's almost a self-hostage situation. But you know, you also hit on something which is that in the letter, the implication was, oh, well, we're not on the right. The right still has these problems. I don't think there was one Trump supporter on there. It's like if you really want to be for a plurality of opinions, couldn't you have found one Trump supporter or one really staunch conservative that you would have believed to have signed on to that thing?

And you know, as far as I'm concerned, in Clay County, the people who have the most skin in the game or vested and invested in the success of the county are the people who live in the county and what we've been experiencing across this country are individuals who don't live in a certain area.

There was a search warrant that was executed today where there was a seizure of the AR-15 that you can see on the screen, and apparently the handgun is in possession of the attorney.
