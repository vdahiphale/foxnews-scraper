White House -- White House lawyer Ty Cobb is out. He retires at the end of the month. Emmet Flood is in. You might remember he represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment. Those changes come as former Trump attorney John Dowd reveals Mueller's team raised the prospect of issuing a grand jury subpoena to compel the president to testify under oath if he doesn't willingly sit down to talk. Current Trump lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, says if there's a sit down there will be limits.

The same exact argument that the Republicans are making today against the justice department for not releasing documents, it's a mirror image of what happened back in 2007 and 2008.

What bothers me most about this is that the investigation, the media, and the Democrats, all appear to be working in tandem. It's like I said yesterday, it's like the Iran deal, the Democrats push the message, the media spreads the message, the investigation broadens. It's a self-perpetuating echo chamber. And what is the echo in that chamber? Unseat and impeach. Instead of a counter vision to -- which requires ideas from Democrats provide to the media, they're relying on the ouster switch. We have to get rid of this guy and this is the way to do it, which is disturbing. But, to your point, we're probably in one of the most optimistic periods of recent history because we're watching the absence of ISIS videos. We're watching the absence of a North Korean nuclear threat. We're looking at a strong economy and declining crime overall, which is kind of interesting. So, what --have they actually planned this out? They don't have to plan it out.

Because I don't think I've ever seen the word \"cured\" in a highfalutin medical journal. Usually, it's \"significantly improves,\" but never \"cures.\" Now the study was small, 26 patients, but the message is big. When a substance has a real affect, meaning it changes you, it also frightens people. Drugs like ecstasy are illegal because they work, and when things work, they are hijacked for other purposes -- to have fun, for example. And then people die from taking too much. And that's when the law breaks in and bans it. This has happened to many substances that could have helped millions of people. Just decades ago, MDMA showed real promise in psychotherapy. Then it got banned. But times are changing. We realize it's absurd to punish the substance and the patient because the substance has potential for abuse. Instead, let scientists test them on various hard-to-treat illnesses. You want a crazy example? Try botulinum toxin. It's a substance that's deadly. Yet instead of reporting its lethality, newscasters shoot it into their faces, because it reduces wrinkles when used wisely. It's poison! Other drugs, like Special K, are now being tested on depression. Pot is also being tried on PTSD, as well. So with scientific study comes progress and relief. So why not send a drug down that path instead of leaving it on the street? All right. You know what I think is smart, Dana? If you look at a lot of these studies, it's the choice of the patient.

I think Rudy Giuliani is actually putting some really good parameters and limits on it to say we want to cooperate. We want to talk. Let sit down. Let's limit the time scope and let's have a discussion ahead of time, sort of, meetings of the minds in terms of how it should be conducted, and then the president will cooperate and answer the questions. Now, that sounds quite reasonable, right? That's not something that's -- tweets being fired off or this or that, or any kind of thing, back and forth. They want to answer those questions. And I think what's particularly important what he said, Rudy Giuliani said as long as they have an open mind to be able to listen to the president, have already jumped to a foregone conclusion that Comey is telling the truth, that the president is not, then they're willing to sit down--"

What signal does it sent to you?"

And we were having that U.S. attorney situation where the Democrats were demanding all these documents from us. We were trying to produce them as fast as we could. The same exact argument that the Republicans are making today against the justice department for not releasing documents, it's a mirror image of what happened back in 2007 and 2008. So, I think that Emmett is a much more assertive and aggressive type of person. He knows special counsel law extremely well. I think there's the feeling that the original team was too accommodating to the Mueller investigation. And I don't know what this will change -- I think when Rudy Giuliani says that this would be a two hour interview and we'll have to see, the narrow scope, I think that's probably what Emmet Flood talked to them about. Apparently, Jay Sekulow was the one who did a lot of interviewing with Emmet to get to this point. But I also think that we kind of forget, it was about five weeks ago, that Don McGahn, the president's White House counsel, said that he'd like to be gone by the summer. That he would stay until he found his replacement, and that could extend to the midterm. But, Emmet Flood, I think, we'll end up being the White House counsel before the end of the summer."

I mean, I think two hours is way too long. I don't think he should have given them any time. Just do it in writing somehow. What bothers me most about this is that the investigation, the media, and the Democrats, all appear to be working in tandem. It's like I said yesterday, it's like the Iran deal, the Democrats push the message, the media spreads the message, the investigation broadens. It's a self-perpetuating echo chamber. And what is the echo in that chamber? Unseat and impeach. Instead of a counter vision to -- which requires ideas from Democrats provide to the media, they're relying on the ouster switch. We have to get rid of this guy and this is the way to do it, which is disturbing. But, to your point, we're probably in one of the most optimistic periods of recent history because we're watching the absence of ISIS videos. We're watching the absence of a North Korean nuclear threat. We're looking at a strong economy and declining crime overall, which is kind of interesting. So, what --have they actually planned this out? They don't have to plan it out. They could just try to impeach the guy, but they should actually think about the long term, what does it mean to the country? What does it mean to half the country? What does it mean to the world? This is not just an attack on the United States. It's the world that's getting less violent. It's the world that's becoming safer because of a reduced North Korean threat and destruction of terrorists groups. It's about the world. Aren't we supposed to be thinking globally?"

I mean, as a lawyer, former prosecutor, that's what you do. It's OK. No problem. Let's go over this. What's significant to you? And I think it makes the president look good to show that he has a reasonable person trying to, in fact, work and cooperate with the other side, because the president's position has been there's no collusion, and I did not obstruct, and I haven't done anything wrong. I'm frustrated by this. OK. Well, therefore, both sides are going to sit down and talk. And you can't just put the President of the United States in with unfettered questions, with no time frame, or no, you know, end game, et cetera. That would be ridiculous. No lawyer would do that. So, Rudy Giuliani has a lot of experience in this. He has a team that he feels comfortable working with. That is also very important. And, I think this is a good sign.

And he's a good public servant and the president chose a good person there, even though they might be frustrated that this investigation is going on. I think, obviously, Rod Rosenstein has the country's best interests in mind, and he has done well by the president, doing the initial firing in the first place with the memo that he wrote. So, I think, what's happening is -- our founding fathers knew about this a long time ago. We've got three branches of government, and they're equal branches and they're going to have to fight it out.

She's one of their top, top, if not number one, you know, fund-raisers, bringing donors together, party message, party direction, party leaders, people that are put in power or candidates that are favored.

But this is not your typical Republican president, because he's probably going to want to work with Nancy if she's the house speaker. He'll wheel and deal with crying Chuck, and that's going to make a lot of people angry on the right. You could get good things done, you can get bad things done, who knows what's going to happen. But, I don't think it's a done deal that the Democrats take the house, and here's why. They have the coalition in place, but I don't think the coalition is solidified. I think millennial support for Democrats is down ten points over the last year or so. Blacks don't usually turn out as much in the midterm elections. I think single white women, college educated, they're really going to turn out. I think Hispanics are going to turn out. But they're broke, the DNC has about $6 million cash on hand, $4 million in debt. The RNC has $40 million cash on hand. So, there's a lot of wild cards, Mueller, North Korea, who knows what's going to happen? But if you get Republican candidates that support the Trump agenda but are still kind of independent of Trump and will dismiss his style if it doesn't play in the district, I think they can do OK."

Like, it's going to be hard for women to compete against transgendered individuals. And that's where I think this kind of like is going. And, what other distinctions can you blur?

And it's heavily in the black community, heavily Hispanic community but it's also now, I think, more than a third of white children. So when you asked me that question, it does touch a nerve, because I think you need role models, and you need a sense of an older male talking to a younger male about behavior and standards and how you deal with women, for example. But you know, actually, when I heard the story, I was concerned more about, you know, my granddaughters, or girls losing their space. Because I know, like, for example, I went to an all-male college. We had an all-female college next door. This is Haverford and Bryn Mawr. And Haverford went coed subsequently. No problem. Bryn Mawr, though, never went coed. And you noticed the seven sisters, they don't go coed. It's all the boys' schools that went coed. And I think it -- you ask why they don't go coed, because girls have their space. They don't have to always be dealing with men in a male-dominated environment. We live in a male-dominated culture. So here's an opportunity for women to talk about sexual harassment. How do you get -- how do you make progress in the workplace? How do you get -- how do you deal with your own physical self as a woman without having men in your presence all the time?"

      "utterance": "According to a new study, soldiers with PTSD using the illegal drug known as MDMA or ecstasy cured the conditions within weeks. This is key. Because I don't think I've ever seen the word \"cured\" in a highfalutin medical journal. Usually, it's \"significantly improves,\" but never \"cures.\" Now the study was small, 26 patients, but the message is big. When a substance has a real affect, meaning it changes you, it also frightens people. Drugs like ecstasy are illegal because they work, and when things work, they are hijacked for other purposes -- to have fun, for example. And then people die from taking too much. And that's when the law breaks in and bans it. This has happened to many substances that could have helped millions of people. Just decades ago, MDMA showed real promise in psychotherapy. Then it got banned. But times are changing. We realize it's absurd to punish the substance and the patient because the substance has potential for abuse. Instead, let scientists test them on various hard-to-treat illnesses. You want a crazy example? Try botulinum toxin. It's a substance that's deadly. Yet instead of reporting its lethality, newscasters shoot it into their faces, because it reduces wrinkles when used wisely. It's poison! Other drugs, like Special K, are now being tested on depression. Pot is also being tried on PTSD, as well. So with scientific study comes progress and relief. So why not send a drug down that path instead of leaving it on the street? All right. You know what I think is smart, Dana? If you look at a lot of these studies, it's the choice of the patient. If you use veterans, people have an innate sense, Democrats and Republicans, that we owe it to them."

And now it's getting a second look because of this. The brain scanning imagery is so much more detailed. You can see, if it's MDMA or a small dosage of LSD, what effect that has on the brain, and it gives the scientists and the medical professionals a more accurate read on what it's actually accomplishing. I think every option should be on the table. If it's a therapy dog, if it's psychotherapy, hyperbaric chambers, medical marijuana, MDMA. Let's get it all fixed.

Says when people complained about it, \"Hey, I'm conservative. Get over it, folks.\" But I thought, boy, I don't -- I'm not thinking that a lot of conservatives -- and gun owners are going to take to this. In fact, we've heard -- or he's heard from gun owners who object."

On his bio at the WWE, it says he' a monstrous abomination that seems to have been extracted directly from your childhood nightmares. That could be for his political opponents. Anyway, so he's running for mayor. Looks likely it's going to be a good race."

Rashon Nelson and Dante Robinson will get any of the money from the grant. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney says he's pleased to make the deal and have something good come out of what was a messy situation."

She immigrated to the United States from Cuba. And she was just 16 when she beat out 25,000 other business students to launch her own business, PopsyCakes. And it's the world's first cupcake on a pretzel. But the best part it's giving back, because it has partnerships with Jenny McCarthy's foundation, Generation Rescue, support to families of children on the autism spectrum; Alex's Lemonade Stand, which is dedicated to fundraising for cancer research. So thank you guys for sending this over. We had a little surprise for you guys. We passed them around. One made each in your likeness."
