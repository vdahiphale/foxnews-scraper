Hassan Rouhani telling the United Nations General Assembly security in the Persian Gulf can be guaranteed only when his nation's security is as well. And he says Iran will not negotiate on the issue of its nuclear program as long as sanctions remain in place. Many western nations are blaming Iran for a recent attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities. However, Turkish President Recep Erdogan is not. He is urging restraint. He made that comment to me during an interview yesterday at the UN."

When I was listening to President Trump, that's what I was trying to understand, the idea. I'm strong, I'm powerful, so I'm right. That shouldn't be the case. Sanctions have been accustomed to and sanctions have been avoided in the past. To what extent can we proceed with sanctions? We are here today and gone tomorrow specifically because we are neighbors with Iran. And I for one, know that sanctions have never solved anything."

The New York Post had an analysis in which it said, under President Erdogan, Turkey has become a permissive jurisdiction for rogue regimes and their illicit bankers. It goes on to say that Tehran relies on Turkish banks and dual Iranian Turkish gold traders, calling it the biggest sanctions evasion scheme in recent history, says in Venezuela, the Maduro regime is using Turkish based companies and the money laundering network to get around sanctions. And that the Assad regime in Syria owns an extensive network of companies in Turkey enabling Syria to circumvent U.S. sanctions.

We've always cooperated, and we will always cooperate with international authorities. These actions have been very significantly taken and we expect the same thing from our allies. Terrorist organizations such as Fattal and PPK are roaming freely in the West. I wonder what is the United States doing about these terrorist organizations. Are they extraditing these terrorists to us? No. For example, here, the Kurdish YPG terrorist organization extensions are present. We want them to be extradited to Turkey. And the leader of Fatah is currently living in Pennsylvania, living on a land of 400 acres. And he is running his global network quite freely from Pennsylvania."

All of the voice recordings have been shared with the Saudi Arabian authorities. I have spoken to the king and the crown prince more than once, and they pledged that there would be a conclusion to this. But still, no steps have been taken forward. Jamal Khashoggi is no ordinary person. He is a colleague of yours. And he has a very respectable position in the world of media. And he has interviewed me more than once. I know him closely. And this happened in my country. How am I not going to follow up on that? Of course, I'm going to follow up on that. This is our responsibility. We can't let this get away or else we won't establish justice."

I have listened to the tape conversations that went on and someone was saying, oh, I know how to slice up. I know how to slice up good. I know how to cut. And this person is a person involved in forensics. And if I'm not mistaken, he was a colonel. This is one of the closest individuals in a core group and they committed these deeds there at the consulate general. And unfortunately, after that, Jamal Khashoggi was cut into pieces and was taken away. The impression of my colleagues working in the intelligence agency are exactly that. These are the responsibilities of the judiciary in Saudi Arabia and the authorities in Saudi Arabia."

I am the President of the Republic of Turkey, and nobody can even dare to put that blame on me. They should first clear away this mess. What they did was to kill an individual who is a Saudi Arabian citizen, and they should identify the perpetrators who came to Turkey on board two airplanes.

Hundreds more have been prosecuted as terrorists, many without evidence. This is all according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

Our eventual goal is to expand the economic relations between Turkey and the United States and increase the trade volume between the two countries up to $100 billion. The region has very urgent problems to be settled. That's why these meetings are of crucial significance."

Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERDOGAN",
      "utterance": "The approach with regards to this acquisition from Russia was never perceived as a threat by me because we wish to acquire U.S. Patriot missiles during President Obama's time in office. But we were told that the Congress would not allow such a transaction to take place, so we were left without Patriots. Then when President Trump took office, I wanted to acquire Patriots as well. But now we are still unable to acquire or possess Patriots. When it comes to national defense, we are in a position to be able to cater to our needs, and that's why we've agreed with Russia on these grounds, because the conditions were quite suitable for our needs. For every U.S. aircraft that was not delivered to Turkey, we are losing $7,000,000, and four or five aircraft were on the brink of delivery, but at the very last minute the delivery was halted. And I don't think it's very becoming of a strategic partnership, and I don't think it's the right way to go."
