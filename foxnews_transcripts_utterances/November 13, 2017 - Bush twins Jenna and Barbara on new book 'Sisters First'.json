We'll be leaving the Philippines tomorrow after many days of constant meetings and work in order to MAGA. My promises are rapidly being fulfilled. The president also teasing a major announcement for Wednesday when he's home on North Korea and the outcome of his trade negotiations.

But when he did then address the Putin stuff on camera there, he makes a gesture that makes it clear that he kind of gets the situation better than when he's like offhandedly talking about it or in tweets because you could tell that -- OK, the distinction without a difference, there is actually a distinction and that he understands it. But then he's trying to figure out some way, I guess he believes, that he has to do this in order to work with Russia on many important issues, including North Korea, Iran, Syria, and there's other multiplying issues around Russia, including the old one like Ukraine. I think that trip was excellent for relationship building. There was no drama. I think that the Asian countries were happy because pretty much the headlines were just -- there was not a lot there. I do think if he has a chance to go back at them, these issues about human rights are important, and he is the best person in the world to talk about them. He does it well. When he gave a speech at the U.N. and he was talking about the plight of the North Korean people, for example. Well, there are human that -- there human rights conditions that are important to address no matter where you're in the world. The president of the United States is in a unique position to do that.

      "sentences": "My favorite part of the trip is the tweets he sent to North Korea. After little Kim called him an old lunatic, Trump goes, hey, I never called you short and fat. That's funny. But what's funnier is the meltdown among the left and the humorless schooled that celebrities and comedians have become. I mean, I always talk about the Wormer effect, that's the head of the college in Animal House. He was humorless and mean. That's always the Republican. And the liberals are always the people having fun. Trump has flipped this. So now whatever he does something everybody acts like dewormer. They're absolutely like apoplectic about a very funny tweet that actually lightened the tension. That was a joke that actually probably would make that little fat tyrant laugh. The other thing too about this trip is that it brings up all the cognitive biases of both sides. So if you don't like Trump then you see everything as proof of his evil disposition. Like if he appears to be soft on Putin, it's because he likes strongmen, because he's just a jerk. But if you like Trump, you seem him as dealing in circumstances. He's saying like this is a weird world, different world, and you've got to get along with these people because ISIS has created a new spectrum of evil. For example, Duterte, he's a thug. He's made disgusting jokes, terrible jokes. He personally bragged about killing people. But ISIS has created a new spectrum of evil where Duterte used to be here but ISIS came along. So now maybe you've got to use this guy, Rodrigo, to deal with the worse evil because ISIS makes everybody look bad. It's redefined our spectrum of evil. So I think that Trump dealing with Putin and dealing with Duterte, I think that's how you say it, reflects a greater idea that he has about evil in the world. He knows that these guys may not be the greatest people, they might be thugs, but for now, we have to use them in order to fight this existential apocalyptic evil which is terror.",

I thought it might take even more heat because they like to read into -- he's best friends. Remember during the debate with Hillary Clinton, it's like he's by best friend. Maybe now, I don't know.

Yankah writes, quote, I will have to discuss with my boys whether they can truly be friends with white people.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" President Trump now on the final leg of his jam-packed 12 day trip to Asia, proud to give a progress report to the American people this morning, great day of bilateral meetings at the ASEAN Summit on trade which we are turning around to be great deals for our country. We'll be leaving the Philippines tomorrow after many days of constant meetings and work in order to MAGA. My promises are rapidly being fulfilled. The president also teasing a major announcement for Wednesday when he's home on North Korea and the outcome of his trade negotiations. And he's attempted to come, clear up some confusion about whether he accepts Vladimir Putin's denials that Russia meddled with our elections."
    },

      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election. As to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership. I believe in our intel agencies, our intelligence agencies. President Putin really feels, and he feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our elections. What he believes is what he believes. What I believe is that we have to get to work. Getting along with other nations is a good thing. Not a bad thing. Believe me."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Believe me. Dana, we were saying on Friday how flawless of a trip this was, and he held the mainstream media vultures at bay for the most part until this last comment or comments about Russia and Putin, how do you think he did?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I would say the trip was definitely a net positive for the president. And that positive -- one of the reasons he held the media at bay is because he physically held them at bay. They didn't have a lot of chance to talk to him. But when he did then address the Putin stuff on camera there, he makes a gesture that makes it clear that he kind of gets the situation better than when he's like offhandedly talking about it or in tweets because you could tell that -- OK, the distinction without a difference, there is actually a distinction and that he understands it. But then he's trying to figure out some way, I guess he believes, that he has to do this in order to work with Russia on many important issues, including North Korea, Iran, Syria, and there's other multiplying issues around Russia, including the old one like Ukraine. I think that trip was excellent for relationship building. There was no drama. I think that the Asian countries were happy because pretty much the headlines were just -- there was not a lot there. I do think if he has a chance to go back at them, these issues about human rights are important, and he is the best person in the world to talk about them. He does it well. When he gave a speech at the U.N. and he was talking about the plight of the North Korean people, for example. Well, there are human that -- there human rights conditions that are important to address no matter where you're in the world. The president of the United States is in a unique position to do that. And I think he does well with the media and he should not keep them at bay so much."

    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "My favorite part of the trip is the tweets he sent to North Korea. After little Kim called him an old lunatic, Trump goes, hey, I never called you short and fat. That's funny. But what's funnier is the meltdown among the left and the humorless schooled that celebrities and comedians have become. I mean, I always talk about the Wormer effect, that's the head of the college in Animal House. He was humorless and mean. That's always the Republican. And the liberals are always the people having fun. Trump has flipped this. So now whatever he does something everybody acts like dewormer. They're absolutely like apoplectic about a very funny tweet that actually lightened the tension. That was a joke that actually probably would make that little fat tyrant laugh. The other thing too about this trip is that it brings up all the cognitive biases of both sides. So if you don't like Trump then you see everything as proof of his evil disposition. Like if he appears to be soft on Putin, it's because he likes strongmen, because he's just a jerk. But if you like Trump, you seem him as dealing in circumstances. He's saying like this is a weird world, different world, and you've got to get along with these people because ISIS has created a new spectrum of evil. For example, Duterte, he's a thug. He's made disgusting jokes, terrible jokes. He personally bragged about killing people. But ISIS has created a new spectrum of evil where Duterte used to be here but ISIS came along. So now maybe you've got to use this guy, Rodrigo, to deal with the worse evil because ISIS makes everybody look bad. It's redefined our spectrum of evil. So I think that Trump dealing with Putin and dealing with Duterte, I think that's how you say it, reflects a greater idea that he has about evil in the world. He knows that these guys may not be the greatest people, they might be thugs, but for now, we have to use them in order to fight this existential apocalyptic evil which is terror."

And I think it really highlights, again, that he does extremely well when he travels internationally. This was, you know, a very long trip, but nevertheless, I think he accomplished a lot and he's getting out there, and he's at his best when you get to know him and have the time with him, one-on-one, interpersonal, especially with the world leaders. So he manages to be able to meet with the leaders in Asia, but also to be able to have the kind of face time with Vladimir Putin as well. So you know -- given the fact that this was already something that was kind of a highly volatile relationship in terms of the media, the way they've covered it, it actually ended up being OK, a lot better than I thought it would with the two of them having the personal interaction. I thought it might take even more heat because they like to read into -- he's best friends. Remember during the debate with Hillary Clinton, it's like he's by best friend. Maybe now, I don't know. They seem to be getting along. And then they have their little matching outfits."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "But I would say that the way I look at this trip, there're two things that he went to accomplish. One, North Korea. We're going into Asia and you've got to deal with the Chinese, and you've got to get help to stop North Korea. That would be number one goal. Number two, trade. Well, when I look at North Korea, I don't see anything. In fact, it looks to me like he failed to get, so far as I know, any of us know, Vladimir Putin to say I'm going to join with the Chinese in terms of enforcing some kind of embargo, sanctions on North Korea. To the contrary, Russia has been undermining us and undermining our policy. And the second thing, I say with regard to trade, the most stunning part was he leaves, and 11 other countries that were involved in the Trans- Pacific Partnership, the TPP, say, yeah, we'll do this deal. I will do it with China. I think, oh, my God. Wait a second. This is short-term thinking about sort of isolationism, and make America great again, and we are just ceding authority because authority conveys not only economic consequence but military control in Asia. And we are pulling back from that at the very consequential moment. So I have trouble with that. Now, the final thing to say is about Putin. He goes over there and he says to the world, oh, you know, I think Putin's feelings are a little hurt. He really -- says he didn't have anything to do with that. He didn't have any impact on the American election. And then invites the controversy you pick on the president say, oh, gee, the press they're always going after. You guys are so mean. But he said this, Jesse. And he goes and he says that our former head of CIA and national intelligence are a bunch of hacks. Wait a minute. Who side is he on?"

He was played by number of countries. And if you played America it's hard to do that with Trump, because Trump -- it's fairly transparent. We're all talking about it.

Ekow Yankah, a dad who poses this question in the wake of the summer violence in Charlottesville, quote, can my children be friends with white people, end quote. Yankah writes, quote, I will have to discuss with my boys whether they can truly be friends with white people. History has provided little reason for people of color to trust white people in this way, and these recent months have put in the starkest relief the contempt with which the country measures the value of racial minorities. So the reason this has caused quite a stir, as I grasp it, is that people see him as somehow caught up in Trump derangement syndrome for saying this. The Daily calls it and say, oh, he's just simply trying to shame white people for being white. Basically people are saying, well, especially on the conservative side, we don't buy it. What do you say, Greg?"

Meaning, like, if you take whites and blacks, there are more similarities between those two groups then the individuals within those groups. Probably because we're all human, in case we forgot. But the fact is, there could be comparatively large differences between these groups, but they still have more in common than the people within the group. You know this in your daily life. That you have somebody that you may be -- they may be white, they may be female, and there are differences. But compared to larger groups, group to group, they're very similar because we are human beings. This is a fact, a biological fact. And denying it."

I could see why some people on a lower socioeconomic level may feel that they, because of quotas, or affirmative action, or getting passed over for someone else when it comes to admissions or job openings based on race, I understand that. But I think in general, white people don't need to complain too much in this country. I feel sorry for this author. I feel sorry for his children. I take pity on this guy. To say your child should discriminate against innocent children because their white goes against everything America stands for. And then, it's exactly what Democrats say about Trump, is that Trump doesn't feel comfortable around people that look differently than they do. Imagine if the headline also was, should I let my children be friends with Muslims? Could you imagine that and the New York Times running that just because 0.0001 percent of Muslims turn out to be terrorists. It's crazy. The guy is conflating his false idea of Trump as a racist with all white people. And I can say as a white person, it's probably safe to say most white people don't walk around thinking about how they can wield power over black America. It does not happen, Juan. I can almost guarantee it. And this is what this guy says in the op-ed."

It's true, you do get the press. But I doubt it sells copies. First, GQ made Colin Kaepernick citizen of the year for obviously taking the knee. He got the press, but he drove NFL viewers away. GQ seems poised to copy him. Then there's Glamour. Glamour naming Linda Sarsour as one of their women of the year. Sarsour championed sharia law. And once brutally mocked women brave enough to challenge it, including a victim of female genital mutilation. How is that pro-woman? Who's doing Glamour's research? Hamas? So why would editors make such choices? Well, they're not just expressing admiration. They're desperate to publicly express their own moral correctness, elevating their position among their liberal peers. It's \"please see how aware I am of social justice issues.\" Such actions bring good feelings from the identity politics set, but it's a political sugar rush: the feeling fades fast, and then you're left alone and broke. Case in point, look at Teen Vogue, or don't look at it, after deciding to embrace progressive politics, they had to close its print edition, costing 80 jobs. All for a desperate stab at social relevance. I'd tell GQ to learn from that mistake, but judging from their past political stances, I doubt they'd listen. They put the ass in ascot. So anyway, what are your thoughts, Dana?"

But these awards don't mean anything anymore as they used to because you said in the monologue, the industry is dying. But what kind of citizen was Kaepernick this year? He didn't work. He was unemployed, and the only thing he did was sue the NFL. J.J. Watt, he, I think, raised $37 million for hurricane victims. That's a lot of money.

      "utterance": "So I'm a little different today. A major new museum opening in Washington, D.C., this week, already causing controversy. The 430,000 square-foot Museum of the Bible, one of the largest assemblies of biblical artifacts. It's funded in part by the founders of Hobby Lobby. And I'm sure you're going to member they were involved in the Supreme Court case over employers providing insurance coverage for contraception. But the museum's president says the institution has no sectarian or evangelical agenda. They just want to get people excited about the Bible. So with the holidays around the corner, I think you'd better get tickets early for this one, because believe me, from everything everybody is saying, it's an extravaganza of biblical proportions."

When you went to type \"I\" and it would turn into the \"A\" with the square? Yesterday fans at Ohio State decided to get back at Apple a little bit. When people started chanting O-H-I-O, which they usually do, \"Ohio,\" with the cards, they replaced the \"I\" with an \"A\" so that they could stick it in Apple's eye. Ohio State also trounced Michigan State, 48-3. So they had a good day all around."

When he finished, he said, \"I decided I would create the story of a veteran who was wounded and thrived from that. I think I accomplished the mission.\" He had a lifetime goal of raising a million dollars for veterans' charities, and as of this early Saturday afternoon, 812.2 mile run had raised roughly $135,000 so far for veterans groups. Well done, Rob. And we look forward to seeing what you do next."
