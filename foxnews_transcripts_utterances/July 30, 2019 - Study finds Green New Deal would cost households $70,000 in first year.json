So Michigan is part of the blue wall, something that President Trump tore down. Democrats have been frantically trying to get those voters back in their corner. The Trump tax cut, almost every single Democrat running against him has said they're going to repeal those. Put them back in place. Twenty five percent of people in Michigan -- or 25 percent of -- was the average tax cut in Michigan for the majority of the families there. That's a lot. There're almost 200,000 people who no longer paying the Obamacare individual mandate. Well, that's something that Joe Biden has talked about defending and bringing back. So I think when you look at the policy positions, they're going to be going after President Trump to try to keep the focus away from the infighting and the civil war going on with the left.

It is necessary for an opposition party to do this sort of thing that Trump is doing because -- usually, your side won't call you out. So Baltimore is an absolute mess and we know it, but the Democrats won't call it out because they're kind of calling themselves out, and they may not get the money. They might not keep getting the money if they actually fix things, so things stay broken that's OK. But the most -- if you see criticizing a person of color as racist, you might be racist. You know, sir, you can't criticize John, because he's black. That is the most pandering crap I've ever heard. You should be able to criticize anybody. More, particularly, you should be able to criticize the city that they represent, because maybe you might help the people. Trump's tweet had created a focus on the city that might do something about the problem. They might invigorate concerns. You might think he's a jerk, he'll take that. He'll take it.

Nothing has changed. But, to Greg's point about solving this problem, for them to solve the problem, they would have to admit that there's a problem. And we're in this crazy zone now where -- there's a reporter today doing a live shot in Baltimore and a rat ran behind her, but we're not allowed to talk about rats infestation, and the fact that this is happening in the city. It's like Baltimore needs to admit the first step of the 12-step program. Like, there is a problem. They're addicted to government spending. They're addicted to big government. And the only way it's going to change is if they have an intervention, which Trump is doing, and hit complete rock bottom. And Trump has said he's willing to work with Elijah Cummings or people in Baltimore to solve the problem, and that's exactly the point. He's willing to work with anybody to solve the problem, even if you do say horrible things about him."

And then the media spends four days -- today's articles were about, did the president have a strategy or is this an impulse? So he comes back today, they ask him this and he says, no, no strategy. Zero strategy. This is just like I want to solve the problem. I'm bringing this up. And so then -- the other thing that, from a communication standpoint, it's pretty impressive. Back in 2016, during the campaign, Trump campaign, remember, was not the well-oiled machine that you're used to. What do they have now? There're wash and cash. They have an RNC that's fully staff. They have an opposition research team that's amazing. So the president on a Sunday morning or Saturday morning can tweet this, and what happens immediately? The opposition research team is able to say, oh, no, Bernie Sanders said this in 2016. Here's the tape. Oh, you know what? Oh, the mayor said this last week. And they're able to prove it. So, instead of the -- talking about -- what did he mean by his tweet? And going through like diagramming the sentence, they are not able to actually talk about the issues, and that's where he continues to win. The first person that's able to say, oh, yeah? What about this, Mr. President? That would be helpful. But instead, they have these arguments."

There're Democrats who have said Baltimore has serious problems, high rates of poverty, and they have done this in the spirit of trying to solve problems, Jesse. The president comes in and what does he do? Demeans people in terms of what human being would want to live here? This takes us back to the way he talks about S-hole countries and the way that he talks about John Lewis, needs to pay more attention. If he cared, he would be also talking about some of these white congressman Republicans who come from districts with far higher poverty rates among whites and blacks than Baltimore. That's why no one --"

Crown Heights where a Jewish man died. Tawana Brawley, the original great hoax of our time. So it's kind of interesting. And to the race thing, Trump was friends with Al Sharpton, now he's not friends. So was he not racist then and racist now? I mean, you've got to be consistent. And again, he targets so many people."

Problem is that lane is now backed up. Engines are revving going nowhere good. If only one or two candidates checked their side views and saw that vacant middle lane and hopped right in, they race right to the front. That's the thing about sanity it's attractive to the rest of us who've seen where that other lane goes. Now, that movement to the middle lane would make sense except for the cops, i.e. the media, who will ticket you for any infraction that might come with expressing any moderate views. Racism, sexism, any-ism, those are the labels the press flings with gleeful abandon. No wonder the new Democratic Party now defends MS-13, Antifa, and rodents. That's where the far-left lane takes you, which is where you find all the sheep, for now. And that lane, bleeding away, mistaking the attention from the press for the desires of America. Instead, it only represents the screeches voices of the press and social media, who are now the loudest voices at the party. The candidates are merely mirrors of the media, one heading the wrong way, the other cheering them on, never pausing to check the damage they leave behind, Baltimore, St. Louis, L.A., Detroit. It's a slow commute when you do with your doors locked. So, Juan, Rahm Emanuel said this about the 2020 Democrats, and I think you've said this before, too often, you succumb to chasing plots on twitter. Care to respond to that, Mr. Williams?"

And I don't think you can kind of turn that switched off after so 70 years. The second thing is, when Biden is attacked, he gets super frantic and defensive and starts spit firing all of his legislative rundowns for the last three decades. And it comes off as extremely crazy and uptight and wild and defensive, but he needs to remain calm when he's attacked like that. But, Trump is in his head because he's supposed to be Sleepy Joe, so he can't act calm. He can't rise above it and act calm and sturdy and steady or else he'll -- the Sleepy Joe nickname will stick."

So Michigan is part of the blue wall, something that President Trump tore down. Democrats have been frantically trying to get those voters back in their corner. The Trump tax cut, almost every single Democrat running against him has said they're going to repeal those. Put them back in place. Twenty five percent of people in Michigan -- or 25 percent of -- was the average tax cut in Michigan for the majority of the families there. That's a lot. There're almost 200,000 people who no longer paying the Obamacare individual mandate. Well, that's something that Joe Biden has talked about defending and bringing back. So I think when you look at the policy positions, they're going to be going after President Trump to try to keep the focus away from the infighting and the civil war going on with the left. But when it comes to how it affected people there who are going to be listening tonight, I'm not so sure they're going to make an impact."

But this kind of thing is not effective. You know, they're chanting, free the children. Where are you going to put the children? I mean, a lot if the time these children are sent by themselves alone, unaccompanied. They've been taken away from sex traffickers. They've been prevented from being sent to sex traffickers in America. They're actually in a safer position in DHS or HHS custody than they are just being thrown out to whoever.
