A little bit after that it, was Paul Ryan, the President and Mike Pence in the Oval, a small group meeting. And Ryan is kind of droning on over and over and over kind of going over the same points and at some point, the President just kind of stands up, walks out of the room, goes into the private dining room just off to the Oval and clicks on the TV and hangs out for a few minutes in there and the Vice President ends up going and getting him to come back, but that was kind of my takeaway in the moment, was that's about the most hardcore power move I have ever seen and it pretty well set the stage for the Trump-Ryan dynamic over the next couple of years."

Mooch is a fan of \"Watters' World.\" I'm a big fan of his. This is an excerpt from the book. This is from the President. \"'Can you believe this guy? I've never seen anything like it.' Said the guy who hosted a reality show with Dennis Rodman, Omarosa and Gary Busey. 'He's completely out of his mind, like on drugs or something. Totally out of his mind,' the President continued.

He is a great surrogate for us.\" And he's like, \"Well, I've got a plan for him,\" and come to find out, his plan was, he was going to bring him in as Comms Director. But there was a lot of resistance to that. And so I kind of tried to help bring him in and get that done. He ultimately came in and he had a short tenure. But the line that you mentioned there has actually gotten a lot of pickup in the last couple of weeks of people saying that Donald Trump said that Anthony Scaramucci was on drugs?

They were more concerned with defending themselves all the time. And I thought The Mooch would change that. People could say what they want about The Mooch, but the guy was loyal to Donald Trump.

This Patriot hatred, this isn't a new thing. The map would not change if Trump wasn't President. People hate the Patriots because we win, because they can't beat us, because we're here every year and they want to be us. They hate us because they hate us. That saying was long before Trump got elected."

I mean, Trump -- Goodell tried to strike us down. That's the only reason he likes us. We've never done anything except say, \"Hey, what you did was wrong and we want you to know about it.\" And we did it with silence, it wasn't threatening, but he allows no dissension within his regime."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay, so let's talk about the game here. I mean, this is probably going to be decided at the line of scrimmage. They have a great D-line over there in LA. You guys haven't let Brady get sacked in about the last two games, you know, the Rams has got to let Gurley get going early, take some pressure off Goff. How do you see it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PORTNOY",
      "utterance": "I think it'll be a close game. I mean, they haven't sacked Brady because Brady gets rid of the ball so quick. So it takes away the defensive line, but every Super Bowl that the Patriots play really comes down to a couple of plays here or there or how the ball bounces. You know, some of the Super Bowls we won, we could have lost and the ones we lost, we could have won. I expect this one to be very similar. Very tight. I think the Patriots will win a very close game. I always think the Patriots are going to win and for the most part, they do. That's why they're in their ninth Super Bowl. That's why they are greatest dynasty of all time, but they play great Super Bowls. All of them have been close. Another gift that we give the rest of the country, great Super Bowls. So I could give you about 34-31."
