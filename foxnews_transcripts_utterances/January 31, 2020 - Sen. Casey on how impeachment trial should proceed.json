We're going to have Chad Pergram in just a moment to get us - get all this figured out. But we're getting some details tonight. We're moments away from the Senate getting back into session to formalize the plan going forward. They will vote to set the final ground rules for the trial and that will resume on Monday with closing arguments. We have word that the votes on each article of impeachment will come sometime after 4 PM on Wednesday when this trial finally does come to an end, if there is not more twists and turns, which of course there could be. No one expects that the outcome will change ultimately. But tonight, Democrats are offering us a preview of what their messaging will be on this.

Now if you notice that this was kind of prescriptive. If you're the Senate Minority Leader and you have the Chief Justice presiding over an impeachment trial, you're not going to try to trip him up. So, a lot of times what happens in the Senate when you have a parliamentary inquiry that's where you're asking the status of what's actually going on, on the floor and you pose that from the floor to whoever is presiding, in this case John Roberts. You ask basically why can't you rule on this, why can't you interject yourself. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And if you noticed Elizabeth McDonough, the Senate parliamentarian, she had a piece of paper that had obviously been prescriptive for Chief Justice Roberts to read because they had worked this out ahead of time. And what he said was the following. He said, I do not have - first of all, I view those episodes with Chief Justice Chase and Andrew Johnson trial in 1868 as \"isolated episodes.\" He noted that two of them were procedural, one was a motion to adjourn and he said, as such, I do not believe that I have sufficient authorities to break ties in the Senate. So, what was happening there was Schumer was just trying to get the Chief Justice on the record and understand what the interpretation was because again you know you're into some pretty interesting parliamentary and constitutional turf when it comes to breaking ties. And if you look at the Senate impeachment rules, it says that the power of the Vice President will have \"devolved\" when you're dealing with impeachment trials, meaning that under Article 1 Section 3 of the Constitution, Vice Presidents can break ties, but not in a presidential impeachment trial, because the Chief Justice is presiding. And what is an unanswered question dating back to the precedent set by Chief Justice Chase in 1868 is can the Chief Justice acting as the presiding officer break ties. And again, the other issue here is sometimes you want the tie to go a certain way, because by rule in the Senate, a tie loses.",

I think getting that piece of information outweighs those concerns. But I'm also very sympathetic to the many senators who had no appetite for this notion that the House of Representatives, the Democrats control it, it was their job to build the best, most thorough case that they could.

Right? And so, I think that has been the Democratic case all along. That case did not -- did not pick up any Republican votes. Like Guy was in the Senate to vote with us and Guy will take a look but he was not.

It is not only possible; it is the obligation of the court to not allow the case to proceed to a full traditional trial if the civil claims or the criminal charges at issue are legally defective or in many cases there are no genuine issues of material fact. The material facts are not in dispute. Both are acceptable answers here and that's why we're not proceeding to trial. But it doesn't make the President's exoneration any less significant.

We've got a deal however with the Articles of Impeachment as they sent them to us. In addition to having some inadequacies in and of themselves.

That would be a problem. Now I don't know whether that would be John Bolton himself, whether it would be somebody connected to his author. I really have no idea, but if there's classified material in there and particularly if it's classified at the top-secret level that would be a problem."

But I think the procedural posture of where we are right now is, I think less important in terms rather than where we are in terms of the big issue today. And that was witnesses and documents. I thought that the best way for the Senate to proceed was to have relevant witnesses called, relevant documents part of the record because that's the only way to have a full and fair trial. But we now know that that's not going to happen. I think that's not good for the Senate. I think the country is seeing every day now disclosures that bear on the fundamental issues of this trial. So, we'll have to go forward. But I'm not at all happy about where we are."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the only thing contrary to that or the fundamental contrary argument to that is every Senate trial whether a judge or of a president in American history has had witnesses, it just makes sense that when you have a trial you have witnesses. Now I think on the House there was also opportunities not just for witnesses to appear and witnesses to be called, but both sides got to question. So, in a sense, they had a grand jury process which is what the impeachment process is House. But when you come to the Senate, it's a different process. And the gravity of this proceeding in large measure increases, because the determination you have to make about guilt or innocence involves removal. So, you'd want to make sure that you have every possible piece of evidence or at least reasonably possible piece of evidence on the record. So, that I think the American people would be better off hearing from John Bolton because you have a basic issue of fact here. You have a dispute. John Bolton says one thing about his interactions and the President says another."

And he and the rest the Democrats are probably upset at the fact they didn't get witnesses in the Senate which is a ridiculous premise because they had 17 in the House. They could have subpoenaed John Bolton. They didn't. They had a chance to do more. They didn't.

Anyone in Donald Trump's orbit, they hate and if they get out and say one negative thing about the President, all of a sudden, they're the toast of the town. Adam Schiff has no credibility whatsoever. He's been caught lying about Russia collusion evidence he didn't have, about his staff talking to a whistleblower. He said they didn't, they did. He made up his entire speech to the American people and to his colleagues in Congress when he tried to pass off his own deranged demented words. Is that of the President's.

Susan Collins wanted witnesses. Mitt Romney wanted witnesses and ultimately Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee both decided to vote against that. However, Lamar Alexander said that he felt that the President's phone call was inappropriate and spoke out about it.

We're not going to have witnesses in the Senate because this is supposed to be done in the house and it was. Now they don't like the way they did it. They have no one to blame but themselves. As we move into the Senate, it's a completely different set of circumstances and as we've said many times had they decided to vote for witnesses then we can have some witnesses. But even Adam Schiff made the point yesterday, we can do this in a week. Let's just do this in a week. So, let me get this straight. You guys had three months to do it in the House, do it the way you wanted. You completely colored the jury. You did it behind closed doors and now you're telling us you only give us a week and only let the witnesses come forward that you want and not us, they're trying to do it all over again. The fact is they ruin this process and our defense team lo and behold finally had a chance to defend this president. And on Monday let's not forget, Democrats were saying they're never going to get the vote for witnesses, and we got it, because the facts prove, the President did nothing wrong. What he actually did do was constitutional. It was legal. It was lawful. It was on behalf of the American taxpayer."

And as you go back to Sunday evening when the first little news of this allegation broke on Monday morning. This was clearly coordinated. As it broke, the Amazon page for preorders of the book went up immediately. A statement from his staff went up immediately. So, this has all been very planned, very coordinated. And when those statements did come out which we don't even know if they're true, these are allegations no one has seen this manuscript. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo came out and said, not true. Attorney General Barr, the DOJ not true. Mick Mulvaney said the same thing. None of this is true. So, this has become a pattern and a track record, and I hate to say it, but it's unfortunate because Ambassador Bolton, I worked together in the White House. He and the President had a good relationship as well. But so often people try to make money off of this President's name and it appears that's what's happening again."

Now, my question is, we all know that after this part of this process is over and I think it seems fairly obvious at this point that there will be an acquittal and the vote is expected to take place on Wednesday at 4 o'clock. These questions are going to continue to go on and on and on and even to the point where you could see this issue of impeachment raised again over these same issues because there is no double jeopardy in impeachment.

There were requests for subpoena there for John Bolton, the move by Leader McConnell to table that. And now you're going to hear the roll call for the course of this. I do want to bring in Chad Pergram one more time because there was an interesting exchange a moment ago with regard to the request establishing on Senator Schumer's part, the history of impeachment and that Salmon Chase, the Chief Justice who presided over President Johnson's impeachment did in fact choose in two out of three cases to get involved and to break a tie. Chad, give us some sense of that question? Why it was brought up at this point and the answer that was given by the Chief Justice?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "Well, Chuck Schumer in the past several days has talked about trying to get Chief Justice John Roberts to weigh in and rule may be in favor of witnesses or break ties in a Senate trial. Now if you notice that this was kind of prescriptive. If you're the Senate Minority Leader and you have the Chief Justice presiding over an impeachment trial, you're not going to try to trip him up. So, a lot of times what happens in the Senate when you have a parliamentary inquiry that's where you're asking the status of what's actually going on, on the floor and you pose that from the floor to whoever is presiding, in this case John Roberts. You ask basically why can't you rule on this, why can't you interject yourself. And if you noticed Elizabeth McDonough, the Senate parliamentarian, she had a piece of paper that had obviously been prescriptive for Chief Justice Roberts to read because they had worked this out ahead of time. And what he said was the following. He said, I do not have - first of all, I view those episodes with Chief Justice Chase and Andrew Johnson trial in 1868 as \"isolated episodes.\" He noted that two of them were procedural, one was a motion to adjourn and he said, as such, I do not believe that I have sufficient authorities to break ties in the Senate. So, what was happening there was Schumer was just trying to get the Chief Justice on the record and understand what the interpretation was because again you know you're into some pretty interesting parliamentary and constitutional turf when it comes to breaking ties. And if you look at the Senate impeachment rules, it says that the power of the Vice President will have \"devolved\" when you're dealing with impeachment trials, meaning that under Article 1 Section 3 of the Constitution, Vice Presidents can break ties, but not in a presidential impeachment trial, because the Chief Justice is presiding. And what is an unanswered question dating back to the precedent set by Chief Justice Chase in 1868 is can the Chief Justice acting as the presiding officer break ties. And again, the other issue here is sometimes you want the tie to go a certain way, because by rule in the Senate, a tie loses."

One candidate particularly irked by this is Bernie Sanders whose campaign released this statement today to quote, \"To now change the rules in the middle of the game to accommodate Mike Bloomberg who is trying to buy his way into the Democratic nomination is wrong.

He needs the full spectrum treatment. He's got to stay and toe to toe with these people. And then he gets in or he might get in the debate and all of a sudden, it's a rigged system. So, guess what?

Starting at 5 p.m. Eastern on Sunday the U.S. will temporarily ban foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting the coronavirus from entering the country. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also announcing any U.S. citizen who has traveled to the Hubei province in the last two weeks must undergo 14 days of mandatory quarantine upon returning to the U.S. Those who are coming back from the rest of mainland China in the same time period will be screened at ports of entry and undergo 14 days of self- monitoring. Also beginning on Sunday, all flights to the U.S. from China will be directed to just seven airports so passengers can be screened for the illness."

In the U.S., a seventh case was confirmed in Santa Clara County, California, the third such case in the state. Health officials there say while the flu has been far more devastating in the United States, people are more afraid of the coronavirus because there is so much unknown."

Less than two hours ago, the United Kingdom officially exited the European Union. It had been a member for 47 years. It comes more than three and a half years after the historic Brexit vote finally implemented. Here is British Prime Minister Boris Johnson just a short time ago."

They have until December 31st to hammer out the details like setting up trade deals with the remaining European Union countries and the United States which could get a little sticky but they are on their way. So more than 28,000 pages of evidence, 22 hours of opening statements from House managers and nearly 200 questions asked by senators during the trial, but Senate Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are now saying that this process is illegitimate in terms of the trial as they brace for an acquittal which is expected to happen on Wednesday."

And I would have voted with Senator Collins and Senator Romney to hear from John Bolton because the counter arguments are completely fair and they are actually quite compelling. I think getting that piece of information outweighs those concerns. But I'm also very sympathetic to the many senators who had no appetite for this notion that the House of Representatives, the Democrats control it, it was their job to build the best, most thorough case that they could. Instead they did a shoddy, shabby rush job and now they want the Senate to do sort of a cleanup job for them --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, what strikes me is that from the beginning it was always going to be a completely partisan process because when we've watched this before, you think about even the Mueller investigation. You know, there was an outside counsel who was appointed. Robert Mueller did an investigation and for those years when that was going on both sides sort of said well, you know, we'll see what he says when it comes back. But in this situation, it was led by Chairman Schiff. It went into the intel committee. Not the judiciary committee. So, it feels as if it was so dug in that that this was never going to be something that was going to get buy-in on both sides. So, in that situation, Richard, when it does get to the Senate it's their House. The Republicans have the majority. They are saying, you know what? Once you left it from the -- let it go from the House, it did become our process and we are not going to, you know, help you find the president guilty in this case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "I get that argument. I'm very sympathetic to it. I think what makes this case so interesting is that last night, and I think Adam Schiff said and I think it was a moment that I remembered in the trial because I think it was stark and telling was, he's like, as we are sitting here talking about impeachment, the Justice Department is at the court arguing if the remedy for the president on abiding by subpoenas is impeachment. Right? And so, I think that has been the Democratic case all along. That case did not -- did not pick up any Republican votes. Like Guy was in the Senate to vote with us and Guy will take a look but he was not. And so now we sit in a place where this president will be acquitted but this Ukraine thing still looms over his presidency. I think now the question will be how will Republicans operate and how will this president operate?"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Vindication is a separate question. Right? We can debate whether there is vindication here. But I do think there is a certain exhaustion. We have gone through, what, three years of the Russia thing that went nowhere. And now we are on to Ukraine. I think it's interesting to see senators like Rubio and Lamar Alexander saying OK, I think the president did some things here that were inappropriate, it is not correct, therefore, afterwards to use our position in the Senate to uproot a duly elected president from the presidency with voters going to the polls in about nine months. And I think a lot of people, you know, look, they could have gotten every witness that they wanted. The result of this trial was going to be almost exactly the same give or take two, maybe three votes."

And then he said in my view they kind of lead themselves open to a lot of criticism. It seems it was half a trial. But what have you, Richard, is that, you know, the White House didn't say that wasn't said at that meeting. What he is saying is not true. John Bolton says it is true. And I just wonder when you go down this road, you know, whether you are ever going to get any sort of conclusive agreement on what happened."

While Guy and other Republicans have been very outlet this call was not perfect. There was a lot wrong with it. We don't hear -- I think this would have went away a lot quicker if there were more Republicans who came out and said, Mr. President, your behavior on this call was unbecoming. It was unpresidential. And to be frank with you, the reason why this impeachment is happening because there are some parts of these calls and part of this whole operation that raise questions to the American people. That what miss -- what was missing here is Republicans never did that and now as we get into this election, right, which literally starts on Monday."

And then senators, you know, that was one of the big issues here, they wanted to have their say on the floor. They will get those opportunities, you know, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday during regular session. That will kind of be outside the parameters of this final trial framework. And then of course 4 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon. That's when we will have two separate votes rendering verdict on the President of the United States on the two articles of impeachment, two separate votes. And in the impeachment rules, the senators rise from their desk and they vote guilty or not guilty. Again, a reminder it takes 67 votes, two thirds to convict and remove, Martha."
