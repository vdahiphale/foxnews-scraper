The committee knows that no court in the country will enforce a subpoena on less than 15 hours notice.\" With that, let's bring in our panel. Here in New York, former CIA analyst Buck Sexton, Mary Anne Marsh, former senior advisor to Senator John Kerry, and Jason Riley, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

So while we are sitting here talking about what Trump may have delayed in funding, he was also willing to make a decision about assisting the Ukrainian military that President Obama and his NSC explicitly refused to do because it was going to anger the Russians, they didn't want to take that additional step.

Since then, there have been a lot of transcripts out from behind closed doors, one of them today from Lieutenant Colonel Vindman who says he was reporting concerns to the NSC lawyer. \"I made a judgment call. I thought this was wrong. My experience has always suggested that if there is -- if you feel like something is wrong, it is your duty to report it to your seniors, and that's what I did.\" In the meantime, as far as other people testifying, the Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, acting chief of staff, I should say, did not show up today. The statement for the White House, \"While Mick is immune from compulsion, making subpoena unenforceable, the subpoena is also independently unenforceable based on a lack of reasonable notice. The committee knows that no court in the country will enforce a subpoena on less than 15 hours notice.\" With that, let's bring in our panel. Here in New York, former CIA analyst Buck Sexton, Mary Anne Marsh, former senior advisor to Senator John Kerry, and Jason Riley, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. OK, Jason, these transcripts tell a story in and of themselves, but it's all setting up really to the public hearings next week. JASON RILEY, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COLUMNIST: Yes, and I'm glad we are getting some public hearings. I don't think it's going to make the process any more fair, but if you are going to try an overturn an election, at least let's make it public. And so I'm glad that they are doing that. But when I watch President Trump out there responding to these reports, Bret, he's starting to look like Leslie Nielsen in \"Naked Gun\" standing in front of that burning building and saying, move on, move on, nothing to see here. It's not going to cut it just saying it's all a witch hunt, it's all a hoax, there's nothing here to see. The Democrats are --"

But he did withhold Congressionally approved money. It was on hold. Members of Congress went to him and said release it, why are you holding it, and there was a condition placed on that. So to Rush Limbaugh's point, bribery is another word for quid pro quo. It's just a simple word. And that's what happened here."

      "utterance": "Democrats are going to impeach President Trump no matter what information comes out, no matter what we find out. And this is my assessment but I think this is where it's all heading. They're not going to pull back on this at all. By the way, it's a good thing they weren't asking for the Javelin missiles during the Obama administration because they were explicitly denied those, which was the single most useful thing that could've been done to push back on Russian aggression. So while we are sitting here talking about what Trump may have delayed in funding, he was also willing to make a decision about assisting the Ukrainian military that President Obama and his NSC explicitly refused to do because it was going to anger the Russians, they didn't want to take that additional step. So I think if we're looking at a policy matter here, that shouldn't be left out of the discussion. As to where this is going to go now with impeachment, let's just understand that during the Mueller probe, there was always the promise, Bret, of revelation. There was going to be the day, the issue, the smoking gun, it was going to happen, and never happened. Here it seems that the plan is just repetition, just keep talking about this call, the call, the call, have all these other people come in and give their perception of the call oir what somebody said about it one point in time to another person. I just don't think that's going to cut it with people who aren't already overtaken with animus to the president. So I actually disagree with people who think that they are winning this battle with the president when it comes to public opinion. I think that this is actually more anemic than they had anticipated."

So on the issue, for example, brought up about the Mueller report, it's we don't know about. But on all these people that are taking shot at this president's administration from behind the cloak of anonymity, it's how dare you try to know. In fact, even journalists are pretending -- the same journalists who will break the espionage act when they think the public has a right to know, they in this case say you could go to prison if you talk about who the whistleblower. I talked about the whistleblower. I don't think I'm going to prison."

But yes, people are saying why not name the whistleblower? If you can change your rules to cover President Trump, why can't you change your rules on reporting who the whistleblower is. So that's where the mainstream media I think has done itself no favors in how it's covered this president under different standards."

I think it will hurt his fundraising, particularly where he's already struggling, and I think it will hurt the moderate voters. Mike Bloomberg will pick away. But more importantly, none of these guys have the black support that Joe Biden has, including Mike Bloomberg. And blacks play an outsized roll both in the primary process and in the general election. They might have cost Hillary the election. It's hard to see people who didn't turn out for Hillary turning out for Mike Bloomberg."

But I think he's making the wrong bet here, which is the Democratic Party isn't looking for a billionaire nominee. He assumes he can pick up the Biden, Buttigieg support. It's not transferable. And he assumes he'll get support from Moms Demand Action and other things that he funded. Presidential campaigns just don't work that way."

The American people just flatly aren't with candidates like Sanders as well as all the candidates who are on stage who said that they would vote for Medicare for all for illegal aliens in this country. When you talk about not enforcing the law, decriminalizing at the border, all the different areas of immigration policy being turned upside down.

Some networks didn't want to cover it for reasons that maybe discuss another time, but it was very interesting to see that a major network wouldn't go with what was essentially ironclad for purposes of journalism, the story of Jeffrey Epstein. And the loser, of course, in this case is the other side of that coin, which would be ABC News, did not look good in the response they had about why they wouldn't go with this story about some of the most rich, powerful, connected people in the world involved in or around somebody who was a pedophile.
