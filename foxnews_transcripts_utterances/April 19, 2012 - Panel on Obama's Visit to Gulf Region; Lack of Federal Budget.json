But those beaches will recover, because those big globs of oil, when they hit the beaches, we can send a bunch of people out there and scoop them up, dispose of it properly, and those beaches will look pretty pristine a year or two years from now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The biggest concern we have actually are the marshes, the estuaries, the wetlands. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } BRET BAIER, \"SPECIAL REPORT\" HOST: President Obama on his trip to the Gulf region today, visiting three states. He did sound more optimistic than that sound bite in other statements today, saying the region will bounce back, and that he and the administration are doing everything they can. This before a speech to the nation from the Oval Office Tuesday night, and then he will meet with BP executives Wednesday. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What about all of this, what is said, what is being done? Let's bring in the panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for the Weekly Standard, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Steve, if you are living on the Gulf Coast and you listen to globs of oil, that is fairly depressing -- one or two years away. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

This is the time where he is finally going to take control in a way that I think he tried to do earlier with his press conference but which failed because he botched some question.

      "utterance": "If the oil hits the beaches, that's actually probably the easiest to clean up. So it's a concern obviously for tourism, it's a concern for an entire Gulf region that economically depends on the tourist season and this period of time when people are out of school. But those beaches will recover, because those big globs of oil, when they hit the beaches, we can send a bunch of people out there and scoop them up, dispose of it properly, and those beaches will look pretty pristine a year or two years from now. The biggest concern we have actually are the marshes, the estuaries, the wetlands. BRET BAIER, \"SPECIAL REPORT\" HOST: President Obama on his trip to the Gulf region today, visiting three states. He did sound more optimistic than that sound bite in other statements today, saying the region will bounce back, and that he and the administration are doing everything they can. This before a speech to the nation from the Oval Office Tuesday night, and then he will meet with BP executives Wednesday. What about all of this, what is said, what is being done? Let's bring in the panel, Steve Hayes, senior writer for the Weekly Standard, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Steve, if you are living on the Gulf Coast and you listen to globs of oil, that is fairly depressing -- one or two years away."

      "speaker": "STEVE HAYES, SENIOR WRITER, THE WEEKLY STANDARD",
      "utterance": "Yes. Not the timeframe you want to be hearing from the president of the United States. I talked that some people working in the region said we would be lucky if we're one-third of the way through this right now. So I think you're looking at something that is very long-term. And it's precisely the reason that you have President Obama spending two days down in the gulf now, to see the kind of pictures that we're showing and other networks are going to be showing. It's why he is giving the speech tomorrow night. This is the time where he is finally going to take control in a way that I think he tried to do earlier with his press conference but which failed because he botched some question. He's now saying I am taking control and directing BP to do what I want BP to do. This is going to be the White House-controlled recovery."

      "utterance": "I agree. It's somewhat extra legal instructing BP. After all, the liability limits under the law today is $75 million. The fund he wants is $20 billion. But that's why you have the White House lawyers. They create loopholes in the law or they give Obama ammunition by saying when he meets with the president of BP, our lawyers looked at this and there are 18 possible laws that you may have violated. And the penalties would amount to a lot more than $20 billion escrow. How about we make a deal? I'm not sure how legal it is. He doesn't have the authority to order BP, but I think he has the leverage to make the BP do it. And it's very politically smart, because whereas up until now he was theoretically in charge, or saying he was, that really puts him in charge of BP at least as to restitution and compensation."

      "utterance": "I think you may have to do it as a practical matter. This may come from the president for precisely the reason you said, because it may not be legal. So president needs to do it to increase public pressure on BP. But I don't think it's a good idea politically. I actually think it's a bad idea politically, because basically what you have the president doing is putting all this pressure to solve the legal issues before the problem itself is solved. We still have oil spewing. You have months of the oil washing in the marshes and the president is out there having these fights among lawyers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "On that score, this is what he told Politico over the weekend in an interview about the tone of defensiveness, a little bit. \"I think it's fair to say six months ago before the spill had happened I went up to Congress and I said we need to crack down a lot harder on oil companies and spend more money on technology to respond in case of a catastrophic spill. There are folks up there,\" meaning Capitol Hill, \"who will not be named who would have said this is classic big government overregulation and wasteful spending.\" Charles, what about that, considering, you know, the Democratic president, Democratic house, and the Democratic Senate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "Well, this is a cheap hit at Republicans and it's kind of a hypothetical hit. Had I proposed \"x,\" Republicans would have opposed. Well, you didn't propose \"x.\" You proposed expanding drilling. This is a way to placate his left, while pretending that his proposed expansion of drilling never happened. So I think it's a pretty weak argument. The fact is that we respond to crises because history shows us what is risky and what is not. We know this stuff a mile down is risky and we need some kind of oversight. But I must say it's also a way which he is covering up on the moratorium of the drilling in deepwater in the Gulf, which is killing what is left of the Gulf Coast economy without any scientific evidence it's needed and in fact harming us, because the boom will move offshore to other countries."

It's also is a huge tax on coal, in which we are the Saudi Arabia of the world, and if you kill coal at home you increase our dependence in other countries. So he will want to make it about all kinds of energy, not about oil and will not help the environment, because the Chinese are opening a coal plant once a week for the next ten years.
