You heard that right, 3.5 percent. You would have to go back to 1969 to see a number like that, when a gallon the gas was 35 cents and the average cost of a new house was just over 15,000 bucks. A new car fetched about 3,200 bucks. And the average income was a dead north of $8,500. 1969, it was the year, of course, of Woodstock and much cheaper stocks. The Dow was at 800 or thereabouts back then, well over 26000 today. Different world.

So the September jobs report, yes, less than forecast, but it's still a pretty strong report, but not too strong that it kills off the chances of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in just a few weeks' time. So, 136,000 jobs in the month. We had that 3.5 percent jobless rate, the lowest in 50 years. Wage gains jumped 2.9 percent, a bit of disappointment there, since it's the weakest read that we have seen in a year's time. But there's still a lot of hiring taking place. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For instance, health care looking for ambulance and hospital workers in the month. We also had business, tech professional services hiring, along with transport and warehousing as well. The soft spots were in retail, since we have retail shedding around 11,000 jobs in the month. Manufacturing cut around 2,000 jobs. But so guess what? That means that we still have 75 percent of the market anticipating an interest rate cut this month in just a few weeks' time. And that helped rally stocks today. You saw the Dow jumping 360 points, being lifted by these consumer stocks and the health care names as well. One stock in particular, Apple, being lifted today because they have to produce more iPhones in order to meet demand. And that's a great sign of spending. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The National Retail Federation confirmed that this week, saying that the holiday shopping period will go up by 3.8 percent to 4.2 percent, so roughly around 4 percent, better than last year.

Wow, America, let's impeach your president, even though he did nothing wrong.\" Latest development from the White House is that we expect, on Monday, the president will be sending a letter up to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying, unless you hold a vote in the full House to authorize an impeachment inquiry, we are not going to be complying with any requests for documents and certainly no subpoenas for documents. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We should point out, Vice President Mike Pence got a subpoena for -- not a subpoena -- a request for documents a short time ago, including a request for a transcript of the president's first call with Ukrainian President Zelensky back on April the 21st, which the president said during the United Nations General Assembly he would be happy to provide. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But listen to what the president said about this idea of sending a letter up to Pelosi, basically, I guess you could say, challenging her to hold a vote in the full House.

He said -- quote -- \"There's a difference of opinion about how important the whistle- blower is at this point.\" This is not as important because the White House released the transcript of the telephone call. One of the other questions here is, will they ever hear from the whistle- blower? I have been told that that seems to be put on the back-burner and they have not really talked about that actively. There's concern about protecting the whistle-blower here. I'm told that some people here on Capitol Hill do in fact know who that person is. And maybe the fact that they might have some associations with a high-level Democrat, that something that's important. The other thing, Neil, that we found out this morning was, we got the prepared remarks that Kurt Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine, that he spoke to the Intelligence Committee yesterday. He had some remarks about Joe Biden yesterday. And he said in his prepared remarks to the committee -- quote -- \"The suggestion that Vice President Biden would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son has no credibility with me. I know of him as a man of integrity.\" Now, this is news o'clock here in Washington. It's about 4:35, 4:36 in the afternoon.

The reason Republicans want to do that is, they want to weaponize a vote on the House floor against vulnerable swing state and swing district Democrats. In other words, then you have documented this. So the other thing to watch for is, once they get through some of this investigation, Neil, is what goes into the actual articles of impeachment that they craft? What do they look like? Do they talk about obstruction of Congress, which could play into the idea that they're not complying with these subpoenas? Do they talk about specific things with Ukraine?

      "utterance": "And one giant leap for the job market, because not since Neil Armstrong walked on the moon have we seen an unemployment rate so out of this world and just so darn low. Try 3.5 percent. You heard that right, 3.5 percent. You would have to go back to 1969 to see a number like that, when a gallon the gas was 35 cents and the average cost of a new house was just over 15,000 bucks. A new car fetched about 3,200 bucks. And the average income was a dead north of $8,500. 1969, it was the year, of course, of Woodstock and much cheaper stocks. The Dow was at 800 or thereabouts back then, well over 26000 today. Different world. What a world, because this, my friends, is \"Your World,\" and I'm Neil Cavuto. And you thought that maybe Quentin Tarantino was the only guy who could make 1969 come back to life this year. But this isn't once upon a time in Hollywood; 3.5 percent unemployment is this time right here and now in America, historic and, for stocks, meteoric, the Dow rocketing, because after a week of some nail-biting data, it turns out the economy is not crashing after all. And we have got you covered with FOX Business' Susan Li on the numbers that got them jumping and John Roberts at the White House that the president certainly wasn't ignoring. We begin with Susan -- Susan."

      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. So the September jobs report, yes, less than forecast, but it's still a pretty strong report, but not too strong that it kills off the chances of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in just a few weeks' time. So, 136,000 jobs in the month. We had that 3.5 percent jobless rate, the lowest in 50 years. Wage gains jumped 2.9 percent, a bit of disappointment there, since it's the weakest read that we have seen in a year's time. But there's still a lot of hiring taking place. For instance, health care looking for ambulance and hospital workers in the month. We also had business, tech professional services hiring, along with transport and warehousing as well. The soft spots were in retail, since we have retail shedding around 11,000 jobs in the month. Manufacturing cut around 2,000 jobs. But so guess what? That means that we still have 75 percent of the market anticipating an interest rate cut this month in just a few weeks' time. And that helped rally stocks today. You saw the Dow jumping 360 points, being lifted by these consumer stocks and the health care names as well. One stock in particular, Apple, being lifted today because they have to produce more iPhones in order to meet demand. And that's a great sign of spending. The National Retail Federation confirmed that this week, saying that the holiday shopping period will go up by 3.8 percent to 4.2 percent, so roughly around 4 percent, better than last year. And they say, Neil, the effect from tariffs either directly or even indirectly through consumer confidence remains to be seen. So some would say this is what we call a Goldilocks scenario in the markets -- back to you."

      "utterance": "Neil, good afternoon to you. The president still happy about this economic report, despite the fact that the jobs numbers came in about 9,000 below what was forecast. But the president really focusing in on that 3.5 percent unemployment number, saying, with other economies around the world beginning to wobble or with the wheels fully coming off, America is the economic miracle. But at the same time, with all of this other stuff swirling in Washington, D.C., the president tying the economic numbers to the impeachment inquiry in the House, the president tweeting -- quote -- \"Breaking News. Unemployment rate at 3.5 percent drops to a 50-year low. Wow, America, let's impeach your president, even though he did nothing wrong.\" Latest development from the White House is that we expect, on Monday, the president will be sending a letter up to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying, unless you hold a vote in the full House to authorize an impeachment inquiry, we are not going to be complying with any requests for documents and certainly no subpoenas for documents. We should point out, Vice President Mike Pence got a subpoena for -- not a subpoena -- a request for documents a short time ago, including a request for a transcript of the president's first call with Ukrainian President Zelensky back on April the 21st, which the president said during the United Nations General Assembly he would be happy to provide. But listen to what the president said about this idea of sending a letter up to Pelosi, basically, I guess you could say, challenging her to hold a vote in the full House. Listen here."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

Simply put, you are failing to meet the basic standards of due process observed by past speakers of the House.\" What McCarthy was referring to there was the Nixon and the Clinton impeachments, where there was a full vote in the House to authorize the House Judiciary Committee to begin an inquiry. Pelosi firing back -- quote -- McCarthy -- quote -- \"There is no requirement under the Constitution, under House rules or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.\" Now, not only does the White House want to challenge Pelosi to hold this vote in order to get documents, but there's a political angle to all of this as well, Neil. As you can imagine, they want to put pressure here at the White House on red state Democrats to see how they're going to vote. And then they also want a full roll call of how everybody voted on this impeachment question in order to use it as a cudgel against them in the 2020 election -- Neil."

But when you -- I mean, saying that you have got them in a whip cap behind the scenes is one thing., but if you have to put this to a full vote, it might come out quite differently. Again, you have got a lot of red state Democrats who are up for reelection in states that President Trump won handily back in 2016 and could win again in 2020.

I think, also, if the idea was that there was going to be a President Elizabeth Warren, that would certainly scare the heck out of Wall Street. I mean, say what you will about the purists out there who don't like the trade war and things like that.

I have always argued that Wall Street isn't red or blue, conservative or liberal. When it comes to making money, they're green. They're all about making money. And I don't think they care if it's Lucifer or Jesus in the White House, as long as they are making money. They don't want that disrupted. And I think what adds to their volatility sometimes is fearing that Gary might be wrong, that the president does get impeached beyond the House, or that it leads to such disruption, there's trouble."

So let's go to 2020. And let's see the opponent. And if it is a Joe Biden, I think Wall Street would be OK, because he's not going to disrupt anything. If it's an Elizabeth Warren, you do have a problem, because she is disrupting everything as you know it. And that does affect Wall Street and all the rules that they have to play by. I think things -- and we always say, you know, October is a very volatile month. It's not the worst month of the year, although it sometimes seems like it."

I'm not sure how much she could get done. But it would be enough to derail all of what we have gained over the last couple years, certainly.

And I have always been a big believer of government, do your thing, set good conditions and get out of the way and let the 150 million people that are working get the job done.

There is nothing in that transcript that I -- that I have said -- and I have read the transcript -- that would be a high crime or a misdemeanor, that would be an impeachable offense And none of the Democrats have articulated to me or to any of the American people what that specific crime, high crime or misdemeanor, would be."

Is it President Donald Trump or Joe Biden himself? Why? Because there's been a total change in trajectory around the integrity of his campaign, what did he know and what did he didn't know, further, the fact that the American people, a lot of folks, don't really understand the context of the conversation. They don't understand the impact. They don't see any quid pro quo here. For them, they do see a quid pro quo where you have a vice president that goes and tells the government, hey, if you don't fire this guy who's investigating this company, then I won't release this money, or going to China with your son, and him getting over a billion-dollar deals with no expertise.

And we have seen that Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren have both raised more money in Q3 of this year than the former vice president, but -- and also just to go back to what we were discussing before, and, to Isaac's point, I actually disagree. I think, from a lot of people that I have spoken with who are rooting for the former vice president to win the nomination, are very worried about this entire campaign that the president, Republicans and this White House are running against him. And even if the allegations are totally unfounded, which every fact-check so far has said that they are, just putting the words Joe Biden and corruption in the same sentence is really worrying people. And they're worrying that, regardless of the truth, regardless of the facts, it's how you paint it. And we know that this president is really a master at branding, at reframing the narrative. And if he's able to do that successfully with Joe Biden, it really could have an impact on him."

But to Isaac's earlier analysis, which may have come from the funny pages, it doesn't agree with facts and honesty. Truth of the matter is, Joe Biden's campaign is going in a direction that he doesn't want it to go in. Elizabeth Warren, in South Carolina, is now nine points up with African- Americans. And that's been the rationale in which the Biden campaign has positioned their candidacy on, that they can get African-Americans. And he's losing that support. So they should be concerned. And there is a direct impact from the impeachment inquiry. And I'm sure that he would rather not be seen in this light, because, right now, it's really hurting him."

And there's been a lot of back and forth, I'm told, in the meeting with Atkinson about the whistle-blower and also the complaint here. And here's something that Peter Welch told me a minute ago. He said -- quote -- \"There's a difference of opinion about how important the whistle- blower is at this point.\" This is not as important because the White House released the transcript of the telephone call. One of the other questions here is, will they ever hear from the whistle- blower? I have been told that that seems to be put on the back-burner and they have not really talked about that actively. There's concern about protecting the whistle-blower here. I'm told that some people here on Capitol Hill do in fact know who that person is. And maybe the fact that they might have some associations with a high-level Democrat, that something that's important. The other thing, Neil, that we found out this morning was, we got the prepared remarks that Kurt Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine, that he spoke to the Intelligence Committee yesterday. He had some remarks about Joe Biden yesterday. And he said in his prepared remarks to the committee -- quote -- \"The suggestion that Vice President Biden would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son has no credibility with me. I know of him as a man of integrity.\" Now, this is news o'clock here in Washington. It's about 4:35, 4:36 in the afternoon. We do not have compliance with the administration with the subpoenas that were sent out here. We might have some information coming out here just a few minutes ago. So this is -- this is a high noon here in Washington at 4:30 on an afternoon a Friday."

Pelosi is saying that she doesn't have to have a vote to initiate an impeachment inquiry. The White House says that they will not comply with subpoenas or provide witnesses unless there is a vote. The reason Republicans want to do that is, they want to weaponize a vote on the House floor against vulnerable swing state and swing district Democrats. In other words, then you have documented this. So the other thing to watch for is, once they get through some of this investigation, Neil, is what goes into the actual articles of impeachment that they craft? What do they look like? Do they talk about obstruction of Congress, which could play into the idea that they're not complying with these subpoenas? Do they talk about specific things with Ukraine? That would be the next step. And even though front and center right now is the Intelligence Committee, next would in fact be the Judiciary Committee."

He speaks at the White House, commemorates the weekend plans, and then might take questions or might offer his own. He has essentially dared a vote today on impeachment to Nancy Pelosi to sort of see whether she would do so and get those Democrats in particularly vulnerable districts, or at least ones that Donald Trump won, to put them on.

One of the things he brought up -- and I don't know whether you agree with it, Kat -- is that the audience grows either with you or against you.
