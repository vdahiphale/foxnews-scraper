Yes, we are officially on a red tsunami watch, but it seems like nobody has told Joe yet. Instead of hitting the campaign trail and talking to voters, President Biden was cooped up inside a bun -- with a bunch of DNC staffers. I bet it smelled wonderful.

But I got to tell you, when it comes to the economy and inflation, I think voters are -- have not lost their sense of humor about where the blame should be assigned. I think the Fed has failed us in a lot of ways. They -- their primary responsibilities to curb and to fight inflation. And they neglected to do that, I think, in the way they should have. I think Dana laid out politically, there were some Democrats to tag along in some of the way they talked about transitory and other things. We had an inflation problem a long time ago. There were Democrats, Republicans who talked about it.

We cannot be for not fully funding the police. I will add, there was a fully a -- a bill that went before Congress three weeks ago, that funded the police. Republicans didn't like all of it and all of them voted against it. Democrats ought to point that out. But the bigger issue, judge, and others is not lost, I think on a lot of voters. When you, just like in our last segment, when you tell people that inflation and the economy are the real problem, or that Biden should be campaigning in a certain place, people aren't seeing it. Some people aren't feeling that. Democrats who believe that crime is not an issue and point the statistics to try to suggest that.

Yes, we are officially on a red tsunami watch, but it seems like nobody has told Joe yet.

First, trans -- inflation was transitory. Then it was a rich person problem. Remember that little thing from the White House podium? Then it was the Republicans will make it worse. Then it was, hey, at least Europe -- Europe is worse than we are. Then it's changing the topic. They don't -- last February in the State of the Union address commentary I said that Biden's accomplishments are now vulnerabilities, and they only exacerbated that by adding more spending to the -- to the, what do you call that?

Well, people are not relieved, and if 78 percent of people feel that inflation is hurting them, and 47 percent said that they've had to make cut backs and their regular purchases because of inflation's made their lives so hard, then they're going to vote on that.

That we've not screened, we're against no cashless bail or we're against cashless bail. But I got to tell you, when it comes to the economy and inflation, I think voters are -- have not lost their sense of humor about where the blame should be assigned. I think the Fed has failed us in a lot of ways. They -- their primary responsibilities to curb and to fight inflation. And they neglected to do that, I think, in the way they should have. I think Dana laid out politically, there were some Democrats to tag along in some of the way they talked about transitory and other things. We had an inflation problem a long time ago. There were Democrats, Republicans who talked about it. I read a piece this weekend in the New York Times magazine of Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene who seems to have her own thoughts and designs on what the majority should look like if the majority is there, and the kinds of things they're going to --"

I think another big issue for Republicans is going to be Ukraine. Do we continue to support Zelenskyy? I think there is a -- there's a part of the Republican Party that said they don't want to do that. And I think it's going to be incumbent upon Senator McConnell, Mr. McCarthy to say, we will tamp that down. They've not done that. So, I think as voters taken all of this, this race is tight. I will agree with you.

He's talking to these staffers with 15 days to go. Why isn't he out in some of these tougher races, you know, campaigning with some of the candidates? And everything that he says is pretty much a lie. I mean, it can be gainsaid by thing -- I always bring my chart. He keeps saying, the rest of the world is suffering. Well, they're not suffering the way we are. Countries that we wouldn't consider, should be in the same league as we are. They're doing better than we are with inflation. But I think this whole thing about Nancy Pelosi and she, her saying, you know, well, I don't want to talk about that. You know, I want to change this subject. That's what the Democrats have been doing. They've been -- it's like a shell game. They say, this is really what we need to be talking about. That the Republicans, they are the violent ones. You saw January 6th, they're the violent ones. And forget about the summer of 2020. Forget about the fact that crime is through the roof and we're going to talk about it in the next segment. Forget about all that. Just listen to us. And then when you've got the mainstream media supporting them with it -- with their bully pulpit, then Americans think, well, gee, maybe that, maybe you know, it's as bad as Biden says it is.

That's super charged inflation. And he's a business correspondent. And he didn't know that. And then you had, I think it was Clyburn come out and say, yes, yes, we juiced the numbers with inflation. But you know, we had to do it. And he said that on MSNBC. So, the business correspondent on MSNBC didn't know that, but I knew that. I'm neither a business correspondent and I'm on Fox.

This, you don't need to be a genius to figure this out. And the fact that these Democrats like this guy Wheeler, I remember him from the summer of 2020.

And that whenever there's a convert to my side, I agree with it and I just take them. Like when there are people who used to root for Ohio state to want to root for Michigan, we will take you onto our side. And when there are people who, Republicans who flipped on choice at the end of their primaries, I accepted them. Now is it political? Perhaps. But we have a problem and I've tried to explain to my party for a long time, at least the last several months, we can't be for violent criminals having cashless bail. We cannot be for not fully funding the police. I will add, there was a fully a -- a bill that went before Congress three weeks ago, that funded the police. Republicans didn't like all of it and all of them voted against it. Democrats ought to point that out. But the bigger issue, judge, and others is not lost, I think on a lot of voters. When you, just like in our last segment, when you tell people that inflation and the economy are the real problem, or that Biden should be campaigning in a certain place, people aren't seeing it. Some people aren't feeling that. Democrats who believe that crime is not an issue and point the statistics to try to suggest that. There have been a lot of people who have lost races because they're trying to tell the voter what you're feeling, what you're experiencing, and how safe you are. If Kathy Hochul wants to make a switch or a shift, or she's just amplifying a point she has, we should accept it. Because I live in New York. I take the subway. I don't take it as much. And we need our streets safer and our subways safer and anything and anybody that can help us do that, I accept. Should they have come sooner, Judge? Without question.

And I also want to mention this. The fact that he gave this speech today to Democratic staffers shows just how political this decision was on forgiving student debt.

And I think it's really outrageous to say they have a problem with working -- the working class. This is one of the reasons why. They would rather help somebody who took out a loan -- maybe they are burden, but you know what, you took out a loan, you got that college degree, and you are different from somebody that's bought an F-150s to run their business.

I get some of the politics of this and I get that there are -- there is a need there for a lot of students that have this -- have this -- some of their loans forgiven or at least some part of it, but we shouldn't be encouraging people until after the courts have spoken.

They want the Democrats. They don't want to hear from Republicans at all.

But make no mistake, if you're a guest there -- I know people have been guests. They can insist on having X number of people in the audience. I don't know what the deals there are, but what I can tell you is this. You've got an audience that to some extent has been primed by The View.

That stuff, it has a reverse effect. Like, it's making me more militant in my adherence to fossil fuels and to red meat. It's like, I see that, I go, I'm going to just start eating a raw ribeye while driving a tractor-trailer of a mountain of coal just like this the whole time. I'm not stopping.
