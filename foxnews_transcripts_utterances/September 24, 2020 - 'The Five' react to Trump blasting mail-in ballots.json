That's happening while the president has ignited a political a firestorm for reeling against universal mail-in ballots and not committing to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses to Joe Biden. The president asked about it again today.

The Democrats are really focused on this loss -- this case that the administration has brought for the last three years. It's been heard the week after the election. So, they're focusing like a laser beam on that. Why? Well, the pre-existing condition issue was one of the reasons that the Republicans lost the House in 2018. And today, the President is doing this E.O., which basically says, it's basically gutting the lawsuit that the administration is putting forward. So, I don't see why don't they just drop the lawsuit and let it go if there's -- and say, look, we're going to do this by executive order. We're going to get this done. I'm going to have this amazing health care plan in the next two weeks and try to do it that way. But again, I don't think this turns on pre-existing conditions alone. I would say that the Republicans have done an amazing job at registering new voters. That's a huge, really good indication of who's going to win the election.

Nate's dad gives them a ride out to the big waves. But once he's out there, it's Nate who picks the wave and takes off on his own. Pretty cool for a four-year-old. His parents plan to enter him in competition as soon as he's age eligible. Oh my gosh. You're up, Kennedy.",

      "utterance": "I don't think so. But I do think that, you know, even back in 2016, there was this whole thing of -- that President Trump -- the election was rigged. The Democrats says he won't accept the results. Then it was -- they didn't want to accept the results. But they -- Hillary Clinton did the next morning that was -- because it was pretty obvious that she had lost. I think that what we are dealing with now, too, is that President Trump is obviously super sceptical of mail-in ballots, even though he needs Republicans to participate in mail-in ballots. I mean, there's a lot of that happening. Democrats are way far ahead than Republicans on that. So if he -- he wants people to vote in person. And that of course, is ideal, but we know not everybody is going to do that. This just reminds me when I heard this last night, oh, hear we go. The media will react. The Democrats will say impeach. And then the White House press secretary or other spokespeople for the White House will say, no, it's a free and fair election. We are all good. It's fine. And then he comes out two hours later and says -- but I am not for the mail-in ballots. So he is trying to keep everyone on their toes. And these states attorneys general -- I'm sorry, secretaries of state in all 50 states responsible for the elections, they have an important job to do. But I think we need to condition everybody to understand that on November 3rd, when we are in this studio, and it's the big election night. It might not be the election night you recall from the past, because these mail-in ballots, especially in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, and maybe even Michigan, now they are allowing them to come in post-dated even 14 days after the election. So we could be sitting here for a long time. Bring your sleeping bag."

Just dismiss it. Let them write whatever they want. They will write the wrong story anyway. So if you are the president, they already advertised the scheme. And the scheme is certain Democratic battleground states are sending out millions of unsolicited ballots based off voter rolls with cobwebs on them. And then you can bring them in. And the signatures don't have match. It's way past the deadline. And you can't even disqualify them if, you know, someone votes Mickey Mouse. That's the deal. And they will litigate it so it goes on forever. And then they hold the country hostage with riots. Hillary said herself that Biden shouldn't concede. The networks have said we're not going to call close battleground states that Trump is winning by a hair. And even social media companies have said if the president declares victory, we will censor him. And now, the Democrats have already gotten caught. Mini-Mike just got busted for buying ex-con votes in Florida. And the FBI just came out and announced that they found military ballots that had voted for Trump, illegally disqualified in Pennsylvania. So the Democratic Party, this is the party that spies illegally and sent FBI agents into the White House to sting the president's national security adviser during the transition. They don't get to lecture anybody on a peaceful transition of power."

      "utterance": "I thought it was unfair showing that video of Biden asking what country we're in. He was legitimately asking. He was just confused. HE had no clue. OK, so this is probably the best gaslighting I have seen in the last, like, three months. If Trump loses an election, no Trump supporter is going to riot, right? No, they're going to contest anything, because they have to be at work the next day, right? And also, they accept results. However, right now, you already have riots that have the seal of approval from the Democrats. You have them calling them mostly peaceful protests. So you think that Trump is somehow suggesting a non-peaceful transition after 100 days of non-peaceful protests? He just answered honestly to a question that in fact had been posed initially by the Democrats. Should we send in the army if Trump stays in? That was never in Trump's brain. He had no -- he wasn't talking about this initially. This all came from the Democrats. So I find it incredibly, incredibly it's rich on their part to act like oh my god, violence. When they are pushing violence every single day as an extortion plot to make you think that if you support Trump or put your sign out on your porch, you are going to get punched or you're going to get torched. That is the reasoning right now. And by the way, that's coming from the left. It's not just coming from me."

And there was even a story today about how Bret Kavanaugh might be the hope of the left, because some of the decisions that he has participated in have not necessarily been cookie cutter Republican decisions.

So it was, to my mind, Governor Ron DeSantis, the state Republican majority in the legislature and the attorney general who are trying to undermine the will of the people.

So when a judge hands down a sentence and says you have to serve two years and pay restitution or a fine, then until you pay that restitution or a fine, you are not clear.

I think to your point, Kennedy, it is -- is this really a good investment? Like how -- like, a guy that knocks off a liquor store, is he's the type of dependable citizen who knows the day to vote, right? He might tell you to vote, Dana. Dana, go vote, go vote, and then he'll break into your apartment and steal all of your dog toys. So, I don't know if a felon is actually going to be the type of person who votes.

Biden can't straddle those issues and win a general election like that. But who knows how it's going to turn out? I agree with Dana. I think it fires up both bases. But if they get the third justice confirmed before the election, it really pumps up Republicans. It looks like if it's going to be Amy Barrett, that they're not going to be able to call her sexist or racist because she's a woman who adopted two Haitian babies. They're going to say that she is a religious zealot who's going to overturn Roe v. Wade and ObamaCare. So, it'll be about abortion and healthcare. Those are two issues that fire up Democrats. But they will overreach. Democrats always overdo it. They always go a little too far. And to them, to be that nasty to the woman's face, very telegenic mother, brilliant constitutional scholar, and I think they're going to come off as going after Christianity. And if you're going after the police, the founding fathers, capitalism and then throw in Christianity on the eve of the election, I don't think that's a smart electoral strategy, maybe in New York, in California, but not in the battlegrounds."

But today, I was reading that there are polls being done by Republicans that are making them anxious because most Americans it's now 60 or two- thirds of Americans think the president shouldn't rush this through. It's not legit. And there are people who are saying if this is going to be about dismantling the Affordable Care Act and taking away protections for people with pre-existing conditions and kids living at home with their parents, this is going to go badly for Trump and the Republicans."

You know, you have a lot of people have faith in the suburbs. And if it becomes an issue of religious liberty and people being attacked at their core foundation, you know, those are voters that have been problematic and peeling off away from President Trump. This actually might bring some of them back. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "PERINO",

So, I think that, again, people are going to be fired up on lots of different angles. On the pre-existing conditions thing, I would -- I would point this out. The Democrats are really focused on this loss -- this case that the administration has brought for the last three years. It's been heard the week after the election. So, they're focusing like a laser beam on that. Why? Well, the pre-existing condition issue was one of the reasons that the Republicans lost the House in 2018. And today, the President is doing this E.O., which basically says, it's basically gutting the lawsuit that the administration is putting forward. So, I don't see why don't they just drop the lawsuit and let it go if there's -- and say, look, we're going to do this by executive order. We're going to get this done. I'm going to have this amazing health care plan in the next two weeks and try to do it that way. But again, I don't think this turns on pre-existing conditions alone. I would say that the Republicans have done an amazing job at registering new voters. That's a huge, really good indication of who's going to win the election. But the Democrats in the last five days have registered something like 200,000 more voters just since Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, so it is real tight."

Now, this is a British pup, and the owner was amazed because when Bruce watches he gets so upset when anything bad happens. And he runs up to the T.V. and he grows up like a child to watch his movie. And he says it's not just cartoon, he actually even likes real lions that pop up on T.V. He's got a thing for the cats."

But I'm going to admit, in these new segments, when I've been wrong, and I've always been saying for the last 20 years that the Red Hot Chili Peppers is the worst band in history. I hate -- I just hate them. And then about three weeks ago, I was on the bike, and I heard that song that I liked and I go, oh my God, it's a Red Hot Chili Pepper song. It's Dani California. It's actually a really good song, so I was wrong. They're not the worst band. They're still not good --"

All right, the Japanese build a social justice warrior robot. How do I know this is a left-wing robot? Well, you find out this way when they unveil the robot and the first thing the robot does is take a knee. It's a typical left-wing radical robot. The Japanese, of course, built the left-wing radical robot. And who else knows what it does? It probably ballot harvests and does all kinds of boos to the president during funerals. So, there you have it. The Japanese strike again. What will they think of next?"

Anyway, fall as you know, started officially on Tuesday, so it's time for endless summer. Take a look at Nate Clark. He's just four and a surfing prodigy from Devon, England. He's been surfing since he was age two. And during the coronavirus lockdown, he's been surfing every day, because his house is only five minutes from the beach. Nate's dad gives them a ride out to the big waves. But once he's out there, it's Nate who picks the wave and takes off on his own. Pretty cool for a four-year-old. His parents plan to enter him in competition as soon as he's age eligible. Oh my gosh. You're up, Kennedy."
