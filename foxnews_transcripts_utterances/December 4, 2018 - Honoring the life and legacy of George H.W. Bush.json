      "sentences": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Lisa Boothe, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and a thin bowl is her ice bucket, Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" This is video of George Herbert Walker Bush when he crashed into the sea as a young pilot. It's what we call a hero. If you're young playing video games, shopping online, or fulminating on Facebook, it's because of something called leisure time. And leisure time was brought to you by millions of men and women whose bravery in times of war made our idle activity possible. I wonder, would we even be here if it weren't for men like him? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The passing of George Herbert Walker Bush reminds me of the recent passing of John McCain. It also reminds me that only losing great men and women unifies people. We try to forget a whole about the other crap. In fact, we realize much of that crap is pointless. People come and go on our planet and in our lives, and it helps to remember that all of us have something in common with the great ones. With the exception of a few chuckle buckets who use such events to score political points. It's actually a share loss that reveals how we really are. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } None of us tweets in the face of death. Kinder and gentler, remember those words? It's a return to the baseline of human goodness. A great person dies and we can observe the rituals with reverence and respect, as though it's second nature. God help those who can't. It's possible best to ignore them. So for this week, it's not a bad thing to use this passing of a great man as an excuse to make life better, less finger-pointing, more handshakes. I'm sure in time we'll get back to our tribes, but for now let's do the guy a favor. Be kind and gentle in case he's watching. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, Dana, I'm sitting, actually, in your chair which I feel quite strange.",

And you talk about a Republican Party expert in terms of -- I was just saying, you know, he's famous for writing notes to people and I'm sure Dana has a ton. I have some.

You know, he was the vice presidency when I was young, and then his presidency, and then his son's presidency, kind of form to, I thought, a great statesman in America would be. Just a few things come to mind, humility, dignity, class and love. You think about he oversaw America winning the cold war. That was a time where he could have said America just beat our chests and gloat and spike the football. Instead, he didn't. And he said absolutely nothing. And that silence was very important at that time and that was a very powerful moment. I think he was, you know, raised in the prep school, boarding school era where, you know, good sportsmanship is drilled into you. And he always won with class and dignity. Also when he kicked Saddam out of Kuwait, he had an opportunity to rush to Baghdad and overthrow the entire government. And he was humble enough to know the limitations of American military power. And I think everyone, Republicans and Democrats, look back at that and say that was a very wise and humble and noble decision. Juan picked up on a few things. The personal relationships he had with people, professional relationships, friendships, he really conducted it in a classy way. He communicated on stationary or picking up the phone.

The rolodex, all of the people that he knew, the networks across the entire country, just had so much honor and reverence for him and his family that when he called and asked for something it was sure. It wasn't a political favor. It was you're doing something for a friend. And then lastly, love. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In terms of his relationship with Barbara and his sons publicly, at least, you'd think a man of his generation wouldn't be conditioned to show that kind of affection towards other people, especially his family in public.  But his love and affection, the way he displayed it was very modern. He wasn't afraid of embracing people and crying and articulating that love.  And I think every father and every son in this country should look at the relationship that he had with his sons and say that is how a true father- son relationship should be.",

And then Mueller takes over the special counsel investigation and then Flynn pleads to lying and pleads guilty to lying.  So -- and then also, Chairman Grassley has been on DOJ and the FBI to, one, give them the 302's with the interview that they conducted with Flynn so that they could see what kind of questions were, what Flynn said. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And they've also asked for the transcript of Flynn's conversation with the former ambassador, Kislyak, as well.

It's what we call a hero. If you're young playing video games, shopping online, or fulminating on Facebook, it's because of something called leisure time. And leisure time was brought to you by millions of men and women whose bravery in times of war made our idle activity possible. I wonder, would we even be here if it weren't for men like him? The passing of George Herbert Walker Bush reminds me of the recent passing of John McCain. It also reminds me that only losing great men and women unifies people. We try to forget a whole about the other crap. In fact, we realize much of that crap is pointless. People come and go on our planet and in our lives, and it helps to remember that all of us have something in common with the great ones. With the exception of a few chuckle buckets who use such events to score political points. It's actually a share loss that reveals how we really are. None of us tweets in the face of death. Kinder and gentler, remember those words? It's a return to the baseline of human goodness. A great person dies and we can observe the rituals with reverence and respect, as though it's second nature. God help those who can't. It's possible best to ignore them. So for this week, it's not a bad thing to use this passing of a great man as an excuse to make life better, less finger-pointing, more handshakes. I'm sure in time we'll get back to our tribes, but for now let's do the guy a favor. Be kind and gentle in case he's watching. So, Dana, I'm sitting, actually, in your chair which I feel quite strange."

And so I had a wonderful time. It was kind of like, you know, being at the feet of the master because you talk about a political -- he had been head of the Republican National Committee in addition to running twice for senate unsuccessfully, but then holding a house seat twice from Houston. So he had been through a lot politically. He knew all the political leadership going back to the Goldwater days of '64. And you talk about a Republican Party expert in terms of -- I was just saying, you know, he's famous for writing notes to people and I'm sure Dana has a ton. I have some. But he would write notes to all these party leaders so that they felt that they had a personal relationship with him. And the axiom here was don't call somebody up to ask a favor, a political favor, a personal favor, right out of the box without saying how are you doing? Who are you? How are the kids? And that's the relationship he had. So that even people who disagreed with him, specifically, I would guess, you know, in this day of tribes as you say, Greg, the Democrats, oh, my gosh, Democrats had a pretty good relationship. I mean, didn't always come to good political ends because remember in terms of the budget deal where he allowed taxes to be raised in order to lower the deficit, it was then held against him by some in the party, especially the far right, the Newt Gingrich types who said, oh, you know, you're breaking your pledge not to raise taxes. Read my lips, no new taxes. But this is a, you know, an example, I keep saying that I would hold up to my children as the kind of person that you want to be. Someone who is about public service, love of country, love of family, just a -- and treated people as individuals, not as, gee, I'm George H.W.

      "utterance": "Just some personal reflections because I kind of came up under the age of Bush. You know, he was the vice presidency when I was young, and then his presidency, and then his son's presidency, kind of form to, I thought, a great statesman in America would be. Just a few things come to mind, humility, dignity, class and love. You think about he oversaw America winning the cold war. That was a time where he could have said America just beat our chests and gloat and spike the football. Instead, he didn't. And he said absolutely nothing. And that silence was very important at that time and that was a very powerful moment. I think he was, you know, raised in the prep school, boarding school era where, you know, good sportsmanship is drilled into you. And he always won with class and dignity. Also when he kicked Saddam out of Kuwait, he had an opportunity to rush to Baghdad and overthrow the entire government. And he was humble enough to know the limitations of American military power. And I think everyone, Republicans and Democrats, look back at that and say that was a very wise and humble and noble decision. Juan picked up on a few things. The personal relationships he had with people, professional relationships, friendships, he really conducted it in a classy way. He communicated on stationary or picking up the phone. And he did that for so many decades that he generated so much goodwill. And towards the end, the Republican Party was the party of Bush. The rolodex, all of the people that he knew, the networks across the entire country, just had so much honor and reverence for him and his family that when he called and asked for something it was sure. It wasn't a political favor. It was you're doing something for a friend. And then lastly, love. In terms of his relationship with Barbara and his sons publicly, at least, you'd think a man of his generation wouldn't be conditioned to show that kind of affection towards other people, especially his family in public.  But his love and affection, the way he displayed it was very modern. He wasn't afraid of embracing people and crying and articulating that love.  And I think every father and every son in this country should look at the relationship that he had with his sons and say that is how a true father- son relationship should be."

And if you read his letters, you can see it. And, you know, the written word always lasts so much longer than, you know, what you say on TV, or what you say during a debate, or what have you. And that's a beautiful thing for him because what a great legacy to leave behind. And, you know, Vice President Mike Pence talked about this yesterday when the former president -- when he wrote a letter to his son when he landed his first tail hook landing as a marine aviator and saying that he shares the pride that Mike Pence has in his son. You look at the letter he left Bill Clinton saying that you're our president, I am rooting for you, even though he defeated him and he was a one term president. What a beautiful thing to have that sort of character to leave that message for Bill Clinton. You look at the love letters to Barbara and what a beautiful, loving relationship that they had as a couple. The letter that he wrote about his daughter Robin who they've lost, and talking about the fact that she's always going to remain with them. So just all these letters, what a beautiful legacy for him to leave behind for future Americans to see the kind of integrity that the man had."

This comes as new court filings due today on former national security advisor Michael Flynn could offer a road map to the Mueller findings. All right, so we're waiting the sentencing memo, Lisa. We have no idea what's going to be in it, but there's a lot of speculation. One of the things we do know is that James Comey did tell congressional investigators that he didn't think Flynn intentionally lied when the feds questioned him."

Because you're right, Chairman Chuck Grassley of the judiciary committee has said that when Comey met with congressional investigators, the investigators led them to believe that they didn't think Flynn had lied. And then Mueller takes over the special counsel investigation and then Flynn pleads to lying and pleads guilty to lying.  So -- and then also, Chairman Grassley has been on DOJ and the FBI to, one, give them the 302's with the interview that they conducted with Flynn so that they could see what kind of questions were, what Flynn said. And they've also asked for the transcript of Flynn's conversation with the former ambassador, Kislyak, as well. None of those things have been provided to the chairman yet. So I have a big question about that, did Flynn actually lie and that the tactics -- I think it also speaks to sort of the tactics of Mueller as well. Those hard-nose tactics."

I don't know if he's going to get it or not, but I sure think when you're seeing people break the law and illegally entering the United States like we're seeing now, and also what we saw most recently with almost a thousand people trying to rush the Southern border, it sure makes President Trump's point for needing -- boosting border security along the southern border. We also have that Yale study most recently saying that the numbers are probably closer to 22 million illegal immigrants living in the United States.

I think that -- I don't think the government will shut down. And besides, the Republican congress working with the White House was able to get so much done on the spending front up to now.  So a lot of those spending bills are already done. It only affects about 25 percent of the government if it does happen. I don't think it will come to that. I think the president will end up having a compromise. But talk about whistling past the graveyard. If the Democrats don't realize images like this sears into the minds of people. You see children being drop that far.  It's not ending well for the caravan participants or the -- I don't know what we want to call them, but the caravan-ers -- they are putting children lives in danger. I understand that they care about their kids, that they want to get something done, but the American people are not going to stand for this, and Democrats better figure this out, figure out a way to get past their far left and come to the table with President Trump on it, or else they're going to find more losses in 2020."

Mr. Bozo Face, said that -- he was comparing the caravan, the migrants coming, to Martians in his backyard.  So apparently, he has Martians. The Martians have landed. And then you have this other weird part where the media is blaming Donald Trump for the caravan, thousands of people coming. Only the left could hear Trump say, \"You better not come\" and hear \"He's telling them to come!\"  No, he was telling them don't come. It's not going to end well. To quote Dana, it's not going to end well. And left are, \"Oh, it's obviously his fault. He's encouraging them to come.\" No, it was manufactured.

But the problem for Joe Biden is I don't think he can get there, because Democrats are going to have a really crowded primary field, just like Republicans did. And the reason why President Trump was able to make his way through that crowded primary field was because he was so vastly different than the other candidates that were in the mix. Joe Biden isn't that different than, you know, the -- maybe 30-something candidates that are going to run.
