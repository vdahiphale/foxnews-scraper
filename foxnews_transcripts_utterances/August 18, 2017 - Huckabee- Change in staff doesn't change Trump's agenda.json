      "sentences": "Kimberly, good evening to you. And we're just getting at this hour a little bit of a different timeline here then we had originally. Originally, it looked like John Kelly was doing a review of all of the positions at the White House, in particular, Steve Bannon's, and that maybe Kelly was looking at him as not the sort of person that he wanted to have on the team. And that may still be true, but now we're learning from an actual White House official -- and this is not sources from the outside, which were the initial source of this -- hearing from a White House official that Steve Bannon, in fact, tendered his resignation to the president back on August the 7th. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, again, it may be that there was discussions with John Kelly back then as he was pretty much brand-new as the chief of staff, that perhaps Steve Bannon wouldn't hang around or that President Trump had indicated to Steve Bannon that he expected that was going to to leave at some point, or it may be just that Steve Bannon thought that his time had come to an end and that it was time to leave. But that would seem to argue against the notion that Steve Bannon was fired by the president today or fired by the chief of staff if, in fact, he offered his resignation, as a White House source says, back on the 7th. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But here's the official take from the White House. Quote, \"White House chief of staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. We are grateful for his service and we wish him the best.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's no question that the president is going to lose a close ally ideologically, at very least, with Steve Bannon's departure, but all indications are that when Bannon leaves the White House, he will continue to work on behalf of the president and may actually continue to work against, and maybe ever more vigorously against the establishment section of the Republican Party that he clearly was at odds with during his time inside the White House, Kimberly.",

      "sentences": "Kimberly, a dramatic day here at the White House, even though President Trump was at Camp David for a national security meeting and then back to New Jersey to his golf club on this working vacation -- Steve Bannon out, as you suggested, General John Kelly, the new chief of staff, clearly trying again to bring some order around here. He put out a very terse statement saying that there was mutual agreement between Kelly and Bannon that it was time for him to go, and he wished him well in the future. And I can tell you that Bannon wasted absolutely no time going right back to the conservative news site Breitbart. In fact, just hours after he'd left the White House, he was chairing their nightly editorial meeting, we're told, right back in the driver's seat of that news organization. Now, there's a narrative taking hold in the mainstream media that somehow, Bannon is going to be waging war against President Trump by using Breitbart to go after the president, but a source close to Bannon insisted to me today that that is not true and that Bannon is 100 percent behind the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In fact, Bannon did an interview with Bloomberg News saying in part, quote, \"If there's any confusion out there, let me clear it up. I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump, against his opponents on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then later, in an interview with The Weekly Standard, Bannon says, quote, \"The Trump presidency that we fought for and won is over. We still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency, but that presidency is over. It'll be something else, and there will be all kinds of fights. And there will be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over,\" at least suggesting that phase of the Trump presidency is over. What comes now? I can tell you in talking to senior Republicans today not just here at the White House but on Capitol Hill, as well, they want to see an end to the palace intrigue, the speculation. And they want to see the president get back on his agenda, tax cuts and all the rest. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's Republican congressman Lee Zeldin. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

A low point for me during the Obama administration, when we knew we had a president, we had a secretary of state, we had a national security advisor that had abandoned Americans to die during an Islamic terrorist attack and then they lied about it. And nothing was ever done. No one ever remembers those four Americans who lost their lives and the family members who were shot. And so when I think of about someone like a Wolf Blitzer, obviously he's quite delusional. He has not been around for quite some time because the terrorists have been using this vehicular attack, this terrorist style attack, going back to Bastille Day in Nice, France, going back to what happened at the German Christmas market, going back just recently is what we have seen happen in England. So again, everything has to be about what their message du jour is right now, is everyone is a white supremacist, everyone is a neo-Nazi or Klan member as long as they don't agree with their agenda. And what I do find interesting is that you have someone like Maxine Waters and others in the Democrat Party who so fight for Planned Parenthood, but yet Margaret Sanger was an incredibly well-known white supremacist.",

Arpaio said, look, I simply followed the advice of my lawyer at the time who did not provide me with all of the restrictions contained in the order. I looked at the order itself. It's vague and ambiguous and really kind of hard to decide what the restrictions are. If you had put this case in front of a jury, and it probably should be in front of a jury since jail time is the penalty, he would have been acquitted I'm pretty certain.

      "utterance": "Kimberly, good evening to you. And we're just getting at this hour a little bit of a different timeline here then we had originally. Originally, it looked like John Kelly was doing a review of all of the positions at the White House, in particular, Steve Bannon's, and that maybe Kelly was looking at him as not the sort of person that he wanted to have on the team. And that may still be true, but now we're learning from an actual White House official -- and this is not sources from the outside, which were the initial source of this -- hearing from a White House official that Steve Bannon, in fact, tendered his resignation to the president back on August the 7th. Now, again, it may be that there was discussions with John Kelly back then as he was pretty much brand-new as the chief of staff, that perhaps Steve Bannon wouldn't hang around or that President Trump had indicated to Steve Bannon that he expected that was going to to leave at some point, or it may be just that Steve Bannon thought that his time had come to an end and that it was time to leave. But that would seem to argue against the notion that Steve Bannon was fired by the president today or fired by the chief of staff if, in fact, he offered his resignation, as a White House source says, back on the 7th. But here's the official take from the White House. Quote, \"White House chief of staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. We are grateful for his service and we wish him the best.\" It's no question that the president is going to lose a close ally ideologically, at very least, with Steve Bannon's departure, but all indications are that when Bannon leaves the White House, he will continue to work on behalf of the president and may actually continue to work against, and maybe ever more vigorously against the establishment section of the Republican Party that he clearly was at odds with during his time inside the White House, Kimberly."

He put out a very terse statement saying that there was mutual agreement between Kelly and Bannon that it was time for him to go, and he wished him well in the future. And I can tell you that Bannon wasted absolutely no time going right back to the conservative news site Breitbart. In fact, just hours after he'd left the White House, he was chairing their nightly editorial meeting, we're told, right back in the driver's seat of that news organization. Now, there's a narrative taking hold in the mainstream media that somehow, Bannon is going to be waging war against President Trump by using Breitbart to go after the president, but a source close to Bannon insisted to me today that that is not true and that Bannon is 100 percent behind the president. In fact, Bannon did an interview with Bloomberg News saying in part, quote, \"If there's any confusion out there, let me clear it up. I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump, against his opponents on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America.\" And then later, in an interview with The Weekly Standard, Bannon says, quote, \"The Trump presidency that we fought for and won is over. We still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency, but that presidency is over. It'll be something else, and there will be all kinds of fights. And there will be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over,\" at least suggesting that phase of the Trump presidency is over. What comes now? I can tell you in talking to senior Republicans today not just here at the White House but on Capitol Hill, as well, they want to see an end to the palace intrigue, the speculation. And they want to see the president get back on his agenda, tax cuts and all the rest. Here's Republican congressman Lee Zeldin."

The president at that now famous news conference at Trump Tower on Tuesday made it clear that he beat out all of the other Republican candidates in the primary and was the leader of this movement that beat Clinton and now wants to get back aggressively to that legislative agenda -- Kimberly."

The fact that some carpenters come and go on the job site doesn't change the design of the construction. And I think everybody gets all excited about who comes, who goes. Look, it's the president's agenda. And everyone who works there, including my own daughter, work at the pleasure of the president.

I think he'll still serve the president. But Kimberly, let me bring up something I haven't heard anyone talk about in all this week of bad publicity for Donald Trump. You know one group of people that has stuck with him absolutely? His faith council, the people who surround him from the evangelical community who were very instrumental in his election. They have not wavered. They had not in any way stumbled. And I think that he should step back and take a look and realize that he has some real key supporters who are good and decent people who are sticking with him because they do believe that he represents for them protection of religious liberty and also an agenda that helps to get America back on track.

And I just asked him straight up, Are these rumors true? What's going on? And can you talk? And he very frankly told me, Yes, Sara, that is correct. I gave my letter of resignation two weeks ago. And you know, Kimberly, we're hearing all of these stories that he was fired, that he was pushed out. I actually heard from sources that the president was trying to figure out a way to keep him on board. But you know, both of them had come to this realization that this was probably what he needed to do. So it's just interesting to hear all the rumors. I wanted to talk to the people directly, and that's what I did. And fortunately, Mr. Bannon was willing to talk to me."

Steve Bannon certainly didn't arrive at his political positions on a lark. And I that it's in -- very much in both of their best interests to continue, you know, pushing forward. Steve Bannon has a lot to be proud of today. He helped get Donald Trump elected. Before that, he gave a tremendous voice to millions of Americans who had been kind of left out of the political process for a very long time. Steve Bannon, I know, remains completely committed to that agenda, which is now the Trump agenda. And I don't think that we're going to Steve Bannon do anything but try to, you know, put his shoulder to the wheel. And -- and -- you know, and Donald -- and -- and Steve Bannon inside the White House -- he's not an establishment guy. He's not an insider guy. He's best when he's a barbarian at the gate and he's leading an army of crusaders trying to get something done. That's where he is best. And I think in a lot of ways, doing what we're going to see him do over the next three years, I think that he will prove to be tremendously effective, every bit as effective as he was before he joined the Trump campaign."

And whether it's on, you know, climate change or international trade or illegal immigration or fighting terrorism, all of these things -- he has not budged from what -- you know, the center of what his commitments were to the voters. And that's why -- so if -- so what? Steve Bannon departs. I don't think that means that Donald Trump is going to renege on any of those things. I think he's going to remain -- I think he's going to remain every bit as committed to those things as he was if Steve Bannon never left."

When you look at this and kind of put it and frame it in the lens of what has happened in terms of the arguments and what's been going forward in this country about white supremacy and nationalists, do think any of that, that emotional rhetoric and that charged environment had anything to hasten the demise and departure of Mr. Bannon?"

But it could have played a role in there. Look, I think the bigger issue really within the White House was this kind of ideological break that people had as far as, like, the Iran deal. That was huge. And you know, McMaster and Bannon butted heads over and over again with that. China was another big issue, which is why he talked to American Prospect, I think, and gave that very kind of stunning interview. And remember he contacted them, they didn't contact him. He just gave up that information. So I think a lot of the issues there are just really policy and ideology. How do we move forward with foreign policy, national policy?"

And I think President Trump is, you know, going to keep a very watchful eye on what goes on within the White House and see how these policies kind of evolve. Remember, the Iran deal comes up for reauthorization again in September, and I think it'll be interesting to see whether he reauthorizes that again or not, and whether McMaster is able to push him in that direction and whether Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will do the same.

      "utterance": "Good to be with you, Kimberly. What I find very interesting is that everything now has to come back to white supremacists. Everything now has to be about racism. I was listening to some of the clips you were playing. A low point for me during the Obama administration, when we knew we had a president, we had a secretary of state, we had a national security advisor that had abandoned Americans to die during an Islamic terrorist attack and then they lied about it. And nothing was ever done. No one ever remembers those four Americans who lost their lives and the family members who were shot. And so when I think of about someone like a Wolf Blitzer, obviously he's quite delusional. He has not been around for quite some time because the terrorists have been using this vehicular attack, this terrorist style attack, going back to Bastille Day in Nice, France, going back to what happened at the German Christmas market, going back just recently is what we have seen happen in England. So again, everything has to be about what their message du jour is right now, is everyone is a white supremacist, everyone is a neo-Nazi or Klan member as long as they don't agree with their agenda. And what I do find interesting is that you have someone like Maxine Waters and others in the Democrat Party who so fight for Planned Parenthood, but yet Margaret Sanger was an incredibly well-known white supremacist."

And just to dovetail on your comments, you have a lot of these jihad inspired magazines, \"Inspire,\" et cetera, talking about the kind of terrorist playbook of what you need to do. And that's been widely distributed in terms of using vehicles to commit acts of terror. So this isn't something that just fell out of the terror lap."

And you have never heard anyone from the left really come out and condemn Islamic supremacy. When you look at the terrorist attacks that have happened in the United States of America, Fort Hood with Major Nidal Hasan is still classified as workplace violence. The president of the United States of America never said anything about the Chattanooga attack that killed five of our sailors and marines on a Naval Reserve installation. When you look at Orlando or San Bernardino, there is no accepting that this was an Islamic supremacist attack or jihadist attack. It was about gun control.

A nationwide manhunt is underway right now in Spain for at least one suspect wanted in connection with yesterday's terror attacks. Fourteen people were killed in the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils, more than 100 others were injured. Police killed five suspects in a shootout yesterday and captured two others. Police say they were members of a Catalonia based terror cell. The one American who died in the Barcelona attack has been identified as Jared Tucker of California. President Trump tweeting tonight he has signed House Bill number 873 into law. The bill allows the global war on Terror Memorial Foundation to establish a memorial on federal land in the District of Columbia. The memorial will commemorate and honor members of the armed forces who saw active duty in the war against global terrorism. I am Jackie Ibanez.

Maryland has now removed a statue of the U.S. Supreme Court justice who wrote the 1857 Dred Scott decision. And in Arizona, the Jefferson Davis memorial was literally tarred and feathered. Joining us now with reaction, radio talk show host James T. Harris and Fox News contributor and Democratic pollster Doug Schoen, and founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk. Gentlemen, thank you for joining me tonight on this explosive issue that continues to grip the nation. James, I'm going to begin with you. So President Trump earlier this week said that the issue of Confederate statues and monuments should be an issue that is best left to the states and to the cities. Do you agree?"

      "utterance": "Yes, I do agree. Before I was a radio talk show host I spent 10 years as a high school history teacher, and I taught my students the good, the bad, and the ugly of history. And there are lessons in this. I look at what is happening across the nation, the taking away of Confederate monuments, in horror because of the important lessons that are being lost, the opportunities to teach about how to avoid these mistakes that we made in the past."

We need to move past these symbolic issues, however wrenching. Talk about tax reform, we need to talk about infrastructure and fixing health care. We need, in short, to talk about the real problems and the challenges overseas from nations like Iran and North Korea. We can't get mired down in talking about Confederate monuments. I think we should leave it to localities. I don't like them, but the larger issue is who we are as a people and how we move forward, not symbolic politics."

      "utterance": "OK, Doug, there's been some polling on that. I want to stay with you for a moment. And 62 percent of Americans according to recent polls believe that the Confederate monuments should stay. Is it a losing issue for the Democrats, and yet you also say that the president should redirect and talk about other issues instead of focusing on it?"

    {
      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "I would say, Kimberly, it's a losing issue for everyone. I respect southerners and the majority of Americans who don't want to get rid of them. On the other hand, they are symbols of racism and oppression and I don't really think they have a place. But the larger issue is to focus on our real problems that we face now. And our adversaries here, our problems at home, and to not do it Steve Bannon is saying he's going to do, go to war. I saw come together."

      "speaker": "CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA",
      "utterance": "I agree with Doug. I think that it is the time for unification. And it's best left to the states and localities. Unfortunately this is an issue that is only going to get bigger. There are leftwing activists groups that are not going to rest until every single Confederate statue or name is removed from everywhere. So there has to be a position that is made, unfortunately. One last point on this that's really important. I think there is this implicit or explicit war on the south. And we have to take a step back. Look, 40 percent of the active U.S. military is from a collection of 11 states, and those states are south of the Mason-Dixon line. And there's a war on everything southern is wrong. I'm not going to disagree that these monuments are not symbols of racism. Some are. But some are just remembering the valor and the bravery of the people that put forth their lives and their time to a cause that they found noble. So I will say unfortunately this issue is only going to get bigger. I wish we were talking about infrastructure and jobs and taxes and government overreach, but this is it an issue that the left wants to keep talking about."

We are literally enslaving our kids with hundreds, or trillions of dollars of debt. We have our inner cities are blowing up. We are looking at 300, or millions of people who have been aborted, and what will the future say about us when we erect monuments to ourselves? They're going to be tearing them down. We need to be very, very careful about sitting in judgment of the past. These monuments are very important. They're very important lessons. The Democrats can learn from General Lee who after he was defeated by the union decided, you know what, I'm going to work with them instead of trying to join a resistance or to try to join some type of guerrilla warfare. These are important lessons that need to stay put."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity.\" President Trump is making news over the possibility of pardoning former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio who was found guilty of criminal contempt last month. In a recent exclusive interview, President Trump told our colleague, Gregg Jarrett, quote, \"I am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio. He has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. He's a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him.\" And in an interview with NPR yesterday Arpaio said he would be honored if President Trump does decide to grant him a pardon. Here with reaction is Fox News anchor and attorney Gregg Jarrett. Gregg, congratulations on getting that interview with the president. A lot of people talking about because of the upcoming trip. What do you think the outcome of that is going to be and the likelihood of the president issuing a pardon?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR AND ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "I would say there's a better than 50 percent chance that on Tuesday when the president speaks at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, a huge venue, that he may take the opportunity then in front of a very friendly crowd to pardon Joe Arpaio. Maybe Arpaio will be there, I don't know. But when I spoke to the president, he really was very moved by the circumstances of this misdemeanor conviction of Sheriff Joe. He felt it was unfair. It was a political prosecution that began in the Obama administration's Department of Justice. I've looked at a lot of the record on that conviction and it is very, very questionable. Arpaio said, look, I simply followed the advice of my lawyer at the time who did not provide me with all of the restrictions contained in the order. I looked at the order itself. It's vague and ambiguous and really kind of hard to decide what the restrictions are. If you had put this case in front of a jury, and it probably should be in front of a jury since jail time is the penalty, he would have been acquitted I'm pretty certain. So I think the president will probably go ahead and pardon Arpaio. Again, it's a misdemeanor, so we are talking about small potatoes."

And it was really the first big venue of the cheering crowd that helped launch his candidacy for president. And it's true he only one back by 3.5 percent over Hillary Clinton, but Arizonans really do like Donald Trump. Representative Trent Franks who hardily endorses a pardon is going to be there. He has a lot of fans, and I think this may be the time he pardons Arpaio. It's not like --"

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Would there be political fallout from that? Because some have said oh, no, poor Joe Arpaio, because it looked like he was going to get it, but then in light in the aftermath of Charlottesville and the racial tensions and sort of what has been boiling over in the country, when you put those two in the juxtaposition of them both, is the timing not as favorable?"

      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "It will be for his many critics in the liberal media. It doesn't matter what the president does. They will always criticize him. And I think he realizes that. And it's not like -- compare it to the last president, President Obama, who commuted the sentence of Chelsea Clinton -- Chelsea Manning, excuse me, who stole 750,000 documents, classified documents, leaked them, did damage to national security and the military. You compare it to that, and criminal misdemeanor is minor compared to what Obama did in commuting the sentence of Chelsea Manning."
