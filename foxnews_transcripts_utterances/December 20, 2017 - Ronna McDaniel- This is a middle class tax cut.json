Keep in mind, a number of guys on the Hill, men and women, have been working on this for years and in some cases even decades. Now, I know that you will get into the weeds on the particulars. But for the folks that don't know money as well as you do, let me just share a little of the details about the tax bill while we have a moment. It reduces the corporate rate to 21 percent down from 35. If you're earning between $49,000 and $86,000, you are going to get an average tax cut of about $930. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Families making $86,000 to $149,000, even bigger, just over $1,800.

Many of these tax cuts could sunset by 2026 unless congressional lawmakers do something. And the state and local tax write-offs are certain to decrease. And one more nugget, I think the folks at home might find this interesting, especially if you're trying to buy a house or if you own a house. Mortgage deduction capped at $750,000. Now, that's actually a bit of a compromise. I know some lawmakers are telling me they wanted it right around $500,000. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But if you are on the coast, East and West, where property is super expensive, $750,000 is actually a better deal than you might have seen before.

Let's be real clear here. Listen, I think it's great what AT&T is doing. Putting money in people's pockets in great. Investing in plant equipment is great. That's why we needed to get down the corporate tax rate. We were so uncompetitive. We had one of the highest in the world. I think there was maybe two other countries, and they weren't exactly like major players that were ahead of us in this thing. And it makes us less -- it hurts our competitiveness.

They're actually raising taxes for people, and a lot of them are not rich fat cats. These are what would be middle class in New York, California, New Jersey, really raising their taxes, by not lowering the top rate that much and getting rid of all these deductions to pay for this corporate tax rate, which I think is necessary. And that is not tax reform. That is something that Reagan -- Reagan did not do that. George Bush didn't do that. And Donald Trump is doing that.

These incentives change the equation that determines whether or not people want an electric vehicle. So, electric vehicles, such as the Chevy Volt, the Tesla Model 3, they all have sales prices around $30,000 after the credit. So it's going to be helpful to those companies. Now, on a fuel-related theme, Neil, after 40 years of wrangling, Congress voted to open Alaska's remote Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, otherwise known as ANWR, to oil and natural gas drilling. So, House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke about the decades and the decades that it took. He said some of the people that he's working with have been working on this particular project all of their lives. Here's his quote: \"We're opening a small non-wilderness area of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge for responsible development.\" And, in his words, he said, \"It is the most ambitious step we have taken in years to secure our energy future.\" Now, environmentalists see the vote as a defeat. They have basically been fighting since the 1970s to block drilling in Alaska. The tax law also appeals the individual mandate to purchase health insurance, a big hit, of course, to the 2010 law the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. So the requirement that all Americans carry health insurance, or face a penalty, that penalty has been removed. So, lots of changes in this first major overhaul of the nation's tax laws since 1986.

That eases up, I think, some of the frustration on the part of travelers, who may have someone who is not as familiar with traveling as they are in front of them that might be, in their view, holding them up a little bit.

A perfunctory vote. And then everybody to the South Lawn of the White House, a who's-who of the Republican Party to say, we have just done it. We have just passed a generational tax cut, the likes of which we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan was president of the United States, and now confident that in short order this will be signed by this president of the United States. Here's thing, though. With all the hoopla, pageantry, and remarks, one after another today, it's not been signed by the president of the United States, so it's not quite a done deal.

But the fact is probably mid next week, after this thing is enrolled on the Hill and reviewed by the White House, he is going to sign this thing, and ultimately we can all say yes, indeed, Neil, this was a historic day here at the White House, not just for congressional lawmakers, but obviously for the president himself, making good on a promise to overhaul the nation's tax code.

Keep in mind, a number of guys on the Hill, men and women, have been working on this for years and in some cases even decades. Now, I know that you will get into the weeds on the particulars. But for the folks that don't know money as well as you do, let me just share a little of the details about the tax bill while we have a moment. It reduces the corporate rate to 21 percent down from 35. If you're earning between $49,000 and $86,000, you are going to get an average tax cut of about $930. Families making $86,000 to $149,000, even bigger, just over $1,800. It should be larger, we're told, by congressional lawmakers. But I should also point this out, Neil. Many of these tax cuts could sunset by 2026 unless congressional lawmakers do something. And the state and local tax write-offs are certain to decrease. And one more nugget, I think the folks at home might find this interesting, especially if you're trying to buy a house or if you own a house. Mortgage deduction capped at $750,000. Now, that's actually a bit of a compromise. I know some lawmakers are telling me they wanted it right around $500,000. But if you are on the coast, East and West, where property is super expensive, $750,000 is actually a better deal than you might have seen before. Anyway, historic day no matter how you slice it -- Neil, back to you."

But the AT&T one stuck out to me at least, probably to my buddy Charlie Gasparino over at FOX Business Network, because that is in a bitter struggle with the administration over getting that he Time Warner deal approved. A link there, connection? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, of course it is, because it's more aggressive than Boeing. As you know, Boeing, if they do more charity, I guess they get more write- offs for that, right? Let's be real clear here. Listen, I think it's great what AT&T is doing. Putting money in people's pockets in great. Investing in plant equipment is great. That's why we needed to get down the corporate tax rate. We were so uncompetitive. We had one of the highest in the world. I think there was maybe two other countries, and they weren't exactly like major players that were ahead of us in this thing. And it makes us less -- it hurts our competitiveness. Companies -- listen, I grew up with a lot of guys that were Irish immigrants. They came to the U.S. because of their jobs here, right? Guess what? Jobs are going to Ireland, because corporations can domicile there and get the lower corporate tax rate. And so that's what's going on here. This is a really good thing. That's why the markets like it. Where it gets a little bit muddied is on the individual side. I mean, that is really not a great deal on the individual side. They're actually raising taxes for people, and a lot of them are not rich fat cats. These are what would be middle class in New York, California, New Jersey, really raising their taxes, by not lowering the top rate that much and getting rid of all these deductions to pay for this corporate tax rate, which I think is necessary. And that is not tax reform. That is something that Reagan -- Reagan did not do that. George Bush didn't do that. And Donald Trump is doing that. So what he's doing here -- what Congress and Trump is doing is that they are allowing some very, very -- they're allowing corporations to make a lot of money. A lot of very rich people who work in private equity keep their so-called carried interest deduction. They keep that. That's a huge, huge win for them. That's $2 billion a year for that industry. Real estate is going to get some big breaks, by the way, after this. If Donald Trump wasn't a billionaire before this thing, he is going to be a billionaire after this thing passes."

But remember what the CEO, Randall Stephenson, of AT&T and his board of directors -- they have a fiduciary responsibility. It's not to their workers. It's to their shareholders. So, this -- they can do some of this stuff where they can say, listen, we need to image -- burnish our image. We need to like get some public relations here, because we're fighting the government on our merger, planned merger with Time Warner, which the Trump administration is against, as you know. But, bottom line, that these companies all have to take care of their shareholders before they ever think of taking care of workers. And that's another issue here."

I think that is going to be something that is going to, you know, go across the market. I think a lot of companies are going to do that.

I think we make a big deal of the fact, well, the mainstream media will talk about how it benefits the stock market and all, as if that average folks are impervious to that or it doesn't connect with them. Half are invested in the market directly and up to three-quarters of Americans are directly affected by that market. So, just having said that, but there is this concern that average folks won't see it net-wise in their paycheck. What is your thinking when February rolls around, assuming it's February, and they start seeing it every week or two weeks, depending how often they get paid, and that will make a difference?"

An average family that is making $75,000, a family of four, is going to see $2,000 extra in their paycheck. And let's remember, we have had stagnant wage growth in this country under Obama. People were seeing their wages freeze and their costs go up. This is something that is going to be good for the middle class in this country. And I will say, a police officer pulled the president aside when we were in New York a couple weeks ago, and said, my pension has gone up so much since you have been president. Thank you. So, everyone is going to be affected by this tax cut. It's good for our country and it's good for the American people."

And I think right now you're starting to see these numbers break through. You're seeing record unemployment. You're seeing consumer confidence at an all-time high. You're seeing the stock market. Now you see this middle-class tax cut. You're seeing the deregulation. You're seeing our economy starting to grow again. And you're seeing policies being put in place that are going to help everyone in this country. And President Trump is going to benefit from that.

I think that the optics of signing it somewhere where there is folks that are getting relief, a single mom, a family that's getting some tax cuts out of this bill that is going to mean the world and make a difference for them would be great.

Over and over, they have told us they're going to raise wages. In fact, a lot of our analysis that we have done has been based off of those projections, and then looking at tax cuts in history and what happened and how companies and families reacted.

I tell the story all the time of a mom I met in a grocery store. A handful of coupons and a cart full of generic food, and she said, when is it going to get better? Today, it got better.

Now, never mind that is coming from a side where the debt piled up under their watch. Do you think that that is the next area and then that should be the next focus and that's where bipartisanship might be found?"

We also in the House want to do poverty reform. Our federal programs that are supposed to lift people out of poverty only perpetuate it. So, we want to reform those, so we really can give families another step in that hope to providing for their kids and their grandkids, and making sure that we don't just perpetuate poverty, but we give people an opportunity to go into these new jobs that we're going to help create with this tax cut."

In other words, if you're not going to be individually writing off stuff and you get a larger standard deduction, what would compel you to make a donation, outside of just a good heart, and you don't really focus on that? A cardinal who is very worried. Yes, the archbishop of Washington is next."

And the response, the response of people was extraordinary. Now, we're not a very, very large diocese when it comes to population, but we had almost $800,000 worth of gifts, people just saying, help those people who need help. And I think that's going to continue. Whatever the frame of reference around taxes might be, there's something wonderful about being called simply to help other people in their need, regardless of whether you benefit a lot from it or not. And I think that's the beautiful thing. In fact, that's what Christmas is all about, isn't it? The call. The call to remind us we're supposed to care for one another. We're supposed to be there for one another."

      "speaker": "WUERL",

      "speaker": "WUERL",
      "utterance": "Isn't that the goal, though? We don't have to depend on the government to be able to encourage us to do the things the Gospel asks us to do. In fact, one of the things we have learned in this country over centuries is, we really have to respond in faith to the Gospel, regardless of what the government is saying or doing. And I think that's one of the beautiful things about faith. People of faith, we understand we have an obligation to one another. We have to be there for one another. And we have to care for one another. Now, it helps -- it helps if the tax structure is such that we have some money with which to do that. But it's not dependent on that. And you're right. There should be an equitable distribution of the burden for everyone, so that everyone gets a fair share of the burden and a fair share of the benefit. And we have to wait to see now how this is all going to play out. But the church and people of faith don't depend on a tax structure to be able to live out their faith and do good to one another. And I think that's just a blessing. It's a blessing of faith."

One of the reasons is, we are merry, we are happy at Christmas, because we get to hear all over again that wonderful message of, love one another, that God loves you, God cares for you, God's son is with us. And it's that love that we're called to share and manifest in the world. That's the good news. And of course we're happy. Christmas -- Christmas reminds us of all of that and challenges us to live it, to do it. So, we are merry, we are happy. And I think it's good to hear that back in the vocabulary, back in the language. Be joyful. Care for one another. Love one another. Take care of one another. And while you're doing it, recognize it's reason to be joyful. This is a spirit, a season. This is the season of joy."

You add the tax cuts in there -- and we haven't fully added them in there - - we're off to the races. Do you buy that? Market watcher Heather Zumarraga, and we have got FBN's Charles Payne, the host of \"Making Money.\" I'm telling you, you can actually make money on that show."

It would tell us or anticipate what the economy would be 12 months out, six to 12 months out? We're already seeing record earnings go through the roof. Every single day from every niche of our economy, we're hearing numbers out of this world, whether it was housing, existing housing sales today, housing enthusiasm traffic the highest it's been in 19 years, corporate earnings, corporate America. So, I think we're just building up a nice wind in our sails economically. And that's going to be the underpinnings for this market to go higher. The tax cuts will be an added bonus."

But, look, over the long run, Neil, we're hearing from these companies such as AT&T and FedEx that they are going to be receiving a lot more on their bottom line. That's going to go back into the hands of their employers or their stockholders in the way of investing in plant property and equipment. FedEx said they're hiring workers. And AT&T said that they're giving $1,000 back to their employees, to each employee. That is a big one for our economy. So, the stock market may be pulling back today and in a few days or weeks to come, but next year, get ready, because it's going to continue to rally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Charles, another thing that worries some who look at the markets - - and maybe it's a good thing to worry about -- is, the Federal Reserve sees things picking up, seems so, might continue to raise interest rates, maybe at a faster clip. Market rates hit a nine-month high today on the belief that maybe that is the case. Again, it splits both ways. How do you see that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "You know, I think as long as the Fed is reacting to the economic reality, Wall Street is OK with them hiking rates. In fact, they already have begun that cycle. The market -- the rally didn't miss a beat. And, remember, when Janet Yellen hiked rates in December of 2015, that was one of the worst Januarys in history. I think the Federal Reserve has learned its lesson with respect to hiking rates for any reason other than the fact that the economy is coming on. So, J. Powell is coming in there. I'm not concerned there. In fact that, my only concern is that I'm so excited and so convinced of this market, you kind of want to have some doubt. But right now, I feel really good. Everything I'm looking at points to our economic revival gaining steam."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Heather, it's a point, but I wonder what the rich do. We just showed their rate goes down 39.7 to 37. But offsetting that, a lot of them in these high-tax states might still see a tax hike, Charles, for example."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you see that as a problem? Because they are the engine here for the economy, if you think about it. They account for a disproportionate number of the spending. Right? So, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZUMARRAGA",
      "utterance": "Yes, top 1 percent spend a lot, as well as pay a lot in taxes. So, they really stuck to it the blue states in a sense that, you know, they can no longer deduct state and local taxes above the $10,000 property tax limit. So, I don't think it's enough to have the rich or the wealthy move to a different state. I think that the rich, actually, reducing the rate from 39.6 to 37 percent on that top rate will be a net positive. But you're right. Some of those deductions are no longer there. So, in the end, the rich may pay more. I mean, the liberal media has it wrong. They're saying this is a tax cut for the rich. The rich may end up paying more. This is a tax cut for the middle class, Neil."

All right, a lot of people are saying, well, the one thing we're sure the Republicans got rid of were a lot of these little loopholes that were tucked in there for, I don't know, things like electric cars. What if I told you not at all? They're charged. Are you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, this was one that actually surprised me, because I know a lot of Republicans, they are not big on these tax credits. Then again, they did have that child care credit. But they kept one that really stunned me, a $7,500 tax credit for electric cars. That stays in the bill. Now, a lot of people look at that and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is one thing you were against. I understand how these things come to fruition. But, bottom line, Deirdre Bolton of FOX Business Network, I was surprised. How about you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, it was surprising, because, at one point, there was discussion that, OK, well, maybe these incentives would be taken away. To your point, very much left in. And let's just say carmakers are very happy. GM's CEO Mary Barra is saying this really changes things in a positive light, she says. These incentives change the equation that determines whether or not people want an electric vehicle. So, electric vehicles, such as the Chevy Volt, the Tesla Model 3, they all have sales prices around $30,000 after the credit. So it's going to be helpful to those companies. Now, on a fuel-related theme, Neil, after 40 years of wrangling, Congress voted to open Alaska's remote Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, otherwise known as ANWR, to oil and natural gas drilling. So, House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke about the decades and the decades that it took. He said some of the people that he's working with have been working on this particular project all of their lives."

      "speaker": "Here's his quote",
      "utterance": "\"We're opening a small non-wilderness area of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge for responsible development.\" And, in his words, he said, \"It is the most ambitious step we have taken in years to secure our energy future.\" Now, environmentalists see the vote as a defeat. They have basically been fighting since the 1970s to block drilling in Alaska. The tax law also appeals the individual mandate to purchase health insurance, a big hit, of course, to the 2010 law the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. So the requirement that all Americans carry health insurance, or face a penalty, that penalty has been removed. So, lots of changes in this first major overhaul of the nation's tax laws since 1986. Here we are, Neil -- back to you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Yes. And critics did certainly raise that point, saying, OK, really? Who are you helping out? But then when you look at some of these prices, the Chevy Volt is one of the more popular ones that is available around $30,000. And then, of course, Tesla does have the sedan that is meant to be a little bit more price-competitive. But, yes, you're not alone, Neil Cavuto, in thinking that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEKOSKE",
      "utterance": "Well, for travelers, the basic rule would be, particularly in a busy season like this, the holiday season, just past the Thanksgiving holiday period as well, is just give yourself a little bit more time. So, get to the airport a little bit earlier than you might otherwise. And then just pay attention for the transportation security officer, the first person you see in the line, and follow their directions. I think, once you do that, it goes very smoothly."

Of course, the Atlanta situation with the airport there when the lights went out, that's not the TSA's fault, I grant you, but it did lead to some pandemonium. People eventually calm down and all of that, but it gets them nervous. What happens then?"

But we worked very closely with the airlines and the airports there. And everything was cleared out Monday. So, it ended up working out very well due to the great cooperation of our partners and really the patience of our travelers."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEKOSKE",
      "utterance": "Well, we're always worried about what is the newest thing that the bad guys would be using. And so we try to stay a couple of steps ahead of where they are. We look at our technology. We look at our procedures, try to refresh those on a continuous basis, so that we do stay ahead of them. But one of the things that really helps us out a lot is passengers. And passengers who are in a line or in the airport or in a mass transit system. If they see something that just doesn't seem right to them, what we would encourage them to do is to go up to a Transportation Security Administration officer if they see one, or to a police officer who may be nearby, and just mention it to them, because something that doesn't seem right is something that all of us want to investigate a little bit further."

A number in both parties have expressed support to at least hear each side out. Obviously, the TSA and security at airports could and likely will be part of that. What do we need?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEKOSKE",
      "utterance": "Well, we need -- when TSA first was formed, we basically worked into the existing infrastructure at airports. And, of course, some airports have modernized over those 16 years. But many have not had the opportunity to do that just yet. And so we would like to design security areas in airports with security in mind, not just as an area that we had available to us that we could put security there. So, the biggest thing for us is to work closely with the airports and the airlines to make sure that they're aware of our requirements and for the future and that we build security in from the very beginning."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "How do you deal -- we always talk about keeping people safe. You talk about be extra early, get there extra early. But for a lot of flyers, it's their fellow flyers that they have altercations with, not TSA guards and all of that. What do you do to try to urge everyone to keep their calm?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEKOSKE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's key is just to keep calm and be patient and know that it's going to be -- with a lot of people, it's going to take you just a little bit longer. A couple things we're doing, though, is we're trying to put in place in some airports -- we have got about 106 of a new kind of a security lane in place where, rather than waiting for the person immediately in front of you to take all their stuff out of the carry-on bag and put it in a bin, now five passengers can do that all simultaneously. That eases up, I think, some of the frustration on the part of travelers, who may have someone who is not as familiar with traveling as they are in front of them that might be, in their view, holding them up a little bit. But I think the biggest thing is, this is a joyous time of year, it's a happy time of year, and just would encourage people to be patient. And, like I said, if they see something that bothers them, that they don't think is quite right, just say something to somebody that can do something about it."
