You had the Bidens visit former President Carter and Rosalynn Carter in Georgia without masks inside, and then as they are walking out of the house, they put on their masks outside, and even though the CDC guidelines said you didn't have to do that, they are all vaccinated. So what about all of this? We'll start there, bring in our panel, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital, Morgan Ortagus, former State Department spokesperson, and Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist.\" Ben, where are we now, and what do you think this all means? BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": We are in the total upside down, Bret, where all of these different political theater elements are coming together where they are clashing with the experience of the average American person. One of the reasons I think that you saw the ratings, for instance, for the NFLS drafts first round, for the Kentucky Derby be as good as they were compared to Joe Biden's speech is that one of them looked like a post-apocalyptic wasteland where the Congress had been wiped out by something terrible, and the flipside was, frankly, something that approached normalcy, which is what people actually want to see and want to experience. When the president is talking about, oh, maybe you will be able to go out and have that July 4th party, guess what? People aren't waiting to hear his permission in order to do so. They are going to do so anyway. And that's something that I think really don't appreciate when it comes to the power of Washington. Washington really is under the impression that they can dictate all of these things. But the reality for the American people is they're going to live the way that they want, the way according to what they perceive in their communities.

I listened to the lead-in with then vice president Biden, now President Biden, talk about how he had one date, then another date, he said things during the campaign, he said things as president. That's because vaccination rates are changing. One of the things that could really help us reach the normalcy that I think Ben aspires to and we all want is if everyone got vaccinated. Some of the most alarming news coming now is that vaccination rates are slowing for some odd, bizarre reason. What is clear if you are vaccinated you have less than a 0.1 percent chance of getting the virus. That's what we all should be aiming for. New York City where I live, 80 percent of the students, even though the schools are open, are not back in school. They are learning remotely. So they're in school but they're learning remotely. We know the damage that's having on kids. I think one of the things the administration should begin talking about more and maybe working with Congress on is some summer school programs for kids around the country, some summer enrichment programs for kids where we might be able to put them in schools or put them in settings where this learning can take place, because without a doubt it's had a negative impacts on kids. But I don't know the alternative. Do we want to put them in school and risk serious sickness or death? I don't think that's what we wanted, certainly not what I wanted.
