Let's not forget, one time, I think 10 years, he worked at \"The Washington Post\", journalist, author, Ron Kessler, reported that Vice President Joe Biden not that long ago apparently loved to swim naked, all the time, even in front of female Secret Service agents who were really uncomfortable with that.

In that sense, it's not funny, is it? Biden's office had no comment when these claims were published. And tonight, while many Democrats rushed to Biden's defense, one person is noticeably not defending his former VP, his boss. Remember, this is storybook, man. He is African-American. He is clean, bright and articulate. His former boss, President Obama. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And by the way his creepy behavior is now -- Biden, of course, in the spotlight. Other potentially more serious scandals are brewing for him tonight. Don't forget, he has to run on his and Obama's disastrous economy. The dumb Iranian deal, his crazy comments and there's tons of them had positions on racial issues. You know, spend a whole weekend on his apology tour on Anita Hill and immigration. And coming up, \"The Hill's\" John Solomon will join us with a live report on Biden's extremely sketchy international conflicts of interest, potentially resulting in millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars going to close members of Biden's family. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We first turn to our HANNITY watch at the crisis at our southern border. DHS Secretary Kirsten Nielsen is calling the rapidly deteriorating situation a category five hurricane disaster. Border patrol agents and custom officials, they are overwhelmed again tonight with this influx of illegal immigration, currently there are 1 million illegal immigrants inside the United States with active final removal orders. Some are violent criminals, some wreaking havoc, at a community near you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A convicted killer, MS-13 gang member, previously deported just arrested in Long Island, New York, after illegally reentering the country for second time. Oh, yes, he was involved in a manslaughter case and convicted. In Maryland, three MS-13 gang members, well, they just pled guilty to killing a person with machetes. Their immigration status is unknown, but the MS-13 gang is primarily composed of individuals from El Salvador, on the Central American countries where the migrate caravans are being formed. And now, President Trump is threatening to close the southern border completely if Mexico does not stop the massive new caravan that is headed our way. Yes, another one, a very serious situation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The left, they're not getting the memo. It doesn't matter how many homicides, sexual assaults, violent assaults by illegal criminal aliens are impacting American families every day. \"The Washington Post,\" what are they worried about?

Donald Trump is lying about the border in order to build his monument to racism. OK. On this program, we actually take our job seriously, so instead of screaming that walls and borders are racist, well, we actually sent our very own Fox News contributor, investigative reporter Lawrence Jones to Laredo, Texas, where he toured the borders, spoke to agents on the ground. He's going to join us in a minute, who assured him this crisis is very real. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why don't we may be listened to the people that are there that are doing the hard work and protecting the country from drugs, gangs, cartels, et cetera?

And Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 to have their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California for a sport they never played. The allegations have cost Lori Loughlin her television shows and endorsements. The damage to Felicity Huffman's career remains unclear.

Remember we saw her at the hearings of Kavanaugh. Here's Alyssa Milano. She was one of the leaders of the believe all woman charge against Kavanaugh, as insane as some of those charges became."

      "utterance": "All right. That's funny. One more bad piece of advice news, creepy crazy Uncle Joe. The story is only going to get bigger and bigger. Look at \"The New York Post\" this morning. Being weird and inappropriate is a pattern of behavior for the vice president. Let's not forget, one time, I think 10 years, he worked at \"The Washington Post\", journalist, author, Ron Kessler, reported that Vice President Joe Biden not that long ago apparently loved to swim naked, all the time, even in front of female Secret Service agents who were really uncomfortable with that. No swimsuit, nothing, lap after lap after lap. Well, skinny dipping, totally nude. Kessler called it offensive, abusive to his security detail. In that sense, it's not funny, is it? Biden's office had no comment when these claims were published. And tonight, while many Democrats rushed to Biden's defense, one person is noticeably not defending his former VP, his boss. Remember, this is storybook, man. He is African-American. He is clean, bright and articulate. His former boss, President Obama. And by the way his creepy behavior is now -- Biden, of course, in the spotlight. Other potentially more serious scandals are brewing for him tonight. Don't forget, he has to run on his and Obama's disastrous economy. The dumb Iranian deal, his crazy comments and there's tons of them had positions on racial issues. You know, spend a whole weekend on his apology tour on Anita Hill and immigration. And coming up, \"The Hill's\" John Solomon will join us with a live report on Biden's extremely sketchy international conflicts of interest, potentially resulting in millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars going to close members of Biden's family. We first turn to our HANNITY watch at the crisis at our southern border. DHS Secretary Kirsten Nielsen is calling the rapidly deteriorating situation a category five hurricane disaster. Border patrol agents and custom officials, they are overwhelmed again tonight with this influx of illegal immigration, currently there are 1 million illegal immigrants inside the United States with active final removal orders. Some are violent criminals, some wreaking havoc, at a community near you. A convicted killer, MS-13 gang member, previously deported just arrested in Long Island, New York, after illegally reentering the country for second time. Oh, yes, he was involved in a manslaughter case and convicted. In Maryland, three MS-13 gang members, well, they just pled guilty to killing a person with machetes. Their immigration status is unknown, but the MS-13 gang is primarily composed of individuals from El Salvador, on the Central American countries where the migrate caravans are being formed. And now, President Trump is threatening to close the southern border completely if Mexico does not stop the massive new caravan that is headed our way. Yes, another one, a very serious situation. The left, they're not getting the memo. It doesn't matter how many homicides, sexual assaults, violent assaults by illegal criminal aliens are impacting American families every day. \"The Washington Post,\" what are they worried about? How the crisis at the border is going to impact avocado toast. Congresswoman Omar tweeting, this is a fake emergency. Donald Trump is lying about the border in order to build his monument to racism. OK. On this program, we actually take our job seriously, so instead of screaming that walls and borders are racist, well, we actually sent our very own Fox News contributor, investigative reporter Lawrence Jones to Laredo, Texas, where he toured the borders, spoke to agents on the ground. He's going to join us in a minute, who assured him this crisis is very real. Why don't we may be listened to the people that are there that are doing the hard work and protecting the country from drugs, gangs, cartels, et cetera? Take a look."

Maybe she should see with their own eyes what's really going on. Now, we do have tonight coming up a full report from two areas in Texas, You will not see it anywhere else, please stay tuned for that. We do turn out to our back story -- creepy, crazy Uncle Joe. While his creepy behavior is grabbing most of the headlines, a possible international corruption scandal is brewing under the surface. Here's what we know tonight, when Biden was serving as vice president, his son Hunter landed a lucrative job at a massive -- guess what, even Paul Manafort will hear about this -- Ukrainian energy company. Remember Hillary, Uranium One, oh. When that company came under investigation over corruption claims in Ukraine, Biden used his influence as vice president of the most powerful country on earth. He actually got the lead Ukrainian prosecutor fired and he bragged about it. There's a little detail we will tell you on the other side. Take a look at him bragging."

And when they vice president intervened, the prosecutor got fired, they moved the case out of the prosecutor's office to another agency and they shut it down. It was swept under the rag, never to be investigated again."

But in this particular case, the vice president of the United States tells them, you fire the prosecutor and we know beyond any doubt that that prosecutor that he has bragging about that he got fired -- he was going to use American taxpayer money as leverage, that he did it to save his son from the prosecutor was investigating him?"

And they are telling me tonight, Sean, that they been trying to get this information to the U.S. Justice Department for more than six months and have not got a receptive audience. But they have a lot more evidence than what they told me in this column. And I think they are very concerned that a sovereign nation, the United States, interfered in a legitimate investigation and it isn't the first time they say. They said this was a regular practice of the U.S. embassy to get involved in the criminal investigations and tell them who they could and couldn't prosecute."

The very same time that Joe Biden was in charge of all U.S.-Ukraine relations. Remember, President Obama gave him a special job and said you take care of this Ukrainian crisis. You're my designee for it. So, while Joe Biden was overseeing it, his son is walking in with this cash."

Ari, I see you smiling. I don't know why, probably because of my humor. I'm guessing. I'm not just that funny. But more importantly, this is now serious because if he used that position in two cases where his son is in one case flying with him on Air Force Two making business deals while his father is there, it is beyond the appearance of impropriety at this point.

We saw the same problems at the State Department. Remember stories coming out of the \"Associated Press\" with Hillary Clinton and where their favors being granted for access? So, this is all about access and money and foreign power and foreign money influencing members of our own government and having those connections with those children. Are there children making money off of their parents' power plays here in Washington?

And so, he is directly connected to Russian spies and they pay him half a million dollars and all the sudden, this deal happens the same year in 2010, in the fall of 2010, that the Uranium One deal gets approved, we have William Campbell who has been integral to the FBI during this time because he is reporting detailed notes of meetings with Russians where they are talking about influencing people in the United States, moving money, trying to gain control of the energy market and the United States is one of those areas that they want to gain control.

They would excuse Joe Biden's behavior. They wouldn't scrutinize it or look deeper into it. Now, it is interesting to see that if the worm is turning and if the press corps is indeed going to give Joe Biden and the other Democrats who were running a tough time the way they for Republicans.

Humanitarian crisis you see every day and is all over the news. It's the number of family units and children, coming across, giving themselves up the border patrol. And the reason why they do that is because they know the laws we have today will allow them to stay in the United States. The asylum law, the law for the Trafficking of Victims and Protection Rights Act, TVPRA, those laws have lost their integrity. And what they do is they bring the family units and the children into the country. We can only hold them, the Border Patrol, for 72 hours. After the 72 hours, we have to turn them over to another agency, usually ICE ERO or Health and Human Services.

It's, you know, 5 miles here, and then a 10-mile break, and another five miles. It is very difficult for us to know how -- what is coming across our border if we can't drive on our border. The situational awareness as far as technology, our cameras that we currently have cover 30 percent of our areas. So, we have a situation where 70 percent of our area, 70 percent of 170 miles, and we are not sure what is coming in and what's coming across. And as you see, the river is right there.

We have some significant help right now from our DoD partners as well as the Coast Guard, FEMA, the Office of Field Operations, our Customs Officers, our ICE officers out there. But all of us are stretched awfully, awfully thin right now. We need to make some changes to the loopholes out there--"

All the parents reportedly are negotiating plea deals. But I've got to tell you it will not be easy because prosecutors want prison time. Experts say actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin could serve between six and 20 months. Huffman is accused of paying $15,000 to have her daughter's SAT. score rigged. And Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 to have their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California for a sport they never played. The allegations have cost Lori Loughlin her television shows and endorsements. The damage to Felicity Huffman's career remains unclear. But many of the not so famous parents caught up in this scandal have lost their jobs, businesses and potentially their professional licenses and don't forget the students themselves have had their acceptance letters rescinded, been expelled and could have their degrees revoked altogether.

The Investigative Council Member of the Independent Counsel Rule. Joining us now Congressman Devin Nunes, Former Chair and now the Opposition Minority Leader on the House Intel Committee. Congressman Jim Jordan. You know the Independent Counsel Rule. Let's see Jerry Nadler was against the Ken Starr report, Jim if I remember correctly. I'm just trying to remember here.

The Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff wants the Attorney General of the United States to release classified information. The Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler wants the Attorney General of the United States to release grand jury material. That's where we're at because they are so focused on getting the President forget about the law that they helped change forget about the rule of law and how things are supposed to happen. They're all about getting the President and that is a sad state of affairs. But that's exactly where we're at."

How many people, how soon, how serious the referrals"

There is going to be many of them. They're going to probably at least be a dozen if not two dozen individuals and as we continue to get more information and build these and build them out, we want to make sure that everything is finished before we turn them in. But I will tell you, you're exactly right. There are people who definitely lied and misled Congress. OK. So, if they don't go to prison, we're going to have a two-tier justice department - justice system in this country and it's not going to be good for the American people."

It was paid for by the Clinton campaign. The Democrats throughout the house said, you can't do this. When we wanted to go out and say look, we think there is FISA abuse. When we did our memo that went out to the American people that said, look, we're not going to disclose sources and methods, but the American people need to know what happened here. They oppose that. So, the hypocrisy here knows no bounds. But with all that said, I think people should be very leery of only receiving what I call the Mueller dossier. Partisans wrote this document. What I'm interested in is not just to receive the Mueller dossier. I want all the information that fed into this because I'm sure just like in everything else that we've dealt with over last two years, there is going to probably be a lot of fake innuendo in the Mueller dossier."

You have to have intent for obstruction. There has to be a crime for obstruction. It doesn't matter you know. Well Donald Trump said this is a witch hunt. Or he fired James Comey. Comey said he could do it for any reason or no reason. All right, Doug Collins, your colleague Freedom Caucus member Jim. He's been very helpful in releasing these closed-door testimonies. But we're expecting a cascade of new information that we have all talked about 302s, Gang of Eight, FISA applications. What else will we - do we want, and will we get it. And what will we see?"

But to Devin's point, your point if we want the truth, if Jerry Nadler wants the truth, then let's release the FISA application. Let's get the 302s. If Jerry Nadler wants the truth calling Glenn Simpson bring him in an open hearing, put him under oath. See if he takes the Fifth like he did in front of our committee in a closed-door deposition. If they really want the truth, bring in John Huber see what he's been up to for 10 months. he's supposed to be looking in this FISA application. And frankly, if they really want the truth and they don't want to jeopardize releasing classified and grand jury material, bring in Bob Mueller, put him under oath. We can ask him all the questions we want."

It was not there even though there were multiple opportunities for Trump associates to collude. The fruit was dangling in front and they didn't take it.

And as journalists, it seems to me our job is to do that, right. That's our duty. But what I really want to know is Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo, are they opinion hosts, are these opinion shows or are these news programs because that's an important distinction and what people tell me American people everywhere, I go in this country that's what they want to know.

Politico had a good story last month that talked about and this wasn't based on somebody's opinion, but economic models with strong track records and picking presidential winners and losers and they cite strong U.S. economy, rising wages, low gas prices and historical advantage held by presidential incumbent. And they say that if you look at all those factors, President Trump will win in a landslide. I don't think we're in a landslide culture anymore. I think it's hard, we're too polarized.
