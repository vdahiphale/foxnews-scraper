This week, major developments in several Democrat scandals, including the controversial Uranium One deal. And tonight, breaking news about the anti- Trump dossier, Byron York who joins us in just a minute, is reporting that the conservative website, the Washington Free Beacon funded the original Fusion GPS research into Donald Trump. According to York, Fusion GPS was also looking into other Republican presidential candidates. The Washington Free Beacon is responding to this explosive information with the statement confirming York's reporting and adding, quote, \"The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier. Did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provide payments for any work performed by Christopher Steele. Nor did we have any knowledge of the relationship between Fusion GPS and the Democratic National Committee, Perkins Coie, and the Clinton campaign.\" Joining us now is Washington Examiner chief political correspondent Byron York. All right. Good evening, Byron."

    {
      "speaker": "BYRON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good evening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right. Now, you've got everyone talking about what this Fusion GPS situation is. You've got the whole thing turned on a tip. Now it appears that the original funding for the GPS, the Fusion GPS -- we thought began with the Clinton campaign and the DNC, was funded by the Washington Free Beacon, which is a conservative publication. Tell us what you know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "It is, indeed. You know, this week we found out that the whole Russia part of the Trump dossier, the part alleging collusion with Russians was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign in the Democratic National Committee. We had always known that earlier than that, several months earlier starting in late 2015, a Republican group had funded opposition research. Not about Russia but opposition research into Donald Trump and some other candidates. And now tonight I reported who it was. It was the Washington Free Beacon which is a conservative website, kind of with attitude. It's a website that mixes journalism and activism and some of its top staffers have history and journalism activism and politics and they are the ones behind this original effort."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right. So, people are now saying, you know, who is the Washington Free Beacon? I mean, who owns the Free Beacon? I understand at one point it was actually a 501C4 not a profit?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "It was. It started in 2012 as a 501C4. Those are the groups called for Center for American Freedom that ran it. One of its board members was Bill Kristol. The former editor of The Weekly Standard who is very prominent never Trump voice in our political debate today. And then 2014 it becomes a private organization. And we do know that Paul Singer who was a New York hedge fund billionaire who has contributed to many conservative causes is a major funder of the Washington Free Beacon today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And Paul Singer we can assume was someone who was antitrust as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Very much so. And certainly in the never Trump camp later endorsed Marco Rubio. And actually wanted to somehow stop Trump at the convention. You know, there is kind of a last ditch effort to hopefully stop them at the convention which didn't work. So, yes, Mr. Singer was definitely very anti-Trump at the time this oppo research is going on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right. And do we know who else was being -- did they seek this opposition research on? I understand it was not just Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "That's a good question and the answer is, I do not know. They did say tonight when the Free Beacon acknowledged after my report -- they published an acknowledgment of all of this. They said that in the fall of 2015, Donald Trump was the leading candidate if you remember back then in the Republican race. In the fall of 2015, they started this opposition research project with Fusion GPS, looking into what they called multiple Republican candidates including Donald Trump. So, unclear who those other ones are right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And, you know, going forward, I mean, the Washington Free Beacon has said, you know, we basically did not do any of this stuff based upon a request by individuals. Are they saying who the individuals are?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, look, a lot of people -- there had been gossip that this was a Paul Singer operation. And people have said that he was the one who was behind all of this. And I think what the Free Beacon is saying is that Singer is a major funder but the Free Beacon has in the past used, employed, retained opposition research firms in its work. And this was something like that. Now, I've got to say this is not standard journalistic practice. I mean, you go to places like the Washington Examiner or The Washington Post or any other organization and they do not go around hiring political opposition research firms to do work for them. So, this is an unusual situation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, clearly if there are investigative reporters, they wouldn't subcontract someone on opposition research to give them their information. But Byron, stay with us. I also want to ask that a few more journalist, Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt and American Conservative Union Chair Matt Schlapp. All right. Gentlemen, I will go to you first, Matt. I mean, what is your take on the information that Byron had just released this evening?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIRMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, there's been a lot of smoke around this for a long time. And I give Byron great credit. Because it just seems like there is almost an access of political evil here. People who are willing to do almost anything to stop Donald Trump and there's some familiar names involved. Bill Kristol who we've all debated throughout the last two years. He was a prominent never Trumper. Paul Singer who has put his money where his mouth is to do everything to stop them. You know, Judge, the thing I is interesting is, how did it move from this Republican effort to stop Trump back over now to the DNC and to the Democrats through Perkins Coie, this law firm? There is a lot more here that we all need to know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And you know, Byron, do we know anything about that? Because as I understand, you know, the original investigation from the fall of `15 to the spring of `16 and then it's ended in terms of the funding by the Republicans or, you know, the anti-Trump people. And then it's picked up by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Who contacted who? You know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Yes. We do know something about this. You're right. What we've been talking about this effort starts in the fall of 2015. And it's a conventional oppo research operation. It's looking at Donald Trump's casinos, its businesses. Charges that he did this or that. Bad thing. So, it's kind of a conventional oppo research and it goes on until early May. And if you remember, on May 3rd, Trump won the Indiana primary, be Ted Cruz and that and essentially clinched the nomination. So, this effort stopped at that point. And what we do know is that after that, Glenn Simpson who is the head of Fusion GPS shop the project to Democrats. And the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign picked it up and at some point after that, that's when they hired Christopher Steele, this former British spy. And that's when it turned towards Russia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right. And so, Charlie, I will go to you now. You know, we just heard that or we know that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, John Podesta, you know, go before Congress with Mark Elias. The attorney here from the law firm in question, Perkins Coie, through which the money was funneled before he got to Steele. And so, the question is, are those two individuals at risk of having lied to Congress because they said they do knew nothing about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly the report reveals something that a lot of it had known it for a long time. And that is the incestuous nature of the way things, business was handled in Washington. But I will be honest with you, for me, doing the oppo research, everybody does that. I'm not terribly concerned about all of that. What does concern me is though is that we've had these past six months where Democrats in particular or rather the past year, for that Democrats in particular, the Clintons have made such a big deal about these Russian connections."
    },

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "And they've been lying all this time about their own fingerprints all over this completely fraudulent dossier which then led to the Obama administration launching of I think an unprecedented investigation using the most powerful intelligence service on the planet.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, I'm disgusted by the fact that Donald Trump, Jr., gets an email about meeting with people who have information and he is called a traitor. And he's said that he is colluding with the Russian government. Hillary Clinton and her team went to Russia to shake down the trees with Vladimir Putin's cronies to get information and they're getting away with calling opposition research. That cannot stand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, and Byron, you know, you've got to -- this whole thing is based upon -- this Mueller investigation, as well as the unmasking that came as a result of FISA warrants are based on this dossier which apparently is purchased by Hillary Clinton and her friends who say they know nothing about it which supposedly cost millions of dollars. You know, my faith in the American justice system, I'm destroyed by this. Because right now, its fruit of the poisonous tree. If that is false, everything else comes down and Mueller has got to end it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Let me add one thing in addition to the Mueller factor here. The reason we are talking about this now, the reason we learned earlier this week that it was the DNC and the Clinton campaign and the reason we learned today that it was Washington Free Beacon is because the House Intelligence Committee and the much-maligned person, Devin Nunes, had issued a subpoena for Fusion GPS' bank records. They had been stonewalled by Fusion GPS before that. People had come before -- Fusion had come before the committee and asserted their Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. So, they subpoenaed bank records. And that's what has shaken this sluice. In response and anticipation of their bank records being handed over to the House. All of a sudden well, whoa, we find out that Hillary Clinton and the DNC had funded and now we found out about Fusion GPS. So, a lot of this is being driven by the House Intelligence Committee investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And you know what, Charlie, to them we certainly owe -- they get kudos. I mean, on Monday, Fusion is supposed to respond to the subpoena handing over the names of clients. Their bank records. What do you think Fusion is going to do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. We owe them a total -- gratitude to them. And the big difference here between today and what we've seen for the past 25 years is, Democrats aren't circling the wagons around the Clintons. Normally, when the Clintons get in trouble and when they cost a mess like this, the whole party circles around them. Now you have the DNC standing back and saying hey, man, we didn't know anything about this. Talk to them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "And you even have former CIA Director Leon Panetta saying, we have to investigate all of this. That's huge stuff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "And where's Hillary? Where is she? She's been hiding out. You know, she's been so talkative and now she has gotten quiet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And you know what's interesting is that once the law firm, Perkins Coie who is the initial receiver of the monies, millions. Once they waive the privilege, then the focus is on Fusion. Fusion is now a big travel. I think it is all going to start crumbling. Byron, again, thanks to you. What can we look forward to next week?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, this is big. This is the next step which is that the House Intel Committee has also subpoenaed the FBI for all of its information about the dossier. Because you have to remember, Christopher Steele went to the FBI, offered his stuff and they kind of took him under its wing and started using this dossier material in some way. So, Devin Nunes subpoenaed them. On August 24th, he was totally stonewalled. They have not turned over anything. Now Speaker Paul Ryan in the last couple of days has said, look, this is not just one committee chairman. This is the House of Representatives telling the FBI you have to comply with this request. And the FBI promises to respond next week and that could be really, really big news to see what they did with this dossier information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And what they did with it and how much Jim Comey knew about what was going on. All right. Gentlemen, thank you so much.

We will tell you who as this special edition of \"Hannity\" continues."

      "utterance": "Well, it is obviously something that the Intelligence Committee is going to have to look at. You know, knowing presidential campaigns, their big operations and somehow the left hand may not know what the right hand is doing. And that could be the case here. But I really do think that the committee is going to have to get into this to determine just exactly what happened, who knew what and when."

All right, Tammy, I have to ask you this. Okay, so we've got Leon Panetta. And everyone is giving him credit because he said obviously we have to look at it. But then he took like the slant but these are big operations. You'd never know. The left-hand may not know what the right hand is doing. What is your take?"

      "speaker": "TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",

The fact of the matter is here, I think the Clintons though and we know the Democrats have been very sloppy. If you think about the Pakistanis running the DNC system, right? The server itself with Hillary, these individuals who have gotten away with so much for so long. They figure they are immune. They are made of Teflon. But they are not. We are finding this out. Now Panetta also though smart enough to know when something is so much of a mess that you've got to at least start the fire. That this could be so bad that he can't even deny that an investigation at least might stop the disaster. Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

In 2013, Leon Panetta said something like, and he was drinking that Clinton Kool- Aid. We did not have an intelligence warning. We didn't have enough time to get armed military assets to respond to Benghazi. When we were in Northern Africa, that's when I stopped with Panetta. But what's your take on Panetta now?"

    {
      "speaker": "LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONALLY SYNDICATED HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, Panetta is usually pretty reasonable, Judge. He's one of the many and Obama's National Security team that wanted him to leave or stay behind for us in ISIS and one of the retired General Ray Odierno said, they had to stay behind for us. ISIS could have been dealt with. So, Leon Panetta is not a loon. But it's fascinating how nobody seemed to know who paid. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she had no knowledge of this. John Podesta had no knowledge of it. Hillary spokesperson had no knowledge of it. I wonder about Donna Brazile. Donna Brazile was vice chair and if you know, she played these shenanigans and got Hillary the debate customs. I wonder what her role is and has Hillary been asked about this, Judge.

And the thing that Mr. Panetta called awkward was when Podesta in front of Congress Mark Elias sitting next to him who was facilitating all of this, when he said he had no idea who is paying for it. When the man who was managing it, who was his personal attorney was the manager. So, we know and this is where you realize that this is out- of-the-box. That the genie is out of the bottle and they've got to be able to do it and there has to be investigations and this is where the real panic sets in. Because they realized how sloppy they've been. All the doors that weren't closed because impart I think Larry would agree, is because they expected her to win. So, they never locked the door. They never figured it out."

It shows you that he was right when he said that he was being wiretapped at Trump Towers. Some of his aides are being wiretapped at Trump Towers. And the question is, did Mueller know that this dossier was phony yet used it as a ruse in order to go after Donald Trump? Was it used to get a warrant to tap Donald Trump even though the people knew when they were relied on this dossier that it was full of crap? These are the kinds of questions that need to be answered and this thing is now just the beginning. And again, it vindicates Donald Trump.

The chairman of the house judiciary and oversight committee have announced that they are opening a new probe into how the FBI and DOJ handled the investigation into Clinton's private server. Also this week, judicial watch, announced last year, the FBI recovered the 72,000 pages of Clinton email records. 40,000 of which the state department still has to process. Joining us now is the President of judicial watch, Tom Fitton from the American Center for Law and Justice, Jordan Sekulow. All right, let me ask you.

The deep state is running things at the state department, justice department on these Clinton emails. As you highlighted, there 72,000 pages of Clinton emails the FBI went and found. We've only released a few of them. At the rate they are releasing to us now, we won't get all of them until 2020. On top of that, they're 2800 pages of records or documents on Anthony Weiner's laptop. That are also from the Clinton email server. We don't know what is in them, is it classified information. Is it Russia information? What was being deleted by Hillary Clinton is a big mystery."

I have an idea. Let's defund Mueller and his special counsel and use that money to get people to start releasing those state department emails. Jordan, what say you about this?"

      "speaker": "JORDAN SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE",

One when it comes to the newly investigations with how the FBI handled this whole investigation, they never wanted to call it that matter, I guess into Hillary Clinton. Why they were giving updates about Hillary Clinton and ultimately made the call not to prosecute instead of deferring to the department of justice, the normal course of action and also Trey Gowdy, who chairs the oversight committee wants to bring James Comey back to testify under oath that is important. I think this is something we are working on right now is that the FBI we know was part of -- and the deal with Christopher Steele to continue the opposition research that Hillary Clinton's campaign was paid for through fusion GPS. We want to know how far along the FBI went. To get that information, that is absurd. As you had said earlier in the broadcast, it takes everything. For the masking. The starting point for the special counsel. For all of this Trump-Russia info. It's really a Hillary Clinton Russian scandal."

Everyone's talking about the FBI's relationship with Christopher Steele that the FBI doesn't want to say anything about it. Now they are going to turn over some documents to congress. We wonder if they will update the court on if they still believe they can credibly say they cannot confirm or deny whether documents exist.

How about our uranium. Let's sell it out to some Russian billionaires and take a bunch of cash for our charitable foundation. $110 million in Quid pro quo. You hear the sound clips. This is put forth by Fox News. No, it was The New York Times that reported on this ten days ago.
