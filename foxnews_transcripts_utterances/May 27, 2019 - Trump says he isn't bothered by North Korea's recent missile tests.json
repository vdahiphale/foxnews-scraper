This is one of the problems when you're Joe Biden. He calls him a swamp creature. He's been in Washington for 46 years. And so he has got a long, long record of a lot of things. Donald Trump actually will be able to make a case to the African-American community, he went to them and he said I'm going to fight for you whether you vote for me or not. He went to a church in Detroit during the campaign. He's delivered the lowest unemployment rate for African-Americans ever recorded. He's delivered the goods. The crime bill, he has built empowerment zones to pass legislation in part of his tax bill. So he's not going to win the African-American vote, but he got eight percent. If he can get that to 14 or 15 percent the Democrats are in big trouble. And also lots of people who are persuadably voters will like the fact that the president is reaching out to the African-American community, which will help them win reelection.",

And I will raise him, because it was also unbelievable hypocritical for Donald Trump to go around bashing people for promoting the idea of super predators back in the '80s and 90s. This is a man who took out a full page ad at his own expense in the New York newspapers calling for the death penalty for five young men who had been, it turned out later, falsely accused of beating a woman in Central Park. Donald Trump himself was one of the most tough on crime loudmouths in New York City. So I think once Joe Biden gets in a position to do it, he will find it very easy to parry him on that issue.",

      "utterance": "So I just defended President Trump for what he said about North Korea when it came to missiles. The opposite is true when it comes to attacking Joe Biden. First of all, number one, you don't attack your political opponents from foreign soil. You're supposed to be out there as America's chief diplomat. And two, you don't cite the murderous dictator of North Korea as evidence of why Joe Biden is a bad candidate. So I think that that was a shameful thing for the president to do. However, the reality is that he's got a point on the 94 crime bill. This is one of the problems when you're Joe Biden. He calls him a swamp creature. He's been in Washington for 46 years. And so he has got a long, long record of a lot of things. Donald Trump actually will be able to make a case to the African-American community, he went to them and he said I'm going to fight for you whether you vote for me or not. He went to a church in Detroit during the campaign. He's delivered the lowest unemployment rate for African-Americans ever recorded. He's delivered the goods. The crime bill, he has built empowerment zones to pass legislation in part of his tax bill. So he's not going to win the African-American vote, but he got eight percent. If he can get that to 14 or 15 percent the Democrats are in big trouble. And also lots of people who are persuadably voters will like the fact that the president is reaching out to the African-American community, which will help them win reelection."

      "utterance": "Well, look, first of all, just on that point about the African- American vote, I'd say Trump has no chance to get to 14 or 15 percent. He has gone out of his way to take Harriet Tubman off the $20 bill. Symbolic politics like that alone will determine that. But coming back to his comments in Japan, I do agree with Marc that it was shameful. And I will raise him, because it was also unbelievable hypocritical for Donald Trump to go around bashing people for promoting the idea of super predators back in the '80s and 90s. This is a man who took out a full page ad at his own expense in the New York newspapers calling for the death penalty for five young men who had been, it turned out later, falsely accused of beating a woman in Central Park. Donald Trump himself was one of the most tough on crime loudmouths in New York City. So I think once Joe Biden gets in a position to do it, he will find it very easy to parry him on that issue."

      "utterance": "It is a sign of the enormous place that Joe Biden is occupying in the president's worldview at the moment. And look, I think he looks at it, he sees Joe Biden's lead in the polls. He remembers his own experience where he led almost wire to wire, which is not really the way it always works. But he looks at this Democratic field and says, who else is it going to be? So he is absolutely fixated on Biden. And the question you have to ask yourself, he should not be doing this in Japan. It looks bad. And what purpose does it serve for this Japanese trip to have done this?"

      "utterance": "If you wonder how can it be that a president whom a majority of the Americans approve of his handling of the economy, you have full employment, you have rising wages, we are headed for over three percent annualized GPD growth. This is great. We are at peace. Crime is low. This is time for an incumbent president where he should be absolutely crushing it. But instead he trails. And instead he is underwater and pretty substantially. Stunts like this stuff in Japan are exactly why. I hear Republican after Republican, they complain, why don't we get enough credit for the good economy? Why don't we get enough credit for this? Because your president misbehaves this way and people don't like it. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2019 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
