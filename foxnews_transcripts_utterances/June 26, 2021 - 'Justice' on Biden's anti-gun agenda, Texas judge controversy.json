A 2004 Department of Justice study concluded that the ban on assault weapons cannot be credited with a decrease in violence.

So, stop patting yourself on the back with that one. And as for your claim that no one needs to have a weapon that can fire 30, 40, 50, or even 100 rounds unless you think deer are wearing Kevlar vests. First of all, you're not funny.

To the extent that Joe Biden is functioning at all, he is doing so in a make believe world where the biggest gun problem we have in America is the sale of guns to straw purchasers."

Yes, absolutely go after straw purchasers, but the problem we have in America is with illegal guns not sold by gun dealers, but instead sold illegally on the streets. The biggest issue we have with guns in America is the use of illegal guns to kill and maim innocent victims. Yes, buying a gun from a dealer and then giving it to a prohibited purchaser is a crime. But the last time we had a significant amount of crime occurring through straw purchasers was when your pal, Barack Obama ended up selling guns to straw purchasers, who then took them to Mexico then used by the cartels in the disastrous Fast and Furious calamity where a United States Border agent was killed. You falsely claim that a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines cuts crime."

No one needs to have a weapon that can fire over 30, 40, 50, and even up to a hundred rounds, unless you think the deer is wearing Kevlar vests or something. Community policing and programs to keep neighborhoods safe and keep folks out of trouble. These efforts work, they save lives."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Joe, your assault on weapons ban claim is also just not true. A 2004 Department of Justice study concluded that the ban on assault weapons cannot be credited with a decrease in violence. Assault weapons are used in no more than eight percent of gun crimes before the ban and your assault weapons ban did not significantly reduce the murder rates at the state level. So, stop patting yourself on the back with that one. And as for your claim that no one needs to have a weapon that can fire 30, 40, 50, or even 100 rounds unless you think deer are wearing Kevlar vests. First of all, you're not funny. Second, you're not lucid, and third, who says the Second Amendment is all about deer hunting. Leave Bambi out of this. People can have a gun for a variety of reasons, none of which are your business."

The Supreme Court has ruled the Second Amendment protects the right of the individual to have and use guns for legal purposes. The right to bear arms vests in the individual, not merely a collective militia. And in the landmark case of D.C. versus Heller, the Supreme Court ruled, \"All citizens are the militia and gun ownership is independent of membership in a militia or any kind of military unit.\" So, stop acting as though deer hunting is the only reason people have guns. But your false statements continued through your press conference when you stated this."

Believe it Joe, you want to know why gun crime is up and violent crime is up, and why we're seeing murder and mayhem on our city streets like we haven't seen in decades? I'll tell you why. These high crime cities are being run by Democrats who either don't have a clue or don't care about anyone, but themselves. As in, let me keep my security and you peons, you just fend for yourselves. And take, for example, Maya Wiley, running for mayor in New York City. She has security where she lives, but doesn't want it for anyone else. And then Joe, you go on to say if anyone dares to go after the government, you're going to need more lethal weapons."

There is only one way to fight gun crime and you obviously don't know what it is. Here are some clues. Get yourself some confidential informants, some undercover officers, search warrants, surveillance, wiretaps, probable cause, start making some arrests, and make sure that your cops charge those crimes which require mandatory incarceration. And make sure that the States Attorney's Office or the DAs prosecute those arrests. Make sure that Judges follow the law and send them to jail. And stop lecturing us and blaming guns for the violence in America. The violence is caused by those who hate America, hate police, and hate law and order. Make no mistake, not one of us law-abiding citizens is going to let you take away our guns or our ammo no matter how much you lie to us. And that's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter, #JudgeJeanine. And here with reaction to my open and to discuss this terrifying increase in violent crime across U.S. cities, Dallas Police Chief Eddie Garcia and the National Vice President for the Fraternal Order of Police, Sergeant Joe Gamaldi. All right, gentlemen, you know, Biden is touting his new crime strategy on assault weapons, and it doesn't appear -- and I could be wrong -- but I'll ask you. Does it appear that he is on the right track to stop gun violence in the United States? I'll start with you, Chief Garcia."

And although, I think I can speak for my colleagues in other major cities across America, we appreciate the fact that we recognize that there's an increase in violent crime, and we're recognizing that we need do something about it. And furthermore, the messaging, recognizing that defunding and dismantling police departments is not the answer. However, although we do have an issue with weapons and illegally possessed weapons being possessed by criminals committing harm on our cities, the data just simply doesn't back up the fact that guns are simply only driver. We do a lot of work with criminologists here in the City of Dallas that we brought in to help us with our issues. And as they'll point out, when crime was at its peak in the 80s, there were many less weapons in circulation than there are today. There are many more weapons that are in circulation than there are today than there was when violence was at its peak in the 80s since criminologists have been studying crime in America. And so simply stating that guns are the only driver --"

We're honorable respective officers that felt under siege and unappreciated, undervalued. They're human. That impacts their work productivity. And so what would happen? What's happened is we've lost proactive police engagement where we need it the most."

      "utterance": "Well, I think it's important that he acknowledged that defunding the police is a complete loser. But yet, we still have politicians and the media gaslighting the American public to believe that this is some sort of solution. And the fact of the matter is, they are charlatans now selling snake oil to the public. And I'll tell you where the President missed the mark. He didn't talk about rogue prosecutors and activist judges who continue this revolving door criminal justice system that we have. We have gang members who are shooting people getting probation. We have gang members that are out on eight felony bonds, and then they're getting another bond. These revolving door policies and bail reform have been unmitigated disaster for our communities. And you compound that with the anti-police rhetoric and denigrating the hard working men and women of law enforcement, and it is a recipe for disaster. And that's why you saw in 2020, we had over 20,000 homicides in the United States. That hasn't happened since the mid-90s. And then the cities that actually decided it was a good idea to defund the police, let's look at their numbers. Portland, their murders jumped by 137 percent. Minneapolis, remember them? Up 236 percent. New York up 48 percent. Philly 66 percent. And the list goes on and on. So, we want to talk about zero tolerance, how about we have zero tolerance for the people who are shooting people in the face and let's throw the book at them?"

I mean, we've got an increase in the tolerance of hate toward police, tying police's hands behind their backs, putting a target on their backs. I mean, what is -- does Joe Biden think anybody believes what he is saying that 90 percent of the crimes -- street crimes occur as a result of sales from five percent of gun sales -- gun sale purchasers? I mean, is that crazy? Does that number sound legit to you?"

But we can't force our officers to conduct investigative car stops, or do the type of investigations needed that yield the types of -- the type the types of drugs and weapons and other things possessed by criminals that are harming our communities. They will only do that if they feel appreciated, and feel that they're going to be judged fairly in a crisis, and that they feel that procedural justice applies to them as well. What was said earlier with regards to the revolving door, there is a perception, true or not, nationally, and unfortunately, there are many examples and many of my colleagues will tell you that violent criminals are not being held accountable. This leads to a thinking that in some ways, social controls are being lessened, which further erodes the morale of police officers and then emboldens the violent criminals to think that no one's watching. And then it ultimately affects our communities the most."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, and Joe Gamaldi, I mean, the Chief is right. They are emboldening to believe that no one's watching and even if they are watching, we're letting them out. I mean, we've got gang members out to kill again, we've got street thugs out to assault another person. I mean, it's just over and over I mean, will somebody talk about bail reform? Is any of this going to happen? Are we just going to have to live with this and buy our own guns?"

      "speaker": "GAMALDI",

But the fact of the matter is, Judge, law enforcement in this country, the American police officer delivered historic crime reductions over the last two decades. And we can do it again, if we're willing to restore the rule of law, which means not letting off hundreds of people in New York who are rioting and looting a few months back, and if we prosecute violent crimes to the fullest extent of the law and we embrace broken windows theories, we can do it again. But we need the funding, and we need the support from our community and our politicians."

The School Board shut down comments from the public after a former State Senator brought up allegations that community members had organized a list of their conservative neighbors to harass and publicly shame. When some of the attendees refused to be silenced and comply with the School Board's orders, the police even got involved.

Superintendents and principals think that they have become parents. Look no further than the Dalton School in New York where parents are paying $55,000.00 a year for their kids to go to school to be shown a cartoon -- six-year-olds -- a cartoon where private parts are mentioned and self- pleasure to six-year-olds, and they're paying for this garbage.

It's almost as though we saw it with some of the governors, they become totalitarian, and they become dictators. They're not to be spoken to. And yet, it seems that more and more, I think the public is understanding the need to get involved in School Board elections, as well as all of the local elections. Now, what do you know about the fact that these teachers shut down the meeting? Up to that point, all the parents seemed to be in agreement. How could they shut down the meeting?"

And I mean, this comes on the heels of in Loudoun County, we know that teacher, Tanner Cross, was suspended for sharing his religious beliefs only to be reinstated by a Judge. This comes after a Christian family said, I don't want my child to be a part of a transgender lesson. So they put this child on what resembled a broom closet, as if he was being punished for not wanting to hear something that should be taught by parents, not by teachers. It's amazing. And Judge, let me just say this, there's a sea change in this country going on. I looked at a poll, a YouGov poll, guess what is tied with the economy as the issue of most importance to voters? Political correctness and race relations, even exceeding that -- there's a sea change, and you're going to see it in 2022 when Republicans prevail."

They can't decide we're only going to hear from 20 percent, and we don't want to hear any more of it. I mean, they should recall them as far as I'm concerned. I would find out how to recall those -- that Board and get started on a on a new Board as quickly as possible. But in the end, I mean, this is reflective of what's going on nationally in the country.

I mean, think about that tied with the economy is political correctness, because these cultural wedge issues, people see it, it affects their lives, it affects their kids. When their little daughter -- you know, I have a one and a half year old -- if she was coming home to me and saying I was just taught that I'm an oppressor because of the color of my skin. And the girl sitting next to me is oppressed because of the color of hers. This is a real personal issue, which is why, hey, I don't want my daughter going to private school or public school, but parochial school because I'll tell you those Catholic schools they may be the last bastion here for these kids."

      "utterance": "No. Absolutely not. And what's more concerning is the fact that Democrats and the activist community are not concerned with it. This is the same treatment that they gave Hunter Biden or I should say, lack of treatment that they gave Hunter Biden over his text messages that contain the N-word, this just goes to show all this activism, all this foe wokeness, it only has to do when it concerns conservatives or independents. But if you play for the Democrats, you are shielded every single time. They don't care about racism, they don't care about bigotry. They don't care about intolerance, so long as you play for their team. And that's evident time and time again. It's a pattern."

      "utterance": "Yes, you know, I'm not the one to tell private businesses what they should do, who they can include or not include, but here's the part when it comes to Senator Whitehouse, he is a hypocrite for belonging to these clubs because as we see him talking on Capitol Hill all the time with the virtue signaling statements that he's gives about George Floyd or Breonna Taylor and how inclusive, you know being inclusive is so important and he's doing the exact opposite in his private life. And so again, Democrats you know, rules for thee, but not for me."

      "utterance": "This isn't the first time he said something like that. He always seems to categorize people into a monolithic way of thinking. But, you know, also he thinks that African-Americans aren't able to get voter IDs, now he thinks that those in the Hispanic community are not able to get vaccinated because they fear deportation. Obviously, the man is slipping, he is unwell, but the pattern of his rhetoric is pretty evident and pretty clear how he feels about people of color. But once again, media silence on that one."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

      "speaker": "KLACIK",
      "utterance": "No, not at all. This is a habit for him. I think he's at a point now in his age where he can't control his mouth. As you said just a minute ago about Baltimore, he is one of the people that authored the 1994 Crime Bill, where they had aggressive policing against black individuals in predominantly black neighborhoods. And this is just something that he has always supported. I don't know how he became the President in 2021 or 2020. But here we are."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "That's right. A lot of people wonder about that. Tomi and Kim, thanks so much for being with us. And still ahead, the latest in Britney Spears' battle for freedom after more than a decade long conservatorship. We break down the shocking details on what her legal rights really are. Next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Britney Spears apologizing to fans for pretending to be okay in her conservatorship. This week we found out some of the shocking details with her disclosing this during a hearing, quote, \"I feel ganged up on and I feel bullied and I feel left out and alone and I'm tired of feeling alone. I deserve to have the same rights as anybody does by having a child, a family, any of those things and more so.\" Attorney Deborah Blum joins me now with reaction. All right, Attorney Blum, you are very familiar with conservatorships. And you know it doesn't -- you don't need to be a famous person to be under a conservatorship. We know a lot of senior citizens are under conservatorships. So, a conservatorship is something that is placed on an individual by a court on what grounds?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEBORAH BLUM, FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Conservators can be granted full or limited control over another individual's finances and affairs if that person is physically or mentally unable to manage it on their own. So for Britney, her conservators for 13 years have had complete control over her movements, who she can associate with and drive her, her medical care and legal decisions, including seeing her kids and forced contraception."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, and that is amazing. Force contraception, I believe, I read she has an IUD. She's not able to drive, unless someone is with her. I mean, she seems to be a highly functioning individual. And yet, her father is in control of the finances and her medication. What is this all about? Can you tell us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUM",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Not allowing her to reproduce is a form of sterilization and in conservatorships, that's only permitted in severely disabled people, which all of what we have before us does not support that she is a severely disabled person. So in order for her to regain control, she'd have to petition the court with facts showing that there's no longer a need for conservatorships and it is in the best interest, in her best interest to terminate. She likely needs to have a full mental health exam to receive termination from Judge Penny. And as you just said, like, the issue is, is Britney Spears when she just went before Judge Penny, I wasn't satisfied with her performance. If I was advising her, I would have told her to be more polished and more articulate and not to say to the Judge, Ma'am, I'm not here to be anyone's slave and to avoid f-bombs and words like \"dumb\" and \"stupid\" and comparing her life to that of a sex trafficking victim. She didn't do herself any favors by doing that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But you know, but the truth is, I mean, you know, you saw her, you know, unvarnished and you saw the real Britney Spears, if she is being kept from people, she is not in -- she doesn't have custody of her children. She's not able to procreate. She's not able to drive alone. You know, why is her father so much in control? Is she out of her mind? She seems to be doing tours and music and dances, or am I -- should I not believe my lying eyes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUM",
      "utterance": "No, to her credit, she got her point across that she was put on lithium based upon her manager's unverified accusation that she's not taking her meds. She got her point across that she has to work 10 days a week -- seven days a week for 10 hours a day and she is being exploited. This definitely supports limiting the conservatorship although she is requesting full termination."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I'll tell you, Deborah, first of all, the shame of this is that we see senior citizens who are under the same kind of conservatorship and you know, by the time we get to them, they're frustrated, they're angry. And we're going to continue on this. Deborah Blum, thank you so much for being with us. And a big update on my FOX Nation show, \"Castles U.S.A.\" is next."
