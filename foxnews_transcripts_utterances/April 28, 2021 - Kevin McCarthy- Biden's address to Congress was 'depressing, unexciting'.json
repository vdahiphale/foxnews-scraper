We -- do we not have an explanation? Why can't that room be full? Why is everyone still wearing masks? Why is there the extreme social distancing? Are these not legitimate questions? I think they are that we all deserve answers to. Joe Biden, these lawmakers, they have been lecturing us, encouraging us, telling us that we all need to get vaccinated for months. They told us to follow the science and that the vaccines were incredibly effective. And why then are they still double masking social distancing after getting the vaccine? What kind of message is that sending? How does that encourage Americans who might be hesitant to get a vaccine?

Probably the biggest lie from Joe Biden ever may be right up there with the window Joe over three times as he was climbing the stairs. That's really saying something. Now second of all, Biden isn't just planning to raise taxes on individuals making 200,000. Yes, he screwed it up again. But also couples, small businesses, corporations, which they pass the costs on to you, when the cost of energy goes up, you pay for it, that -- you pay at the pump, when you fill your gas tank, you fill for heating your home and cooling your home. And by the way, anyone who makes any income through capital gains, yes, that's going to go from 23 to 43 percent. And even then, that's not going to be enough. Mark my words, everyone that pays taxes will be forced to pay for these massive spending bills. I say it over and over again. Corporations don't pay taxes, they will pass the tax loss to you. And you will pay more for goods and for services and for energy all at the same time. You will pay for it. Let's be clear. America does not have a revenue problem. Prior to the pandemic after the Trump tax cuts. Yes, the federal government took in more tax revenue after the tax cuts than ever before in history. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We don't have a revenue problem.

Ultimately, this theme of his speech was yes, class warfare, divide the country, redistribution with every cliche you'd expect, every bumper sticker, every slogan that you could possibly mix in. A socialist wish list. Any way you want to package it, what Biden presented tonight was the failed idea, ideology, philosophy of socialism. That's it. Now America has a choice. America is at a crossroads. Socialism which will fail or freedom and capitalism which would work. You have leftists, authoritarianism, statism or freedom and capitalism. America, you will get to decide we are at a crossroads. 2022 is the night you begin to decide the future of this great Republic. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And tonight, once again, it really makes you wonder who's in charge inside the Democratic Party. As a matter of fact, Joe doesn't even bother to show up for as important COVID-19 meetings. According to a report from RealClearPolitics, state governors are now increasingly frustrated that both Biden and Kamala Harris routinely skipped the weekly conference calls that are used to be coordinating the country's COVID-19 response. In his absence, Joe Biden appointed Governor Cuomo, really? Of New York, that guy? The nursing home executive order guy to lead our nation's COVID- 19 conference calls. Yes, the same Andrew Cuomo, the one that signed that executive action, that catastrophic policy that forced elderly patients infected with COVID-19 at of hospitals and back into long-term care facilities which lead to massive outbreaks and death among New York's most vulnerable population. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The same Andrew Cuomo who is now under federal investigation for covering up his state's true nursing home COVID-19 death toll. And tonight, according to an explosive report from the liberal New York Times, the cover up is even worse than we thought. According to the piece, Cuomo's top aides they spent months hiding the true death toll numbers from the general public and even the state's own health officials. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And get this, \"The actions coincided with the period which Mr. Cuomo was pitching and then writing a book on the pandemic with assistance from his top aide.\" So is Andrew Cuomo ever going to be held accountable? I don't know if I'd hold my breath, I wouldn't count on it. Apparently, he's Joe's right hand man in the fight against COVID-19. Here with reaction. And by the way, Biden's joint address to Congress, Senator Ted Cruz. Senator Cruz, before we get to the socialist utopian, authoritarian statism of Joe Biden, I think we got to talk about the star of the night and that would be your colleague, our friend, and that would be Senator Tim Scott.",

They're going to raise taxes on small businesses. They're going to raise capital gains taxes. They're going to raise the death tax. Every tax is going up.

He didn't say we're getting kids back in school completely missing from his remarks tonight.

We talked about unity. He talked about common ground. All of that was gone tonight. Tonight, this was an agenda that was set by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and AOC. It's the radicals and socialists. What did he talk about also? The corrupt politicians act, H.R. 1, a federal takeover of elections to keep Democrats in power forever.

The big takeaway for me was just the lack of energy in the chamber. I said to someone, this was, this was socialism presented in slow motion. We know they're moving fast, but the presentation was just no energy at all. And you contrast that to a little over a year ago, when we were in that chamber, and President Trump honored Rush Limbaugh and the speech that he gave. I mean, that to me was the real contrast that came through. So, they didn't want to talk about all the things they've done in the 100 days, all the crazy things they've done and what they want to do now. And the only time immigration really came up was when Biden talked about giving a bunch of millions of people amnesty, so I don't think the American people bargained for all this.",

But first, it's not totally clear that the very weak, very frail, cognitively struggling Joe Biden really seems to have a grasp on the real state of our union. But he was able to slowly get through a speech crafted by his advisors, and I am sure practice for weeks. And at the beginning of his remarks, he thanked himself for the 220 million COVID-19 vaccinations or maybe a nice little unifying message to Operation Warp Speed and Donald Trump.

We -- do we not have an explanation? Why can't that room be full? Why is everyone still wearing masks? Why is there the extreme social distancing? Are these not legitimate questions? I think they are that we all deserve answers to. Joe Biden, these lawmakers, they have been lecturing us, encouraging us, telling us that we all need to get vaccinated for months. They told us to follow the science and that the vaccines were incredibly effective. And why then are they still double masking social distancing after getting the vaccine? What kind of message is that sending? How does that encourage Americans who might be hesitant to get a vaccine? And of course tonight shortly after congratulating himself on his great COVID response, Joe then quickly moved to address the concerns of what is his radical socialist base. That is the New Democratic Socialist Party outlining his very own Green New Deal including of fully clean green power grid environmental renovations for thousands of homes and schools and buildings and 500,000 electric-charging stations for electric cars that Americans have not shown much interest in. A massive expansion of Medicaid and apparently massive new government subsidies for wind turbines and other forms of green energy. Take a look."

Now second of all, Biden isn't just planning to raise taxes on individuals making 200,000. Yes, he screwed it up again. But also couples, small businesses, corporations, which they pass the costs on to you, when the cost of energy goes up, you pay for it, that -- you pay at the pump, when you fill your gas tank, you fill for heating your home and cooling your home. And by the way, anyone who makes any income through capital gains, yes, that's going to go from 23 to 43 percent. And even then, that's not going to be enough. Mark my words, everyone that pays taxes will be forced to pay for these massive spending bills. I say it over and over again. Corporations don't pay taxes, they will pass the tax loss to you. And you will pay more for goods and for services and for energy all at the same time. You will pay for it. Let's be clear. America does not have a revenue problem. Prior to the pandemic after the Trump tax cuts. Yes, the federal government took in more tax revenue after the tax cuts than ever before in history. We don't have a revenue problem. We have a government spending problem. And Joe wants to make it far worse on human growth hormone and steroids, frankly, the way he's going forward. This might even include single payer Medicare for All. In fact, tonight, just a few years after calling Obamacare a big bleeping deal, you know, the one that promised keep your doctor plan and save money, the one where millions lost their doctors, millions lost their plans and we're all paying about 250 percent more. Joe Biden wants you to know that the healthcare system is broken. Well, you broke it, Joe. And just a few months after trashing President Trump's plan to lower prescription drug prices, is now vowing to lower prescription drug prices. Ultimately, this theme of his speech was yes, class warfare, divide the country, redistribution with every cliche you'd expect, every bumper sticker, every slogan that you could possibly mix in. A socialist wish list. Any way you want to package it, what Biden presented tonight was the failed idea, ideology, philosophy of socialism. That's it. Now America has a choice. America is at a crossroads. Socialism which will fail or freedom and capitalism which would work. You have leftists, authoritarianism, statism or freedom and capitalism. America, you will get to decide we are at a crossroads. 2022 is the night you begin to decide the future of this great Republic. And tonight, once again, it really makes you wonder who's in charge inside the Democratic Party. As a matter of fact, Joe doesn't even bother to show up for as important COVID-19 meetings. According to a report from RealClearPolitics, state governors are now increasingly frustrated that both Biden and Kamala Harris routinely skipped the weekly conference calls that are used to be coordinating the country's COVID-19 response. In his absence, Joe Biden appointed Governor Cuomo, really? Of New York, that guy? The nursing home executive order guy to lead our nation's COVID- 19 conference calls. Yes, the same Andrew Cuomo, the one that signed that executive action, that catastrophic policy that forced elderly patients infected with COVID-19 at of hospitals and back into long-term care facilities which lead to massive outbreaks and death among New York's most vulnerable population. The same Andrew Cuomo who is now under federal investigation for covering up his state's true nursing home COVID-19 death toll. And tonight, according to an explosive report from the liberal New York Times, the cover up is even worse than we thought. According to the piece, Cuomo's top aides they spent months hiding the true death toll numbers from the general public and even the state's own health officials. And get this, \"The actions coincided with the period which Mr. Cuomo was pitching and then writing a book on the pandemic with assistance from his top aide.\" So is Andrew Cuomo ever going to be held accountable? I don't know if I'd hold my breath, I wouldn't count on it. Apparently, he's Joe's right hand man in the fight against COVID-19. Here with reaction. And by the way, Biden's joint address to Congress, Senator Ted Cruz. Senator Cruz, before we get to the socialist utopian, authoritarian statism of Joe Biden, I think we got to talk about the star of the night and that would be your colleague, our friend, and that would be Senator Tim Scott."

You know, you -- what I would argue we've had in our lifetime, three waves of conservatism Reagan, the Contract with America, and the Make America Great Again, America First agenda, all things that we agree on. In every case, that agenda, those policies work, the history of socialism, you know well, is one of failure of one of unfulfilled promises, more poverty.

You know, I challenge you to remember a single line from the speech. I mean, it was monotone, the chamber was nearly empty. And that really has characterized the first 100 days of Joe Biden that he's tried to say nothing notable. He's tried to tweet nothing notable. I think that made the political decision that many people were tired of the drama of the previous four years, and they wanted something calm. And so -- but Joe is deliberately being boring. But the substance of what he's saying is radical. This is the most radical, first 100 days of any president in the history of this country. This makes Barack Obama look mild and moderate. You look at what Joe Biden stood up there tonight and said. He said number one, we're raising taxes, we're raising every tax. If you pay taxes in America, your taxes are going up. He said that they're going to raise individual income taxes. They're going to raise corporate income taxes. They're going to raise taxes on small businesses. They're going to raise capital gains taxes. They're going to raise the death tax. Every tax is going up. And it's to the tune of trillions of dollars. Look at what Joe Biden didn't say tonight. He didn't say we're opening up small businesses. He didn't say we're getting people back to work. He didn't say we're getting kids back in school completely missing from his remarks tonight. What was the outrage that more than half of the kids in America are not in person in school five days a week, and he provided zero solution to the crisis at the border that he caused. He pretended it didn't exist. This was all about trillions of dollars in spending, massive job killing regulations, trillions of dollars in taxes. And it was -- it was an unapologetic partisan speech. There wasn't even the tiniest fig leaf of an outreach to the other side. You know, it was 100 days ago, he gave his inauguration. We talked about unity. He talked about common ground. All of that was gone tonight. Tonight, this was an agenda that was set by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and AOC. It's the radicals and socialists. What did he talk about also? The corrupt politicians act, H.R. 1, a federal takeover of elections to keep Democrats in power forever. And he didn't once reject the radical Democratic plan we saw introduced this last week to pack the U.S. Supreme Court with four new liberals. This was a frightening speech, and it was a frightening speech masquerading in really boring toes."

And Mark Kelly hasn't shown a fraction of the guts that Kyrsten Sinema has shown or Joe Manchin has shown. You know, I got to tell, Sean, the most radical line tonight was when Joe Biden said we the people is the government. No, Joe, you seriously misunderstand the constitution. We the people is not the government. We are not a country of dictators in Washington, running the people. We the people is the people, damn it, who are in charge of the government, whose freedom you're taking away, whose liberty you're stripping away.

They have none in Delaware. Both states require voter I.D. There's no drop boxes in the State of Delaware. They haven't been every precinct in Georgia.

His most compelling story about the exceptionalism of America, when Tim, who's a close personal friend tells that story of his grandfather. Who has his two grandsons at the kitchen table every day in that newspaper in front of them who was only years later to Tim find out his grandfather could not read but wanted a better life for his grandsons because he knew that's what America meant.

That the President just said we the people is government? I mean, I was shocked if we sat there, the American public needs to wake up, he doesn't understand what the constitution says. And the most concerning to me is think about how much money he is spending. I mean, if you look at what we spent in the in the New Deal, that's about 5.6 percent of the GDP. This is five times larger. So anybody out there, I don't care what he says about taxes, about how much money you make.

The bottom line is, Joe Biden instituted Catch and Release. If you come to America, you get released in the country. You never show up to your court date. If you're under 16, you stay here. Where does that all over Central America that Joe Biden is going back to Catch and Release? And Mark Kelly knows unless you change, Catch and Release and reform asylum, it's never ending.

The big takeaway for me was just the lack of energy in the chamber. I said to someone, this was, this was socialism presented in slow motion. We know they're moving fast, but the presentation was just no energy at all. And you contrast that to a little over a year ago, when we were in that chamber, and President Trump honored Rush Limbaugh and the speech that he gave. I mean, that to me was the real contrast that came through. So, they didn't want to talk about all the things they've done in the 100 days, all the crazy things they've done and what they want to do now.

But the image from the chamber was exactly the opposite as Mark just laid out, and Americans are tired of having their First Amendment Liberties assaulted and attacked like they have been for a year. It's time to get those back and let Americans live free not on this socialist vision that the Biden administration has."

I got to figure this out. We're going to come up with something. All right, thank you guys both. When we come back, Kayleigh McEnany, Steve Miller, they'll have reaction of Biden's radical address and much more. Speaking of Leo 2.0, he's coming up to straight ahead."

Senator Tim Scott, he called him out, he exposed Biden's lies one by one. Joining us with reaction to tonight's speech, \"OUTNUMBERED\" Co- Host, Kayleigh McEnany, Former White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller. It was a good line post speech. Well, I'm not particularly the biggest fan of lately, Chris Christie. That was like a 15-year-old with a credit card, Kaleigh, that kind of made me chuckle."

      "utterance": "Yes, that's exactly right. Look, Joe Biden has met with historians to try to make himself FDR. One notable difference as Rich Lowery points out, FDR had a 200 seat majority. Joe Biden has the slimmest majority since the final two years of Rutherford B. Hayes. So, that credit card he may try to make himself FDR, but he doesn't have the mandate to lead. And just, I know Tim Scott has gotten a ton of praise all well merited, I've just got to say to hear Tim Scott say America is not a racist country. That is what the American public wants to hear. An original sin is not the end of our story, redemption is. That inspiring message is the future of our party. What a contrast tonight."

Yes, it took Lyndon Johnson, he was the one that relied on Republicans, historically speaking. Steve Miller, you, you have played a role in crafting these speeches, State of the Union joint session of Congress with President Trump. There were good parts of this speech by America sounded right like Donald Trump, never ending wars. We got to get out of them. That sounded a lot like Donald Trump. Prescription drug prices be lowered. That sounded a lot like Donald Trump, said, wow, maybe learned a thing or two."

This was a laundry list. Like a series of bullet points, read in order, nothing stitching it together. No big idea. I mean, compare that to a year ago. In President Trump's speech with all of the excitement and the enthusiasm, and the energy, the patriotism, the optimism, this speech was literally like watching paint dry on the side of an old house."

I did, it doesn't seem to be a vitality, in, in, in how he approaches this. And it's the hardest job in the world, Kayleigh. This is not, this is not for somebody that doesn't have a high energy level."

Look, my, my friend and former colleague, Stephen Miller, I got to say that last state of the union by President Trump was one of the most well written state of the unions well delivered State of the Union I've ever heard. It's about the American people. And to watch American hero stand up all across that room as President Trump acknowledged them, inspiring our country to come together in unity. It was a beautiful speech and you just got none of that tonight. Well done, Stephen Miller. He teaches as a speech writer."

Sean, I've been on every one of these Fox programs and your program. Systemic discrimination does not exist. Systemic discrimination does not exist. You had Tim Scott, basically debunked all the lies being told by the left. He said very clearly, America is not a racist country. And he told the truth. Tim Scott should be the Senate Minority Leader, effective tomorrow, because he is the leader. He is a shining star within the Republican Party. One final point, he made it very clear. And I said this to you last night, Sean, that Democrats do not want to get rid of the race issue. They love it. And what Tim Scott said they rather have the issue to the solution? Exactly, because they want the chaos. But Tim Scott is a truth teller and you saw it tonight."

      "utterance": "Well, the Democrats, of course, need to have the race card. Without the race card, they can't win. And Leo is exactly right. They want this issue. They don't want it to go away. And by the way, it's a bogus issue. Not only is it bogus, it's getting people killed. It's called the Ferguson effect. The cops are pulling back for fear of being accused of racism. Bad guys know it. Young black men are not complying because they're being taught by our so-called leaders, whether it's brock Obama or Al Sharpton or Eric Holder or Maxine Waters that the police are out to get you, so why should they comply? And as a result, a stop that otherwise would be fairly routine becomes DEFCON 1 because of this systemic racism lie. Was I asleep when Obama got elected and re-elected? And when in 2008, the percentage of eligible blacks exceeded the percentage of eligible whites to vote for the first time in American history? In 1958, when this question was first asked whether you would vote for a black president, 37 percent of Americans said yes, now only three percent say no. So, where's the systemic racism? It's a con that the Democrats are doing for votes and the media does for ratings."
