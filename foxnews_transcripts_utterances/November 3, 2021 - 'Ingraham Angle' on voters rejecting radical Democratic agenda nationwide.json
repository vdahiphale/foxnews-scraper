That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, last night I predicted that most Democrats would glean all the wrong lessons from the Republican victories, and today I was proven right.

But the economy, supply chain issues, empty stores on Christmas, that bothers them a heck of a lot too.

Oh, and if he is someone few are talking about Cuban- American Jason Mijares, who won the race for attorney general in Virginia. Now, both are first in the Old Dominion. But, of course, we know Democrats only prattle on about firsts when they're on their team. The populist conservative movement was already gaining Hispanic support under Trump. And that support is only growing. Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics noted that, \"So the shifts in New Jersey should be much more concerning to Democrats than the more or less uniform swing we saw in Virginia. Biggest swings from 2017 are in heavily Hispanic areas.\" Now, we're going to talk more about the Hispanic issue later on in the show. But somehow, Democrats conclude that the way to stop the bleed with Hispanic voters is to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on climate change and universal pre-K. And how exactly will Hispanic small business owners and there are thousands and thousands stay fully staffed when Democrat policies will just make it easier for people to stay home longer? My friends, this is sheer madness. Trump's pre-COVID economic success demonstrated how to do it. He did it. The fact is Democrats long ago lost touch with the beating heart of America, which is its middle class, the blue collar workforce. Their jobs were exported overseas and the old establishment didn't care frankly of either party. Their fathers and sons are now dying from drugs crossing our southern border. They don't care. They're losing their jobs because of vaccine mandates. But the Democrats don't care. They're in favor of vax mandates. And now, these same blue collar workers are struggling to fill up their gas tanks, and no one on the left cares. Perhaps, Democrats should remember what happened the last time they ran through their dream legislation despite having zero Republican support.",

Well, last night, Joe Biden won by 10 points in Virginia, and he lost by two points last night. Make no mistake, Joe Biden's agenda was on the ballot last night. There were a lot of things that were rejected by the voters last night. Big Government socialism was the biggest thing voters rejected. They also rejected critical race theory, defunding the police was rejected, the idea that union bosses are more important than parents and the kids education that was rejected by the voters too. And so if you're a Democrat, not just in the states, like Virginia and New Jersey, any district in the country, if Joe Biden won by 10 or 12 points, those districts weren't Republican. And by the way, they can't bring Joe Biden, because Terry McAuliffe brought out all the big guns, all the leftist, all the radicals. Kamala Harris might have said it best, Laura.

A man seen as one of the most powerful democratic critic legislators in the country. And just to the north of New York, Republicans crushed Democrats in two district attorneys races on Long Island and what's being seen as a stunning rebuke of New York's bail reform law. And while not technically a GOP win, the crushing defeat of the socialist Democratic candidate for Buffalo's mayoral position is another resounding defeat for the far left. Likewise, pro business, pro law enforcement Democrat Eric Adams won the New York City mayoral race. Now, in Texas, Republicans flipped a Statehouse seat in the San Antonio area that Biden won by 14 points last year, and that is majority Hispanic. Up north in Colorado, more than half the Denver School Board could be replaced after a slate of conservative candidates swept their races. And as the Left Coast turning as well, well, Republican and Davidson won a resounding victory in Seattle's District Attorney race against a self described police abolitionist. In the city of George Floyd, voters rejected a ballot measure to defund the Minneapolis police department. American voters aren't stupid. They've spoken. The New Left is not welcome here.

Don't forget, if a drug has a great risk-benefit, but it doesn't have a medical need, why take it? If I'm not in pain, I don't take a pain medicine, for example. That is a generalization. With vaccines you have to make sure that there is a need. The FDA and the CDC both did a pretty good evaluation based on the limited data available today of the risks and benefits of the vaccine. They didn't really look at the medical need, however, as much, but when they looked at the risk- benefit, what they did find was there was some potential benefit. There was no reduction in hospitalizations, severe infection, or deaths shown. This is largely because it was a sample size of just 3,000 kids who got the vaccine. Similarly, they didn't show any severe side effects. However, we know that some of the really severe side effects or adverse events are rare, and in the sample size of 3,000, it's too small of a subset of a population to really assess whether there really are risks that are more rare than one in 3,000 or not. And so that remains to be seen. But the FDA admittedly used not the actual hard data, but what they consider modeling in order to make their decision and eventually give that authorization. And the modeling is as good as the model, right. And so in their model they, in fact, admitted that under four of the scenarios that they tested, one of them failed, and that was when there is relatively low community infection rate and low community transmission rate. And so in that case it's slam-dunk, even based on the FDA's best case modeling, right, that this is not necessarily a winning argument risk-benefit-wise.",

Sean Trende of RealClearPolitics noted that, \"So the shifts in New Jersey should be much more concerning to Democrats than the more or less uniform swing we saw in Virginia. Biggest swings from 2017 are in heavily Hispanic areas.\" Now, we're going to talk more about the Hispanic issue later on in the show. But somehow, Democrats conclude that the way to stop the bleed with Hispanic voters is to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on climate change and universal pre-K. And how exactly will Hispanic small business owners and there are thousands and thousands stay fully staffed when Democrat policies will just make it easier for people to stay home longer? My friends, this is sheer madness. Trump's pre-COVID economic success demonstrated how to do it. He did it. The fact is Democrats long ago lost touch with the beating heart of America, which is its middle class, the blue collar workforce. Their jobs were exported overseas and the old establishment didn't care frankly of either party. Their fathers and sons are now dying from drugs crossing our southern border. They don't care. They're losing their jobs because of vaccine mandates. But the Democrats don't care. They're in favor of vax mandates.

Never acknowledging that it's because their policies are destroying the American dream. It's the definition of insanity. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton.

But I can tell you, that's not what the body language said. Those Democrats in Congress looked like the voters walked over their grave last night. Because the voters in New Jersey and in Virginia, and for that matter in places like San Antonio and Long Island and Minneapolis and Seattle, all repudiated the Democrats' radical agenda. They know that this short - multi-trillion dollar spending bill is just going to make the prices they pay at the gas pump, or the grocery store go up, that it's riddled with billions of dollars of ridiculous, ridiculous equity programs that are counting and dividing by race, things like tree equity, whatever that means. And that it's going to encourage local school districts to continue to push critical race theory, now down to pre-K if the federal government gets its hands on pre kindergarten education.

They know that this bill has nothing to do with coronavirus. The problems in our schools are created by Democratic governors and school boards who shut our schools down and then keep our kids in masks.

Now, today the National Republican Congressional Committee added 13 new names to its target list, now it's a total of 70. Wow! But how many more names could be added before 2022?

      "speaker": "REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA)",

Because if you think about it a month ago, if you were in a district that Joe Biden won by maybe 12 points, you probably thought you were safe and it was just those few members where maybe Trump won by one; or Biden won by two or three, that were the vulnerable ones. Well, last night, Joe Biden won by 10 points in Virginia, and he lost by two points last night. Make no mistake, Joe Biden's agenda was on the ballot last night. There were a lot of things that were rejected by the voters last night. Big Government socialism was the biggest thing voters rejected. They also rejected critical race theory, defunding the police was rejected, the idea that union bosses are more important than parents and the kids education that was rejected by the voters too. And so if you're a Democrat, not just in the states, like Virginia and New Jersey, any district in the country, if Joe Biden won by 10 or 12 points, those districts weren't Republican. And by the way, they can't bring Joe Biden, because Terry McAuliffe brought out all the big guns, all the leftist, all the radicals. Kamala Harris might have said it best, Laura. When she said, what happens in Virginia is ultimately going to be what happens in 2022 and 2024. So how about that?"

And their answer is today to try to go back and pass this crazy multi-trillion dollar bill to pay people not to work, to tax people.

If they go back on us, it's a betrayal of what we were told. So Joe Biden doesn't even know what his own the handlers are agreeing to on his behalf. That - I found that to be disturbing.

It's time for around the country in 90 seconds. Election edition. First in New Jersey, where a trucker who spent 153 bucks on his campaign is on track to defeat the democratic states senate president. A man seen as one of the most powerful democratic critic legislators in the country. And just to the north of New York, Republicans crushed Democrats in two district attorneys races on Long Island and what's being seen as a stunning rebuke of New York's bail reform law. And while not technically a GOP win, the crushing defeat of the socialist Democratic candidate for Buffalo's mayoral position is another resounding defeat for the far left. Likewise, pro business, pro law enforcement Democrat Eric Adams won the New York City mayoral race. Now, in Texas, Republicans flipped a Statehouse seat in the San Antonio area that Biden won by 14 points last year, and that is majority Hispanic. Up north in Colorado, more than half the Denver School Board could be replaced after a slate of conservative candidates swept their races. And as the Left Coast turning as well, well, Republican and Davidson won a resounding victory in Seattle's District Attorney race against a self described police abolitionist. In the city of George Floyd, voters rejected a ballot measure to defund the Minneapolis police department. American voters aren't stupid. They've spoken. The New Left is not welcome here. And that's around the country in about 90 seconds. Now, it's time to meet two of the people behind last night's victories. Joining me now is Angela Allen, who won her Virginia School Board race after being turned off by one party rule; and Don Samuels, former Minneapolis city council member, who fought against this reimagining of the police. Angela, let's start with you. Congratulations on your win in Goochland County. What is driving moms like you to run for these positions?"

They got $175,000 in donations from, I guess, it was the ACLU of New York, and 220k from the Solidaire Action Fund in California. The ballot pushers also got 650,000 from the Open Society Policy Center founded by George Soros.

I think that was exploited to some degree by forces outside our city. And - so the vote was a resounding sort of a democratic revolution, if you will, in our city to say, we are going to come back from the extremes and find practical solutions that won't betray us in their outcomes, making things worse."

I mean, I don't know anybody who doesn't think the evils of slavery should be taught and taught really clearly to our kids. And the heroes of the abolitionist movement, their story should be taught as well. Obviously, that's just an obvious. But other things were going on with state control and even federal - the threat of perhaps eventually federal mandates on local educational decisions. How important was that?"

But she also ends up blaming - she blamed the police for bringing this on themselves, the issue of police defund. What's happening with the Democrats if they don't see how important the issue of safety on the streets for the good people of Minneapolis and, frankly, St. Paul as well? Why are they out of touch?"

I think the congresswoman and the attorney general were out of touch, in fact, with the voters on this issue. And last night's victory said that, in fact, the people of Minneapolis want a sensible solution to both renegade police officers and the culture of policing, and to keeping our communities safe. It is both-and, not either-or. And the either-or was going to win on the either and put the or at great risk, meaning the 30 children who have been shot in our city, the 80 people who have been killed, 85 percent of those being African-Americans, those shot, same percentage. So this is what the people of Minneapolis want. This is what they voted for --"

They don't deserve the damage, they don't deserve bad policing, they don't deserve police dismantlement. But Ilhan Omar said we don't want your damn reforms. That's what her reaction to that was."

We definitely want to wait and make sure that children have an opportunity to get vaccinated, so that will have been no sooner than about eight weeks after the vaccine is available to kids."

Joining me now is Bernadette Rosselli, a mother of five just outside of San Francisco, and Dr. Houman Hemmati, board-certified MD, PHD, research scientist, father of two. Bernadette, what was your reaction when you heard the city was planning to force vaxxes on kids, otherwise no public events, apparently, for them?"

      "utterance": "Hi, Laura, thanks for having me. Absolutely ridiculous. There's not enough science behind this right now. And parents are concerned, and rightly so. And so I think that it's important that we take the time to make sure our children will be safe, especially when they are at such a low rate of risk. It's really not necessary to rush into this. Let's give it a little bit of time. We don't have the science backing the long-term effects of it. And I think that, again, there is no rush for this."

      "speaker": "DR. HOUMAN HEMMATI, SAYS MANDATE NOT BASED ON SCIENCE",
      "utterance": "I'm glad you asked, right. With vaccines, as with any drug, there is a calculation that has to be made of risk, benefit, and need. Don't forget, if a drug has a great risk-benefit, but it doesn't have a medical need, why take it? If I'm not in pain, I don't take a pain medicine, for example. That is a generalization. With vaccines you have to make sure that there is a need. The FDA and the CDC both did a pretty good evaluation based on the limited data available today of the risks and benefits of the vaccine. They didn't really look at the medical need, however, as much, but when they looked at the risk- benefit, what they did find was there was some potential benefit. There was no reduction in hospitalizations, severe infection, or deaths shown. This is largely because it was a sample size of just 3,000 kids who got the vaccine. Similarly, they didn't show any severe side effects. However, we know that some of the really severe side effects or adverse events are rare, and in the sample size of 3,000, it's too small of a subset of a population to really assess whether there really are risks that are more rare than one in 3,000 or not. And so that remains to be seen. But the FDA admittedly used not the actual hard data, but what they consider modeling in order to make their decision and eventually give that authorization. And the modeling is as good as the model, right. And so in their model they, in fact, admitted that under four of the scenarios that they tested, one of them failed, and that was when there is relatively low community infection rate and low community transmission rate. And so in that case it's slam-dunk, even based on the FDA's best case modeling, right, that this is not necessarily a winning argument risk-benefit-wise."

So Fauci is still out there, and the goal, I'm sorry, is to terrify parents. That is the goal. And Bernadette, they're positively giddy about getting the kids vaccinated. Bernadette, the cost-benefit analysis, you heard Dr. Hemmati, he's brilliant, beyond brilliant, your thoughts now. Is it even a close call given what we know now in this sample size?"

He said \"We are never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is until we start giving it. That's the way it goes.\" These are our children. They are not guinea pigs. I'm sorry, this is science we are going by, let's just see what happens? If this is the approach they are taking, I am truly concerned. And I think more parents really need to look into this."
