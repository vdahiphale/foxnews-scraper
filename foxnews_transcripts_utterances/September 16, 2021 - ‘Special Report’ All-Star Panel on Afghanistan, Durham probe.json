And essentially what the military is saying is that within the parameters he had given us, we didn't have any choice. We had to make -- that there weren't any options. Now, we told him you can do it this way instead, and he said no, that won't fit with the mission. And so that's where we got where we got. It's on Biden. He made the call.",

Over the years they downplayed the existence of Al-Qaeda in country. They whitewashed some of the Taliban. They did that in public setting. They did that certainly in private settings. But I think Kimberley is right. This is ultimately Joe Biden's call. And there were certainly intelligence assessments that said to the president if you withdraw U.S. troops, if you reduce the American presence on the ground in Afghanistan, it will have negative effects on what's happening there and will hurt our ability, certainly, to collect more intelligence.

When employees worked to change that, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports that Mark Zuckerberg resisted some of the changes because it would reduce that user engagement.

      "speaker": "JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "He was provided a range of advice. It is crystal clear that 2,500 troops would not have been sustainable on the ground. It would have been either increased troops on the ground or withdrawal troops on the ground. He was not going to send thousands and thousands more troops to fight a war the Afghans did not want to fight themselves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "But, Kimberley, that's the strawman. That wasn't the offer. And from everything we are getting about General Miller, the commander on the ground, and what he recommended and perhaps what other military advisers were recommending, it was something short of that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, the disconnect here all along is that President Biden has been blaming the military for decisions that were made, or saying, hey, this was the best advice, and I was just doing what they told me do. It's on them if it went wrong. But the reality is, and this puts it in better context, is that the president is always in charge of setting the mission. And essentially what the military is saying is that within the parameters he had given us, we didn't have any choice. We had to make -- that there weren't any options. Now, we told him you can do it this way instead, and he said no, that won't fit with the mission. And so that's where we got where we got. It's on Biden. He made the call."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And obviously that hearing we will get to September 28th with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley. Steve, this will be a major question, but as will, obviously, the Woodward-Costa book and all the allegations there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think we can bet on a number of questions about the Woodward- Costa book and the firestorm over the past 36 hours. On this question, look, the U.S. military leadership on the ground in Afghanistan made plenty of mistakes, and I think gave plenty of bad advice. Over the years they downplayed the existence of Al-Qaeda in country. They whitewashed some of the Taliban. They did that in public setting. They did that certainly in private settings. But I think Kimberley is right. This is ultimately Joe Biden's call. And there were certainly intelligence assessments that said to the president if you withdraw U.S. troops, if you reduce the American presence on the ground in Afghanistan, it will have negative effects on what's happening there and will hurt our ability, certainly, to collect more intelligence. So that's on Joe Biden."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Increasing pressure on social media giants tonight over allegations their platforms have too much power and influence. President Biden is expressing his opinion, shared by many of all political persuasions left and right, that the situation is actually growing worse. This comes on the heels of a report that Facebook is putting good business ahead of good practice. Edward Lawrence of FOX Business joins us tonight from the White House with this story. Good evening, Edward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Bret. As Facebook tried to make its service a healthier place, \"The Wall Street Journal\" found documents, internal documents that show it actually made it more angry. The report shows that the new algorithm that Facebook had would push more and more divisive content because it was driving engagement. When employees worked to change that, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports that Mark Zuckerberg resisted some of the changes because it would reduce that user engagement. So tech experts say that they don't hold Facebook accountable for society's divisions, but for being cynical about them."

    {
      "speaker": "VIVEK RAMASWAMY, BIOTECH ENTREPRENEUR AND AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "What I do hold them to account for is lying about it, consciously knowing about their effects, creating this do-good smokescreen as they are taking steps to actually make the world and America a better place, while, in fact, knowingly doing the opposite and creating this smokescreen that ultimately prevent the public from seeing it. That, I think, is the real case of arguable fraud on the public here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAWRENCE",
      "utterance": "Now a Facebook spokesperson tells me that the new algorithm ranks post that inspire interactions. That spokesperson adds this, that \"Research shows certain partisan division in our society have been growing for many decades, long before platforms like Facebook even existed. It also shows that meaningful engagement with friends and family on our platform is better for people's well-being than the alternative.\" Further, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports that Facebook knew Instagram gives one in three teenage girls a worse self-image of their bodies yet did nothing about it. About this, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki says that the president believes that social media companies in general hold too much power. So on Capitol Hill a bipartisan group of senators will probe into this. And, Bret, I can tell you that since January of 2019, Mark Zuckerberg has testified five times in front of Congress, and nothing has changed. Back to you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Edward Lawrence at the White House. Edward, thanks. We're back with our panel. Harold, listen, I'm concerned about how much time I spend on social media let alone my kids who are young. This seems to cross party lines about concerns about this on a number of different fronts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FORD",
      "utterance": "And I have a seven-year-old daughter, so the last part of Edward's story was that much more disconcerting. I think what this probably increases, obviously, is the likelihood of some regulation and oversight from Congress. And I hope one of the questions that they might ask anew of all of these social media CEOs and even maybe even bringing some of their deputies to testify as well, is to how many of you -- how many of these other companies have had memos written or things suggested to them that somehow they are fostering and encouraging engagement is having a negative effect on society. If they can't police themselves, they should understand that attorneys general and/or Congress will have to step in and do it, especially if you know it and you choose not to police it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes. Kimberley, this is a -- I'll play devil's advocate here -- a double edged sword because when you go down the road of regulation and you go down the road of what Congress can possibly do, are you killing the goose that is laying the golden egg for America's economy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, correct., I'm in the camp of those that doesn't -- I mean, thinks that people and users have to make their own decisions about social media. That's not necessarily government's call. But at the same time, more established, long established companies have long understood that one of the reasons you really care about best practices is so that you do not give government and opportunity or a reason to come regulate you. And you have got to wonder who is advising and running these teams at these social media platforms which just continue to land in it again and again, and, like wave a red flag in front of Congress saying please, some step into our businesses. And they really need to think about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "That's true. And when you are ahead of an election, Steve, it's really appetizing for some of these politicians to get into this black hat mentality because it's an easy target, some of these companies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "Sure. Yes, look, it is sort of a vicious cycle, right? You have the exacerbation of our polarization problems by the media companies, by the social media companies. And then the politicians use that to further divide us. It's sort of a never-ending cycle. I think what was most striking about \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting about Facebook is it has long been clear to anybody who has spent any time on social media that it has these effects, that it encourages this virality and this false information and this polarization. And what you had particularly in the case of Instagram was senior Facebook officials testifying and saying, yes, we are not really aware of these bad effects, or the external studies say that it could be good for young women to spend time on Instagram. And, in fact, what their internal research was saying was just the opposite. I think that's troubling. And that's what I think will be the focus of questions going forward as these media executives, social media executives come before Congress once again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, Harold, going back to your point, some of these social media executives, their kids, they don't have smart phones. They have got flip phones."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FORD",
      "utterance": "Without question, I don't disagree with anything that's been said. But all of them need now to come forward and be proactive and share what do they now about how their content, how their engagement, how deleterious and how damaging it can be, and what are they doing to protect and guard against that? And if they can't do it, then they should expect what we have all said. Someone else will, and it likely will be government."
