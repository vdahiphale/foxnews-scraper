Donald Trump, Jr. is here with his first interview since we learned what is inside that report. Also, give you a remarkable update on the creepy porn lawyer, a lot has happened in his life. But first to the Mueller probe. The Special Counsel's investigation, \"Did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential election,\" end quote. That is Robert Mueller's conclusion after nearly two years of investigating the matter. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Attorney General repeated versions of that sentence four times in his summary of Mueller's report released yesterday.

There were spies in our midst. The President of the United States was one of them. He was disloyal, a quisling, an agent of a nation a hates us and seeks our destruction. That man was at the helm of our country, destroying democracy, undermining our values, poisoning this nation from within. He was terrifying and millions of Americans were terrified. Some wept as they talked about their fear and helplessness. Now we know that none of that was true. You would think the relief at learning this would be overpowering like finding out a terminal illness was just a cold. The long and bitter war has ended. We are safe.

They had to know their talking points wouldn't work. They repeated them anyway. Why? Because they didn't know what else to say. Over on CNN, Jeff Zucker dispatched his eunuch to address the channel's viewership, meaning those Americans trapped at the airport waiting for flights, you may think CNN has been lying to you relentlessly for the last two years, the eunuch explained.

In the end, CNN paid Jewell a settlement for slandering him, but Jewell never recovered his life. Just two years later, CNN falsely the United States Military of murdering American defectors during the Vietnam War with sarin gas. It was a ludicrous story based on obvious lies. CNN ran it anyway because it confirmed their world view. Three years after that, CNN implied again on the basis of zero evidence that a California Congressman called Gary Condit had murdered one of his interns.

Then in January, they told us that a group of boys from a Catholic School in Kentucky were dangerous bigots who threatened to a revered tribal elder Vietnam veteran purely because they hated American Indians. Every part of that claim was a lie. And CNN is now facing a $275 million lawsuit for repeating that lie, yet CNN kept going.

Exactly two weeks after Smollett was indicted for telling the same lies that CNN uncritically repeated, we learned that the Russian collusion narrative, which by the way, has formed the backbone of CNN's entire programming schedule for two years is fake. It's a hoax. It never happened. CNN responded by congratulating itself. Jeff Zucker still runs the network, his job apparently is safe.

Nineteen Federal prosecutor spent nearly two years investigating the Democratic Party's claim that Donald Trump stole the presidential election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Investigators in the case had a limitless budget and essentially no restrictions of any kind. They hired dozens of FBI agents, intelligence analysts and forensic accountants to help them investigate. They issued nearly 3,000 subpoenas. They received hundreds of search warrants and hundreds more surveillance orders. They showed up at people's homes with automatic weapons pointed in their faces. They spied on American citizens.  They read their texts, downloaded their e-mails. They interviewed at least 500 separate witnesses. Not since September 11th have Federal investigators dug more deeply into a case. And in the end, they proved the charges false. Democrats have decided to ignore the findings. Instead they say they want justice by which of course they mean revenge, punishment, power. That's what they've always wanted. The rest of this, the Mueller investigation included, was staged purely for show. Shame on the rest of us for falling for it yet again. You'd like to believe that people who did this will be held accountable.  They heard our country, they poisoned our public sphere, they distorted our foreign policy, they completely terrified the population. They should be punished. It's not like we don't punish people here. We live in a society where people lose their job for believing in biology, in a place where college students risk having their lives destroyed for telling the wrong joke. America is suddenly a very punitive place. But these people will escape what they deserve. You know, they will because they so often have before.  The very same people who push the Russian collusion conspiracy are the ones who told us Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction in 2003. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } A few years after that, they had assured us that the housing market was absolutely solid, no problem. Go ahead and invest. Just the other day, they informed us that will have to stay in Syria and Afghanistan forever because of threats that only they understand. Tomorrow, they'll be telling you to take the bus to work because of global warming. They will never take the bus. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They won't have to. They will never face the consequences of the disasters they created. Instead, they'll keep getting rich from failure, another TV contract, other committee chairmanship, other fat grant from a Soros-funded foundation. And as they prosper, they will continue to lecture you from Twitter about your imaginary moral failings. Shut up, racist. Obey.  That's what's likely to happen in the aftermath of this hoax. That's what's always happened. How long do they think this can continue? Donald Trump, Jr. was recently labeled a traitor to his country by a press that could not accept this father's victory. Tonight, he's here to respond.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" For the first time in a moment, the President's son will talk about being a central target in the Mueller probe. Donald Trump, Jr. is here with his first interview since we learned what is inside that report. Also, give you a remarkable update on the creepy porn lawyer, a lot has happened in his life. But first to the Mueller probe. The Special Counsel's investigation, \"Did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential election,\" end quote. That is Robert Mueller's conclusion after nearly two years of investigating the matter. The Attorney General repeated versions of that sentence four times in his summary of Mueller's report released yesterday. Whatever you think of Donald Trump, it's not factually established that he did not collude with Vladimir Putin to steal the Presidential election, period. That case is now closed. This is the point in the story where applause breaks out. Not just cheers from Trump and his family and campaign staff and all of those many people who were told they were going to be indicted, but weren't, but gratitude from the country itself, from all Americans of all political parties. For years we've all been told that our government was being controlled by a foreign power. There were spies in our midst. The President of the United States was one of them. He was disloyal, a quisling, an agent of a nation a hates us and seeks our destruction. That man was at the helm of our country, destroying democracy, undermining our values, poisoning this nation from within. He was terrifying and millions of Americans were terrified. Some wept as they talked about their fear and helplessness. Now we know that none of that was true. You would think the relief at learning this would be overpowering like finding out a terminal illness was just a cold. The long and bitter war has ended. We are safe. But that is not how most on the left are responding tonight. They are not celebrating for their country.  They are not grateful. They are angrier than ever. To them, the Mueller investigation has proved nothing and exonerated no one. Russian collusion is as real to them is it was the day first Hillary Clinton alleged it. Progressives have not surrendered the vast robot army of the Democratic Party fights on as if nothing has changed."

Mueller, the very man you loved and trusted, the one whose report you looked forward to like it was Christmas. The grey-haired angel of truth who was going to deliver you from the orange scourge, our friend, Robert Mueller. It turns out Mueller was part of this conspiracy, too. It was a conspiracy so brilliant, so complex that he and 18 other Federal prosecutors conducted a two-year Potemkin investigation in order to shield their plot from discovery. Diabolical. Why would Mueller do that? Come on, you know the answer because it's always the same answer. Robert Mueller is a racist."

You should be ignored. And so should Trump by the way. Go ahead and ignore his complaints about being persecuted. He's just whining.

      "utterance": "It goes without saying that Democratic Members of Congress echoed these sentiments or maybe it was the other way around, the media aping the Democratic Party, suddenly it's hard to tell who is taking cues from whom?  Any remaining distinctions between journalists and the country' ruling class have long since disappeared. Reporters used to boast about holding the powerful to account. Now, they scramble to do their bidding. \"The Washington Post\" is owned by the richest progressive in the world. They're one interest group now. You can't tell one from another. Politicians and prosecutors and intel agency heads told us implausible lies about Russian collusion. Reporters are paid to push back, but they didn't. Instead, they welcomed those lies and then amplified them. They're proud to do that, but they are not apologizing for it now. In their first statement after the Mueller report's summary became public, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the two leaders of the Democratic Party in Congress didn't mention the fact that Trump had been cleared of collusion. Neither did any Democratic politician appearing on cable news. Virginia Congressman Don Bayern insisted this morning that quote, \"There was a lot of collusion within the Trump campaign, even though Robert Mueller whom Democrats have t old us many times is the final word on the question had already told us otherwise. So nobody was fooled by any of this. Mueller's summary is on the internet. You can read it yourself if you want and reach your own conclusions. So by lying about the obvious, and doing it so obviously, Democrats merely revealed themselves to be everything they claim Donald Trump is -- stupid, irresponsible, reckless, corrupt, buffoonish. They had to know their talking points wouldn't work. They repeated them anyway. Why? Because they didn't know what else to say. Over on CNN, Jeff Zucker dispatched his eunuch to address the channel's viewership, meaning those Americans trapped at the airport waiting for flights, you may think CNN has been lying to you relentlessly for the last two years, the eunuch explained. Not at all. CNN has done a fantastic job. None of this was our fault. We're amazing. Listen to him squeak."

So don't be fooled by the partisans who cherry pick the worst mistakes of individual journalists or the craziest ideas from commentators and claim that's the entire media. It's not. We're waiting for the facts because here is what I know. I mean, you're going to hear this from the right for the next days and weeks to come that the press has basically made all of this up to take down President Trump.  But the press is just following a trail that Trump created."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "The greatest value add. That's how CNN sums up its role in the Russia story. Does a single person believe that? Of course not. Not one person. Jeff Zucker himself doesn't believe that, and that's why he sent his marionette out to lie as you just saw. Jeff Zucker is an anxious man tonight. He's been caught doing the one thing journalists are not allowed to do. He intentionally misled his audience. In a fair world, Jeff Zucker would be running a car wash or he would be selling time shares in Cancun. He would not be in the news business.  Zucker himself knows that very well. He knows he's an imposter. In a fair world, CNN wouldn't call itself a news network at all. It's far less than that, and it has been for a long time. In 1996, CNN blamed the Olympic bombings in Atlanta on an entirely innocent security guard name, Richard Jewell. In the end, CNN paid Jewell a settlement for slandering him, but Jewell never recovered his life. Just two years later, CNN falsely the United States Military of murdering American defectors during the Vietnam War with sarin gas. It was a ludicrous story based on obvious lies. CNN ran it anyway because it confirmed their world view. Three years after that, CNN implied again on the basis of zero evidence that a California Congressman called Gary Condit had murdered one of his interns. CNN's relentless coverage helped drive Condit from office. Condit turned out to be innocent. Too late.  His life and family were destroyed. Now, you'd think a news network might learn from debacles like this. And yet, under the leadership of Jeff Zucker, CNN's recklessness and its dishonesty have only accelerated. Just this past September, CNN told us that Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh was a gang rapist alcoholic who targeted underage girls. Then in January, they told us that a group of boys from a Catholic School in Kentucky were dangerous bigots who threatened to a revered tribal elder Vietnam veteran purely because they hated American Indians. Every part of that claim was a lie. And CNN is now facing a $275 million lawsuit for repeating that lie, yet CNN kept going. Just days after its Covington Catholic fraud, CNN decided to amplify yet another racially divisive hoax, Jussie Smollett manufactured hate crime. And now this. Exactly two weeks after Smollett was indicted for telling the same lies that CNN uncritically repeated, we learned that the Russian collusion narrative, which by the way, has formed the backbone of CNN's entire programming schedule for two years is fake. It's a hoax. It never happened. CNN responded by congratulating itself. Jeff Zucker still runs the network, his job apparently is safe. CNN's anchors wonder aloud why Americans don't trust the news media. It must be that propaganda from Fox News. Yes, must be. It has absolutely nothing to do with coverage like this."

      "utterance": "Okay, in case you're wondering, and you may be why Donald Trump got elected President of the United States, you just saw it. Trump may be flawed, but the people in charge are just absurd. \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" have no idea. They still don't know why Trump won the election. They wholeheartedly agree with their friend, Carl Bernstein. Both of those newspapers won Pulitzer Prizes for their Russia coverage. In its citation, the Pulitzer Committee commended the reporters for their quote, \"deeply sourced relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically further the nation's understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elects transition team and his eventual administration,\" end quote. We need that run on sentence again, if you dare. You might want to keep those words somewhere as a keepsake memento like that, Dewey defeats Truman headline from the \"Chicago Tribune\" so many years ago. A monument to human absurdity. Your grandkids can read it and snicker. \"The Times\" and \"The Post\" though don't get the joke. They have no plans to return their prices. They think they did a great job. The rest of us can keep laughing, but there's an ominous lesson here, too.  Our leaders are not fit to lead. They have no idea what they're doing and they won't admit it. They are hysterical children, cruel and stupid and vain. They care only about themselves. They learn nothing from their mistakes. And so their self-regard undiminished. They march on to the next disaster full of self-righteous confidence. The next battle they tell us is over obstruction of justice. It doesn't seem to occur to them that justice is precisely what we got yesterday. Nineteen Federal prosecutor spent nearly two years investigating the Democratic Party's claim that Donald Trump stole the presidential election. Investigators in the case had a limitless budget and essentially no restrictions of any kind. They hired dozens of FBI agents, intelligence analysts and forensic accountants to help them investigate. They issued nearly 3,000 subpoenas. They received hundreds of search warrants and hundreds more surveillance orders. They showed up at people's homes with automatic weapons pointed in their faces. They spied on American citizens.  They read their texts, downloaded their e-mails. They interviewed at least 500 separate witnesses. Not since September 11th have Federal investigators dug more deeply into a case. And in the end, they proved the charges false. Democrats have decided to ignore the findings. Instead they say they want justice by which of course they mean revenge, punishment, power. That's what they've always wanted. The rest of this, the Mueller investigation included, was staged purely for show. Shame on the rest of us for falling for it yet again. You'd like to believe that people who did this will be held accountable.  They heard our country, they poisoned our public sphere, they distorted our foreign policy, they completely terrified the population. They should be punished. It's not like we don't punish people here. We live in a society where people lose their job for believing in biology, in a place where college students risk having their lives destroyed for telling the wrong joke. America is suddenly a very punitive place. But these people will escape what they deserve. You know, they will because they so often have before.  The very same people who push the Russian collusion conspiracy are the ones who told us Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction in 2003. A few years after that, they had assured us that the housing market was absolutely solid, no problem. Go ahead and invest. Just the other day, they informed us that will have to stay in Syria and Afghanistan forever because of threats that only they understand. Tomorrow, they'll be telling you to take the bus to work because of global warming. They will never take the bus. They won't have to. They will never face the consequences of the disasters they created. Instead, they'll keep getting rich from failure, another TV contract, other committee chairmanship, other fat grant from a Soros-funded foundation. And as they prosper, they will continue to lecture you from Twitter about your imaginary moral failings. Shut up, racist. Obey.  That's what's likely to happen in the aftermath of this hoax. That's what's always happened. How long do they think this can continue? Donald Trump, Jr. was recently labeled a traitor to his country by a press that could not accept this father's victory. Tonight, he's here to respond. We'll be right back."

Certainly, when you look at what the other side was doing, you realize that it was them in fact, colluding, not us. We were doing a campaign. We were functioning like any campaign would and that's what we did. So it was difficult to watch. It was difficult to watch what they're trying to and have been trying to do to my father for two years. And it's really the Democrats, with their media lackeys, creating a narrative that they want to be true because they couldn't explain the outcome of the last election. My father won. He was able to speak to the American people. He's been able to move the needle for them in a way that Barack Obama couldn't come close to doing. But by the way, it's not just a partisan issue. Bush couldn't have done it either. My father has done incredible things. He has done things for working class Americans.

No, we have none. Guys like Da Nang Dick Blumenthal go outside on the steps of Congress 30 seconds later hold a press conference saying, \"There are many questions that were not answered.\" It's nonsense, Tucker. It's all a game. And you've got the leader of the tin foil hat brigade, Adam Schiff out there every day talking about the evidence of collusion that he's seen. He is flagrantly lying to the American people. He's doing it every day on national television. He's gotten more airtime amazingly enough, than Michael Avenatti, but they're about of the same level of credibility. And there's no accountability for that, Tucker, because when you're on that side, and you have the media carrying your water for you, you can say whatever you want. When you're on our side, even when you're right, even when you're proven so, there's a level of culpability.

I know those people. Guess how many of them have even asked about Russia? Zero, because they know that it nonsense. And this is the media's classic move. They take the narrative that they understand in their little New York and DC bubbles, and they try to sell that to the rest of the country. But the rest of the country gets it. You know what they see? They see manufacturing jobs coming back to this country. They see their wages rising for the first time in decades. They see the stock market and their 401k is at all-time highs. They see all time low unemployment. What is -- the Democratic platform is do the opposite of anything that Donald Trump has done. If Donald Trump came out today in favor of oxygen, the left would be against it? Do they really want to reverse the successes that we have seen?

This started with the lawyer bureaucrats at the top of the FBI working with Hillary Clinton, Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele, Peter Strzok, those people need to be looked into. This was the greatest farce ever perpetrated on our democracy. It's a disgrace and it's a stain on our Constitution. We have to fix that. Then what I'd like -- I'd like us all to get together. Let's start working.  How about we pass some bills for infrastructure? Why don't the Democrats get together with the Republicans and my father, and actually start doing and continuing the amazing things that my father has been doing for the American people? That's what I'd like to say, you know. I'd like to see that kind of unity.  I'd like to see the Democrats focusing on what's good for the American people, not just for screaming on TV, trying to perpetuate a hoax and a myth that they themselves have created. Because the media and the Democrats have no credibility right now. The Adam Schiffs of the world have no credibility right now. And it's going to take years for them to gain that back if they don't try to actually do something to effectuate change, and to get things moving for the American people. Again, my father did amazing things with all of this stuff going on with this cloud over his head. Imagine what he could do if you let him do his thing. They may want to sit this one out.

For that, he was roundly attacked. By the way, we should say that Glenn Greenwald was when last we checked, the liberal party wouldn't vote for Trump at gunpoint, but he was still attacked roundly, by virtually everyone on the left. Howard Dean called him a possible Russian agent, but he did not seem to care and persisted. And of course, he has just been vindicated. Glenn Greenwald joins us tonight. So I think before it slips from collective memory, we should just restate once again, that you a liberal, were denounced as a Russian agent by other liberals. What was that like?"

These are people who are on the verge of losing their jobs. That whole network was about to collapse, this whole scam saved them. And not only did they constantly feed people for three straight years, total disinformation, they did it on purpose, Tucker. And the proof of that is that unlike you, who has been criticized and a lot of different ways by the left, some of which I agree with, and we talked about before, the first time I ever watched your show, you had on Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat to talk about on your set for 12 straight minutes collusion so that your audience could hear the other side of the story. MSNBC did the exact opposite. There was a whole slew not just me of left wing journalist with very high journalistic credentials far more than anyone on that network like Matt Taibbi and Jeremy Scahill and many others, including myself who were banned from the network because they wanted their audience not to know that anybody was questioning or expressing skepticism about the lies and the scam they were selling because it was so profitable.  They did it on purpose. It was a total fraud that they perpetrated on their audience. And to the extent that they talked about this at all, it was to call us agents of the Russian government to defame us as traders and to lie about us continuously to their audience. And there is still no accountability. They still won't put us on their airwaves. They still won't apologize and they're still lying to their audience. They don't want their audience to know what they did to them for three straight years on purpose. It's just -- it's unbelievable when you when you put it that way. One of the things that you've been, I think particularly, acute on and virtually nobody else has said this is those channel, both MSNBC and CNN, have hired and promoted a seat series of retired Intel officials -- Jim Comey, John Brennan -- and they come on and they basically parrot a certain set of talking points but with the imprimatur of the agencies, they once ran.  What effect does this have would you say an American society?"

The whole point of what we were supposed to learn from the debacle of WMDs and the Iraq War, which by the way, this network that we're on was one of the leaders of, was the fact that we were not supposed to trust intelligence agencies, when they say things without evidence. And not only did MSNBC and CNN use those people as their sources, they hired them as their news analyst. So if you turn on CNN or MSNBC, it was basically state TV. It was CIA TV. Three weeks ago, Tucker, three weeks ago, John Brennan was on MSNBC, and he said that he strongly believes that Robert Miller is going to indict members of the Trump family, either before or after March 15 because he's too noble to use the Ides of March for having conspired with Russia. They kept all dissent off the air. They turned themselves only into the spokes people of the people they are supposed to be investigating and scrutinizing which is the intelligence community and the military officials, who now are their colleagues, who now report the news. You have government officials who spent their whole careers in the Pentagon and in the CIA, they are disinformation agents, who now work at CNN and MSNBC, shaping what their news is. And that's why these channels turned into disinformation campaigns, because those are the people that they hire, the people they're supposed to be serving as watchdogs over the people who are neo-cons, the people who glide the country into war through WDMs, not only did they have no accountability, they got rewarded by becoming the stewards of these networks, and they lie to millions of people for three straight years and huge amounts of accountability is needed."

I watched Ken Delaney and the NBC reporter who is basically the CIA spokesman on Twitter say, \"Look, this is the end of the game Trump won.  There's no collusion,\" and huge numbers of people on Twitter that follow NBC were genuinely confused. They were saying, \"Wait a minute, you were telling us for three years all of this was a given that it was a slam dunk that it was just a matter of time when it would happen.\" I think they've completely lost credibility and faith, even among their own followers who are now confused and disoriented.

Just hours ago, the man you saw on the screen was arrested in Manhattan.  He's now facing indictments in both New York and the state of California.  Authority say he went years without paying any taxes on what he earned.  They say he embezzled cash for his own clients and employees. And most spectacularly, they say that he tried to extort millions of dollars from the Nike shoe company in a mafia style shakedown scheme. He's actually on tape doing his best John Gotti impression. In short, this guy is in serious trouble tonight. If he calls you with a \"can't fail it investment opportunity,\" it would probably best to pass on that one, just our advice. But tonight we're wondering what happened to all the people around the creepy porn lawyer and there were a lot of them. How are they doing? The Democratic officials who begged him to run for President. The donors who funded is exploratory committee. And more than anything, the media, they truly love this man."

I congratulate you, Tucker, because you grasp the essence of this character in a way that CNN and MSNBC and all the rest of the media didn't. As you know, we were talking, as you mentioned six months ago after that interview about the reality of the situation here that stormy Daniels is stripping on an 18-inch bar in Richmond, Virginia, hoping to get a few dollar bills and maybe the occasional five tucked in her garter while he's sitting there in a $4,000.00 suit and making exploratory trips to Iowa and New Hampshire. And in a way, it ties in with everything else you've been talking about this last hour, the way the media have been pushing things that are obviously phony down the throats of the American people. And no matter how often -- they're basically like a kind of army of Yosemite Sam's. They keep sticking the dynamite down their own pants. And no matter how often, Brian Stelter's pants are dynamited and Anderson Cooper's pants are dynamited and Don Lemon's pants are dynamited, they'll fall for the very next three people extortionist who comes along."
