      "sentences": "The House impeachment inquiry resolution has been put forward, likely to come to a vote on Thursday. Meantime, the White House was quick to react to that, putting out a statement from the press secretary Stephanie Grisham. The resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote. It continues the scam by allowing Chairman Schiff, who repeatedly lies to the American people, to hold a new round of hearings, still without any due process for the president. The White House is barred from participating at all until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee. Even then, the White House's rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain because those rules still haven't been written. This resolution does nothing to change the fundamental fact that House Democrats refuse to provide basic due process rights to the administration.\" Let's bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch,\" Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" also author of the bestseller \"Resistance At All Costs, How Trump Haters are Breaking America.\" Kimberley, first to you, your thoughts on this resolution and what this is shaping up to be? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So now we have this resolution, but as you could see, it certainly is not going to satisfy Republicans or shield them from ongoing complaints. It still isn't being done in the way the former impeachment proceedings have been done. Most notably, it has been outsourced to these three committees who will continue to do these hearings probably behind closed doors and where the president's counsel will not be welcomed to take part. They will not be able to take part until it actually goes to the Judiciary Committee, and that will allow Republicans to continue saying that this is being done in a one-sided way. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": I had not heard of Alexander Vindman before today, but I think it is likely that he is the most important witness that we've heard from so far on this impeachment inquiry because he was on the call, unlike the previous witnesses, unlike the whistleblower. He is not a political figure. He is someone who has served with honor in the Army, who got a Purple Heart from being wounded in the Iraq War. And he is someone who raised objections immediately after the phone call to the NSC Council, saying he thought some inappropriate had happened. So he is, I think, a very powerful voice to be heard from. And I think when we go to the public hearings, which are likely to start next month, we are likely to hear from him there.",

I think Democrats are overdue in opening up this process and actually putting this to a vote. We would all do better to have this done out in the open, and the president should be afforded the opportunity to defend himself, to have the White House defend himself. On the substance, though, I think your Republicans are facing a tough road here with two new harsh realities. The quid pro quo -- the no quid pro quo defense has basically collapsed. You now have multiple credible witnesses who have testified under oath the president engaged in this quid pro quo. That's highly problematic. And while I agree with Susan's point that Vindman was a credible witness, at least judging by his opening statement. We obviously couldn't see what he ultimately testified to and how he answered questions, but he's a person with a respected background. I think in some sense the more damaging witnesses for the White House are the Republicans. The president and the White House can complain about the process, and as I said, I think they have some legitimate gripes. The real problem is that the most damaging testimony comes from people like Mick Mulvaney and from Kurt Volker and from Gordon Sondland and from Bill Taylor, all people who the White House itself had brought in to the process and who worked for President Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",
