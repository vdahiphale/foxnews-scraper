This is, to Trey's point, someone who has spent his career in the Senate and in other roles, spouting off, really, quite a lot. And I think that's an ill service to the country in a moment like this when you want to make clear that the extreme sanctions that have been taken against Russia and against the Russian people are ones that can go away, that they don't have to be permanent, they don't have to lead to us cutting off our relations to a much greater degree, and that they are not tied to regime change, they are tied to negotiating a peace in terms of Ukraine. And that's something that I think it's important for the president, any president to stick to.

For Ukraine, neutrality would mean dropping its long held ambitions to join NATO, making it a buffer state between Russia and the western military alliance. Zelenskyy attached strict conditions for these possible concessions. Russian troops would have to withdraw to pre February 24th positions, and any peace deal would be put to the Ukrainian people in a referendum which could take up to a year to organize. While Ukraine's neutrality is a key demand for Moscow, Zelenskyy refused to give ground in other areas such as demilitarization of the country.

Finland is, some other countries are neutral. But the notion that we are going to continue your civilians, target civilians, and continue to try to assassinate you unless you agree to something, that is textbook coercion.

This is a White House with enormous problems here at home. They have enormous domestic challenges. They have enormous challenges around the world. And the fact that they want to pursue this in this moment, I think, is really shaking things up as it relates to our relationship with the Israelis. It seems again to me to be very unwise. Yet, this is a group of people who under the Obama administration were dedicated to this deal. It was part of their major priorities. It was a priority as a candidate, again, this time around, and they seem dedicated to trying to make it happen even if it unwise.",

And I think everybody, where we see some of our Arab counterparts like Egypt, Morocco, Bahrain, certainly Israel in the Middle East, or even Democrats and Republicans in our own nation's capital have a concern that this will be a watered-down version of what happened in 2015, and that's just not going to be strong enough to appease everyone. Another elephant in the room is who stands to gain from this? And certainly not just Russians at the table but Vladimir Putin could make billions of dollars because Russia could help Iran build not one but two nuclear facilities under a new deal. This is not the time for this. The White House certainly has, I don't want to say bit off more than it can chew, but there is enough on its plate. Not that they or any administration can't walk and chew gum at the same time, this is not the time for this deal. And there are other issues. We saw with this summit, we still saw people saying, isn't somebody missing from the table? And we saw the Arab allies there still talking about a sovereign state for the Palestinian people to the Israelis, and we also know that in Yemen, we have the Saudis that are involved in that, and we also have on the other side Iranians that are involved in that at least with weaponry.",

Of greater concern it CBP officials, the agency has been holding more than 15,000 migrants per day at border stations and tent facilities exceeding capacity limits.

      "utterance": "Ben? BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I do think that it was a mistake. I think it was part of a series of mistakes, including the president's comments about the 82nd Airborne which he tried to do some cleanup for today. His comment about the use of chemical weapons leading to a response in kind. This is, to Trey's point, someone who has spent his career in the Senate and in other roles, spouting off, really, quite a lot. And I think that's an ill service to the country in a moment like this when you want to make clear that the extreme sanctions that have been taken against Russia and against the Russian people are ones that can go away, that they don't have to be permanent, they don't have to lead to us cutting off our relations to a much greater degree, and that they are not tied to regime change, they are tied to negotiating a peace in terms of Ukraine. And that's something that I think it's important for the president, any president to stick to. And the amount of time that the White House spends running around cleaning up for the mistakes that he has made or the gaffes that he says is time that they are not spending working on actually solving this problem, and I think that that's an error."

      "utterance": "Trey, speaking of the negotiations, there is some hope, some indication that President Zelenskyy is getting ready for this negotiation with Russia and that possibly they're going to have some success. \"POLITICO\" writes \"Ukraine ready to discuss neutral status to reach Russian peace deal. For Ukraine, neutrality would mean dropping its long held ambitions to join NATO, making it a buffer state between Russia and the western military alliance. Zelenskyy attached strict conditions for these possible concessions. Russian troops would have to withdraw to pre February 24th positions, and any peace deal would be put to the Ukrainian people in a referendum which could take up to a year to organize. While Ukraine's neutrality is a key demand for Moscow, Zelenskyy refused to give ground in other areas such as demilitarization of the country. Trey, the hope that there is negotiation, that is what everybody is hoping for, an offramp, but is that realistic with what we have seen from Putin so far?"

      "utterance": "My heart goes out to President Zelenskyy. Can you imagine trying to negotiate while your own life is at risk, civilians are being killed, your population is being displaced? Talk about negotiating under duress and coercion. Ukraine is either sovereign or they're not. And if they are sovereign and they want to be neutral, that's fine. Finland is, some other countries are neutral. But the notion that we are going to continue your civilians, target civilians, and continue to try to assassinate you unless you agree to something, that is textbook coercion. Would I say it to get them out of my country? Probably. But I wouldn't mean it and I wouldn't own up to it."

But for the Israelis they are focused on Iran. Here is \"The Jerusalem Post,\" \"With the Iran deal delayed, will Ayatollahs weaponize their uranium? If Tehran took this step it would force Israel to make new unprecedented kind of choice. Would Jerusalem finally order a high stakes preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities to prevent the ayatollahs from having the possibility of fielding a functional nuclear weapon?\" We're back with the panel. Ben, this negotiation continues, even with the Russians at the table, as we talked about last week. Where do you think we are on all of this?"

    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "Where we are is that this White House doesn't seem to have a limit on the number of problems they want to try to tackle at once. I just can't -- I can't see the point in pursuing this at this juncture just given the level of discomfort having those Russians at the table as they are, obviously, compelled to be. This is a White House with enormous problems here at home. They have enormous domestic challenges. They have enormous challenges around the world. And the fact that they want to pursue this in this moment, I think, is really shaking things up as it relates to our relationship with the Israelis. It seems again to me to be very unwise. Yet, this is a group of people who under the Obama administration were dedicated to this deal. It was part of their major priorities. It was a priority as a candidate, again, this time around, and they seem dedicated to trying to make it happen even if it unwise."

I said it before, this is not the time for this. There are some elephants in the room with this deal. And I think everybody, where we see some of our Arab counterparts like Egypt, Morocco, Bahrain, certainly Israel in the Middle East, or even Democrats and Republicans in our own nation's capital have a concern that this will be a watered-down version of what happened in 2015, and that's just not going to be strong enough to appease everyone. Another elephant in the room is who stands to gain from this? And certainly not just Russians at the table but Vladimir Putin could make billions of dollars because Russia could help Iran build not one but two nuclear facilities under a new deal. This is not the time for this. The White House certainly has, I don't want to say bit off more than it can chew, but there is enough on its plate. Not that they or any administration can't walk and chew gum at the same time, this is not the time for this deal. And there are other issues. We saw with this summit, we still saw people saying, isn't somebody missing from the table? And we saw the Arab allies there still talking about a sovereign state for the Palestinian people to the Israelis, and we also know that in Yemen, we have the Saudis that are involved in that, and we also have on the other side Iranians that are involved in that at least with weaponry."

      "utterance": "Another thing at the table is the U.S. border and the problems there. \"The Washington Post\" writes it this way, \"President Biden faces an influx of migrants at the border amid calls to lift limits that aided expulsions. Authorities are on pace to make more than 200,000 detentions along the Mexican border in March, the highest monthly total since August. Of greater concern it CBP officials, the agency has been holding more than 15,000 migrants per day at border stations and tent facilities exceeding capacity limits. Last month CBP averaged fewer than 7,500 in custody per day records show.\" And now there are changes potentially because of COVID rules, Trey. And this could be a surge. It's been kind of on the backburner because of Ukraine, but Bill Melugin is heading down to the border again, and we expect that this is going to be a big story coming weeks."

I have talked to I think will be the house incoming house judiciary chairman today, and he listed the border as the number one issue is he going to tackle if he gets the gavel come next January. So it's chaotic. It's disastrous. It's unnecessary, and it's going to be a political liability come November. It's just a question of how much damage is done between now and then."
