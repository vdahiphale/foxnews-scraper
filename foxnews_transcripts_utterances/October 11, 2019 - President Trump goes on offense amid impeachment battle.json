I won't even want to repeat what he just said. I mean, that -- you know, he has his lips -- I mean, it's just unbelievable. It's not -- you know, at some point with Trump, you say, oh, Trump is so entertaining, you know, Trump is going to be funny, or it's like a schoolyard kid. But in that moment -- all right, and the second point, Jesse, I think it's pretty clear from that attack last night that there's only one Democrat that he is concerned with and that's Joe Biden. He doesn't attack Elizabeth Warren who's been doing well in the polls. He doesn't attack Bernie Sanders who does well in the polls.

And, of course, this week we also had Rudy Giuliani's pals going to Ukraine, or being paid by Giuliani or somebody to try to influence American politics to get that ambassador thrown out who testified today.

How hilarious is it that the revolutionary is a Republican talk show host, right? Their impeachment is going to turn Trump into a revolutionary to a lot of people in a positive way that will create a movement.

Democrats on the other hand have had a very hard time finding their own platform, so there's Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. They have a difficult time defending their positions which is why Elizabeth Warren has changed her so many times. And so when it comes to getting on the campaign trail with one person, of course, Trump is going after Joe Biden because he still is the front runner. He wants to knock him out to get to Elizabeth Warren because the country sees her as too far left. And so, the energy that he has in a place like Minnesota, which is generally a blue state with 20,000 plus people waiting in line is going to be very difficult for Democrats to compete with in states that don't want to be defending without the amount of cash on hand as the Trump campaign has. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Why did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter? And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama's ass. The Biden's got rich and that is substantiated, while America got robbed. That's what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends sold out America."

      "utterance": "I mean, to say -- so heartbroken for America that that's the president. That's the way he talks. And that's the way he talks about people who are his political rivals. I mean, not only -- I mean, we could do the journalistic thing and say so much of this is Trump's unsubstantiated charges and, you know, he just wants to throw dirt at somebody. But it's just heartbreaking that that's the President of the United States in front of our kids talking about the former vice president, whether you like him or not. I won't even want to repeat what he just said. I mean, that -- you know, he has his lips -- I mean, it's just unbelievable. It's not -- you know, at some point with Trump, you say, oh, Trump is so entertaining, you know, Trump is going to be funny, or it's like a schoolyard kid. But in that moment -- all right, and the second point, Jesse, I think it's pretty clear from that attack last night that there's only one Democrat that he is concerned with and that's Joe Biden. He doesn't attack Elizabeth Warren who's been doing well in the polls. He doesn't attack Bernie Sanders who does well in the polls. Both have done better than Biden in terms of fund- raising over the last quarter. But his actions and his words, everything from Ukraine, and those unsubstantiated theories to this, show that he is really worried about Joe Biden. And this week in the Fox poll -- with other polls as well, show Biden beating him handily. And, of course, this week we also had Rudy Giuliani's pals going to Ukraine, or being paid by Giuliani or somebody to try to influence American politics to get that ambassador thrown out who testified today. But, again, they were going after dirt on Joe Biden when Joe Biden and his son have been found to be guilty of zero."

    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, HOST",
      "utterance": "Big surprise, I don't feel the same way Juan does. I find it interesting when people are shocked by Donald Trump. It's three years, OK? That's a Trump rally. You've got to get over it. I mean, you're like the guy that opens up the fridge, knows that the milk is sour and you still sniff it, and -- oh, my God, the milk is sour. That's Trump is. He -- and by the way, you act like this is -- like, this is somehow new in general. This is how the left -- how Democrats have talked about people, privately, have demeaned us, how academia, entertainment have talked about America. This guy is just taking what's inside and taking it outside. So -- somebody smarter than me, you know, they look at this and they go, oh, my God. You know, the new line is, this isn't normal. Well, you're right. It isn't normal. That's why he won because that's not the typical politician. You can hate him. You can hate him every single day. It's not going to change. And by the way, you've got to look at the energy of that rally and you got to wonder if the Democrats are really thinking straight about this impeachment, because what the left always wanted, they always wanted a revolutionary. Their American version of Fidel, their American version of Che, they always wanted that. Weird way they thought Obama would be that. How hilarious is it that the revolutionary is a Republican talk show host, right? Their impeachment is going to turn Trump into a revolutionary to a lot of people in a positive way that will create a movement. So they've got to understand that this is actually going to help Trump when you see the energy that he has, and then you compare it to Biden at the town hall on CNN. Here you have Trump talking clearly, saying exactly what he's thinking, and you see Biden sounding like he's reading from a Reader's Digest magazine five years ago that he found on the train."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Maybe a little bit. And Lisa Page, actually, ended up testifying against Peter Strzok, and kind of blowing up his story that he told Congress under oath. But in terms of the president and his demeanor and his attitude, one thing he has on Democrats is that he's completely secure with who he is. He doesn't care what he says. Democrats on the other hand have had a very hard time finding their own platform, so there's Joe Biden or Kamala Harris. They have a difficult time defending their positions which is why Elizabeth Warren has changed her so many times. And so when it comes to getting on the campaign trail with one person, of course, Trump is going after Joe Biden because he still is the front runner. He wants to knock him out to get to Elizabeth Warren because the country sees her as too far left. And so, the energy that he has in a place like Minnesota, which is generally a blue state with 20,000 plus people waiting in line is going to be very difficult for Democrats to compete with in states that don't want to be defending without the amount of cash on hand as the Trump campaign has."

You can question whether they were peddling influence and whether that was inappropriate. And I think that's actually a pretty strong argument. And the Biden's are actually complaining that the DNC isn't defending them enough. The DNC is like you -- us? Like, you've got to be able to defend yourselves. And they know that this is coming from a long time, and they aren't able to get off their back foot. However, even with all of this in the last three weeks, Biden is still doing pretty well across the boards. So he has staying power.

But if you take Bernie Sanders out of the polling and you add his far-left voters to Elizabeth Warren, they're not all going to vote for her, but it's actually leapfrogged over Joe Biden's numbers. And you have to question why the Biden campaign continues to say we don't have to win Iowa. We don't have to win New Hampshire. Maybe we're not going to try in those states. And there's this question too, if Joe Biden keep lashing out at the media, well, where's the double standard on that? You know, Trump says stuff about the media and he's accused of all these things, but Joe Biden sending mean letters to the New York Times and telling them to back off on asking questions about his family, and maybe questions about the campaign --"

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "True. However, I do think that this White House's strategy of delay, and especially this week by saying this is an illegitimate inquiry, if you look back at the historical record, let's just take the Nixon one for example, you had a unified impeachment staff. So it wasn't Republicans and Democrats separately then coming together. They hire their own staff and it was a mix of Republicans and Democrats. Nixon's lawyer got to sit in. They got to subpoena. They got to interview. I think, as a process point for the White House, that is really good. The one thing about all this impeachment talk is that it is basically giving cover to the DNC on its debate process, the funding woes that they have. There's a lot of more stories going on that are problems with the Democrats than Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff's issues with the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Katie, I was thinking, as Dana was speaking, that I think a lot of times in previous episodes of impeachment, the reason they have the vote to start the inquiry was to gain subpoena power. The rules have been subsequently changed so that they don't need it. But, it could be that you say, and I think that this came from Beto O'Rourke this week, just take away the president's talking point, have the vote, because the votes are there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I mean, if they have the votes they should take the votes and, you know, put their money where their mouth is, and actually do a real impeachment process and issue real subpoenas and get witnesses under oath about what they feel like --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yeah, because they're already on record verbally, so taking a vote shouldn't be hard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Well -- and what Democrats don't want to do is open up an official impeachment inquiry because then it gives Republicans some power to do their own digging, and gives them more power than they have now as the minorities on these committees, and it forces Democrats to, actually, to have to work more with Republicans who have been asking questions about Adam Schiff's relationship with this whistleblower who heard the phone call from the White House, for example. So when it comes to the politics of this, look, Democrats are using impeachment as a political tool against the president in an election year. It gives cover to Democrats on the campaign trail who don't seem to get it together when it comes to their platform. And in the end, it comes down to credibility issue between Donald Trump and Adam Schiff. And given Adam Schiff's record with the Russian investigation, and now the questions about his handling of this complaint, people are going to look twice at whether they should believe what he's saying."

That's what this is -- that's what this process is. The Democrats are just hoping that this will just drive Trump crazy enough to say, I've had it. I'm out of here. I'm too good for you, OK? I'm too good. Look at all the great stuff I got you, right? Lowest unemployment for minorities and women in history. I've got you prison reform. I'm making peace with North Korea.

He didn't have the sources. He didn't have people named or willing to go on the record. Seven weeks later is it that the New Yorker publishes the story.

This guy, up and armor, or I think his name is -- what is he, the president or vice president? Now has writings from when he was at Harvard. They were a little too -- I guess maybe misogynistic the people were pointing to, and there's a little bit of a brushfire growing among the staff at NBC, which they obviously have to contain because of those things can get out of control. But, you know, when you talk about all these old MDA's, or these old incidents that get reported to human resources, when these things happen in companies they handled them the best they can, and it's not always a thermonuclear war. Sometimes it's a smaller incident. And they try to do what's best for everybody involved. And maybe it's not handled perfectly, but I think they do the best job.

Reagan, my daughter is having her birthday on Monday, so I thought I'd give her a shout out tell her how much I love her and call attention to her work as a board member of the National Parks trust. Here are some pictures of Ray Ray and her husband Patrick in Bald Mountain Pond in Maine. It's part of the Appalachian Trail. The Trust recently bought this virgin land from a timber company and they donated it to the National Park Service, all part of an effort to protect America's natural beauty. Since 83, they've had - acquisitions giving the National Park Service 30,000 acres in 31 states. I'm so proud to see my beautiful daughter who works as a lawyer in touch with America, the Beautiful."

The Billy goat, he was found taking a nap in the Knightley (ph) family's bathroom after ramming his way in earlier in the day. The security camera caught the goat making its way into their home after having escaped a week prior from a local farm that was several miles away, two county deputies tried to bait the goat from the bathroom using carrots, a dog bone and grass. They finally got a Mountain Cat. Jennifer Knightley (ph) told the local paper, my house definitely smells like a goat farm but there's nothing you can do but laugh."
