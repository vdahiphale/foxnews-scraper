The judge went on to say, when it comes to modern libel laws, there are many defenses, even in the case of defamatory statements. Remember, Nick Sandmann was widely vilified after cell phone video clip showed him staring down Native American Nathan Phillips. But the full video clearly shows that Sandmann and his Covington High School classmates were not the instigators. But Judge Bertelsman says, it appears Nathan Phillips felt he was being blocked by the students and his opinion, the judge rolled, \"he -- meaning Mr. Phillips, pass those conclusions onto the Post. They have been erroneous, but as discussed above, they are an option protected by the First Amendment and the post is not liable for publishing those opinions.\" Nick Sandmann's father release this statement about the dismissal. Quoting, \"If what was done to Nicholas is not legally actionable, then no one is safe.\" Sandmann's lawyers also wrote, quote, \"The law must protect innocent minors targeted by journalists publishing click-bait sensationalized news.\" The attorneys are also planning to appeal the decision, lawsuits against CNN and NBC are still pending, Martha.",

And if anybody deserves the death penalty, it seems that obviously there is very good reason that they are on the list. I want to put up on the screen some other people who are on death row. Some of these names I think people will recognize. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for his role in the 2015 Boston marathon bombing, white supremacist Dylann Roof, 2017 in the Charleston Church shooting he killed nine people, and Gary Lee Samson who was sentenced to death the second time in 2017 for carjacking murderers. But you know, there is an issue that, you know, for some time, Dana, this was not on the table, we weren't doing federal executions in this country. A lot of Americans are against it. Pope Francis has said that he'd like to see, you know, a global end to the death penalty, that he thinks that it's an inhumane. And it goes back to the question of whether or not is it -- you know, do people human beings have the right to take life, whether it's before birth or at any point during life or is that decision just left up to God?",

He said, you know, he believes that there is some other existence outside of the report that requires them to keep digging here. You wrote the case against impeaching President Trump.

Maybe he'll throw some hooks in the water and hope maybe he'll come up with something that's not the way investigations are supposed to be conducted. Either prosecutorial investigations or congressional investigations. You know, on Fox the other night, the night before the hearing, I was asked by Laura whether I thought this would be a Hail Mary pass by the Democrats, and I said, \"No, I thought it would be an intercepted pass that the Republicans would use to their advantage.\" And it would hurt the Democrats and as a Democrat myself, it was painful for me to see how the Democrats are shooting themselves in the foot, they're hurting themselves. Americans don't want to see this path to an impeachment. They want to see the Democrats work together with the Republicans and try to achieve something to make the lives of Americans better every day, not to go down the line to satisfy 100 radicals or led by four radicals leading toward something that will never be impeachment."

In other words, we need Don McGahn to sit there. So, they're going to go back down the road, they're going to try to subpoena him."

I've been right, 100 percent of the time, not because I'm any smarter, but because I don't engage in wishful thinking. I do analysis. I try to understand the Constitution and the law. And I apply it equally no matter who is the subject. You know, the original title of my book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump, was The Case Against Impeaching Hillary Clinton. We even have a cover that shows it, because when I thought and we all thought Hillary Clinton to be elected, and people were saying, lock her up, lock her up, I was writing a book on why Hillary Clinton shouldn't be impeached. So, I try to make it down the middle. I'm not ideological when it comes to my analysis of the law, that's why I've been right more than CNN and more than CNBC. And that's why I continue to be right, I'm not bragging about this, I'm only making a point that it's important to analyze this from an objective point of view."

That's what he's -- that's what he says."

      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, that's exactly what the framers of the Constitution rejected. There was a debate about that, and they said, no wrongdoing, mal-administration isn't the criteria. It needs to be treason, bribery, other high crimes, and misdemeanors. And unless they have a basis for believing one of those categories has been satisfied, you don't engage in a fishing expedition, you don't use the resources of the United States government to search for some possibility that maybe you can find something that will lead to an impeachment. That's just the wrong way to go. And if the Republicans are doing this to the Democrats, you know, Nadler would be the first one to be yelling, this is a violation of the power of Congress and that shouldn't be done. We need to have the same rule for everybody. What I call the shoe on the other foot test. If it's good for the Democrats, it's good for the Republicans, and vice versa."

      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Listen, I don't think this is a question about. This is not a political question, this is a question of mathematics. As whether or not you have the entire Democratic caucus in the House that say they want to impeach the president. The problem that you have here is this. In the United States Senate, where an impeachment inquiry would actually taking place or where the trial would take place, you need 67 senators to vote to impeach. And right now, I don't think we're anywhere near 67. I think we're probably somewhere in the low -- high 30s or low 40s."

If you're saying I think that all of these horrible things happened and the Mueller reports somehow just couldn't find them, then isn't it incumbent upon you if you really believe that, and we hear that every day from so many of -- so many Democrats, then isn't it incumbent upon them to keep going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, here's the thing. I think the House of Representatives have the goal of oversight, they have the goal to ensure that the administration does it -- doesn't it needs to do. And so, they -- yes, if they want to investigate this president, if they want to have hearings about wrongdoing, they should. If they want to look into whether or not this president obstructed justice, which is the volume two of the Mueller report points to that, then they can do that. But the mathematics doesn't seem to be on their side, and I think that's where the Speaker is."

The person who matters is the attorney general, who said it's not chargeable, I happen to agree as well. But Martha, the whole notion here, the Democrats maintaining this very strange obsession, it's like they can't give this up, they can't give up the ghost, they can't let it go, they're so invested in this that they're going to keep digging, and digging, and digging into something that in the minds of most Americans has been resolved. And if they truly believe as Nadler has said and many of these Democrats have said over and over again that the president committed crimes, they said they already have that evidence, they say it's right in front of us in plain sight."

So, at this point, you either have to say, you know what? OK, we fought to have this investigation, we fought to have Robert Mueller run this investigation. We let him hire whoever he wanted to hire, right? If anybody was going to find him guilty of things, given the resumes of these people, they would have found it. So, what -- Is there -- have we lost the ability in the United States of America for someone to come forward and say, \"OK, you know what, it's done.

Mueller got knocked out marginally because there's no case. I mean, there's a lot of attacks on Bob and he wasn't smart and he didn't pay attention, maybe -- it may be true. But there's a real problem. You can only go so far in creating a phony case and Bob ultimately does have integrity. He was asleep at the switch, the inmates took over the asylum like Weissmann and did all kinds of horrible things trampling on people's rights which is the uncharacteristic of Bob Mueller, by the way, which always made me wonder is he in charge of this thing. And the reality is that the Democrats are now making total clowns out of themselves. It's not about patriotism, it's about do you have any sense of decency. I mean, this is over. They couldn't -- they couldn't find collusion. They couldn't find obstruction in any sensible way. I mean, he didn't obstruct anything. There was no underlying crime. There isn't a seasoned prosecutor in the country that would bring a case like that except laugh at it. So now they're trying to do -- we must have done something wrong or it wasn't presented correctly or if Andrew Weissmann couldn't get three people to lie about Donald Trump, one of them that he put in solitary confinement and I would say came pretty close to torturing, Manafort, put the guy in solitary confinement bring him back nine times, tell him what to say, if he says it he gets out of solitary confinement. That's what we call suborning perjury. If he couldn't do it, believe me, these two guys who are trying -- Nadler and Schiff who were not operating really with the same mental power as Weissmann. Weissmann is much brighter than they are and much more than malicious in some ways. If he couldn't do it, they're not going to do it."

The judge went on to say, when it comes to modern libel laws, there are many defenses, even in the case of defamatory statements. Remember, Nick Sandmann was widely vilified after cell phone video clip showed him staring down Native American Nathan Phillips. But the full video clearly shows that Sandmann and his Covington High School classmates were not the instigators. But Judge Bertelsman says, it appears Nathan Phillips felt he was being blocked by the students and his opinion, the judge rolled, \"he -- meaning Mr. Phillips, pass those conclusions onto the Post. They have been erroneous, but as discussed above, they are an option protected by the First Amendment and the post is not liable for publishing those opinions.\" Nick Sandmann's father release this statement about the dismissal. Quoting, \"If what was done to Nicholas is not legally actionable, then no one is safe.\" Sandmann's lawyers also wrote, quote, \"The law must protect innocent minors targeted by journalists publishing click-bait sensationalized news.\" The attorneys are also planning to appeal the decision, lawsuits against CNN and NBC are still pending, Martha."

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 3.7 million jobs would be lost if the federal minimum wage went up $15, let alone $20 an hour. Not to mention prices go up. It's the consumer that ends up having to pay more and then it's the middle class and lower-class workers, entry-level positions that get cut when you raise the minimum wage and it's a burden on the middle class and the middle -- lower middle-class workers."

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for his role in the 2015 Boston marathon bombing, white supremacist Dylann Roof, 2017 in the Charleston Church shooting he killed nine people, and Gary Lee Samson who was sentenced to death the second time in 2017 for carjacking murderers.

Pope Francis has said that he'd like to see, you know, a global end to the death penalty, that he thinks that it's an inhumane.

In favor of abortion and against the death penalty is odd to be because you're condemning one life to death for doing nothing but simply existing, and yet, you are wanting to exonerate another life.

She really in that piece used hearsay, something somebody remembered someone telling them as evidence in the Judge Kavanaugh piece, but now she wrote a lengthy piece in the New Yorker about Al Franken, saying that he had railroaded in the main woman accusing him was not credible. Now the ladies at The View were talking about this collision course between people's politics and Me Too. Watch."

So, you know, that becomes the issue when suddenly Jane Mayer is defending Al Franken after she thrashed Brett Kavanaugh on the thinnest thread of someone telling her something that they remembered happening in the dorm although they weren't there, it just raises the question of whether or not, you know, sort of cheering for one team and not another and not applying the same standard across the board."

I think that she is telling the truth about what happened. I think there are a lot of people who do believe her and might have either decided he should still be confirmed saying it happened when you're 15 years old. It doesn't matter anymore. Or we are past the statute of limitations."

      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "I just wanted to draw the distinction that that is -- that is the Brett Kavanaugh accuser that I believe in this. And I think Jane Mayer did get herself into a tricky situation. Kirsten Gillibrand actually came to work where I work at Bustle and spoke to us this week the day THE STORY came out and she defended her decision to push for Al Franken to resign. Where she said, you can talk about Leeann Tweeden (Ph) and I think that's a bit of a tenuous story. But she said there were seven or eight, I think it was other women who would also say that Al Franken had made them uncomfortable or touch them inappropriately. And you have to take the entire body of work there. So, you can't be partisan and you do have to take the totality of the story."

      "speaker": "LISA BOOTHE, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think either of the three accusers of Brett Kavanaugh are credible for my opinion, considering the fact they have zero corroborating evidence and even the witnesses that Christine Ford named said that contradicted what she said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLEY SHIMKUS, REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Well, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "And even one said that she had felt forced by Christine Ford and her friends to change her story. But regarding Jane Mayer, she had tweeted out and saying that almost nothing his main accuser, talking about Al Franken, said checks out. Well, guess what. Neither did her story about Deborah Ramirez, the New York Times who said that they try to pursue the story, interviewed several dozen people and couldn't find anyone to establish this event had happened. That's basically the same story for all three women. NNC has sat on information that would have been beneficial to Brett Kavanaugh and said sat on it until after he was confirmed. So, if anything, if you look at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh, it was an orchestrated smear by the media and that's exactly what the New Yorker piece was for Brett Kavanaugh. It was a smear, and the article about Al Franken is a defense of him."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Yes. And the Franken situation is an example of the frenzy that took place in the immediate aftermath of the Me Too movement where due process completely went out the window. And Democrats put pressure on Franken to resign not because of their moral compass but because it worked for them politically. They came out as a party that says we are going to believe all the women and they couldn't say that with Franken still in office. So, I know that a lot of people have issues with this Mayer piece, but I'm glad that I know that Democrats now feel bad about what they did to Franken because he didn't have a chance to defend himself."
