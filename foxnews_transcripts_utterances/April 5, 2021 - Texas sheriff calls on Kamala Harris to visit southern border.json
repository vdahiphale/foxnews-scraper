You can see just minutes away from first pitch, and a ton of fans still waiting to get into this brand-new Globe Life Field.

You have got the Super Bowl. That only had about 25,000 people in it.

President Joe Biden says that this is a mistake, having 100 percent capacity here, that it's not responsible. But the Rangers fired back, saying that they can do this and they can do it safely. They have rules in place, like mask requirements unless you're eating or drinking. You have got to keep social distance at concession lines. And this is a retractable roof, so, essentially, fans who are watching are enjoying the game outside.

They took a 70 percent hit in revenue during 2020, the COVID year, by virtue of essentially having no fans in the stands for the course of the season. They were uniquely impacted in that regard.

It's largely felt inconsistent and subjective. So, for many Texas Rangers fans, this is a breath of fresh air. On March 1, the seven-day average in Texas was 7,693. On April 1, it was a 53 percent drop. March 10 was when Governor Abbott issued that mandate. So, in the context -- I mention all these numbers for a reason -- in the context of science, much like the back of a baseball card, where you studied the statistics, it actually makes sense, at least based on how the trend line is going, that Texas would try and implement this. It's an outdoor stadium. They're going to be wearing masks, but for eating and drinking, and that gentleman had the sound bite about the hot dog. I was certainly jealous of that guy.

And sports has always provided that for us as an American populace. So, obviously, we're hoping for the best, but I have to believe that the Rangers and other teams across the league are prepared for the worst, in the event that this tends to go sideways on them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The NBA pulled All-Star Game from North Carolina, obviously, now, the MLB All-Star Game, the 2021. But your question really hedges on, where is this going, right? In a couple of days, we start the Masters in earnest, Thursday, right, with Sunday being the most -- typically, the most viewed day.

Scott, that is not a good economic prescription for us. Spell it out.",

So, to say that raising taxes, as Biden is proposing, on corporations is going to have no economic consequences is just plain false, and especially as we see other countries such as France, which is lowering their corporate tax rate to 25 percent -- they don't have a state level rate. Sweden is cutting their corporate tax rate to 20 percent. Other countries are trying to be more competitive and attract jobs, wages and investment to their countries through lower corporate taxes. And, meanwhile, we're talking about going the other direction. And, as you say, if you combine the federal rate of 28 percent, which he's proposing, with the average of the state rates, we're looking at having the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world again.",

And in this particular stadium in Arlington, Texas, they can fill it to capacity, 40,000-plus strong. And, apparently, they already have, the game but minutes away. What's at stake at a time when the economy is coming back, in fact, soaring back, and has a lot of people at the corner of Wall and Broad and elsewhere saying, you know what, it's a good time to go post-pandemic. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is YOUR WORLD. First to the developments right now in Texas, because they are going to be playing sans the governor of Texas, who has opted not to throw out the first pitch here. We're going to get into details of that in just a second. But, in the meantime, to Grady Trimble on play ball -- Grady."

      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. They say they do things bigger in Texas. And that is certainly the case about opening day today. You can see just minutes away from first pitch, and a ton of fans still waiting to get into this brand-new Globe Life Field. And if this is a sellout or anywhere close to it, 40,000 fans would be the largest sporting events since the pandemic started. For perspective, let me show you some other crowds at major sporting events since the pandemic began. You have got the Super Bowl. That only had about 25,000 people in it. It's also going to be a bigger event than the World Series, which was hosted here, the Daytona 500, and the NCAA final, which takes place tonight for basketball. It's also drawn a lot of criticism from as high up as the president himself. President Joe Biden says that this is a mistake, having 100 percent capacity here, that it's not responsible. But the Rangers fired back, saying that they can do this and they can do it safely. They have rules in place, like mask requirements unless you're eating or drinking. You have got to keep social distance at concession lines. And this is a retractable roof, so, essentially, fans who are watching are enjoying the game outside. And the fans that we talk to say they are just excited baseball is back."

      "utterance": "Governor Greg Abbott was expected to throw out the first pitch today, but just a few hours before the game, he said he declined to do that, sending a letter to the Rangers telling them that he was not going to do that because of the MLB's decision to pull the All-Star Game out of Georgia over the election law that recently passed there."

But he was going to be joined by front-line workers. So, presumably, one of them will step up to the mound instead. I talked to fans about that issue as well. And they didn't seem too bothered by it, Neil. They're happy to pack a stadium right now. And, as we said, baseball is back, and they're happy to witness it -- Neil."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I can definitely see that. Grady, it's good to see you, Grady Trimble in Arlington, Texas, the start there of the baseball season, their home opener. Doug Eldridge is back with us, the sports agent extraordinaire, DLE Agency founder. Doug, I do want to get into the governor's tit-for-tat with Major League Baseball itself, but the fact that baseball is back and games resumed over the weekend, and, of course, in this particular case, to a packed stadium - - they are 100 percent capacity -- they're OK with that -- baseball badly needs the fans back, doesn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOUG ELDRIDGE, DLE AGENCY",
      "utterance": "Yes, sir. Baseball -- of the major four sports in the United States, football, baseball, basketball, and hockey, none is as dependent on fans in the stadium as baseball. It's certainly America's pastime, traditionally the oldest sport in our country. And, in so many ways, those traditions and old-world ways of enjoying sports really persisted with baseball. They took a 70 percent hit in revenue during 2020, the COVID year, by virtue of essentially having no fans in the stands for the course of the season. They were uniquely impacted in that regard. So, I think, for the Rangers and hopefully for other teams across the league, this is going to be the first in a positive string of dominoes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "By the way, we're learning that the first pitch at the Rangers game is going to be a teacher named Audrey Simmons. So, a teacher gets to throw out the first pitch. So I guess she beat you to it, Doug."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Let me get your sense of, it's always a reminder this virus is still with us, right? Nationals games were delayed because of a virus within the team. And this spreads. This cancels other games as well. Where do you see this season going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELDRIDGE",
      "utterance": "Well, that's a great question, because, when we saw the start of last season, it was largely defined by fits and starts, which is to say there was an outbreak here, which has that butterfly effect, which spread across the division, eventually the league. But you referenced -- Neil, to go back for a second, when we look at the bigger picture of how the season is going to go to President Biden's interview -- he sat down with Sage Steele, who's fantastic, on ESPN and was talking about why he doesn't think that the Rangers should open at full capacity, and that you should -- I believe it sound bite was, listen to Fauci and the scientists. The problem for a lot of sports fans, which in this case is a synonym for voters, is that the science hasn't been calling balls and strikes, which, pun aside, is meant to say call it objectively and consistently. It's largely felt inconsistent and subjective. So, for many Texas Rangers fans, this is a breath of fresh air. On March 1, the seven-day average in Texas was 7,693. On April 1, it was a 53 percent drop. March 10 was when Governor Abbott issued that mandate. So, in the context -- I mention all these numbers for a reason -- in the context of science, much like the back of a baseball card, where you studied the statistics, it actually makes sense, at least based on how the trend line is going, that Texas would try and implement this. It's an outdoor stadium. They're going to be wearing masks, but for eating and drinking, and that gentleman had the sound bite about the hot dog. I was certainly jealous of that guy. Maybe you were too. But we're all hungry, no pun intended, for this sense of normalcy. And sports has always provided that for us as an American populace. So, obviously, we're hoping for the best, but I have to believe that the Rangers and other teams across the league are prepared for the worst, in the event that this tends to go sideways on them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Then we have got this controversy, Doug, the Georgia new voting law that's already prompted Major League Baseball to move the All-Star Game from there. And I'm wondering now, with Governor Abbott refusing to throw out the first pitch, as he was originally scheduled to do, and now a number of groups forming to boycott Major League Baseball for its boycott of Georgia, where is this whole going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELDRIDGE",
      "utterance": "And that's a great question, sir, because I don't think this is a unique one-off in terms of how this is being treated. Sure, you could go back to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte with the transgender bathroom bill. The NBA pulled All-Star Game from North Carolina, obviously, now, the MLB All-Star Game, the 2021. But your question really hedges on, where is this going, right? In a couple of days, we start the Masters in earnest, Thursday, right, with Sunday being the most -- typically, the most viewed day. There's already a #boycottTheMasters campaign being put into place to try and essentially move The Masters, right, uproot them from Augusta National in the state of Georgia itself and move them elsewhere, right? We're already starting to see a growing trend and national sentiment towards possibly boycotting the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics because of China's record on human rights. So, this is really not a one-off. But I think what affects so many American fans is that they don't want the inconsistent application of equality, meaning, if we're going to protest the goose, let's protest the gander. And I think that's where you see Americans pushing back and saying, heck, yes, I'm going to go to the game. I will wear my mask as I'm required. I will stand for the anthem. I will thank my ushers. I will pay my tab when I leave the parking lot. I might get a Coca-Cola and a hot dog and a pendant for my boy. I think Americans are hungry, literally and figuratively, for a return of normalcy. And I believe sports is going to provide that."

Always enjoy having the good doctor with us. What do you think, Doctor? A lot of people, they're going to be crowded in there. They're going to be wearing masks, a good many of them, at least, that our reporter talked to. How safe do you think it is in there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. AMESH ADALJA, INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA",
      "utterance": "I think it's going to be hard to keep transmission to zero during a situation where there are 40,000 people present, and we know that most of those 40,000 are not going to be vaccinated. So, I do suspect that the masks are going to help. Having the outdoor air is going to help. But I think, with a couple -- with 1,000 or so cases occurring daily or more than 1,000 in Texas, it's likely that they're going to be people there that have the virus and that are going to transmit the virus. Hopefully, though, it's going to be something that can be kept to a minimum, that it's not going to overwhelm contact tracers, and that it's something that won't derail the good trend that we have seen in Texas over time with the number of cases, hospitalizations looking good. And I think this is something that you just have to be very careful when you have a mass gathering like this, because of all the chains of transmission that could get set off if something went wrong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you think what could experience what some countries in Europe are experiencing, where there are borderline lockdowns in Italy and France, and they're really cracking down on restrictions that will be extended in Britain, even though a lot of the vaccination progress, in particular in that country, is very promising? But could any of that hit here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "I don't think so. And that's because we have really done a good job when it comes to vaccinating high risk individuals, nursing home residents, and people who have conditions that live in that community, because that's what we really wanted this vaccine to do, was remove the ability of the virus to cause serious illness, hospitalization and death. And, remember, flattening the curve was about preserving hospital capacity. And hospitals, by and large, across the country are in a much better place than they were just a couple of months ago in December and January. So, I don't think that we're going to see that. And the solution that we have at hand and many countries don't is to continue to vaccinate. We're putting four million doses into people's arms every day. If we continue that pace, I think we will stay ahead of this and not have anything like what's going on in Europe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Dr. Fauci recently said he doesn't think the government will eventually be requiring these so-called vaccine passports. Where are you on this, Doctor? Because I know, in Britain, they're not even calling them that. They're just calling them proof that you have had the vaccine cards or something like that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Is it semantics? Is it important? How would you describe how people get to know that you have been vaccinated and you can enter a hotel, you could enter an event, you can get on a plane? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "I think that it's not going to be the government that does this. It's going to be private businesses that want to have higher capacity or to decrease restrictions on people who are vaccinated, because, if you're vaccinated, the virus treats you differently, so why shouldn't people treat you differently? So, I think that this is something that companies may try to do to increase capacity. International travel, I think, is a different issue. I think there are going to be countries that will want to know that you're vaccinated. And if you're not, you're going to have to go through a quarantine or going to have to have a test. But I think it's important to remember that this is also going to be something that's temporary, until we get everybody that wants to be vaccinated. I think you will start to see some of this fade away as cases come down. And I think it's not that big of a deal if a place wants to go to 100 percent capacity with just vaccinated people. We have seen sports do that in certain areas where they have a vaccinated section, where they can be a little bit laxer with everything. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think companies and businesses can set the terms of their -- of entry for their customers. And if they want to treat vaccinated people differently, I think that's OK."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that the government shouldn't stand in the way of this. So, what's going on in Florida, where Governor DeSantis by executive order is saying, you can't do this, even if you're a private business, I think that's really usurping the business owners' decision-making to say, yes, we want to have people that are vaccinated in here, and we're going to look, and you don't have to come in. You're not forced to come into the store."

When you have an urgency of your policies that outstrip your capabilities and endanger your citizens here in the United States, then that leadership has to come up. You have got to admit, sometimes, that look, in our urgency, in our haste to put something together, be a welcoming nation, that's all fine and good. But you need to have local and state and federal conversations about how you're going to do that without endangering Texans and Americans here. Those conversations haven't started.

The most basic, fundamental situation that we have in here is to take care of your border and your people. You can be as welcoming as you want. And we are a welcoming country. That's a million a year on legal immigration under, an orderly standardized process that works very, very well, as we have seen the last two years.

And one of sheriffs' concerns around the nation is the accountability. I mean, nobody knows exactly where anyone's going. The NGOs are saying that that's private information. So we don't know who's come into our counties until they show up in buses. We don't know what state is receiving who. We don't know who's actually coming into the country here, some of them with no travel documents whatsoever and a promise to appear, which ICE had to -- CBP had to stop here a number of weeks ago, simply because of the amount of people that the surge caused and the policy change.

This comes as the Biden administration started conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill about raising that corporate tax rate to pay for the American Jobs Plan. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen making that outreach, as she is addressing the opening session for the World Bank, making the opening case to raise global corporate tax rates to a minimum level.

They had an interesting study, I think it was last week, that took a look at combined rates in this country, talking what corporations are paying, not only the federal level, but what they pay in many, many states. And that combined rate, now, many countries don't have that -- there are regional taxes in some countries, not all, that go on top of those country rates, but even allowing for that, it would put the U.S. in the unenviable position of having the highest combined corporate rates on the planet. Scott, that is not a good economic prescription for us. Spell it out."

      "speaker": "SCOTT HODGE, PRESIDENT, TAX FOUNDATION",
      "utterance": "Well, not at all, Neil. In fact, economists at the OECD in Paris determined that the corporate income tax is the most harmful tax for economic growth. So, to say that raising taxes, as Biden is proposing, on corporations is going to have no economic consequences is just plain false, and especially as we see other countries such as France, which is lowering their corporate tax rate to 25 percent -- they don't have a state level rate. Sweden is cutting their corporate tax rate to 20 percent. Other countries are trying to be more competitive and attract jobs, wages and investment to their countries through lower corporate taxes. And, meanwhile, we're talking about going the other direction. And, as you say, if you combine the federal rate of 28 percent, which he's proposing, with the average of the state rates, we're looking at having the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world again."

But there are a lot of ancillary and Social Security Medicare surtaxes and the like that could lift that up still higher, even tucked into this plan to go green, a lot more green from that crowd. But what I find interesting, Scott, it won't only be from that crowd. It's going to spread wide and far. And I don't think a lot of people realize that."

      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "No. In fact, other studies have shown that the U.S. has one of the most progressive income tax systems on the individual side, that the wealthy in our country pay a higher share of the tax burden than do the wealthy in any other country. The poor in the United States have the lowest tax burden compared to the poor in other countries. And that's because we do so much through things like the Earned Income Tax Credit, the child credit and other things, in which we're essentially -- the IRS has become an extension of the welfare state, expanding a lot of benefits through the tax code that other countries simply don't do."

Their stocks have been moving up through this whole back-and-forth. Is it - - is it because they're prepared for it, and we're overstating the case, or they don't think it's ever going to come to fruition?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",

I think a lot of companies are hoping it'll settle in around 25 percent. And they think that they can live with that. The problem is that there are a lot of other tax increases in the Biden plan that would affect the tax base, which would expand and actually raise their effective tax rates beyond what that statutory rate is. So, they could get -- they could live with a 25 percent rate, but they may not be able to live with the changes that are happening -- or being proposed to the international tax rules that will dramatically increase their international tax liability."

It also says that any attempt to limit Americans from voting is wrong, so weighing in without mentioning Georgia by name. We have already seen Delta and Coca-Cola CEOs weigh in hard here in Georgia, criticizing Georgia's voting law, which they say restricts access to the ballot box. And that has drawn a lot of pushback from Republicans. Also, this story, as it gets bigger and bigger here in Georgia, we may see it spread soon beyond Georgia's boundaries, Texas now facing a similar law, it's passed the state Senate, which would limit extended early voting hours, once again, the same arguments. Republicans say this is about voting integrity. Democrats say this is about voter suppression, and, again, the big corporations weighing in, in Texas, including American Airlines, who say we oppose this bill, this bill is wrong.

      "utterance": "Well, the narrative has been -- it's been indoctrinated into our brains growing up, especially for millennials and Gen-Zers and more, that big business, they're out to get you, that they're evil, that they're corrupt, and that they are not looking out for you. Now, personally, I would still -- I would say, well, look at the opportunity they have been able to do and the good that they have been able to bring. And, sure, it might sound good in Hollywood that, oh, yes, they're all evil, but bottom line is, they're not all evil. And if we have learned anything in the past year, especially during this COVID time..."

She's the REVIV president and CEO. It's a health passport app, if you will in Las Vegas that kind of gets to the bottom of, all right, you have COVID-19 or don't you? Sarah, very, very nice you to take the time. Explain how this works."

      "speaker": "SARAH LOMAS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, REVIV",
      "utterance": "Hi. How are you? Very nice to be here today. Very simply, in fact. HELIIX is an application that will allow events to take place for individuals to arrive into the city of Las Vegas. If we imagine the show, and you want to go into that show, knowing that the people in there are either vaccinated or COVID-negative, then, as a -- REVIV is a medical company first and foremost. So, we will test the individual with rapid antigen, upload those results to HELIIX, which will then deliver the passport technology to allow entry into the event. And it's really that simple, testing and technology and bringing those two things together."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so you get that, and then you would be -- if people were leery about you entering a casino or any other property, they'd be less leery. Good for you, safe for you, and good for where you're going, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOMAS",
      "utterance": "Yes, yes, exactly. I mean, we're seeing just such a vast range here in Las Vegas -- well, all over the world, actually. But Las Vegas is fighting and fighting back hard for the opening of mass events and the opening of shows and conventions. That's why I'm here this week, so that we can really deploy HELIIX to allow those conventions to take place safely and to kind of avoid all the discussions around vaccination and discriminating against somebody that doesn't want to be vaccinated or doesn't want to share those vaccination results."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, this isn't about a vaccination. It's just whether you have COVID or not, right? So it doesn't get into that whole argument, right?"

      "speaker": "LOMAS",
      "utterance": "It can be everything that it wants to be. It's a platform. It's a platform that allows the individual first and foremost to be in control. If they want to sign a HIPAA and allow the vaccinations to be uploaded, then they can do so. If not, and they do want to attend a convention that's COVID-secure and has a geolocator for track-and-trace, then they can only enter that with a green passport. And to enable that green passport, they will have to be tested and ensure that they are COVID-negative before entering into the event, whether that is a convention, whether that is a show. Whoever wants to..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. I think it's a -- no, I think it's a great idea. And it removes a lot of these other things that the government is trying to force down your throat. We will watch it closely. Sarah Lomas is the REVIV president and CEO. I think that's something that -- for which there could be some more support, certainly more support than the vaccine passport thing. Here's \"THE FIVE.\" THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.
