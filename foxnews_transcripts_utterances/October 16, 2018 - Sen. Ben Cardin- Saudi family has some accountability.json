And the list continues. This only the faces that could fit on this screen right now. There are many more that have pulled out of this event. There are some big names that are still attending. You have the IMF, Christine Lagarde, who is going, and of course the U.S. treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who did say that the relations with Saudi Arabia are good, and that they are a good partner to the United States. However, you had Senator, Republican of Arizona, Jeff Flake commenting on this, and he tweeted out -- and I quote -- \"Secretary Mnuchin shouldn't be going to Riyadh.\" So, many people weighing in on whether people should be attending or not.  The Saudis today, according to The Financial Times, have retaliated against one company that has decided not to go. And that is company operated by Richard Branson. Richard Branson runs the Hyperloop company. This is Virgin Hyperloop One.  They have said -- the Saudi Arabians have said that they are pulling the deal right now. It's on hold. They were originally going to invest about $1 billion into research in Hyperloop. They have now said that they are pulling out of that deal at the moment. It's on hold. So this could potentially be a bigger picture of more retaliation from Saudi Arabia because so many companies have pulled out, so many media companies have pulled out. This can effect the defense industry, the energy industry. Oh, and speaking about defense, just last year alone, the president's son- in-law, Jared Kushner, secured a very big defense deal worth $110 billion.  That could be at stake should the United States impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia. And last but not, you have oil too that could be affected. Some analysts were saying that oil could jump to well over $100 U.S. a barrel.

Welcome, everybody. We are on top of both. I'm Neil Cavuto. And you are looking right now at the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Now, pressure is building on the Saudis, lots of unanswered questions about exactly what happened to missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Saudis are pledging an investigation after that meeting with the secretary of state. The secretary will be meeting with Turkish officials tomorrow. Now, we're going to talk to two key members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, fair and balanced, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Maryland Democratic Senator Ben Cardin.

Today, he was in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, meeting with the Saudi Arabian King Salman, also the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. And after that, President Trump tweeted out that yet again Saudi Arabia's top leaders continue to say that they had no involvement whatsoever with the disappearance of the missing Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The president tweeting this out just a little while ago -- quote -- \"Just spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their Turkish consulate. He was with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during the call and told me that he has already started and will rapidly expand a full and complete investigation into this matter. Answers will be forthcoming shortly.\" Now, just before that tweet there, the president wrapped up an interview with Trish Regan, and the president said he will soon hear from the secretary of state."

The crown prince has been all over the globe holding the power of the Saudi kingdom. So, it is clear that he has to account for what happened. We got to get a clear understanding. America's foreign policy is strong because it is embedded in the principles of human rights and good governance.

But I think it has to change as a result of this activity, assuming, again, the facts points to where it looks like it's going. There has got to be repercussions from that. If not, we will see other world leaders look at the United States and say, look, we can do whatever we want to, there is not going to be any consequences. The United States is truly the world leader in promoting the human rights agenda, and we need to be very clear in our language and our actions as to what happened in Turkey not being acceptable."

But we have relationships with the Saudis that deal with their military needs, with their economic needs, their energy issues. We have multiple issues that we can choose from.

We have a strategic need for the Saudis in regards to our war against terror. We understanding that. But the Saudis need to understand that to do business with the United States, that we're going to demand that there be respect for international human rights.

      "utterance": "... on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a key player there. Well, if Wall Street was worried about any of these developments here, what is that always say, they had a funny way of showing it. Take a look at what's happening on the corner of Wall and Broad, about a 550-point surge. Now, remember, it was a week ago tomorrow that the big aggressive sell-off really took steam. It accelerated on Thursday. Over two days, we lost over 1,400 -- close to 1400 points and then the markets started clawing its way back, continuing that theme today buoyed by much-better-than-expected earnings out of corporate America and a sentiment building that maybe the sell-off was overdone. Also had a very positive read on industrial production. For the fourth straight month, manufacturing activity was picking up steam ,and maybe not as much as Wall Street had thought. But that was also seen to be a benefit to the bond market because it didn't ignite inflation fears. I could go on and on. But why don't I let my local brainiacs do that, including FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton, Danielle DiMartino Booth, and market watcher Art Hogan? Art, what happened today? Why the big comeback?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ART HOGAN, MARKET STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's interesting. So a lot of things that we were really hyperventilating about last week calmed down this week. So, when we think about the yield on the 10-year, when that spiked from 3 to 3.75, that is sitting at 3.15 now. The volatility index, the VIX, was 10 handles higher last week than it is this week. Price of a barrel of oil has come in four handles. And certainly when you think about the dollar index, that has come off from a 97 handle to a 94 handle. So, lot of the things were we were ultra-concerned about have calmed down a bit. But I also think what's really happening is, we're earning seasonings and economic data continues to look good and several companies have reported really good earnings. And I think that we're coming into earnings season sitting on support vs. bumping up against resistance. I think that's the turn that we saw today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. If you look at all of the numbers that were coming in from corporate America -- and we're still early on in this process, Danielle, I mean, they were off the charts. They might have quarter will end up being better than the 19 or 20 percent earnings surge that was factored in here. Is that the wind at this market's back or are there some headwinds you're looking at?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANIELLE DIMARTINO BOOTH, FORMER FEDERAL RESERVE ADVISER",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I would still, being a former Fed insider, be a little bit concerned about what we might hear tomorrow out of minutes. But, look, the day started off with news that we had more job openings than we have ever had before. It was a record number. I think that that put a bit of a hop in the market's step. And then we saw very strong earnings coming out of the financials. Obviously, there has been a lot more trading activity. Volatility begets activity on Wall Street. And that is very good for earnings and that's exactly what we have seen pan out. And, of course, we have seen some strength in the energy names as well. It doesn't hurt these names that oil prices have rebounded to the extent that they have. But, again, to Art's pointed, they have also come off their highs. That takes a little bit of pressure off the consumer. So, everything that possibly could have gone right today definitely lined up and went right. And we just got blowout earnings from Netflix."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "We did, indeed. I want to go into that a little bit here. Can we do a Fox News Alert, guy? I love when you do that, because I get -- it scares me when I hear it. There you go. Netflix is out with earnings that handily beat the Street, to Danielle's point. And, Deirdre, I will take this up with you, 89 cents a share, significantly bigger than the 68 percent expected. They added a lot of customers, too, about almost seven million. That is, as they say, crazy good."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "It is. It is crazy good. And, I mean, just to start with, that earnings figure that you gave me, I mean, that is better than 140 percent -- and I'm doing quick math -- vs. the third quarter of last year. Cannot overstate what a win that earnings number is. And then revenue, if you like it, exactly in line, exactly what Wall Street was looking for. But the story that most investors care about is exactly what you just talked about, Neil, in the number of subscribers added.  Right? This was the big question mark. OK, sure, you know, the skeptics were saying we know that Netflix can continue to add subscribers, but just how many? Is it going to peter out? If this is the answer, that's why you are seeing the stock move up 13 percent after-hours. So, you said it, Neil, close to seven million new subscribers. As far as what the analysts, even the most optimistic analysts out there, were looking for slightly more than five million. I mean, Netflix had given five million as guidance."

And then, even more importantly, Netflix is talking about the fourth quarter, saying they are going to have yet another large add of new subscribers. And I think this does have to silence the critics, at least for the next 24 hours -- who knows what comes next -- about..."

And that is the backdrop for this as well. Now, I'm wondering how the Federal Reserve, something I will raise with Danielle as well, sort of digests that, because that is boffo, but it also means interest rates have to go uppo, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Right. That's really true, Neil. And I think that's consistent with what we heard from the Fed so far.  They're pretty consistent along this path, agnostic to anything they hear about what is going on in Italy, and certainly not moved by any financial market volatility. They are on a clear and steady path, at least for December. Remember what's going to be important, Neil, I think next year. And Danielle can speak to this as well. Every meeting is live. They're having a press conference after every meeting this year. I think that changes the dynamic of the pace and cadence of rate increases in 2019. But I think, for 2018, if all things remain equal, I think they are going to raise again in December."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so, Danielle, you are looking at all of this. And the president in his interview with our Trish Regan on the Federal Reserve was critical again that they kind of overdo it, but that he has been consistently saying that, that they can sort of bash a party mid- party. He's not the first president to think that. He is the first president to publicly state it again and again. Is he right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DIMARTINO BOOTH",
      "utterance": "You know, yes. Nixon was obviously a lot more quiet about how he went about criticizing the Fed. Should he be as vocal as he is? I have to say no. It is designed to be an apolitical institution. It is their duty to try and keep ahold of inflation, and not let that inflation genie get out of bottle. When you see record job openings like we saw this morning, that's going to eventually translate into employers having to hire employees away from their competitors, and that can only mean one thing. That means, I'm going to give you a bigger paycheck, so that you come over to my greener pastures. It's Powell's duty. He is duty-bound to follow inflation. And I think that's exactly what he is going to do. And I appreciate the president having an opinion on many things, but I wish that he had a quieter opinion when it came to the Fed."

The secretary was dispatched by the president Sunday night. He called him -- 24 hours, or less than 24 hours later, he was on a plane to Riyadh. All of this as senior members of Congress say they just don't believe the Saudi government's explanations. Democrats and Republicans are calling to cancel arms sales with Saudi Arabia and sanction those found responsible. The administration has warned of consequences if it is determined the Saudi government is responsible for the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, though has given no specifics on what it would do. The president has also rejected calls to cancel arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi wrote a column for The Washington Post. The paper's publisher and CEO has just released a statement, saying -- quote -- \"The Saudi government can no longer remain silent. And it is essential that our government and others push harder for the truth. Until we have a full account and full accountability, it cannot be business as usual with the Saudi government.\" The State Department has also announced that Secretary Pompeo will travel to Ankara, Turkey, tomorrow to meet with the foreign minister of Turkey after he leaves Saudi Arabia -- Neil."

That didn't happen today.  Certainly continuing a surge, as was across the Dow Jones industrials, S&P 500. We told you a little bit about Netflix with those boffo earnings coming in far better than thought, adding close to seven million subscribers. Well, stock is getting appropriately run up in after-hours trading, up 14 percent. That is in a matter of minutes. I believe it was up, guys, what, 4 percent on the day anyway. So, add another 14 percent on that, and Big Blue not looking so big black and blue.  IBM also out with numbers that beat the Street, earning about $3.42 a share. The market had been expecting $3.40. I emphasize these numbers to illustrate the point this is the backdrop, the fundamentals that you hear a lot of bulls allude to, that no matter the gyrations you are seeing from abroad, this is at our core the wind at everyone's back, or so they hope. So far, so good. More after this."

Five hours from now, a debate in that Senate race featuring the incumbent Republican, Ted Cruz, his Democratic challenger, Beto O'Rourke. They square off. O'Rourke is a setting a record, by the way, with fund-raising. Many Democrats are outraising competitors with just three weeks to go. And that's surprising a lot of folks, particularly when it goes against Republican incumbents. Democratic strategist Robert Patillo is here, conservative commentator Madison Gesiotto, and The Washington Examiner's Phil Wegmann. Madison, to you first. These are striking numbers in race after race, not across in every one, but particularly in Texas, where a lot of outside money has come in, thinking that O'Rourke has a chance at this.

You can have all the money in the world. You can raise all the money in the world. But if you don't have the votes, you will not win. When it comes to November 6, money will be one of many factors, not the only or the deciding factor. And the only thing we really need to do to look back at is 2016. Look back at 2016. Hillary Clinton in total money raised brought in over $1.4 billion. Donald Trump didn't even come in at $1 billion. He came in under $1 billion. And he won that election.

So, I think the money coming in just from what they like to say big-money outside corporations. These are regular people making donations to campaign and candidates all over the country they think support their values. And I think it's a good sign for the Democratic Party."

Once the campaigns have a lot of money, some of them won't use it usefully.  And when it came to President Trump's campaign in 2016, he was outspent 2- 1, but we were very lean and we were very smart about how that money was spent. It was very targeted. And so I think there are a lot of races."

But if you do look elsewhere, though, if you do look at some of these races that are incredibly tight, the ones that are going to determine whether or not Democrats retake control of the House, what we see is, yes, there is enthusiasm. And, yes, there is money, because, right now, Republicans, while they have been bringing in significant fund-raising totals on their own, Republicans aren't going to be able to match the glut of negative advertising that we are going to hear on radio and television going in to Election Day. So, it's definitely reason to be concerned if you are a Republican strategist, because, again, you can't win if you are getting outspent. I know that President Trump did it in 2016.

And one of the things I think that they are really disappointed in when it comes to Democrats, if there were voters who were on the fence, is the way they handled the Kavanaugh nomination process and the way that they have been handling their own party for the past two years. They don't feel there is strong leadership in the Democratic Party and they don't feel that the Democrats have come forward with a message saying what they can do for the people. All they hear is, we hate Trump, we hate Trump, we hate Republicans. And they are sick of that. They want to know what these candidates going to do for them. How are they going to positively impact their life? And I think we are going to have a red wave because of that."

It builds cynicism. It builds belief among the populace that there is no point in getting out the vote because have you negative people on both sides of the aisle. Now, on the point of if some of these swing candidates don't win, what you see is, with these millions of dollars elections being poured into these elections, you're getting millions of young people voted on -- or registered and on voter rolls. You're getting people involved in the political process. You're going people educated. So, even if it doesn't pay off in 2018, it pays dividends in 2020."

But we're not surprised by that. I do think that she just stepped on this and it blew up in her face. Her timing couldn't have been worse. The morning after Democrats get up and have to deal with questions about Hillary Clinton's bone-headed, tone-deaf, defiant remarks in an interview on Sunday saying that her president as -- her husband as president didn't abuse power having an affair with a 22- year-old intern, Elizabeth Warren does this massive rollout three weeks before the midterm elections, when Democrats do not want to focus on either of them and they want to focus on winning the House back and trying to stay alive in Senate races. The whole thing she is trying to do to convince the base that she is going to take on President Trump and fight with him, you know, she can be just as nasty as him, absolutely could have waited for November 7.

But how does she stack up with all the other -- she's obviously identified with the hard left. Very popular figure in the hard left. But so is Bernie Sanders.

But they have a huge kind of meltdown coming in the party about whether or not they are a center-left party or super free lunch socialist party on the left. And they haven't had that discussion.

Obviously, he has largely lost the white-college educated female, and those are the voters that the Democrats are hoping to turn out, former Republicans and independents or Dem leaners.

And it was supposed to show how Saudi Arabia is breaking its dependence on oil and modernizing the kingdom.  But now you have a massive CEO exodus, many people pulling out of this conference that is scheduled for October 23. The ones that you are seeing on your screen right now, you have got J.P. Morgan Chase -- that's the CEO, Jamie Dimon -- the Ford executive, Uber CEO, Blackstone CEO, BlackRock, HSBC. And the list continues. This only the faces that could fit on this screen right now. There are many more that have pulled out of this event. There are some big names that are still attending. You have the IMF, Christine Lagarde, who is going, and of course the U.S. treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who did say that the relations with Saudi Arabia are good, and that they are a good partner to the United States. However, you had Senator, Republican of Arizona, Jeff Flake commenting on this, and he tweeted out -- and I quote -- \"Secretary Mnuchin shouldn't be going to Riyadh.\" So, many people weighing in on whether people should be attending or not.  The Saudis today, according to The Financial Times, have retaliated against one company that has decided not to go. And that is company operated by Richard Branson. Richard Branson runs the Hyperloop company. This is Virgin Hyperloop One.  They have said -- the Saudi Arabians have said that they are pulling the deal right now. It's on hold. They were originally going to invest about $1 billion into research in Hyperloop. They have now said that they are pulling out of that deal at the moment. It's on hold. So this could potentially be a bigger picture of more retaliation from Saudi Arabia because so many companies have pulled out, so many media companies have pulled out. This can effect the defense industry, the energy industry. Oh, and speaking about defense, just last year alone, the president's son- in-law, Jared Kushner, secured a very big defense deal worth $110 billion.  That could be at stake should the United States impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia. And last but not, you have oil too that could be affected. Some analysts were saying that oil could jump to well over $100 U.S. a barrel. All of this though, is the what-if, worst-case scenario -- Neil."

So, the question again, are we hooking up with the wrong guy? And is it time to see if we can find an alternative to that guy, as if we have a choice? Retired four-star general, Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane. General, good to have you. We can't pick and choose our friends, nor our enemies.

And, you know, Neil, half of the global economy comes through the Middle East in terms of oil. So there is no doubt about our national interests here. So, what do we do when we have a friend like this that appears to have misbehaved rather dramatically? Do we walk away and get a divorce as a result of that? With the nation's self- and our strategic interests, I don't believe so. But I -- one is I think we must wait for the full accounting of what actually took place. I don't like the idea that the Saudis are just going to go out and do an investigation themselves. I think we should have insisted that we want to participate in that. The Turks know an awful lot that they're not talking about. And they sort of clammed up a little bit in the last couple days."
