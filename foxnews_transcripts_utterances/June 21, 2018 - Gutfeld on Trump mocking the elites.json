Last night's rally was nothing new, the crowd loved him. The people who already hate him will just hate him more. And the media pats itself on the head for not covering it while secretly watching Fox News. Too bad, they totally missed an opportunity to call him Hitler. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, for the bias-impaired here's news: Trump just reduced the risk of nuclear war. He also got remains of 200 U.S. soldiers back from North Korea just a week after the issue was raised. He's bringing in record-low unemployment, helping women and minorities most. He's addressed trade imbalances as our GDP climbs higher. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, if he's monster, he might be the worst monster ever -- meaning, not a monster at all. That's why optimism is high: 95 percent of manufacturers have a positive company outlook. It's good news. Even if the elites deny it.

Now bragging is never appealing, but he's not wrong that by wealth he's an elitist, yet, he's still embraced by working classes. No wonder the De Niro's, the Madonna's, the Depp's, the Fonda's all unravel. Trump is richer than them all, but closer to the street than they are. How can that be? The answer is he makes promises and fights to keep them. And besides, for you deplorables at the rally the outrage celebrity class will always deem you to be the uncool kids. Trump defends you against the jerks. So, it's not about wealth or apartments. It's about speaking up for people that the media celebrity complex snickers at. And it's why when everything seems to be working out those snickers seem truly from Mars.",
