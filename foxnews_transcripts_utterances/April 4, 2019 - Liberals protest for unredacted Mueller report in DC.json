The Hill's John Solomon has some answers and a message to the media who published these leaks. Plus, there were protests tonight across the country and today calling on Attorney General Bill Barr to release the full Mueller report. But do these people even know what they're protesting. Well, we sent Arroyo down into the crowd to get some answers today and he's going to bring the protest to life here in the studio. It is hysterical. So, stay there. And the saga of hate crime a hoax or Jussie Smollett is not over. So, did the disgraced Empire star make his deadline to pay back the city. A late breaking update ahead. But first, the Democrats make America hate again. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Just when you think they cannot get any nuttier, the ever-radicalized members of the President's opposition party surprise us all anew. Now after going full on Red Scare for two years during Mueller only to be left jilted at the altar of impeachment, Democrats are returning now to their first loves, racial pandering and grievance peddling. So, rather than seeing America as a place of near endless opportunity, they paint her as a place of near constant oppression. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

He's talking about Kamala Harris' comments about how people are responsible for these past racial sins. Kamala Harris wants to hold slavery responsible for black America's contemporary problems but that requires ignoring the progress made by blacks both in absolute terms and relative to whites who live much closer to the era of slavery. For example, the soaring violent crime rates that produce so much quote trauma according to her in poor black communities today did not exist in those communities in the first hundred years after emancipation. Even though poverty rights at the time were much higher and racism was still legal and widespread. Jason Riley's point, Shane your reaction to that. His point is, how do you tag that with today's problems given that long period of lower crime rates, lower homicide rates, a black man by black and of black men and other social pathologies which were much lower during that long time period until actually coming up to the 60s and the 70s when things kind of exploded.",

The Justice Department rules derive from our constitution says, if a prosecutor cannot bring charges in a federal court they can't then go take their evidence walk it into the court of public opinion and try to smear you and that's what last night's leak was disgruntled Mueller sycophants trying to smear the President with a backhanded leak. And here's one of the things I learned today in my reporting. It really gets to the political nature of what's been going on. When the Mueller people wrote the report, they wrote these little summaries like campaign summaries that could be released instantly for the public. That wasn't their mission. That's not what the statute says or even supposed to do. The Justice Department looked at him and said, well, wait a second, there's law enforcement information here. There is grand jury information. We can't release this. So, they've been doing the diligent thing trying to go through that and fix that problem.

And the Democrats have now kept some of that, but they've supplemented with identity politics, which is essentially an affirmation of race and gender, sexual orientation and so on. I think Stacey Abrams is giving a very benign picture of what this identity politics is, because there's a toxic side to it. Let's remember, for example, that black nationalism came out of -- came as a sort of retaliation against white nationalism. Malcolm X was asked why he was a black nationalist, and in fact he said I've got to be a black nationalist to fight against the white nationalism that preceded me. But of course the inverse is also true, which is to say that black nationalism and Latino nationalism is likely to give rise to a revived form of white nationalism. So what I'm saying here is the Democrats through identity politics are creating some of the very problems that they then pretend to deplore.

The Hill's John Solomon has some answers and a message to the media who published these leaks. Plus, there were protests tonight across the country and today calling on Attorney General Bill Barr to release the full Mueller report. But do these people even know what they're protesting. Well, we sent Arroyo down into the crowd to get some answers today and he's going to bring the protest to life here in the studio. It is hysterical. So, stay there. And the saga of hate crime a hoax or Jussie Smollett is not over. So, did the disgraced Empire star make his deadline to pay back the city. A late breaking update ahead. But first, the Democrats make America hate again. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Just when you think they cannot get any nuttier, the ever-radicalized members of the President's opposition party surprise us all anew. Now after going full on Red Scare for two years during Mueller only to be left jilted at the altar of impeachment, Democrats are returning now to their first loves, racial pandering and grievance peddling. So, rather than seeing America as a place of near endless opportunity, they paint her as a place of near constant oppression."

So, this is - I want to read something, this is what Jason Riley wrote in The Wall Street Journal about the reparations debate just last a couple weeks ago. He's talking about Kamala Harris' comments about how people are responsible for these past racial sins. Kamala Harris wants to hold slavery responsible for black America's contemporary problems but that requires ignoring the progress made by blacks both in absolute terms and relative to whites who live much closer to the era of slavery. For example, the soaring violent crime rates that produce so much quote trauma according to her in poor black communities today did not exist in those communities in the first hundred years after emancipation. Even though poverty rights at the time were much higher and racism was still legal and widespread. Jason Riley's point, Shane your reaction to that. His point is, how do you tag that with today's problems given that long period of lower crime rates, lower homicide rates, a black man by black and of black men and other social pathologies which were much lower during that long time period until actually coming up to the 60s and the 70s when things kind of exploded."

Let us not forget we gave reparations to many others in this country, in the Indian community. You see it across the line. You see reparations go to many, many, many people. But yet and still African- Americans are still disproportionately unemployed. African-Americans have not gotten the opportunities or the resources that many, many other communities have gotten.

I know it sounds a little bit like Johnnie Cochran, but there is a really important part behind that. The Justice Department rules derive from our constitution says, if a prosecutor cannot bring charges in a federal court they can't then go take their evidence walk it into the court of public opinion and try to smear you and that's what last night's leak was disgruntled Mueller sycophants trying to smear the President with a backhanded leak. And here's one of the things I learned today in my reporting. It really gets to the political nature of what's been going on. When the Mueller people wrote the report, they wrote these little summaries like campaign summaries that could be released instantly for the public. That wasn't their mission. That's not what the statute says or even supposed to do. The Justice Department looked at him and said, well, wait a second, there's law enforcement information here. There is grand jury information. We can't release this. So, they've been doing the diligent thing trying to go through that and fix that problem.

We'll keep in touch with you after your Congressional appearance, or his Congressional appearance. All right, I want to dig in a little more on something I touched on a little bit earlier in THE ANGLE and ask this question. Is failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams kind of the purest distillation of what the modern Democratic Party today is all about? Well, it's about identity politics to them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STACEY ABRAMS, FORMER GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "We have to acknowledge any constraints that people see when they see us. I'm a black woman with natural hair and a sturdy build. And there are people who discount my capacity for leadership based on purely phenotypical issues. We have to acknowledge that. You can't ignore that that's how people behave. The issue is, what do you do with that information? For me, it's lean into it. I talk about it. I don't pretend you can't see me. But I also make certain that you understand that I'm incredibly smart. I'm very capable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And very modest, which is great. Here now to react is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author and filmmaker. Dinesh, at least, I guess she's honest. She's confident. And this is what the Democratic Party must be about now. She's very clear on it -- identity politics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER",
      "utterance": "Yes. The old FDR Democratic Party under Franklin Roosevelt was ultimately about a division, but it was a different kind of division. It was a class division between, if you will, the haves and the have-notes, the workers and the employers. And the Democrats have now kept some of that, but they've supplemented with identity politics, which is essentially an affirmation of race and gender, sexual orientation and so on. I think Stacey Abrams is giving a very benign picture of what this identity politics is, because there's a toxic side to it. Let's remember, for example, that black nationalism came out of -- came as a sort of retaliation against white nationalism. Malcolm X was asked why he was a black nationalist, and in fact he said I've got to be a black nationalist to fight against the white nationalism that preceded me. But of course the inverse is also true, which is to say that black nationalism and Latino nationalism is likely to give rise to a revived form of white nationalism. So what I'm saying here is the Democrats through identity politics are creating some of the very problems that they then pretend to deplore. They deplore the rise of white nationalism, yet they are doing more than anyone else, certainly more than Trump, to fuel those fires."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, but Dinesh, they have to keep this going, do they not, because there has been significant progress, there's significant gains, still much work to be done, no doubt about it. But you can't give Trump credit for pretty much anything. You have to pull the credit out of people for criminal justice reform. But Al Sharpton said in his radio interview this week, some unemployment has gotten better, but we're still double that of whites. We still have less income as a family household matter than whites. It was down the line, than whites. And that's how they're reading it, and that leads to reparations, the need for that leveling of the economic playing field through monthly payments of some sort, perhaps given how that plays out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "You see here that Trump is actually embracing the correct answer for this sort of identity politics, and it is to reject identity politics altogether, and to embrace a sort of decent American nationalism in which all groups are given an opportunity and a chance to move up. I think this kind of American nationalism, which was the nationalism of Lincoln, the nationalism of the American founders, this is the Trump card, if I may say so, to beat identity politics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, and yet they want to tag the word \"nationalism,\" Dinesh, with white nationalism. So if you love your country and you think the country is worth preserving, our borders, our sovereignty, our Constitution, our history, our historical markers, even when they're people who committed terrible acts of cruelty but who redeemed themselves in other ways, then you're tantamount to just a white nationalist. But no, we love the country, the warts and all. We love our experience. We want to keep getting better."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "What's been hidden here is that white nationalism was invented by the Democratic Party after the Civil War in order to maintain its lock on the south. White nationalism was the glue that held the south tightly to the Democratic Party. So the very people who have sort of poisoned the waters here with white nationalism are now pretending to show up as the water commissioner and be the solution to white nationalism. No, they created white nationalism, and in a sense they've also created black nationalism."
