      "sentences": "Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" We have massive news to share with you tonight. We have the DACA negotiations reaching a fever pitch. It's an issue so many of you care about and the president is not budging. We are going to have the real analysis of what the Democrats and some of their pals in the Republican Party are trying to ram through. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we are going to get into that explosive comment the president made in the oval office. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And first, Silicon Valley, came after conservatives and now they are coming after you. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, Chicago residents revolt over the Obama Library plan. We have one of the men behind the pushback here with us tonight. Plus, we have exclusive details on some of the most vial, heinous crimes ever committed by an illegal immigrant and we are the only show doing this story tonight. We have exclusive details about something that happened in Denver, Colorado. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, the Durbin-Graham-Flake DACA bill travesty, that is the subject of tonight's ANGLE. As I predicted this gang of six bill is a complete and utter joke. Earlier in the week, the president empowered Congressional leaders to come up with a bipartisan deal to address the status of the 800,000 or so DREAMers that President Obama through executive action protected from deportation. Remember, there were some perquisites, build the wall, add more border agents and immigration judges, and end chain migration, and the visa lottery. But today, Senator Dick Durbin, Lindsey Graham, and Jeff Flake unveiled their great compromise. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The moment I heard it was those three involved, I knew it was going to be bad. If you're wondering why the president has already in the words of Dick Durbin personally rejected the bill, I'll tell you why, it would increase chain migration violating one of the president's non-negotiables. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Number one, the DACA citizens get citizenship and can then sponsorship relatives and their parents for renewable three-year period. The money for border enforcement is as I predicted a pittance $2.3 billion is all Durbin, Graham, and Flake offered. And by the way, only 1.6 billion will go towards the construction of the wall and double fencing, and what are they supposed to build the wall with, Styrofoam, for that much money. A real border wall is expected to cost about $20 billion. And while Congress anguishes to find the money, by the way, remember we are going to rebuild Puerto Rico for about $50 billion and illegals cost us all in about $113 billion a year. So, do not tell me that we do not have the money to enforce our own border. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The bipartisan proposal placed new constraints on the Department of Homeland Security that will hamper the actual building of the wall, and this really tortures me. The visa lottery would simply be transferred to temporary protective status. Meaning those visas would result to even more lower-skilled immigrants coming into the country. The bars even lowered for that group. So, I suggest that the great bipartisan working group sharpen their pencils and return to the table. This will not do, no way, no how. Again, it would increase chain migration. It would lead to more immigration and it would spike the number of low-skilled immigrant workers. This is a bill that the president should love, right? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president of Mexico that is. Republicans should run, not walk away from it. Just like in 2006, 2007, 2013, and 2014, open borders, bipartisan cartel tries to trick the American people every time. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, guess what? We are not Charlie Brown and you're not Lucy. But Donald Trump is not going to be led down this garden path on this, no way. During the presidential election, Lindsay Graham got 1 percent of the vote in his home state of South Carolina during the primaries, yes, 1 percent. And Jeff Flake, himself, is so unpopular in Arizona, he was forced to retire rather than face the electorate. Let's face it. The immigration views of Flake and Graham are not popular, and the president should not tie his great political future to these walking anvils. They should just sink him right down. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For a real perspective on immigration, they president should listen to the voices of the silent majority that I heard loud and clear once again on my radio show today. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" We have massive news to share with you tonight. We have the DACA negotiations reaching a fever pitch. It's an issue so many of you care about and the president is not budging. We are going to have the real analysis of what the Democrats and some of their pals in the Republican Party are trying to ram through. And we are going to get into that explosive comment the president made in the oval office. And first, Silicon Valley, came after conservatives and now they are coming after you. By the way, Chicago residents revolt over the Obama Library plan. We have one of the men behind the pushback here with us tonight. Plus, we have exclusive details on some of the most vial, heinous crimes ever committed by an illegal immigrant and we are the only show doing this story tonight. We have exclusive details about something that happened in Denver, Colorado. But first, the Durbin-Graham-Flake DACA bill travesty, that is the subject of tonight's ANGLE. As I predicted this gang of six bill is a complete and utter joke. Earlier in the week, the president empowered Congressional leaders to come up with a bipartisan deal to address the status of the 800,000 or so DREAMers that President Obama through executive action protected from deportation. Remember, there were some perquisites, build the wall, add more border agents and immigration judges, and end chain migration, and the visa lottery. But today, Senator Dick Durbin, Lindsey Graham, and Jeff Flake unveiled their great compromise. The moment I heard it was those three involved, I knew it was going to be bad. If you're wondering why the president has already in the words of Dick Durbin personally rejected the bill, I'll tell you why, it would increase chain migration violating one of the president's non-negotiables. Number one, the DACA citizens get citizenship and can then sponsorship relatives and their parents for renewable three-year period. The money for border enforcement is as I predicted a pittance $2.3 billion is all Durbin, Graham, and Flake offered. And by the way, only 1.6 billion will go towards the construction of the wall and double fencing, and what are they supposed to build the wall with, Styrofoam, for that much money. A real border wall is expected to cost about $20 billion. And while Congress anguishes to find the money, by the way, remember we are going to rebuild Puerto Rico for about $50 billion and illegals cost us all in about $113 billion a year. So, do not tell me that we do not have the money to enforce our own border. The bipartisan proposal placed new constraints on the Department of Homeland Security that will hamper the actual building of the wall, and this really tortures me. The visa lottery would simply be transferred to temporary protective status. Meaning those visas would result to even more lower-skilled immigrants coming into the country. The bars even lowered for that group. So, I suggest that the great bipartisan working group sharpen their pencils and return to the table. This will not do, no way, no how. Again, it would increase chain migration. It would lead to more immigration and it would spike the number of low-skilled immigrant workers. This is a bill that the president should love, right? The president of Mexico that is. Republicans should run, not walk away from it. Just like in 2006, 2007, 2013, and 2014, open borders, bipartisan cartel tries to trick the American people every time. Well, guess what? We are not Charlie Brown and you're not Lucy. But Donald Trump is not going to be led down this garden path on this, no way. During the presidential election, Lindsay Graham got 1 percent of the vote in his home state of South Carolina during the primaries, yes, 1 percent. And Jeff Flake, himself, is so unpopular in Arizona, he was forced to retire rather than face the electorate. Let's face it. The immigration views of Flake and Graham are not popular, and the president should not tie his great political future to these walking anvils. They should just sink him right down. For a real perspective on immigration, they president should listen to the voices of the silent majority that I heard loud and clear once again on my radio show today."

The media is not asking any questions and then, they turn around and blow up on a comment like Trump's.

But, you know, I think it's worth mentioning, this is exactly what all of the Democratic sponsors of the 1965 Immigration Act promised us. Teddy Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, the \"Washington Post,\" Emmanuel Selert (ph) swore up and down. This immigration act will not change the ethnic composition of America. We will not be overwhelmed by immigrants from Asia, Africa, Caribbean, from any one country. They swore up and down. In fact, the 1965 Immigration Act and (inaudible) acted exactly the opposite of that. Basically, Western European immigration was shut down. We were overwhelmed with the third world. Now if anybody complains about it, they call you a racist. Well, no, we are just saying -- was Teddy Kennedy a racist for saying it wouldn't do all of the things it did? No, it is not true.

I think this is a contentious issue and the president should be speaking in a presidential capacity with better choice of words. But the fact is the dialogue has deteriorated. We have unfortunately leaders in this nation in both houses that have not done anything to fix this broken immigration system that is festering. And you know, family reunification was a hallmark of the 1965 Act. It's now been given the derogatory term of \"chain migration\". So, we have a lot of things to fix. Guys, let me just something, we have 50,000 lottery visas and we have 10,000 people getting EB5s where they put a million dollars and buy green cards effectively.

      "utterance": "Oh, tell us, Stephanie. But the real reason of course the press was giddy is because they thought the exodus of all those corporate chieftains made it certain that the entire Trump agenda would be over, finis. Could they have been more wrong? The truth is the president, despite his unconventional approach, has demonstrated that he's smarter and more in tune with the people than these business leaders will ever be. In fact, they are now the ones cheering. Consider the recent news. In the wake the tax reform Wal-Mart announced today that it's raising starting wages for hourly employees to $11 an hour. It's also giving $1,000 bonuses to some of its hourly employees. Wal-Mart credited the salary hikes and the bonuses to the president's tax cuts. And by the way, they are not alone. Waste management, Comcast, AT&T, and many others have made similar moves. This is real money in people's pockets. Political this puts Democrats in something of a trick bag. The economy is humming, manufacturing is up, but remember what Nancy Pelosi said when that tax bill passed?"

Maybe it is crumb if you live in Pacific Heights or Seacliff neighborhood of San Francisco and you're married to Paul Pelosi, maybe then it's a crumb. But for most people it is real money. And they say, by the way, that Trump doesn't have both oars in the water. Nancy has lost the oars and can't even find the water she is so out of it. Now it must be a great relief to the Democrats that in their moment of confusion, their dear former leader, President Barrack Obama, is giving them tons of moral support and clarity as he chatted with Dave Letterman on Netflix."

And meanwhile, back in the present, some of those same CEOs who abandoned Trump a few months back resurfaced yesterday and they are urging the president to grant amnesty to the 800,000 DACA Dreamers. Here's my question -- why, Mr. President, should you trust them on that issue? They kicked you when you were down back in August. Let's face it, most of them talk about you behind your back and they voted for Hillary Clinton. Only the base stood by you during all the controversies, Billy Bush, Khizr Khan, travel ban rollout, and even post Charlottesville. As the immigration debate continues, do not forget who your real friends are. We'll be right back."
