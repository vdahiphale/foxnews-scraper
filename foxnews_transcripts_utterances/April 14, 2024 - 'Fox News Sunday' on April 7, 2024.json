There will still be several thousand IDF troops. That's what a brigade is in Gaza after this announcement this morning. But I presume this is a tactical decision by the IDF and Israeli leadership in the face of a threat of a real attack from the north, from Hezbollah, or a direct attack from Iran.

You'll be hearing from a hostage someone who's been released soon. I've met many times with hostage families. It is tragic that Hamas continues to use civilians as human shields, continues to hold these hostages and continues to terrorize them now for 184 days. So it's my hope that the changes that were asked for, the delivery of humanitarian aid, the deconfliction of possible strikes into Gaza with where humanitarian aids being delivered, and a conduct of the future campaign against Rafah to finish the job against Hamas in a way that will minimize civilian casualties, I'm hopeful that we're going to see all of those changes unfolding here in the days ahead.",

He is the commander in chief in charge of national security for our country.

The unemployment rate in this country is at 3.8 and the jobs added number was over 100,000 higher than economists were expecting there. So take a look at this from Semafor's publication. This is what they are arguing. The border crisis might be a boon for the economy. The daily march of migrants across the southern border has been a political curse for Joe Biden -- President Joe Biden. But for the economy, it may have turned out to be a blessing. By adding millions of new workers to the labor market, the immigration surge has lifted payrolls and growth and potentially helped keep a lid on consumer prices. What do you say to that, sir?",

Job-wise, Texas ranks number one for the most new jobs added. So our economy and our jobs are growing faster at the very same time, Martha, while illegal immigration into the State of Texas is going down. Illegal immigration into Texas has gone down 72% because of the resistance that we've put up. It's gone up, however, in the other border states.

What Texas is doing is not in conflict with the laws of the United States of America. They are consistent and uphold the laws of the United States of America. There are laws on the books passed by Congress that require the president and the country to deny illegal entry, to detain anybody who comes into the country illegally and to build border barriers.

So, it sounds - KURTZ (voice over): What Caitlin Clark did almost single-handedly carrying her Iowa team to victory over LSU in the NCAA playoffs was not just a sports event, it was a cultural phenomenon. It was the determination of one woman, through years of endless practice, taking 300 shots in each section, to transform herself into a leader without losing her midwestern niceness. That event was the most-watched women's basketball game in history, 12.3 million viewers for ESPN, peaking at 16 million, as Clark took on LSU star Angel Reese.

What is your reaction to this very big development on the ground in Gaza?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE)",
      "utterance": "Well, Martha, first, it's important to remember how this all began six months ago, with a brutal, a barbaric attack by Hamas terrorists who massacred roughly 1,200 Israelis. And in the six months of this campaign against Hamas in Gaza, thousands and thousands of IDF troops have done their best to carry out a campaign to eliminate Hamas from Gaza. There will still be several thousand IDF troops. That's what a brigade is in Gaza after this announcement this morning. But I presume this is a tactical decision by the IDF and Israeli leadership in the face of a threat of a real attack from the north, from Hezbollah, or a direct attack from Iran. And it's important for all of us who support Israel to be clear that we will continue to defend Israel against Iran or any of its proxies in the region."

    {
      "speaker": "COONS",
      "utterance": "Well, I wasn't in that conversation between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, but there are negotiations in Cairo today about a possible hostage release and ceasefire. As you know, Martha, thousands and thousands of Israelis have been protesting in Tel Aviv and throughout the country about the lack of progress on the release of the hostages. You'll be hearing from a hostage someone who's been released soon. I've met many times with hostage families. It is tragic that Hamas continues to use civilians as human shields, continues to hold these hostages and continues to terrorize them now for 184 days. So it's my hope that the changes that were asked for, the delivery of humanitarian aid, the deconfliction of possible strikes into Gaza with where humanitarian aids being delivered, and a conduct of the future campaign against Rafah to finish the job against Hamas in a way that will minimize civilian casualties, I'm hopeful that we're going to see all of those changes unfolding here in the days ahead."

I have not heard President Biden call for a ceasefire without the release of hostages. I think that is the direction that all of us are pressing for. And I'll remind you that President Biden has repeatedly pushed Qatar and Egypt who have direct communications with Hamas, to press Hamas harder to release the hostages they are holding. I think that's what all of us have been hoping for. In my last meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel, that's what I was encouraging was continued negotiations and I've also directly communicated with Egyptian and Qatari leaders on the urgency of a hostage release as a condition for any ceasefire."

Let me remind you, in Rafah, there's more than a million Palestinian civilians who have fled from the north and the center of Gaza, they are now trapped up against the hard border with Egypt. And what I have been saying and what I believe President Biden has been saying directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu is before you go in at scale and try to finish the job against Hamas, make sure that you allow for humanitarian aid and for those civilians trapped in Rafah to move out of the way before you conduct this last stage of the ground campaign.

He is the commander in chief in charge of national security for our country. Our country is being invaded in ways that put our country at risk because of the political games that Joe Biden has played. And Mayor Adams is just aiding and abetting that by having a sanctuary city status, welcoming in anybody from across the world to live there or stay there in New York City on the bill of New York City. And what Mayor Adams needs to do, he needs to stop talking boldly about illegal immigration and the migrants that Texas is sending there, and he needs to step up and do his own job because look at the dangers in New York City under his watch. You have a police officer who is killed. You have the train system in New York which is treacherous for travelers. You've got police officers attacked in Times Square by illegal immigrants. He needs to step up and do his job as mayor and protect the people of his community as opposed to gimmicks about what's going on, on the border."

The border numbers are similar as well. But the President did get some good economic news this week, Governor. In the March jobs report, 303,000 jobs added. The unemployment rate in this country is at 3.8 and the jobs added number was over 100,000 higher than economists were expecting there. So take a look at this from Semafor's publication. This is what they are arguing. The border crisis might be a boon for the economy. The daily march of migrants across the southern border has been a political curse for Joe Biden -- President Joe Biden. But for the economy, it may have turned out to be a blessing. By adding millions of new workers to the labor market, the immigration surge has lifted payrolls and growth and potentially helped keep a lid on consumer prices. What do you say to that, sir?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ABBOTT",
      "utterance": "I'm going to give you some facts, Martha, that completely debunk that notion. For one, one reason why the U.S. economy is doing so well is because the Texas economy is doing so well. The gross domestic product economic growth in Texas is going twice as fast as the United States. We have the fastest growing economy of any large state in the United States. Job-wise, Texas ranks number one for the most new jobs added. So our economy and our jobs are growing faster at the very same time, Martha, while illegal immigration into the State of Texas is going down. Illegal immigration into Texas has gone down 72% because of the resistance that we've put up. It's gone up, however, in the other border states. And so Texas is decreasing illegal immigration while at the very same time adding more jobs and growing our economy far faster than the entire country."

What do you expect next on SB4, Governor?"

We feel pretty good about this SB4, which is a law that authorizes Texas to make arrests. I feel good about us winning for this very simple reason. What Texas is doing is not in conflict with the laws of the United States of America. They are consistent and uphold the laws of the United States of America. There are laws on the books passed by Congress that require the president and the country to deny illegal entry, to detain anybody who comes into the country illegally and to build border barriers. While Joe Biden has abandoned that responsibility, Texas has embraced that duty and all that Texas is doing is enforcing laws through SB4 that the federal government has already said they want to have enforced."

      "utterance": "-- needs in terms of where their money gets spent. But there's been a lot of talk about whether Donald Trump would be able to bring home the Republican Party. Last night, he started to prove that. Warren Stephens, who was a big billionaire out of Arkansas, was a big Nikki Haley supporter. He was not only at the fundraiser, but a co-chair donating the top amount. His name was on the invitation for this fundraiser. They also have interesting players, like former senator Kelly Loeffler out of Georgia, who was at the fundraiser, also a co-chair. So you're seeing this rallying around. It's not surprising that Donald Trump would be behind -- be behind in fundraising. After all, he just went through a primary. We're now in the longest general election, I believe, that we've ever seen. And so he's bringing home Republicans who previously were question marks in terms of whether they would back Donald Trump that opens the door for other donors to have a safe place to go and get behind the Trump campaign."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

This is what the Trump team says. \"Republicans may not be the beneficiaries of the self-interested largess of Hollywood and Silicon Valley elites, but President Trump is proud to be supported by donations from voters who are the backbone of the nation.\" That's from Trump campaign senior advisor, Susie Wiles, Juan. This is a question, because this part of the money raising reveals how broad the support really is out there. What's your take?"

      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, just the numbers aren't not in favor of that statement. I think it's, you know, right now, you have like the Biden people saying 96 percent of their donors are giving $200 or less. What we saw last night was big money coming behind former president Trump. But then it allows the Biden people to say, oh, you have -- you're backed by the oil money, an oil billionaire, casino billionaire, hedge fund billionaire, TikTok billionaire. You don't really have the people. And when you think about the need to consolidate the base, what Kate -- the Republican base that Katie was talking about, it's striking that where President Biden is able to get former president Obama, former president Clinton, and all those people to gather in support of him. What you get for former president Trump is Vivek Ramaswamy, Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, Tim Scott, the senator from South Carolina. You do not see Nikki Haley. You do not see Mike Pence. You do not see George W. Bush, the former Republican president. You do not see Dick Cheney, the former Republican vice president. That base is still eluding him. But, you know, I don't think there's any getting around. He raised a lot of money last night and his campaign is saying, it's enough for him to run."

I don't know that people across America and the battleground states, and let's put up the polls that we just got last week, are, you know, sitting around the breakfast table on a Sunday morning saying, well, you know, this person was there and that person wasn't there. But the -- what we're seeing in these numbers, this was a very important poll, and it -- and it really backs up some of the numbers that we saw in previous polls as well, is that Trump is ahead in every single battleground state by a few points. Some of the margins are bigger than others, which you can see clearly here, and tied in the state of Wisconsin. So what's your take?"

President Trump will be out there. Read a story that Kamala Harris is out in Pennsylvania. I'm not sure she's going to do what the Democrats need. But what we're seeing with these donors is that they're making a decision to have a choice right now, where they're going to give their money if they're going to send their hands or give the money. Voters are going to come down to the decision between Trump versus Biden. It doesn't really matter who else is out there. Everybody's recognized this down to two. And that's what you're going to see the emphasis on those -- on those states because everybody's got to recognize they got to pick one side or another does no good sitting on your hands."

Seventy-one thousand of those jobs are government jobs. And this is the kind of number that we've been seeing consistently. So the government is getting bigger and bigger and bigger is, you know, clear takeaway, just based purely on the numbers that we see here. And how you feel about that is up to everyone to decide. So we're going to be right back with more with our great panel. So stay with us. Up next, America gets ready for a total eclipse of the sun in the middle of the afternoon as millions flock to the path of totality. Are you going to be in that path this Monday?

And I think that that's where you're seeing sort of this pressurized situation where President Biden is saying he wants to support Israel, but you're also having the Senate majority leader doing his - his speech, sort of going after President Netanyahu - sorry, Prime Minister Netanyahu. And that's where you're sort of having this whole conflict arise and Biden needs to figure out how he's going to navigate reattracting these voters."

And third, which the administration loses sight of, Iran is responsible for supporting these organizations. We've lost sight of that. If you keep those three things in mind, it would result in the U.S. supporting Israel, giving them the aid they need and allowing them to finish this fight against terrorism. Hamas for Israel is what ISIS is for the United States. And we're seeing this change in tactical operations in Israel right now, but they're still going to go into Rafah. And that's not Bibi wants. It's what all of Israel wants."

But I think that what we're seeing on the ground in Israel is the president saying, listen, what we're seeing and going on in Gaza is really regrettable. People are calling it, you know, a massacre. So, people and innocents, people who are not involved with Hamas. And you've got to do a better job of protecting not only innocent people, you - I mean it really is heartbreaking to think about children dying, but also people who are humanitarian aid workers. And that's why the president is saying, let's get a deal that involves release of hostages and a ceasefire. And this week was the first time you heard the word \"ceasefire\" come from this White House because this White House is squarely behind Israel. But Netanyahu, and his tactics, are clearly seeding Israel's standing in the globe. It's not just the United States.
