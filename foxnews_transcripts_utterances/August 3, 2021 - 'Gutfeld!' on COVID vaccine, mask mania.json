I guess that's how Fauci got his invite. Now, this news comes amid an increase in the Delta variants and the ensuing media panic. A panic, however, that doesn't go near Obama for holding a bass during a pandemic. But I salute him and the message he's sending, which is rather than shut down your lives again, it's time to throw Fauci to the wind, and live your life. Death comes for all of us, whether it's the miniscule risk of a vaccinated person gets from COVID, or the giant risk of getting murdered in Portland. The real challenge isn't simply the virus. It's overcoming those who politicize this in order to divide a country. Too bad there isn't a vaccine to protect us from CNN's misinformation. But based on the ratings, it would take only about 50 doses. I wonder what the angry white male has to say.",

I don't think is great that President Trump, stone rallies which are kind of like parties. (INAUDIBLE) are great. I love the fact that our former presidents throw parties and rallies. That's great. You know what else would be some cool parties and since we're on the subject of partying? How about just the facts only CDC party? That will be awesome. I would love to attend that. Have easy guest list. And how about a no free money is good money party? That would be phenomenal. We can all get back to work and pull our own weight and get back to doing the things that make this country great again.

      "sentences": "Five-nine. That's about right. Meanwhile, other leaders are doing the same thing. D.C. Mayor Bowser was photographed maskless at an emergency wedding reception just after reinstating a mask mandate for her city. But can you blame her? It's very hard to breathe wearing a mask while doing the chicken dance. D.C. is currently averaging one COVID death a week. Experts say the city has become so criminally dangerous, even COVID doesn't want to go there. Meanwhile, who was at Lollapalooza, the worst mayor in history if you ignore Bill de Blasio. It's Chicago's Lori Lightfoot. Despite threatening new lockdowns, she's the mayor who always looks like she just walked in on a naked Jerry Nadler. It's like she just saw something that she can't ever unsee. But if anybody should be hiding their face, it's her given what she's done to Chicago. But I hope she enjoyed the music. If anything, it drowns out the gunfire. The Times are different. Right now we have health experts sending more mixed messages than an MRI of the president's brain. And the orders are violated by our leaders as quickly as they're given. Yesterday, censorship becomes tomorrow's fact, which I'm good with. I love seeing hypocrites in action. But what you're truly seeing is a division between the power and the powerless, as well as a new fake justice masquerading as action. It used to be that laws were for everyone didn't matter who you are. Not so now, we now have laws and restrictions for the law abiding only. And then no laws at all for those who don't. You can be mandated to do this and do that. But no such efforts are directed at the shoplifters, the looters, the homeless encampments populated in the cities. So, when there's a dramatic surge in crime, the instinct is not to go after the criminal but to create more restrictions for people who already follow them. Imagine a fire alarm when pooled sends the trucks to places that aren't on fire. That is the new strategy here. It's why now with COVID, the powerful make sweeping judgments about Americans who might have good bad or even insane reasons not to be vaccinated or to wear a mask, they mock them, call them stupid call them killers. But they wouldn't dare stand in the way of a man walking out of a Walgreens with enough product to keep Jesse Watters' err standing on end for eternity. They wouldn't dare try to get the transients off the street or they're harassing panhandlers overwhelming the subways. That would take guts. So instead they call you names that they throw a party. It's the Gutfeld golden rule. One enters politics to become immune to the laws one creates for others. But I say if Obama can party, so can we. It's time to be inspired by him and get back to what Americans do best, which is doing whatever the hell you want. And then later if your cat waking up in your neighbor's tool shed.",

Now this debate that Disney Princesses are a problem has been going on for a while now since that epidemic of damsels who refuse to take the stairs. Yes, that's silence Even -- there's even multiple books dedicated to the subject with titles like Cinderella Ate my Daughter and the Princess Problem. Were surprised there's no book called Princess Pool. I almost got it grown. But this latest study finds that kids who were into princesses at age five were more likely at age 10 to hold healthier views about gender roles. And that's important. Said the study's author, \"You'd expect a girl who said her favorite princess was Mulan to be less gender stereotyped than one whose favorite was Cinderella, but we didn't find that.\" So, that's the big news. As for now, the only person destroying the influence of princesses is Meghan Markle. But what happened -- but what happens when these little girls grow up? Maybe the princess influences last longer than we think.",

Just outside of Seattle, citing a rule that bans selling products on public property. What a monster? Why couldn't you take a bus into Seattle and firebomb Starbucks like a normal child? Elsa, who's 7, had been selling lemonade since she was four, meaning she's had a real job for three more years than Joe Biden. Red meat. And also, she donates the profits to charity. Again, what a monster. Neighbors are upset because nothing's been done to address near-by homeless camps despite several complaints. And let's face it, the homeless lemonade sucks. To further prove the point, why a little Elsa and grandpa, grandma we're giving an interview to the local news a naked man walked out of the woods and into the park. And no, I wasn't shooting a movie that day. But seriously, that really happened. I guess, we could show tape that. The mayor of Everett is now responding, saying in part: \"This shouldn't have occurred. Elsa is welcome to my office anytime and invite her to become an honorary park ranger.\" What? Was that easy?

Today, 48 states D.C. allow people to change sex on their birth certificates in 10 states allow for a gender neutral designation, which recognizes gender fluidity and horrible shotgun accidents like the one Jimmy add. If you're confused, you're not alone. Harvard lecturer, Carol Hooven, sparked an online Firestorm by stating biological sex is real and defending terms like pregnant women and male and female. The even nuttier part, the blowback came from her medical colleagues who called her comments false hateful, transphobic, probably racist and fat phobic too, just out of habit. So, is there a difference between biological sex which has clear physical markers and gender which activists say it's a social construct?

It's like what your dad used to do after exiting the bathroom with a can of Lysol. Everything was now under control. Well, the greatest man in the history of the world is back. No, not him. Him. Yes, our former 44th president has given the middle finger to the CDC by inviting over 500 people to his 60th birthday party at his $12 million Martha Vineyard Mansion. It's the beach house of bash that shows America that there's no reason to be worried about COVID or rising sea levels. Yes, climate change and corona are officially dead. According to this news. Although I think my invite got lost in the mail or mixed up with all those love letters for Megan Fox. Apparently, the guests will be wined and dined by over 200 staffers, 200, boy, I bet border patrol in Texas is green with envy. Yes, I wonder how the wall of security at this party would take to a bunch of party goers to showing up demanding to be let in. And I wonder if you bring a kid you'll be letting free just like at our border. Now, Pearl Jam was supposed to play at this party, but now they deny it. That's probably good."

I guess that's how Fauci got his invite. Now, this news comes amid an increase in the Delta variants and the ensuing media panic. A panic, however, that doesn't go near Obama for holding a bass during a pandemic. But I salute him and the message he's sending, which is rather than shut down your lives again, it's time to throw Fauci to the wind, and live your life. Death comes for all of us, whether it's the miniscule risk of a vaccinated person gets from COVID, or the giant risk of getting murdered in Portland. The real challenge isn't simply the virus. It's overcoming those who politicize this in order to divide a country. Too bad there isn't a vaccine to protect us from CNN's misinformation. But based on the ratings, it would take only about 50 doses. I wonder what the angry white male has to say."

Mayor Bowser was photographed maskless at an emergency wedding reception just after reinstating a mask mandate for her city. But can you blame her? It's very hard to breathe wearing a mask while doing the chicken dance. D.C. is currently averaging one COVID death a week. Experts say the city has become so criminally dangerous, even COVID doesn't want to go there. Meanwhile, who was at Lollapalooza, the worst mayor in history if you ignore Bill de Blasio. It's Chicago's Lori Lightfoot. Despite threatening new lockdowns, she's the mayor who always looks like she just walked in on a naked Jerry Nadler. It's like she just saw something that she can't ever unsee. But if anybody should be hiding their face, it's her given what she's done to Chicago. But I hope she enjoyed the music. If anything, it drowns out the gunfire. The Times are different. Right now we have health experts sending more mixed messages than an MRI of the president's brain. And the orders are violated by our leaders as quickly as they're given. Yesterday, censorship becomes tomorrow's fact, which I'm good with. I love seeing hypocrites in action. But what you're truly seeing is a division between the power and the powerless, as well as a new fake justice masquerading as action. It used to be that laws were for everyone didn't matter who you are. Not so now, we now have laws and restrictions for the law abiding only. And then no laws at all for those who don't. You can be mandated to do this and do that. But no such efforts are directed at the shoplifters, the looters, the homeless encampments populated in the cities. So, when there's a dramatic surge in crime, the instinct is not to go after the criminal but to create more restrictions for people who already follow them. Imagine a fire alarm when pooled sends the trucks to places that aren't on fire. That is the new strategy here. It's why now with COVID, the powerful make sweeping judgments about Americans who might have good bad or even insane reasons not to be vaccinated or to wear a mask, they mock them, call them stupid call them killers. But they wouldn't dare stand in the way of a man walking out of a Walgreens with enough product to keep Jesse Watters' err standing on end for eternity. They wouldn't dare try to get the transients off the street or they're harassing panhandlers overwhelming the subways. That would take guts. So instead they call you names that they throw a party. It's the Gutfeld golden rule. One enters politics to become immune to the laws one creates for others. But I say if Obama can party, so can we. It's time to be inspired by him and get back to what Americans do best, which is doing whatever the hell you want. And then later if your cat waking up in your neighbor's tool shed."

Now this debate that Disney Princesses are a problem has been going on for a while now since that epidemic of damsels who refuse to take the stairs. Yes, that's silence Even -- there's even multiple books dedicated to the subject with titles like Cinderella Ate my Daughter and the Princess Problem. Were surprised there's no book called Princess Pool. I almost got it grown. But this latest study finds that kids who were into princesses at age five were more likely at age 10 to hold healthier views about gender roles. And that's important. Said the study's author, \"You'd expect a girl who said her favorite princess was Mulan to be less gender stereotyped than one whose favorite was Cinderella, but we didn't find that.\" So, that's the big news. As for now, the only person destroying the influence of princesses is Meghan Markle. But what happened -- but what happens when these little girls grow up?

Elsa, who's 7, had been selling lemonade since she was four, meaning she's had a real job for three more years than Joe Biden. Red meat. And also, she donates the profits to charity. Again, what a monster. Neighbors are upset because nothing's been done to address near-by homeless camps despite several complaints. And let's face it, the homeless lemonade sucks.

A new resolution distinguishes between the certificate of live birth which gathers info for government statistics and a birth certificate which proves you actually been born and that you're not faking your human like Adam Schiff. Today, 48 states D.C. allow people to change sex on their birth certificates in 10 states allow for a gender neutral designation, which recognizes gender fluidity and horrible shotgun accidents like the one Jimmy add. If you're confused, you're not alone. Harvard lecturer, Carol Hooven, sparked an online Firestorm by stating biological sex is real and defending terms like pregnant women and male and female. The even nuttier part, the blowback came from her medical colleagues who called her comments false hateful, transphobic, probably racist and fat phobic too, just out of habit. So, is there a difference between biological sex which has clear physical markers and gender which activists say it's a social construct? If you want a clear answer, don't as academics, they change their answers like RuPaul changes wigs.

      "utterance": "Tell your lover you care, but always have a spare. A study out of the University of Oklahoma, good for them, home of the fighting fruit bats, found that backburner relationships arising during the pandemic. Isn't everything rising or declining? Almost everyone surveyed said their current relationships were supposed to be exclusive. But 62 percent admitted to keeping someone on the backburner, just in case something bad happens. We call that the Jeffrey Dahrmer. So, it's like their current partner finds out they've been chatting with an ex. So, that's why they changed their mind. See, it's a recursive loop. That said, they were still chatting up their exes, which puts them in a bad mood, even if they didn't hook up again. And unrelated news, Kat was seen outside the University of Oklahoma this weekend screaming, did my husband take this survey? What did he say? I will kill him in his sleep. Which by the way is the best time to kill someone according to Stuart Varney. I don't know why I said Stuart Varney. I liked it. Jimmy, does your wife let you have phone privileges?"

I do think there's value in staying in contact with exes because they often remind you that you made the right choice. Anyone who's ever been in an on again off again relationship, you get back together every six months just to remind yourselves of why you keep breaking up?"

I don't even know he has time for a job. So, like, he certainly doesn't have time to text anyone else, right?"

      "utterance": "No, but you can't talk to -- you can't talk to exes. You can't talk to anything. You're a guy. You're just not allowed to. Your woman can all day. Because they can put people on friend rows and stuff like that. That's where we talk about gender issues is a big gender problem for guys. We don't know how to put people in front row. They end up on deck. You know what I'm saying? So, and that and that doesn't work. That does not work. So, my advice to guys, the answer is: no, never, uh-uh, didn't happen, wouldn't me if it was me. I'm damn sure it wasn't me."

      "utterance": "But it's such a good point. Because the ex it's always, it's the female that often instigates this thing out of the blue and you're going but she would be mad if somebody did that to here."

    {
      "speaker": "TYRUS",
      "utterance": "But women never get blamed for it. We get blamed for it. Your woman cheats on you it's because you weren't there for her. You may feel ugly, so Trent the trainer made her feel beautiful again."

Guys, it hurts, but that's the truth. It's always our fault. Same thing in this situation. The answer is just say no, guys, it's a trap."

      "utterance": "Yes, you know being world famous. It's hard for me to have just a few friends over because a lot of them are celebrities and I have a pool and I'd like to come over but you wouldn't believe who stopped by crashed my party. No invite. Ryan Gosling. Here he is just hanging out. You know, just it's just kind of weird. Like he immediately hits on the women. And it's like he just like gloms onto them and it's really kind of uncomfortable because he's nude. And the woman just has to sit there and deal with you know, his, his hairy parts. It's absolutely disgusting. Holding that like it. But Gosling doesn't care, even in this era of Me Too. He's just out there hanging out. Look at him -- I had to clean the pool. Stuff he did in there was disgusting. I'm out of time. Set your DVRs every night so you never miss an episode.
