As \"The Wall Street Journal\" warned in this foreboding op-ed today, America's 21st century competition with China is likely to be more dangerous and more complex than its old cold war with the Soviet Union.

They cannot credibly argue that they would have a more effective policy on China. Look at Buttigieg basically giving up. If so then the obvious question to them is well, then if you have the answers, like why in eight years in office didn't Obama do any of that stuff? To be fair, though, the Democrats do have a legislative wish list of their own, we have to be fair, but the problem is the policies like government run health care, mass amnesty, banning fossil fuels, would destroy the booming Trump economy that is actually keeping us one step ahead of China now. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So there you have it.

If Trump hadn't come into town, I can tell you what would have happened. This race would probably have been a 10-point race for the Democrats. Again, I want to repeat this for everybody who might be freaking out with -- the Virginia news is terrible. I'm not going to say anything good about what happened in Virginia for conservatives. Not good at all. But in the state of Kentucky, we had a very unpopular in governor, God bless him, but very unpopular. He took on some big fights in the teachers' union, and Trump comes in, and he made this race as competitive as you can possibly make it. That is the power of Donald Trump. So anyone thinking anything differently tonight isn't being honest with the way the electoral map works, or what happened down ballot. And that means every Republican, they won secretary of state, they won auditor, they won comptroller, we had an historic win with an African-American Republican candidate. This is all very good news for Republicans. But Democrats are going to celebrate. Of course, you have to expect that, they're going to celebrate on a night like this any time a Republican governor goes down. Virginia is a completely different story. We're going to have more on that tomorrow, because we are going to unpack what happened in Virginia. It's very similar, in many ways, as to what happened in the state of California. There is some similar factors at play. When we come back, the Last Bite. Stay there.",

Donald Trump Jr. is going to react to that, also, the new Project Veritas video revealing yet another media cover up. Who can his father trust in his own administration? Don Jr. will tell us a head. Also tonight the media thinks testimony released from Ambassador Sondland today provides a smoking gun. As if it's another day, another smoking gun. Intel Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes is here to explain what everyone is ignoring in the actual transcript. And as I said, we are awaiting final election results in multiple states across the country. What did they tell us, if anything, about 2020? Our expert panel will address it all. But first ignoring obvious threats that's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” We've been warning you for weeks that the impeachment craze Democrats are guilty of a dereliction of duty. By dragging the country through another bogus investigation of President Trump, they willfully ignored the most pressing problem facing our country. Tonight, we're going to focus on two stories that should keep every American up at night. The first is just heart-wrenching. Yesterday's mass slaughter of Americans by Mexican drug traffickers they were all shot while driving in the border state of Sonora. Many were burned beyond recognition."

If Mexico needs or request help in cleaning out these monsters United States stands ready, willing, and able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively.\" The Mexican President Obrador was cool on that offer, but I was thinking, maybe Trump should arrange a follow-up call with the President of Mexico, threatening to reduce aid, just to get the Democrats' attention. We know everyone is listening. Now, while the U.S. is breaking records in the stock market and unemployment numbers, Mexico is breaking records of its own for murders.

China's technological arsenal can be just as damaging, as a Soviet missile, we have blackouts, computer viruses, hacking, hacking up transportation systems, the grid all aimed potentially at causing mass chaos and confusion.

All right, anyone else recall their nationwide divest from South African movement in the 1980s? It was really effective. On my college campus, it was a point of constant progress. China on human rights violations, a lot of people think it's like South Africa on steroids, the sheer power and force of China. Think about the mass incarceration of Muslims and brutal crackdown on base human rights and free speech. But most Democrats when it comes to China big money of course, they are shamefully mum. They cannot credibly argue that they would have a more effective policy on China. Look at Buttigieg basically giving up. If so then the obvious question to them is well, then if you have the answers, like why in eight years in office didn't Obama do any of that stuff? To be fair, though, the Democrats do have a legislative wish list of their own, we have to be fair, but the problem is the policies like government run health care, mass amnesty, banning fossil fuels, would destroy the booming Trump economy that is actually keeping us one step ahead of China now. So there you have it. Whether its mass killings and drug trafficking, raging right across our border, are the biggest threat to America's freedom and prosperity that we have ever faced? The Democrats have but one answer. Well, it's kind of two parts a big impeachment, followed by more big government. Cartels and China are watching and that's “The Angle.” Now, as I pointed out in my “Angle,” Trump wants to help Mexico fight the cartels, but his Mexican counterpart doesn't really want it. President Obrador today said \"It's not in agreement with our convictions. The worst thing is war\" this is the same Mexican President by the way, who adopted and \"Hugs not bullets\" policy toward drug cartels that's working out well.

Because just doing nothing is not an option, I don't believe. My niece needs justice. And also, her children, and the other victims, as well, they need justice. It doesn't need to be, you know, they live in Mexico, they accept that risk. I don't buy that. I believe they deserve justice. They are American citizens that live there, and they visit the United States constantly. I'm appreciative that President Trump was willing to reach out to the President of Mexico to try and do something, to at least offer some type of assistance - if they need it, they can't handle this themselves, they need to reach out.

I mean, we've known for decades that they are left leaning but now they've just made it a point to be the marketing wing the total defenders of the loony left and any of the insanity that they will push. It was a big factor in writing the book because I got to see that what both on the campaign trail and frankly as the number to target over the Mueller hoax which again had a lot less credibility than any of these allegations and a lot less actual proof was a lot more shade involved and yet they were able to run with that as though it was gospel. I mean it definitely happened when it didn't happen they just wanted it to have happened because that's their narrative and that's what the DNC told them to run with so they did it blindly."

I know that he is waiting economically. I know he is doing things that are unprecedented, and he is doing it despite unprecedented incoming from the media, form the left, all of this nonsense. This impeachment inquiry is B.S. It started on November 9th, 2016, the second he beat out the anointed one, Hillary Clinton, who was a joke candidate. But he won. \"The Washington Post\" ran their article, the case for impeachment, 19 minutes after he was in office, 19 minutes. These people didn't want to give him a chance, and I see this around the country, Laura. I see people, even Democrats, you know what, I'm a Democrat, but it would be sort of nice if they'd let him do his job. He renegotiated NAFTA. The USMCA is sitting on the desk of Nancy Pelosi --"

And yes, I like Matt Bevin. He's been a friend of mine, he's a good guy, but he has picked a lot of battles. He's teed off on a lot of people in Kentucky, that's not always popular. We understand how that works. But they won't give Trump the credit for that. But this is that same mainstream media that will run with anything. This is the same mainstream media, Laura, that tells me that al-Baghdadi is an austere religious scholar."

So that tells you the warped, the level of sickness that is the leftwing media filter that the regular American people see and they're fed up with it. So I'm not worried about that as a race. I would love to see another governor. I think those are important. Like I said, I think he has done a good job, but Matt Bevin has picked some fights. So this has nothing to do with Trump. Again, they swept the rest of the ticket, they did great in Mississippi, et cetera, et cetera, the other election today. The two really I don't think have that much to do with each other, but again, because you can utilize -- a platform to try to come up -- keep knocking Trump, guys. See how well it worked last time."

However, I presumed the aid had become linked to the proposed anticorruption statement.\" In other words, he was offering something called an opinion to the Ukrainians about why military aid was held up.

Sondland doesn't talk the supposed quid pro quo that they're talking about, this happened like six weeks after the phone call.

I want Zelensky to do the right thing.\" And then what Sondland said is, \"what does that mean? And he said, I want him to do what he ran on.\" Now, Robert, do you see any problem in that -- certainly not surprising that the Democrats would seize on it, is it?"

I don't think that is the case at all. And language like what is likely to occur or what is presumed to be involved here is not sufficient to prove what you would have to prove, under these circumstances, which would be an explicit quid pro quo. So when I hear everybody jumping up and down to say that this is a clear case of bribery, and this is clearly impeachable, and the evidence is overwhelming, I think everybody, again, should take a step back and actually look at what he said.

I think that the Democrats, particularly in the modern era under Trump, have really polarized electorate to the point where they demagogued the president. It's very hard there in the suburban areas for the president to win right around on the capital. Further afield, Republicans and supporters of the president have been told that they are bad people, they're racist, they're bigots, et cetera. I think that is actually driving people towards the president, because this type of polarization, ultimately, does not really work.

We had Matt Bevin, who had about a 32 percent approval rating back in July. Trump comes into town, and Trump gets this thing tied up at 49-49. That's who brought this race this close. If Trump hadn't come into town, I can tell you what would have happened. This race would probably have been a 10-point race for the Democrats. Again, I want to repeat this for everybody who might be freaking out with -- the Virginia news is terrible. I'm not going to say anything good about what happened in Virginia for conservatives. Not good at all. But in the state of Kentucky, we had a very unpopular in governor, God bless him, but very unpopular. He took on some big fights in the teachers' union, and Trump comes in, and he made this race as competitive as you can possibly make it. That is the power of Donald Trump. So anyone thinking anything differently tonight isn't being honest with the way the electoral map works, or what happened down ballot. And that means every Republican, they won secretary of state, they won auditor, they won comptroller, we had an historic win with an African-American Republican candidate. This is all very good news for Republicans. But Democrats are going to celebrate. Of course, you have to expect that, they're going to celebrate on a night like this any time a Republican governor goes down. Virginia is a completely different story. We're going to have more on that tomorrow, because we are going to unpack what happened in Virginia. It's very similar, in many ways, as to what happened in the state of California.
