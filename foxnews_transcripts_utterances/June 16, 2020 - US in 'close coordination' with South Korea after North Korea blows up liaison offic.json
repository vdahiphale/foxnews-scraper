It basically breaks down into three separate initiatives. First is federal incentives to police forces to create credentialing and certification in best practices for the use of force. This would involve Department of Justice grants. And one of the things the president wants to do is limit the use of choke holds -- also information sharing on police officers who have complaints of misconduct, so they can't move from one law enforcement agency to another, and then incorporating social workers into police forces to deal with issues like people who are mentally ill, people who are homeless, domestic calls, things like that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is just the beginning of more to come.

When that fell apart, the South cooperation with the North fell apart, the North took it out on that building in Kaesong. But the larger issue is that it just seems that, for all the talk about denuclearization, the U.S. and North Korea had very different understandings of what that was, and during what, I guess, three meetings that Kim had with President Trump in Singapore and Vietnam, and then once on the demilitarized zone, they never could resolve those differences.",

Imagine if you have worked for 20 to 25 or 30 years to get to retirement, and now you're in this predicament. And so I'm just urging people out there just to not make knee- jerk reactions. This is a time to really breathe carefully, and to have clarity. You want to ask yourself a few questions. What am I invested in? What am I invested in? What's my risk tolerance? And what's my time frame? And, sometimes, we may have to shift some of those expectations right now because of everything that's going on. But it really boils down to three options, right? You can sell, you can hold, or you can shift. And if you sell right now, what you're doing is, is, you're removing the risk of the market, but you're also eliminating yourself from any potential rebound or gain. And if you decide to hold, now what you're saying is, is, I'm going to give myself a chance for the market to be able to rebound, because we all know, once we get a vaccine for this virus, and it gets distributed, we are going to calm down and the market is going to begin to come back. But there could be a shift that's needed, where if you do have enough money put away, you can begin to kind of move away and take less risk with your investments.

This would involve Department of Justice grants. And one of the things the president wants to do is limit the use of choke holds -- also information sharing on police officers who have complaints of misconduct, so they can't move from one law enforcement agency to another, and then incorporating social workers into police forces to deal with issues like people who are mentally ill, people who are homeless, domestic calls, things like that."

No officer should be told that they cannot use a particular use of force in a use of force continuum, especially if they're facing a deadly threat. And that's where the -- that's where everything gets lost in the equation here. And I'm opposed to banning choke holds across the board.

Wall Street was having a grand old day today. And a lot of that was built on you, yes, you. You were shopping like crazy, apparently, in the latest month, so much so that this V-shaped recovery thing that people talk about, it might not be so farfetched -- after this."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, we had a nice day at the corner Wall and Broad, a heady gain here. And a lot of it was built on that number that ain't a typo. For those of you listening, I can tell you that retail sales in the latest period up almost 18 percent. And I can say, if you look it up in the history books, we have never seen a month like it, the biggest monthly jump in history there. Of course, we also came out of the weakest retail sales environment in history, so it stands to reason that we'd see a good bounce-back. But what's interesting about this, and echoing other numbers, is the bounce- back might be happening a tad sooner than expected. Also, consider mortgage applications, a busier homebuying season, bidding wars on properties. There's something going on here. Doesn't Bob NardellirMD-BO_ probably know it, the former Home Depot CEO, former Chrysler CEO, overall corporate smarty-pants. He joins us right now. Bob, always a pleasure. What do you make of some of the data you have been seeing here, because it does seem to confirm this pent-up demand that's out there, once people come out of their homes?"

And I wouldn't want to put a damper on that, but you nailed it. We have been sheltering now for a couple of months. We're all suffering cabin fever. Nothing reduces stress more than shopping and spending, right, and I think also coming off of a very poor month. But, again, I don't want to dampen it. I think this was a very proof-positive sign. I'm also somewhat amazed at this potential V-covery, Neil. I mean, when you look at the market, I really scratch my head and try to figure out why the equities market is doing so well. The Dow is up significantly, not back to where we were at 30000, but certainly climbing back in that direction, Neil."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

I only mention it because he says, you know -- I'm paraphrasing here -- but we're not out of the coronavirus woods just yet. He's concerned about a spike in cases, the fact that things are going to be bumpy around the world. He was stating the obvious. But it was a counter to everything else you saw today. What does he see or fear that maybe we're not?"

So, now he's going to be a stock picker, which, again, must have conveyed it into the market today, again, really strong support by the Fed. And I think he's just concerned at the rate with which this is recovering. He did make a statement, if you will remember, that these rates were going to stay for a long time. He saw no inflation. And maybe his concern, Neil, is that this may generate a little bit of inflation, which, of course, a couple of years ago, he put in four increases, and then had to back them off. So, we will have to see how he handles this potential recovery. The other thing I think we have got to watch very closely, Neil, is the second quarter earnings, when we get -- come out of the second quarter and we start to see earnings results.

Well, because we were all sheltered (AUDIO GAP) social distancing really had a positive impact. None of us should be surprised that, once we open the gates and we get out there, that we're going to see a level of -- level of spikes return, not to the degree we saw originally, I hope.

We have been tracking North Korea for four years, and something special, North Korea actually blowing up one of its own facilities in North Korea, as you say, to make a point. The explosion and the plume of the smoke could be seen from South Korea. It happened in the North Korean town of Kaesong. That's just a few miles north of the DMZ. The regime thanking area miners probably for their explosives. Now, the building had huge symbolic value. It was opened in 2018, when diplomacy was warming up between North and South Korea and the United States. It's called the Inter-Korean Liaison Office to facilitate ties. It hasn't been used much in recent months. In fact, it has been closed since January due to COVID-19 concerns. Nobody was apparently inside. And the move was publicly previewed -- this is also very interesting -- over the weekend by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's sister Kim Yo-jong. She's been taking the lead on Pyongyang's aggressive -- aggressive relations with Seoul and assuming a bit more power lately. Experts tell us that the North's tough actions mostly due to disappointment that South Korea is not delivering on business deals desperately needed by the North to help its absolutely struggling economy. Now, none of this helps the Trump administration's efforts to rein in Kim's nuclear and missile programs. They also announced today the North is planning to move more military towards the DMZ and recently said it would bolster its efforts to strengthen its nuclear deterrence. Neil, the State Department weighing in today, saying it supports South Korea's efforts and -- get this -- urges North Korea to -- here's a quote - - \"refrain from further counterproductive activities.\" Now, that's counterproductive -- back to you, Neil."

Of course, you know him as the host of \"FOX News Sunday,\" much, much more, but author of a great book, \"Countdown 1945.\" I want to get into that with you, Chris. But I also, since we're talking about nuclear and everything else that set the stage for the end of World War II, and I'm looking at the North Koreans, obviously, you know, sort of champing at the bit here to do something or get talks back on, or they, darn it, will get going nuclear, where do you think this is going? Is the bloom off the rose between the president and Kim Jong-un? How seriously should we be taking this? What do you think? CHRIS WALLACE, HOST, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\": Yes, I -- and, certainly, the negotiations, the Trump-Kim negotiations -- and I remember going halfway around the world to Singapore for the first round of them -- seems to basically have collapsed. And part of the reason that the North Koreans are taking it out on the South Koreans is that the South Koreans had talked about more economic cooperation, and even some -- sending some South Koreans, allowing them to go to some resorts in North Korea, but it was contingent upon progress towards denuclearization. When that fell apart, the South cooperation with the North fell apart, the North took it out on that building in Kaesong. But the larger issue is that it just seems that, for all the talk about denuclearization, the U.S. and North Korea had very different understandings of what that was, and during what, I guess, three meetings that Kim had with President Trump in Singapore and Vietnam, and then once on the demilitarized zone, they never could resolve those differences."

But the fact of the matter is that that was the start of the nuclear age, at least -- even Truman himself was not aware of it, taking office after the death of FDR. And the 116 days, it refers to that point, to the actual Hiroshima bomb. But the one thing that came up and I wanted to get a sense of with you, how is it possible that a vice president of the United States is that much out of the loop that he wouldn't be informed of something as major as that? I mean, FDR had been sickly for the better part of a year-and-a-half prior to that, extremely bad in the last few months.

And Democratic Party leaders thought Wallace was too far to the left, too much of a socialist. And they were very concerned that Roosevelt would not survive a fourth term and that the vice president would then be president. And they didn't want Henry Wallace in that position. Roosevelt didn't care, because, as far as he was concerned, he was going to live forever, and certainly through the end of World War II, so he didn't pay much attention. In fact, remarkably enough, Roosevelt -- rather, Truman had been vice president for 82 days when Roosevelt died.

Chris Wallace, \"Countdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days That Changed the World.\" That is an understatement. We will have a lot more after this, including how those guys up in the space station are doing, you know the two ones that we launched into orbit for the first time in a decade, no longer hitching rides with the Russians? Meet them next. We have two astronauts now joining three others on the International Space Station. The fact is, we got there of our own means, though, didn't have to hitch a ride with the Russians, as you know, thanks to SpaceX and, of course, the Dragon capsule.

So, from our perspective, it's actually kind of sparsely populated, as far as space stations go, compared to our previous experience. They're able to deconflict things pretty well, so we can do our task in different modules, so we're not right on top of each other for the science activities or stowage activities or even the EVA preparations.

The International Space Station has a lot of things that need to be done up here. And we're able to help with that, as you mentioned, with some space walks. We are going to do at least two starting next week. Bob and Chris will go outside and replace some aging batteries on the starboard side of the space station. And so I think it's great that we can contribute to the mission up here, as well as continue to get time in orbit for Dragon, which I also believe is important, since the next crew coming up here will likely be up here a full-duration flight closer to six months.

It's not just a single event that you can accomplish and then be selected to be an astronaut. It's a -- it's an education of excellence. It's a career of excellence. Then -- and folks are selected from that group. And so really focus on trying to be excellent at what you're doing right now. And, of course, education is a is a critical piece of that. And so both Doug and I, I know, can look back at our younger years and find things in science or mathematics that inspired us to continue our educations, inspired us to go into engineering fields, and inspired us to eventually go into the military to fly or work on airplanes, and then on to be astronauts.

And, today, the Travis County commissioners voted on an ordinance that would require face masks at dedicated county facilities. And those who don't comply could be charged with criminal trespassing.

And late word this afternoon in Tulsa, the site of President Trump's first rally since the pandemic began, which is going to be held on Saturday, as you know. Health officials they're urging the elderly, people with compromised immune systems to maybe go ahead and stay home. And those who will attend, health officials are urging them to comply with the temperature checks that are going to be held at the venues' doors, and also try to social distance as much as possible, wear a face mask, and sanitize your hands as much as possible -- Neil."

      "utterance": "Imagine you are all set for retirement, you got your paperwork in order, everything in order. You think you got the right savings. Then the whole virus hits. And then you go through this whipsawing in the markets. Even if you're back to where you were, you start wondering, where am I going to go? Enter Chris Hogan, Ramsey Solutions, multiple bestselling author, famous for getting in the mind-set of millionaires. Chris, what do they do? I mean, a lot of them right now are saying, you know, I'm not so sure this is the time to pack it in. What do you tell them?"

      "utterance": "Well, Neil, the first thing I want to advise them is to understand that this has a been a very trying time, these last few months. And people are scared, and they're nervous. Imagine if you have worked for 20 to 25 or 30 years to get to retirement, and now you're in this predicament. And so I'm just urging people out there just to not make knee- jerk reactions. This is a time to really breathe carefully, and to have clarity. You want to ask yourself a few questions. What am I invested in? What am I invested in? What's my risk tolerance? And what's my time frame? And, sometimes, we may have to shift some of those expectations right now because of everything that's going on. But it really boils down to three options, right? You can sell, you can hold, or you can shift. And if you sell right now, what you're doing is, is, you're removing the risk of the market, but you're also eliminating yourself from any potential rebound or gain. And if you decide to hold, now what you're saying is, is, I'm going to give myself a chance for the market to be able to rebound, because we all know, once we get a vaccine for this virus, and it gets distributed, we are going to calm down and the market is going to begin to come back. But there could be a shift that's needed, where if you do have enough money put away, you can begin to kind of move away and take less risk with your investments. But studies show, by SimplyWise, Neil, 40 percent of Americans don't believe that they're ever going to retire. So, growth is necessary, which means we have got to be in the market."

      "utterance": "So, having said that, I think a lot of people underestimate how much income they're going to need in retirement. I know the rule, oh, I can do a third or half what I normally make. But many of them quarantined in their homes have to come to discover, you know, still spending a lot of money. And then maybe they have to adjust, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, they're going to have to make adjustments. We can look at our lives right now, Neil. We know the time where we spend the most money. It's weekends. When you have more downtime, that's when we tend to spend. Well, if you make it to retirement, your life is a weekend now. You have got options in front of you."

But we have got to be able to be grown up enough, Neil, to tell a want that it needs to wait. And so it really boils down to being in tune, but getting the proper guidance, but also believing in ourselves. We have worked so hard throughout our careers. I want people to have more options later. So, don't throw in the towel right now. We need to make some adjustments, but keep your eyes on the prize. We have got to stay focused and not finished."

All right, in the meantime, Hoboken, New Jersey, right now, looking live there, where they're allowing outdoor dining here, but not everyone's biting. Kristina Partsinevelos following that phenomenon in Hoboken, New Jersey. Kristina, what's going on?"

But I am standing right now on what is called -- I have learned a new word -- a parklet. They're taking over parking spots in order to provide outdoor dining. We know the restaurant industry has been devastated as of late. I spoke to one owner, who talked about how you have to get creative in order to stay open. Listen in."

And, already, 3 percent of businesses have shut down. These are restaurant-owned businesses. We're expecting that number to increase once government statistics have come out. But, Neil, I want to showcase just right now where I am. I'm in Hoboken. There's a family right here. And it's just normal to see just chairs, right, and tables out on the sidewalk. This is what we're talking about, creativity. But like you mentioned out from the top of the hit, it's all about whether healthy customers are going to feel comfortable coming back out. Could set a precedence for New York City -- back to you, Neil."

Again, at the corner of Wall and Broad, they're letting the worries like this sort of ease back here. And they're optimistic that things will pick up, including for those restaurants, so I guess some bullish food for thought. See what I did there? Food for thought."
