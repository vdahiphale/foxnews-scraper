Now he seeks a big turnout in the rural vote, and he has secured the support of nine Democrat mayors in the Iron Range area. There you see Air Force One landing on the tarmac there. So, the suburbs - in the suburbs though in 2018, there were two Trump districts that turned blue in 2018. So, as you can see this is shaping up to be a pretty fierce battle for Minnesota. Minnesota of course is also ground zero in the fight over police brutality after George Floyd died in Minneapolis triggering months of protests and violence that still grips the country. Homicides are up 90 percent in Minneapolis. And arson is up 80 percent from 2019. It was in Minnesota that the City Council began the defund the police movement.

I have lost 30 percent of my street officers since the end of May. A potential cadet class stated for January of 2020 was also eliminated. Reinforcements aren't coming any time soon.

They've canceled the class that was supposed to start in 2021 and it takes about a year to get an officer on the street. So, if you're losing 150 to 200 officers, where are the replacements. Again, I go back to - this is an absolute failure of leadership at the city level to realize what they're up against. And the problem is only going to get worse and you pointed the crime. The crime is through the roof, but nobody is talking about it. The mainstream media is not covering it. And the streets of Minneapolis are starting to look like a war zone. I was just downtown earlier this week. You have businesses that are boarded up. Nobody is there.

I think that the truth of the matter here is what needs to happen now more than any time before is everybody needs to come to the table and figure out how do we create a meaningful solution to deal with the fact that there's a breakdown in trust in communities of color when it comes to policing. And now police are feeling this sort of pressure of how am I able to do my job? I think the place where you see this happening most poignantly is in Louisville, right. The Breanna Taylor family and what they did in that settlement was actually quite powerful. And it was actually something that we should all aspire to. They brought all the parties to the table and they said, how can we make this better? So, now cops not only have to wear body cameras, they're forced to turn them on. They're hiring more mental health care professionals. So, when their mental health calls, there's actually somebody who's who spends years and years training on how to de-escalate those situations. On top of that, they're incentivizing police to live in the communities where they work, all steps to work on pushing that reset button--",

I agree with Richard and I don't agree with a lot of things that he says. But I think you've got to look back at where the problem started, and you've got to hold some people accountable. Why are we not holding them accountable? If this had been Republicans doing this, everyone would be up in arms. But no, its Democratic leadership starting from over 17 years. When that man kneeled on George Floyd's neck, he had so many violations behind him, any of us would have been fired from our jobs. But no, the Democratic leadership, the attorney general's offices, even Senator Amy Klobuchar, all of them overlooked all of these discrepancies through the police department where they were mistreating people of color. So, let's start looking at the actual cities, the police chiefs and the folks who are really at fault here. And let's start holding folks accountable, just like every other American is held accountable in their job. These are elected officials and elected officials have a job to do in this nation. And we can't just point back at protesters in this and that. We have to look at root cause. We have root causes across our nation, and they start with spirituality. They start with when you go into the same neighborhoods across Minneapolis, they're pulling God out of the schools. Yes, fatherlessness that's rising. You have a double. The crime rate has double when it comes to murders. The crime rate has almost doubled when this comes to shootings. This is ridiculous. We have to take a stand in our nation and save our streets and get law and order back. But most importantly, get godly order, get the rule of law, and get people with the fear of God back in them.",

Right. And when a pastor in many communities can walk out of his church with a suit on and be treated with respect, that same pastor when he has a hoodie on or sweatpants on, is treated as a threat. And I'm not making this up because the polling says that. A recent Gallup poll found that one in five African Americans feel that when they interact with police, they're treated with courtesy, respect, and dignity. And we've got to turn that around and turning that around starts with everybody engaging in the conversation. And that means if it's a national problem, where is the Department of Justice? Where is that level of oversight coming into these police departments saying your policies and practices are not as good as they should be, they're not up to the standards of what America should be, they're not up to the standards to what law and order should be in this country, which means fair law and fair order for everybody.

There are three teenagers that were killed in recent weeks in Minneapolis.

There has to be some accountability there, too. And we can't keep these things mutually exclusive. We have to have the broad conversation and talk about the root cause. And the root cause is fatherlessness. I keep saying it. You're 20 times more likely to go to prison and have a run in with the law enforcement if you're fatherless. The people we see, the reason why these police officers are scared and people like myself don't want to be police officers. And most people who have something to say, most pundits don't want to go into these same streets and police them. And I'm a black man. I have black kids. And, yes, I wear baseball caps and I wear sweats and everything else, too. But when a police officer pulls me over, I don't talk smack to them. I say, Yes, sir, no, sir. And I respect authority. These are the same things that are happening in our schools. We have kids that don't respect their teachers because we put fathers out of the homes and we've we did everything we can to water down masculinity across America. We need to get Jesus Christ back into our schools, back into our society. It's the only thing that can solve our racial divide. The Bible doesn't talk about race, that's manmade. This is a spiritual battle that we cannot fight with flesh and blood. We need to get back to the blood of Jesus and the word of God.

I've stood on the docks in Duluth seeing the taconite pellets go on the boats to the Great Lakes, out to the steel mills. And what Donald Trump is going to do is also turn that into the copper range, the nickel range, the palladium range, the cobalt range. He's going to make logging great again in that state. And you're going to see that whole eastern part of Minnesota go strongly for Trump. In Minneapolis, you've got 3M making all our N-95 masks and you've got the USMCA helping farmers in Minnesota and Jack Brewer for mayor, by the way.",

We're going to win Minnesota because they did nothing for Minnesota except close up that beautiful iron ore territory, they closed it up with a pen. Do you remember that one day, you didn't have your jobs? Then I came along, and I opened it up. So that's critical. But I'm thrilled to be here with the beautiful, great, hardworking people of this incredible state. You're really hardworking American patriots that what you are. And a lot of people haven't been treated right until I came along, and we've done a lot of work and a lot of good work. And you had your best year ever last year. The state had the best year. 46 days from now, we're going to win Minnesota and we're going to win four more years in the White House. One of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees, you know it, you know it perhaps better than almost anybody. Lots of luck. You're having a good time with the refugees? That's good. We want to have Omar. He said, Omar, that's a beauty. How the hell did she win the election? How did she win? It's unbelievable, every family in Minnesota needs to know about Sleepy Joe Biden's extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet. That's what's happened, and you like Omar, don't you? Biden has promised a 700 percent increase in the manifesto with Bernie, right? A 700 percent increase in the importation of refugees from the most dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria, and Somalia. Congratulations, Minnesota. A 700 percent increase. Good luck, Minnesota. Enjoy yourselves. Because if I'm not here, if I don't win, I don't know where I'm going to be. But maybe I'll come over to see, Mike. I'll come and see, Mike. Your state will be overrun and destroyed if Biden and the radical Left win. That's what's going to happen. I've been watching it for years. They haven't treated you right. They have not treated Minnesota right. Thank you. I'll tell you; these hangars are great. Remember this, it's a friendly protest, please remember, this is not a rally. You're not allowed to have political rallies of any kind. You're not allowed to go to church. You're not allowed to do anything. The only thing you're allowed to do is run wild through the streets, burn down storefronts, blow up stores and kill people because that's considered a protest. And yet they allow you to have - you don't have to wear masks at protest. So, I said, we can't have a rally. The most we can have is 10 people. But why don't we just go on a protest? Because this is a protest. It's a protest against stupidity. And speaking about stupidity, Sleepy Joe will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp, think of it, 700 percent increase. So, you're not happy now? Look at that guy over there. He's not too thrilled when he hears this. 700 percent increase is what they have in the manifesto, now maybe they don't honor it. But I would say they'll go substantially higher than that number. Biden will overwhelm your children's schools, overcrowd their classrooms, and inundate your hospitals. It'll happen. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban. Jihadist regions, Jihadist regions. They've already been doing that to you, haven't they? Opening the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorists. My administration is keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals the hell out of our country. We don't want them. We've got enough of them. We've got enough of them. Just today, we deported, as you know very well, dozens of Somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes, including rape, assault, robbery, terrorism, and murder of course. These hardened criminals are back in their country where they can do all the complaining they want. And your children are much safer as a result. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you. If it were up to Biden, and it's not it's the people that surround him, they are seriously radical Left Democrats and they're very dangerous and the offenders are very dangerous. And they'd be running all over your state only by voting for me. Are you going to say, but I hate to say this? I did it with your iron ore. I did it with some other things, and I'll do it for you again. I'll do it for you again, but if you vote for me, I'm the difference and I'm the wall, you know the wall that we're building on the southern border. I'm your wall between the American dream and chaos. Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the Left-wing mob. He has no clue where he is. This is not a sharp guy. Years ago, I said to a certain senator who I was very friendly with a Democrat who is the dumbest senator, who's the smartest senator? He gave me a name for the smartest. I said, who's the dumbest? Joe Biden. You didn't know that? That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. This is no longer prime time for Sleepy Joe. And they do disinformation, they make things up and they make commercials, they make things up, I've never seen anything like it. Everything they make up. First of all, I'm the one protecting your Social Security. They say Trump, remember four years ago, they used to say, Trump will get rid of social, I have protected your Social Security. They're going to destroy your Social Security. Another thing, Big Ten football, did I do a good job? Your team better do well, you're on the spot. They better do well. Are they're going to do well this year? I think so, right. And I brought it back, but I saw that, you know, what I did it actually, it sort of energized me. Sleepy Joe did it that I was against football, that I was against Big Ten football. Give me a break. I was against it. When I saw the ad, I said, what's the problem with Big Ten football? They said they're not going to open, why? And they say some stupid reason. I said, these are strong young people. They're going to do great. Let's get going. I called the commissioner, Kevin, good guy. And we sort of started something and we got it rolling. We had big opposition from a few of the Democrat states and governors, but we rolled over the opposition. And you have Big Ten football. Congratulations, congratulations. When the Far-Left rioters rampage across Minneapolis and they rampage across your state, how about your police department? Let's just run for your lives and it's not their fault, they were told to do that. You have a good police department, you have good police, but they're not allowed to do their job. They're not allowed to do their job. Remember that, they were told to leave the precinct, leave it, and then they knocked the hell out of that precinct, and they had a great mayor, great mayor, it's a real power. Remember, did you ever hear of a man, Fiorello LaGuardia? Did you ever - I don't think that happened with him. New York. I don't think it happened with Rudy Giuliani. Did it? What a great job. Rudy did. You realize, Rudy just now really being appreciated. People forgot how good he was as a man. He was a great man. Joe Biden called the peaceful protesters. He said these are peaceful protesters as opposed to sending in the National Guard, they didn't want the National Guard, Joe Biden said you shouldn't send the National Guard and this went on day after day after day. I pushed and I got it approved. The National Guard and it ended within what would you say, a half-hour?",

I remember being struck by the death of her husband. They were extremely close. And just devoted to each other and when he passed away a few years ago, I was in court the next day and I was stunned to see her there. But she was so devoted to the court, to her job there, to her life's work there. She was dedicated and she was not going to let anything stop her. She had long said when people would nudge her or push her into retirement and try to suggest she would say nope, as long as I feel like I can do this job mentally and physically, I'm going to keep doing this job and that's what she did years and years and years. She was the second female appointed to the Supreme Court. She has had such an enormous impact, it's hard to overstate it at this point. It is a shock tonight because she has overcome so much in her life and been so incredibly strong. And she's had prayers from around the world, as she has gone public and she is one of the justices who has been very open and honest with us. As member of the press corps covering the Supreme Court, each time that she was hospitalized or had an issue, she wasn't somebody that tried to hide it from us. She was public in sharing these different struggles that she had. And so, we knew a lot of what was going on, there was a lot of talk with her last time with the recurrence of cancer about her ability to continue to fight. And she had said she was undergoing chemo and that was going well. This was just a matter of weeks ago, she felt hopeful about that. So obviously in these last few days and weeks, she did privately come to terms, I can only assume, and with her family about the fact -- you know, the fact that her life was coming to a close, we're told she was surrounded by her family tonight, they were with her. She's got two children and several grandchildren, and she was incredibly devoted to them too, and so very, very proud of them. She just spoke glowing of her family and she had shared over the years about what it was like to be a young woman in law school. During the time that she was in law school and how she was expected to juggle things with a husband and with children eventually and that she was treated differently in those days when she was coming out of school, one of the top graduates. And yet, being viewed by some employers as somebody who might be a liability because she was a woman who valued her family, her marriage, and her kids and she blazed a path. And she was somebody who showed us that you could be incredibly committed to your professional life, to fighting fights that to her were exceptionally important and to raising a family as well. So, it is a shock to the system tonight because she has done so well in rallying so many past, you know, past difficulties but we know that, we're told she was at peace with her family. And that is the news tonight, at 87 years old that she has passed away.",

And then as you say, being so, you know, she struck such a great balance, I think, in terms of being human and also being this great legal mind and someone that so many people looked up to. And the other thing that I think of when you mentioned in your piece, that she shared her love of opera with Antonin Scalia is that the camaraderie on the court and how well respected she was by all of the members of the court.

Also, one of those nights the shocking news that we got that he was gone that they had such a friendship, that they bonded over all kinds of different things. They enjoy spending time together. They are families together. They could not have been more opposed on, as you said, the way that they viewed interpretation of the Constitution and many of the key critical decisions that came down from the court, and yet, in the midst of that they were able to forge this very genuine, very close friendship over things that they did have in common. And you know, the justices have lunch together on a regular basis and one of the things is, they don't talk politics, they don't talk about the cases, they talk about their grandkids and opera and travel and the things that do bond them. And a lot of people saw the two of them as an odd couple. They made no apologies for it, they were very close and it was a beautiful thing to see that you could be so opposed ideologically on a number of key issues and yet, have a genuine affection and love for each other.",

Her, as Shannon was just saying, her best friend on the court was Antonin Scalia, someone she almost never joined in opinions with, disagreed, they had vigorous discussions about weighty issues, and yet, they managed to love opera together and love each other.

I would be shocked if Senate Republic -- if Donald Trump didn't nominate somebody to replace her and if the Senate Republicans didn't confirm that person before the end of the -- before the end of this term and probably before the election. I interviewed Senator McConnell in 2018 about this and I asked him specifically if another Supreme Court justice vacancy came up during an election year, would you confirm them? And he said that absolutely yes. He said that if the rule is, McConnell rule, is that, if the Senate is of the different party than a president and a vacancy occur in the presidential election year it doesn't get filled. That's what happened with Merrick Garland. I guarantee you, Martha, that if President Obama had a Democratic Senate in that -- at that time, he would've confirmed Merrick Garland and Merrick Garland would be on the Supreme Court today. President Trump has just recently put out a new list of candidates and because he's gone through this twice now, according to people on, he's vetted a lot of people who came very close to getting picked, so it should not take them very long to put somebody forward. And because the Democrats made the mistake back in 2014 of getting rid of judicial filibuster and then filibustered Neil Gorsuch who was supremely qualified for the Supreme Court out of anger over Merrick Garland, they created a situation where Republicans only need a simple majority. So, I would -- I would say the likelihood is that her replacement will be put forward by the president and confirmed by the Senate in pretty short order.",

Minnesota of course is also ground zero in the fight over police brutality after George Floyd died in Minneapolis triggering months of protests and violence that still grips the country. Homicides are up 90 percent in Minneapolis. And arson is up 80 percent from 2019. It was in Minnesota that the City Council began the defund the police movement.

And this is the email that he got back from the third precinct inspector - excuse me, Sean McGinty. As far as a long-term plan, I don't have one. I have lost 30 percent of my street officers since the end of May. A potential cadet class stated for January of 2020 was also eliminated. Reinforcements aren't coming any time soon. We are doing everything we can with what we have. What kind of exodus is this producing both in the police precincts and also in the neighborhoods, sir?"

They've canceled the class that was supposed to start in 2021 and it takes about a year to get an officer on the street. So, if you're losing 150 to 200 officers, where are the replacements. Again, I go back to - this is an absolute failure of leadership at the city level to realize what they're up against. And the problem is only going to get worse and you pointed the crime. The crime is through the roof, but nobody is talking about it. The mainstream media is not covering it. And the streets of Minneapolis are starting to look like a war zone. I was just downtown earlier this week. You have businesses that are boarded up. Nobody is there. And again, nobody is talking about the reality of what is happening with crime and what is happening at a staffing level at the Minneapolis Police Department. It's absolutely sad.

And now police are feeling this sort of pressure of how am I able to do my job? I think the place where you see this happening most poignantly is in Louisville, right. The Breanna Taylor family and what they did in that settlement was actually quite powerful. And it was actually something that we should all aspire to. They brought all the parties to the table and they said, how can we make this better? So, now cops not only have to wear body cameras, they're forced to turn them on. They're hiring more mental health care professionals. So, when their mental health calls, there's actually somebody who's who spends years and years training on how to de-escalate those situations. On top of that, they're incentivizing police to live in the communities where they work, all steps to work on pushing that reset button--"

We got to this pressure point because there's been a long call for police reform in this country and that call has gone unanswered. So, peaceful protesters took to the streets and demanded that. And folks and provocateurs and whatever you want to call them, used those peaceful protesters voices and their stage to create havoc in the streets. And that has to stop.

I agree with Richard and I don't agree with a lot of things that he says. But I think you've got to look back at where the problem started, and you've got to hold some people accountable. Why are we not holding them accountable? If this had been Republicans doing this, everyone would be up in arms. But no, its Democratic leadership starting from over 17 years. When that man kneeled on George Floyd's neck, he had so many violations behind him, any of us would have been fired from our jobs. But no, the Democratic leadership, the attorney general's offices, even Senator Amy Klobuchar, all of them overlooked all of these discrepancies through the police department where they were mistreating people of color. So, let's start looking at the actual cities, the police chiefs and the folks who are really at fault here. And let's start holding folks accountable, just like every other American is held accountable in their job. These are elected officials and elected officials have a job to do in this nation. And we can't just point back at protesters in this and that. We have to look at root cause. We have root causes across our nation, and they start with spirituality. They start with when you go into the same neighborhoods across Minneapolis, they're pulling God out of the schools. Yes, fatherlessness that's rising. You have a double. The crime rate has double when it comes to murders. The crime rate has almost doubled when this comes to shootings. This is ridiculous. We have to take a stand in our nation and save our streets and get law and order back. But most importantly, get godly order, get the rule of law, and get people with the fear of God back in them."

Right. And when a pastor in many communities can walk out of his church with a suit on and be treated with respect, that same pastor when he has a hoodie on or sweatpants on, is treated as a threat. And I'm not making this up because the polling says that. A recent Gallup poll found that one in five African Americans feel that when they interact with police, they're treated with courtesy, respect, and dignity. And we've got to turn that around and turning that around starts with everybody engaging in the conversation. And that means if it's a national problem, where is the Department of Justice? Where is that level of oversight coming into these police departments saying your policies and practices are not as good as they should be, they're not up to the standards of what America should be, they're not up to the standards to what law and order should be in this country, which means fair law and fair order for everybody.

There are three teenagers that were killed in recent weeks in Minneapolis. So, I think we need to have the broader conversation and to understand that that when black lives matter, those black lives need to matter, too.

But at the same time, you can't expect police to go into these communities where we have war in the streets, where you have hundreds of black men shooting at each other every weekend. There has to be some accountability there, too. And we can't keep these things mutually exclusive. We have to have the broad conversation and talk about the root cause. And the root cause is fatherlessness. I keep saying it. You're 20 times more likely to go to prison and have a run in with the law enforcement if you're fatherless. The people we see, the reason why these police officers are scared and people like myself don't want to be police officers. And most people who have something to say, most pundits don't want to go into these same streets and police them. And I'm a black man. I have black kids. And, yes, I wear baseball caps and I wear sweats and everything else, too. But when a police officer pulls me over, I don't talk smack to them. I say, Yes, sir, no, sir. And I respect authority. These are the same things that are happening in our schools. We have kids that don't respect their teachers because we put fathers out of the homes and we've we did everything we can to water down masculinity across America. We need to get Jesus Christ back into our schools, back into our society. It's the only thing that can solve our racial divide. The Bible doesn't talk about race, that's manmade. This is a spiritual battle that we cannot fight with flesh and blood. We need to get back to the blood of Jesus and the word of God. And Martha, thanks for having me on this show to be able to talk about this, because these issues have come to a boiling point in our nation.

As you can see, everybody at home, the president is deplaning Air Force One and getting ready to speak to the crowd. He lost this state of Minnesota in 2016 by less than two points. Tonight, he is in Beltrami County, which is a county that he won. And he hopes, of course, that he will win again. All of both candidates hope that they're going to win back the places that were won before and to expand. And that's why you saw both candidates, Joe Biden, and President Trump, in the state today. President Trump. Look at that from 2016. So basically, every single one of those rural counties was red, but he lost the state, the population centers obviously, Minneapolis, St. Paul. And then you've got that northeastern area, which is the Iron Range section of Minneapolis, which is such a huge focus of this part of the election when you look at Minneapolis. So, he's vowing to make the country, the manufacturing superpower of the world, to open up mining in that area, to end reliance on China.

I didn't know. I didn't think he knew where it was. But let me tell you, Martha, why Donald Trump is going to win this state. The steel and aluminum tariffs, which Joe Biden opposes, basically have a renaissance in the Mesabi Iron Range. I've stood on the docks in Duluth seeing the taconite pellets go on the boats to the Great Lakes, out to the steel mills. And what Donald Trump is going to do is also turn that into the copper range, the nickel range, the palladium range, the cobalt range. He's going to make logging great again in that state.

We're going to win Minnesota because they did nothing for Minnesota except close up that beautiful iron ore territory, they closed it up with a pen. Do you remember that one day, you didn't have your jobs? Then I came along, and I opened it up. So that's critical. But I'm thrilled to be here with the beautiful, great, hardworking people of this incredible state. You're really hardworking American patriots that what you are. And a lot of people haven't been treated right until I came along, and we've done a lot of work and a lot of good work. And you had your best year ever last year. The state had the best year. 46 days from now, we're going to win Minnesota and we're going to win four more years in the White House. One of the most vital issues in this election is the subject of refugees, you know it, you know it perhaps better than almost anybody. Lots of luck. You're having a good time with the refugees? That's good. We want to have Omar. He said, Omar, that's a beauty. How the hell did she win the election? How did she win? It's unbelievable, every family in Minnesota needs to know about Sleepy Joe Biden's extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet. That's what's happened, and you like Omar, don't you? Biden has promised a 700 percent increase in the manifesto with Bernie, right? A 700 percent increase in the importation of refugees from the most dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria, and Somalia. Congratulations, Minnesota. A 700 percent increase. Good luck, Minnesota. Enjoy yourselves. Because if I'm not here, if I don't win, I don't know where I'm going to be. But maybe I'll come over to see, Mike. I'll come and see, Mike. Your state will be overrun and destroyed if Biden and the radical Left win. That's what's going to happen. I've been watching it for years. They haven't treated you right. They have not treated Minnesota right. Thank you. I'll tell you; these hangars are great. Remember this, it's a friendly protest, please remember, this is not a rally. You're not allowed to have political rallies of any kind. You're not allowed to go to church. You're not allowed to do anything. The only thing you're allowed to do is run wild through the streets, burn down storefronts, blow up stores and kill people because that's considered a protest. And yet they allow you to have - you don't have to wear masks at protest. So, I said, we can't have a rally. The most we can have is 10 people. But why don't we just go on a protest? Because this is a protest. It's a protest against stupidity. And speaking about stupidity, Sleepy Joe will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp, think of it, 700 percent increase. So, you're not happy now? Look at that guy over there. He's not too thrilled when he hears this. 700 percent increase is what they have in the manifesto, now maybe they don't honor it. But I would say they'll go substantially higher than that number. Biden will overwhelm your children's schools, overcrowd their classrooms, and inundate your hospitals. It'll happen. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban. Jihadist regions, Jihadist regions. They've already been doing that to you, haven't they? Opening the floodgates to radical Islamic terrorists. My administration is keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals the hell out of our country. We don't want them. We've got enough of them. We've got enough of them. Just today, we deported, as you know very well, dozens of Somali nationals charged or convicted with very grave crimes, including rape, assault, robbery, terrorism, and murder of course. These hardened criminals are back in their country where they can do all the complaining they want. And your children are much safer as a result. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you. If it were up to Biden, and it's not it's the people that surround him, they are seriously radical Left Democrats and they're very dangerous and the offenders are very dangerous. And they'd be running all over your state only by voting for me. Are you going to say, but I hate to say this? I did it with your iron ore. I did it with some other things, and I'll do it for you again. I'll do it for you again, but if you vote for me, I'm the difference and I'm the wall, you know the wall that we're building on the southern border. I'm your wall between the American dream and chaos. Joe Biden is wholly owned and controlled by the Left-wing mob. He has no clue where he is. This is not a sharp guy. Years ago, I said to a certain senator who I was very friendly with a Democrat who is the dumbest senator, who's the smartest senator? He gave me a name for the smartest. I said, who's the dumbest? Joe Biden. You didn't know that? That was 25 years ago. That was in prime time. This is no longer prime time for Sleepy Joe. And they do disinformation, they make things up and they make commercials, they make things up, I've never seen anything like it. Everything they make up. First of all, I'm the one protecting your Social Security. They say Trump, remember four years ago, they used to say, Trump will get rid of social, I have protected your Social Security. They're going to destroy your Social Security. Another thing, Big Ten football, did I do a good job? Your team better do well, you're on the spot. They better do well. Are they're going to do well this year? I think so, right. And I brought it back, but I saw that, you know, what I did it actually, it sort of energized me. Sleepy Joe did it that I was against football, that I was against Big Ten football. Give me a break. I was against it. When I saw the ad, I said, what's the problem with Big Ten football? They said they're not going to open, why? And they say some stupid reason. I said, these are strong young people. They're going to do great. Let's get going. I called the commissioner, Kevin, good guy. And we sort of started something and we got it rolling. We had big opposition from a few of the Democrat states and governors, but we rolled over the opposition. And you have Big Ten football. Congratulations, congratulations. When the Far-Left rioters rampage across Minneapolis and they rampage across your state, how about your police department? Let's just run for your lives and it's not their fault, they were told to do that. You have a good police department, you have good police, but they're not allowed to do their job. They're not allowed to do their job. Remember that, they were told to leave the precinct, leave it, and then they knocked the hell out of that precinct, and they had a great mayor, great mayor, it's a real power. Remember, did you ever hear of a man, Fiorello LaGuardia? Did you ever - I don't think that happened with him. New York. I don't think it happened with Rudy Giuliani. Did it? What a great job. Rudy did. You realize, Rudy just now really being appreciated. People forgot how good he was as a man. He was a great man. Joe Biden called the peaceful protesters. He said these are peaceful protesters as opposed to sending in the National Guard, they didn't want the National Guard, Joe Biden said you shouldn't send the National Guard and this went on day after day after day.

About seven o'clock, then they see this guy walk out with about a $250,000 outfit on, that's because they had more computers and this and that, got the tear gas deal, he's got the whole deal. Pepper spray, got everything. The finest outfit you can buy, believe me. We just paid for him and they'll very expensive.

Ginsburg said, quote, \"I think the notion that we have all the democracy that money can buy strays so far from what our democracy is supposed to be, so that's number one on my list.\" In her personal life, Ginsburg battled four separate cancer diagnoses.

Shannon, obviously, she has had so many health challenges over the years, but she has been such a fighter, and such a courageous member of this court showing up in the middle of all of those procedures and doing her best to live her life as a justice to the very end. Your thoughts on this obviously very big news story on so many angles tonight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's shocking, any time that we get news that one of the justices has been passed away, we have been through so many roller coasters with her following, as you said, so many challenges to her health over the years and she has fought back and been so incredibly strong. I remember being struck by the death of her husband. They were extremely close. And just devoted to each other and when he passed away a few years ago, I was in court the next day and I was stunned to see her there. But she was so devoted to the court, to her job there, to her life's work there. She was dedicated and she was not going to let anything stop her. She had long said when people would nudge her or push her into retirement and try to suggest she would say nope, as long as I feel like I can do this job mentally and physically, I'm going to keep doing this job and that's what she did years and years and years. She was the second female appointed to the Supreme Court. She has had such an enormous impact, it's hard to overstate it at this point. It is a shock tonight because she has overcome so much in her life and been so incredibly strong. And she's had prayers from around the world, as she has gone public and she is one of the justices who has been very open and honest with us. As member of the press corps covering the Supreme Court, each time that she was hospitalized or had an issue, she wasn't somebody that tried to hide it from us. She was public in sharing these different struggles that she had. And so, we knew a lot of what was going on, there was a lot of talk with her last time with the recurrence of cancer about her ability to continue to fight. And she had said she was undergoing chemo and that was going well. This was just a matter of weeks ago, she felt hopeful about that. So obviously in these last few days and weeks, she did privately come to terms, I can only assume, and with her family about the fact -- you know, the fact that her life was coming to a close, we're told she was surrounded by her family tonight, they were with her. She's got two children and several grandchildren, and she was incredibly devoted to them too, and so very, very proud of them. She just spoke glowing of her family and she had shared over the years about what it was like to be a young woman in law school. During the time that she was in law school and how she was expected to juggle things with a husband and with children eventually and that she was treated differently in those days when she was coming out of school, one of the top graduates. And yet, being viewed by some employers as somebody who might be a liability because she was a woman who valued her family, her marriage, and her kids and she blazed a path. And she was somebody who showed us that you could be incredibly committed to your professional life, to fighting fights that to her were exceptionally important and to raising a family as well. So, it is a shock to the system tonight because she has done so well in rallying so many past, you know, past difficulties but we know that, we're told she was at peace with her family. And that is the news tonight, at 87 years old that she has passed away."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What a remarkable life. And as you point out so perfectly, Shannon, she really had it all. I mean, she's a woman who had it all. She was extremely successful, Ivy League education and her law education, and she worked through all of that while, you know, raising her family over the course of those years. And then as you say, being so, you know, she struck such a great balance, I think, in terms of being human and also being this great legal mind and someone that so many people looked up to. And the other thing that I think of when you mentioned in your piece, that she shared her love of opera with Antonin Scalia is that the camaraderie on the court and how well respected she was by all of the members of the court. And obviously they had differences in the way they approach the Constitution and approach these cases but she was part of that family. She was a pillar of that family."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And there's really, you know, we talked to the justices and you know -- the truth is that nobody understands what their life is like except for those who have served on that bench. Nine at a time that they do become like family. There was so much discussion of her relationship with the late Justice Scalia. Also, one of those nights the shocking news that we got that he was gone that they had such a friendship, that they bonded over all kinds of different things. They enjoy spending time together. They are families together. They could not have been more opposed on, as you said, the way that they viewed interpretation of the Constitution and many of the key critical decisions that came down from the court, and yet, in the midst of that they were able to forge this very genuine, very close friendship over things that they did have in common. And you know, the justices have lunch together on a regular basis and one of the things is, they don't talk politics, they don't talk about the cases, they talk about their grandkids and opera and travel and the things that do bond them. And a lot of people saw the two of them as an odd couple. They made no apologies for it, they were very close and it was a beautiful thing to see that you could be so opposed ideologically on a number of key issues and yet, have a genuine affection and love for each other."

And thank you, Shannon, so much for doing such a beautiful job documenting it, and obviously your close coverage of the Supreme Court and understanding of all of its workings is a huge value to us tonight.

      "utterance": "Well, any one, any time a giant of our democracy dies, it's a heartbreaking moment, the passing of an era. She was truly a legal giant who, I mean, I disagreed with her judicial philosophy, I disagreed with her on a lot of things but she was an incredible Supreme Court justice, an incredible innovator for the reason. And also, she was such a wonderful model for us in these times where partisanship has become almost toxic in our political ecosystem. Her, as Shannon was just saying, her best friend on the court was Antonin Scalia, someone she almost never joined in opinions with, disagreed, they had vigorous discussions about weighty issues, and yet, they managed to love opera together and love each other. It's -- that's something to hold onto and to remember, because sadly, the timing of her passing, we are going to see probably the in the next weeks or months the greatest period of political vitriol in a modern history as the debate over filling her seat takes on."

An election was coming, Mitch McConnell said that it was too close to an election to fill that seat, President Obama put forward Merrick Garland and that was a hugely controversial moment. You know, as we continue to respect this moment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's passing tonight, and so much will still be said about her biography and her incredible life. Your thought though on, as we look a little bit forward in this situation tonight, Marc."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "It's almost uncomfortable talking about it so soon but it has to be discussed. You know, the reality is, yes. I would be shocked if Senate Republic -- if Donald Trump didn't nominate somebody to replace her and if the Senate Republicans didn't confirm that person before the end of the -- before the end of this term and probably before the election. I interviewed Senator McConnell in 2018 about this and I asked him specifically if another Supreme Court justice vacancy came up during an election year, would you confirm them? And he said that absolutely yes. He said that if the rule is, McConnell rule, is that, if the Senate is of the different party than a president and a vacancy occur in the presidential election year it doesn't get filled. That's what happened with Merrick Garland. I guarantee you, Martha, that if President Obama had a Democratic Senate in that -- at that time, he would've confirmed Merrick Garland and Merrick Garland would be on the Supreme Court today. President Trump has just recently put out a new list of candidates and because he's gone through this twice now, according to people on, he's vetted a lot of people who came very close to getting picked, so it should not take them very long to put somebody forward. And because the Democrats made the mistake back in 2014 of getting rid of judicial filibuster and then filibustered Neil Gorsuch who was supremely qualified for the Supreme Court out of anger over Merrick Garland, they created a situation where Republicans only need a simple majority. So, I would -- I would say the likelihood is that her replacement will be put forward by the president and confirmed by the Senate in pretty short order."

I recently saw her a few months ago at an event. And you know, she was really about getting out and about, this is pre-COVID time. And she's just a figure that had this following. You just mentioned the movies that had come out and I commend those to you as well, RBG and the life story is just really inspirational to a lot of people. And all that she fought for as far as women -- women's rights, and change the way the country deals with a lot of big issues. Obviously, she came from the left but she had this relationship with Antonin Scalia on that court who was obviously from the right and they got along fabulously. And I saw them together at an opera in Washington and it was quite something to see when they were both on the court."

And she was such a remarkable figure and someone who was so admired, I think by so many people. She was herself. She had a great sense of humor and obviously just an enormous intellect. So, Bret, obviously, you know, it feels you want so much to just be remembering her life and we will do that over the course of the next several days and covering her legacy, but we are within a breath of an election in this country.
