      "sentences": "This is the biggest show we have had so far this year, tons of breaking news tonight. Breaking right now, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions now revealing that there are over 50,000 -- we thought they were ten -- text messages between Trump-hating FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer mistress Lisa Page. Now, nearly 400 of them are released this weekend. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also tonight, stunning evidence that the fix is, in fact, in. We have been right all along. The FBI now saying they lost five key months of text messages between the two lovers, Strzok and Page. Now, this is a conspiracy to obstruct justice, I'm not buying it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And part of the problem, it's a troubling pattern. What have we seen it over and over again? Hillary and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the list goes on and on. The IRS case, remember that? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, not only is this worse than Watergate, it looks like a cover up worse than Watergate. Our 18 minutes of missing tape has shown up in this case. This all comes as one of the new messages tonight suggests that Strzok, Page, and the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch knew Hillary Clinton would go free in the email scandal investigation before they ever investigated it or interviewed her. Plus, tonight, pressure is built into released a classified memo showing systemic FISA abuse against the Trump campaign. This scandal is one of the biggest abuses of power in American history. It is time that you, the American people, get the truth. We are once again tonight, we are calling on you to contact Congress, let them know. You want the memo released. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We also want you to send out, we want the text messages. And now that the government shutdown is almost over, my advice to Republicans going forward on immigration -- we'll give that on so much more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "All right. Remember the vindication I've been telling you it was coming? Tonight, it is in full motion. Everything that we have been reporting for over the past year and the media has ignored for the past year, is now being uncovered. We have so much information, I literally need three hours tonight. We'll go through a slowly so everybody gets it. Now, please stay with us. It will take your breath away. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Attorney General Jeff Sessions is revealing that there are in fact more than 50,000 text messages between Trump-hating FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. This is significant because previous reporting put. The number of text messages that only 10,000. Sessions is also vowing tonight to get to the bottom of the missing text messages, which, beginning to look more and more like an FBI cover-up. This is a massive developing scandal and it ties into everything we have been telling you. Now, we are learning that five -- five months of text messages between the Trump-hating lovers Strzok and Page, they have conveniently disappeared. I don't make this up. The messages that the FBI is claiming to have lost, well, they are from a critical, crucial time in the Russia investigation. Here is what happened. Now, during that five months -- this is from December 14 to May 17, 2017 -- March 4, President Trump claimed that he was wiretapped at Trump Tower. We don't have the exchanges from them. I would love to know what Strzok and Page were gossiping about at that point. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } January 11, remember, BuzzFeed, they published the Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian propaganda dossier that the FBI used to get a FISA warrant against the Trump campaign, they say against Carter Page, that was a pretext. January 24, now former National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, he's interviewed by the FBI, and I hope Flynn's attorneys are watching tonight, because it was one person in the room named Peter Strzok who has made it clear that he despises all things Donald Trump. He oversaw that interview. Now, given what we now know, you have to wonder, how fair could Strzok possibly be? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Strzok had no business being involved in that investigation or any of the others he's involved in. The guy still shouldn't have a job. As I said last Friday, he should be fired, he should in fact be investigated. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then we go to May 9, FBI Director James Comey is fired. May 17, Robert Mueller is named special counsel. So, the messages are missing from that entire time period, the most critical time. But they are available from May 18. That's the exact day after Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel. You don't think that's highly suspicious? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Strzok and Page, they are the key players in everything that we have been uncovering. They got their hands and everything. Are we really supposed to believe that the FBI simply lost text messages from that important time frame? This is like Watergate and far worse. Remember the 18 1/2 minute gap in the White House tapes? This reeks of lawbreaking, it reeks of conspiracy, and it reeks of obstruction of justice. And, by the way, the cover-up is always worse than the crime. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, that's what it looks like to me tonight. Now, the DOJ, they're trying to explain it away. They are saying tonight that many of the FBI's issued Samsung 5 phones didn't capture text messages during that period. Hold on a second, we're going to blame Samsung? The DOJ is, you know, talking this up to a, quote, \"misconfiguration\" on issues related to rollouts, provisioning and software upgrades that conflicted with the FBI's collection capabilities? We're going to blame Samsung? They are blaming Samsung? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Where are the phones tonight? And instead of making excuses, the FBI, have you brought in your best forensic experts to analyze the phones? And, by the way, if you can't get the messages, you need to call Samsung. Maybe they will help you. And if the FBI doesn't want to do that, then we can only draw the conclusion that the FBI clearly is hiding something in this very crucial time period and timeline that we are talking about. Remember Lois Lerner? She's another example. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, this is part of a much larger pattern here. Let's look at Hillary Clinton's email server scandal. Remember, 33,000 deleted emails that had been subpoenaed by Congress. Now, to make doubly sure that those were erased, never to be retrieved again, well then Clinton acid washed the hard drives with an item known as bleach bit to get rid of all of them, no trace of them, while those emails again under congressional subpoena. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And on top of that, a Clinton aide then took the BlackBerrys and mobile devices and smashed them with a hammer, and the few remaining cell phones -- well, they turned over to the FBI, and they had no SIM cards. And look at these headlines. Fox News, October 2016, quote: FBI agreed to destroy laptops of Clinton aides with immunity deal, lawmaker says. Well, why would the FBI ever agreed to destroy evidence? That doesn't make sense. And according to the same reporting, as part of the plea deal, the FBI wasn't allowed to search emails after the existence of Clinton's server was made public, which means that the FBI wouldn't be able to look at possible obstruction of justice by Clinton and her aides when it so obvious that is what happened. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then, there's this, October 5 report from The Washington Examiner: Immunity deal stopped FBI from investigating Bleach Bit use in Clinton email case. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Any of you at home ever use Bleach Bit? You ever smash your mobile device? Clinton destroyed evidence and the FBI didn't even want to investigate. And we can't forget, instead of coming clean and admitting what she was doing, Hillary Clinton gave excuse after excuse for using an unsecured email server at a mom and pop shop bathroom closet. Remember, five foreign intelligence agencies got access to all of that. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } HILLARY CLINTON, MARCH 10, 2015: The laws and regulations in effect when I was secretary of state allowed me to use my email for work. That is undisputed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } CLINTON, AUG. 26, 2015: It clearly wasn't the best choice. And I take responsibility for that decision. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } CLINTON, MARCH 10, 2015: I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, FEB. 24, 2015: IPhone or Android? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Really? You're going to joke about it? Clinton broke the law. We know she certainly didn't take care of classified, top-secret special access information. She destroyed such and, by the way, and it's pretty simple, the FBI letter off the hook. We'll have more on that in just a second. We have new information. This destruction of evidence as part of a pattern from the Obama administration. Remember Lois Lerner, IRS targeting conservative scandal? The agency lost the emails of Lois Lerner and the official that was leading the charge, unfairly going after conservatives, the IRS of the emails were lost because of a system crash? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Every time the walls are closing in on the Obama administration officials, key evidence just disappears. And they found it two years later in that case.When it keeps happening, it's not a coincidence. It's actually called obstruction of justice. And there were also several other wrinkles in the story. Remember Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the IT aide scandal? Well, he had smashed hard drives in his garage. But, of course, the aide's lawyer denied it ever happened. Also breaking tonight, a newly released text message from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page -- this is where it gets interesting -- appears to show that both of them -- and now tonight, add the attorney general, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch -- knew that Hillary Clinton would not be prosecuted in her email server investigation. Well, what's important is they are saying this before they even interviewed Hillary. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, before we show you the message, let's give you a little back story. Remember in May, Comey and Strzok and other top FBI officials, remember, they were drafting the Clinton exoneration of the email server scandal before ever interviewing Hillary and 17 other key witnesses? So, exoneration before investigation, yes, that's called being rigged and the fix was in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then you also have former Attorney General Loretta Lynch meeting who? Bill Clinton on the tarmac, talking about grandchildren for 40 minutes at the end of June. Again, they still have not interrogated or asked questions of Hillary Clinton and the key people in this investigation. Lynch also called Comey, remember, had the meeting with Comey and said to Comey, call it a matter not an investigation, and Comey followed her orders to the letter. And then just days later, when Lynch said that she would step away from the email investigation, she said she would accept the FBI's conclusion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Well, Strzok texted page on July 1st. Look at this: \"Timing looks like hell.\" Page response: \"Yes, that is awful timing\" -- talking about the tarmac meeting. \"It's a real profile in courage since she,\" Loretta Lynch, \"knows no charges will be brought.\" How did she know? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Four days after that, Comey held this press conference, letting Hillary Clinton off the hook. Now, we also have the text message between Strzok and Page, remember talking about the insurance policy, in case, God forbid, Donald Trump became president? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The fix was in. This was rigged. This was an exoneration without an investigation. There is no equal justice under the law here. You've got to Strzok, Page, Lynch all knew that charges would not be recommended against Clinton. That's why they wrote the exoneration early on. And if Lisa Page knew, then that means that her boss, the Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe knew, who we think Strzok and Page were talking to any insurance, quote, text message. Now that would probably mean that Clinton would go free. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we also need to know, you know, what now deputy attorney general, what did Rod Rosenstein know? And when did he know it? He has a lot of questions to start answering. And if Comey and Lynch, the top two law enforcement officials in the country knew, I gather there's a pretty good chance that someone in the Obama White House also knew the fix was in for Hillary. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The timing is key. If you put the fix in, she gets to stay in the presidential race. If she gets indicted, the Democratic Party is thrown into shambles before an important presidential election. They thought they knew better and they saved Hillary because they thought she would win and they wanted to appoint her the president of the United States. You think Watergate was a big scandal? This is Watergate on steroids and human growth hormones at levels that would kill the average person. And to top it all off, there is even more information tonight. Another newly released text message between Strzok and Page, it talks about a change to Comey's Clinton exoneration letter. Now, the statement originally referenced Clinton emailing President Obama when she was, quote, on the territory of a hostile country. Now, the part mentioning Obama was then altered to say, quote, senior government official, before being removed entirely. So, Obama had to know that Clinton was using a private email server and we have the evidence tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We also have new breaking developments in terms of Republicans' effort to release the classified four-page memo that details these massive FISA abuses against the Trump campaign. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is becoming the biggest scandal in American history, modern American history. You have members of Congress who have seen it, are saying the contents are shocking, jaw-dropping, alarming, people will go to jail. And Fox News is reporting tonight that releasing the memo to you, the American people, could take up to 19 congressional business days if all the procedures are, quote, followed. That means we don't get to see them, you don't get to see the memo, until at least the middle of March. Tonight, we are asking that you keep applying pressure. Demand that the public see the memo. Release the memo. You need to see the truth, you need to about this massive abuse of power. They are trampling on our Constitution, they are shredding it. Our Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure, the weaponization of our intelligence community, and how the Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian dossier -- she fixed, remember, she fixed the primary, she had Comey, Strzok, and apparently Loretta Lynch trying to fix her case when she broke the law and then she tried to use the phony dossier to fix the general election, why not after it worked on the primary. And then they use it in an effort to spy on an opposition candidate in an election year and a president-elect and his team. Call the number at the bottom of the screen. We need to see this memo, 202-224-3121. We'll put it up throughout the evening. Tell your member of Congress, release the memo. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There's a ton of information tonight. Let me sum up what this all means. Clinton fixed the primary against Bernie. Strzok, Comey, and apparently Loretta Lynch exonerated Hillary without ever interviewing her or the key people in that whole email server scandal. The fix was in, it was rigged. Clinton and the DNC tried to influence the general. They bought and paid for Russian lies before an election and the fix was in there. And the Obama administration weaponized the powerful tools of intelligence to target members of the Trump campaign. The fix was in. Strzok and his mistress, Lisa Page, talked about an insurance policy, and now, key messages are missing. The fix is in. This is far worse than Watergate. It's a massive abuse of power and you are witnessing one of the biggest scandals in American history with a cover up to boot. Key players, Strzok, Page, Bruce Ohr, Rod Rosenstein need to be fired and investigated. Comey, Loretta Lynch, investigated.

No. Special counsel Robert Mueller is appointed on May 17, 2017, at any text messages there? No. But the next day, they start up again.

This is not the first time this has happened by the way. They brought in lawyers, within the agency or brought in lawyers outside of the agency into the agency to find out what is going on here. This is inexplicable. There is no excuse for this. The FBI can't just write this off saying, must of been a technical glitch with Samsung, by the way every time there is a technical glitch we ended up recovering the document. Remember the technical glitch on the Iran negotiation with President Obama and the video was edited and they said it was a technical glitch. We found out in the litigation that we brought against the state department it was intentional edit by the state department to change the dating of when this is going this. It is illegal. Obstruction of evidence. You know, maybe the inspector. I hope what the previous panel said the inspector general has all this information. If not the FBI, Department of Justice better get it. If they can't get it from their existing systems they need to go to Samsung and get it from them. Here is the problem Sean, this is not just individuals they're individuals charged with investigating the Russia probe this. Isn't just random political talk. Explain the five months missing.

      "utterance": "This is the biggest show we have had so far this year, tons of breaking news tonight. Breaking right now, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions now revealing that there are over 50,000 -- we thought they were ten -- text messages between Trump-hating FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer mistress Lisa Page. Now, nearly 400 of them are released this weekend. Also tonight, stunning evidence that the fix is, in fact, in. We have been right all along. The FBI now saying they lost five key months of text messages between the two lovers, Strzok and Page. Now, this is a conspiracy to obstruct justice, I'm not buying it. And part of the problem, it's a troubling pattern. What have we seen it over and over again? Hillary and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the list goes on and on. The IRS case, remember that? Now, not only is this worse than Watergate, it looks like a cover up worse than Watergate. Our 18 minutes of missing tape has shown up in this case. This all comes as one of the new messages tonight suggests that Strzok, Page, and the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch knew Hillary Clinton would go free in the email scandal investigation before they ever investigated it or interviewed her. Plus, tonight, pressure is built into released a classified memo showing systemic FISA abuse against the Trump campaign. This scandal is one of the biggest abuses of power in American history. It is time that you, the American people, get the truth. We are once again tonight, we are calling on you to contact Congress, let them know. You want the memo released. We also want you to send out, we want the text messages. And now that the government shutdown is almost over, my advice to Republicans going forward on immigration -- we'll give that on so much more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Remember the vindication I've been telling you it was coming? Tonight, it is in full motion. Everything that we have been reporting for over the past year and the media has ignored for the past year, is now being uncovered. We have so much information, I literally need three hours tonight. We'll go through a slowly so everybody gets it. Now, please stay with us. It will take your breath away. The Attorney General Jeff Sessions is revealing that there are in fact more than 50,000 text messages between Trump-hating FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. This is significant because previous reporting put. The number of text messages that only 10,000. Sessions is also vowing tonight to get to the bottom of the missing text messages, which, beginning to look more and more like an FBI cover-up. This is a massive developing scandal and it ties into everything we have been telling you. Now, we are learning that five -- five months of text messages between the Trump-hating lovers Strzok and Page, they have conveniently disappeared. I don't make this up. The messages that the FBI is claiming to have lost, well, they are from a critical, crucial time in the Russia investigation. Here is what happened. Now, during that five months -- this is from December 14 to May 17, 2017 -- March 4, President Trump claimed that he was wiretapped at Trump Tower. We don't have the exchanges from them. I would love to know what Strzok and Page were gossiping about at that point. January 11, remember, BuzzFeed, they published the Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian propaganda dossier that the FBI used to get a FISA warrant against the Trump campaign, they say against Carter Page, that was a pretext. January 24, now former National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, he's interviewed by the FBI, and I hope Flynn's attorneys are watching tonight, because it was one person in the room named Peter Strzok who has made it clear that he despises all things Donald Trump. He oversaw that interview. Now, given what we now know, you have to wonder, how fair could Strzok possibly be? Now, Strzok had no business being involved in that investigation or any of the others he's involved in. The guy still shouldn't have a job. As I said last Friday, he should be fired, he should in fact be investigated. Then we go to May 9, FBI Director James Comey is fired. May 17, Robert Mueller is named special counsel. So, the messages are missing from that entire time period, the most critical time. But they are available from May 18. That's the exact day after Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel. You don't think that's highly suspicious? Now, Strzok and Page, they are the key players in everything that we have been uncovering. They got their hands and everything. Are we really supposed to believe that the FBI simply lost text messages from that important time frame? This is like Watergate and far worse. Remember the 18 1/2 minute gap in the White House tapes? This reeks of lawbreaking, it reeks of conspiracy, and it reeks of obstruction of justice. And, by the way, the cover-up is always worse than the crime. Now, that's what it looks like to me tonight. Now, the DOJ, they're trying to explain it away. They are saying tonight that many of the FBI's issued Samsung 5 phones didn't capture text messages during that period. Hold on a second, we're going to blame Samsung? The DOJ is, you know, talking this up to a, quote, \"misconfiguration\" on issues related to rollouts, provisioning and software upgrades that conflicted with the FBI's collection capabilities? We're going to blame Samsung? They are blaming Samsung? Where are the phones tonight? And instead of making excuses, the FBI, have you brought in your best forensic experts to analyze the phones? And, by the way, if you can't get the messages, you need to call Samsung. Maybe they will help you. And if the FBI doesn't want to do that, then we can only draw the conclusion that the FBI clearly is hiding something in this very crucial time period and timeline that we are talking about. Remember Lois Lerner? She's another example. Now, this is part of a much larger pattern here. Let's look at Hillary Clinton's email server scandal. Remember, 33,000 deleted emails that had been subpoenaed by Congress. Now, to make doubly sure that those were erased, never to be retrieved again, well then Clinton acid washed the hard drives with an item known as bleach bit to get rid of all of them, no trace of them, while those emails again under congressional subpoena. And on top of that, a Clinton aide then took the BlackBerrys and mobile devices and smashed them with a hammer, and the few remaining cell phones -- well, they turned over to the FBI, and they had no SIM cards. And look at these headlines. Fox News, October 2016, quote: FBI agreed to destroy laptops of Clinton aides with immunity deal, lawmaker says. Well, why would the FBI ever agreed to destroy evidence? That doesn't make sense. And according to the same reporting, as part of the plea deal, the FBI wasn't allowed to search emails after the existence of Clinton's server was made public, which means that the FBI wouldn't be able to look at possible obstruction of justice by Clinton and her aides when it so obvious that is what happened. Then, there's this, October 5 report from The Washington Examiner: Immunity deal stopped FBI from investigating Bleach Bit use in Clinton email case. Any of you at home ever use Bleach Bit? You ever smash your mobile device? Clinton destroyed evidence and the FBI didn't even want to investigate. And we can't forget, instead of coming clean and admitting what she was doing, Hillary Clinton gave excuse after excuse for using an unsecured email server at a mom and pop shop bathroom closet. Remember, five foreign intelligence agencies got access to all of that. Take a look. HILLARY CLINTON, MARCH 10, 2015: The laws and regulations in effect when I was secretary of state allowed me to use my email for work. That is undisputed. CLINTON, AUG. 26, 2015: It clearly wasn't the best choice. And I take responsibility for that decision. CLINTON, MARCH 10, 2015: I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, FEB. 24, 2015: IPhone or Android?"

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Really? You're going to joke about it? Clinton broke the law. We know she certainly didn't take care of classified, top-secret special access information. She destroyed such and, by the way, and it's pretty simple, the FBI letter off the hook. We'll have more on that in just a second. We have new information. This destruction of evidence as part of a pattern from the Obama administration. Remember Lois Lerner, IRS targeting conservative scandal? The agency lost the emails of Lois Lerner and the official that was leading the charge, unfairly going after conservatives, the IRS of the emails were lost because of a system crash? Every time the walls are closing in on the Obama administration officials, key evidence just disappears. And they found it two years later in that case.When it keeps happening, it's not a coincidence. It's actually called obstruction of justice. And there were also several other wrinkles in the story. Remember Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the IT aide scandal? Well, he had smashed hard drives in his garage. But, of course, the aide's lawyer denied it ever happened. Also breaking tonight, a newly released text message from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page -- this is where it gets interesting -- appears to show that both of them -- and now tonight, add the attorney general, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch -- knew that Hillary Clinton would not be prosecuted in her email server investigation. Well, what's important is they are saying this before they even interviewed Hillary. Now, before we show you the message, let's give you a little back story. Remember in May, Comey and Strzok and other top FBI officials, remember, they were drafting the Clinton exoneration of the email server scandal before ever interviewing Hillary and 17 other key witnesses? So, exoneration before investigation, yes, that's called being rigged and the fix was in. And then you also have former Attorney General Loretta Lynch meeting who? Bill Clinton on the tarmac, talking about grandchildren for 40 minutes at the end of June. Again, they still have not interrogated or asked questions of Hillary Clinton and the key people in this investigation. Lynch also called Comey, remember, had the meeting with Comey and said to Comey, call it a matter not an investigation, and Comey followed her orders to the letter. And then just days later, when Lynch said that she would step away from the email investigation, she said she would accept the FBI's conclusion. Well, Strzok texted page on July 1st. Look at this: \"Timing looks like hell.\" Page response: \"Yes, that is awful timing\" -- talking about the tarmac meeting. \"It's a real profile in courage since she,\" Loretta Lynch, \"knows no charges will be brought.\" How did she know? Four days after that, Comey held this press conference, letting Hillary Clinton off the hook. Now, we also have the text message between Strzok and Page, remember talking about the insurance policy, in case, God forbid, Donald Trump became president? The fix was in. This was rigged. This was an exoneration without an investigation. There is no equal justice under the law here. You've got to Strzok, Page, Lynch all knew that charges would not be recommended against Clinton. That's why they wrote the exoneration early on. And if Lisa Page knew, then that means that her boss, the Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe knew, who we think Strzok and Page were talking to any insurance, quote, text message. Now that would probably mean that Clinton would go free. Now, we also need to know, you know, what now deputy attorney general, what did Rod Rosenstein know? And when did he know it? He has a lot of questions to start answering. And if Comey and Lynch, the top two law enforcement officials in the country knew, I gather there's a pretty good chance that someone in the Obama White House also knew the fix was in for Hillary. The timing is key. If you put the fix in, she gets to stay in the presidential race. If she gets indicted, the Democratic Party is thrown into shambles before an important presidential election. They thought they knew better and they saved Hillary because they thought she would win and they wanted to appoint her the president of the United States. You think Watergate was a big scandal? This is Watergate on steroids and human growth hormones at levels that would kill the average person. And to top it all off, there is even more information tonight. Another newly released text message between Strzok and Page, it talks about a change to Comey's Clinton exoneration letter. Now, the statement originally referenced Clinton emailing President Obama when she was, quote, on the territory of a hostile country. Now, the part mentioning Obama was then altered to say, quote, senior government official, before being removed entirely. So, Obama had to know that Clinton was using a private email server and we have the evidence tonight. We also have new breaking developments in terms of Republicans' effort to release the classified four-page memo that details these massive FISA abuses against the Trump campaign. This is becoming the biggest scandal in American history, modern American history. You have members of Congress who have seen it, are saying the contents are shocking, jaw-dropping, alarming, people will go to jail. And Fox News is reporting tonight that releasing the memo to you, the American people, could take up to 19 congressional business days if all the procedures are, quote, followed. That means we don't get to see them, you don't get to see the memo, until at least the middle of March. Tonight, we are asking that you keep applying pressure. Demand that the public see the memo. Release the memo. You need to see the truth, you need to about this massive abuse of power. They are trampling on our Constitution, they are shredding it. Our Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure, the weaponization of our intelligence community, and how the Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian dossier -- she fixed, remember, she fixed the primary, she had Comey, Strzok, and apparently Loretta Lynch trying to fix her case when she broke the law and then she tried to use the phony dossier to fix the general election, why not after it worked on the primary. And then they use it in an effort to spy on an opposition candidate in an election year and a president-elect and his team. Call the number at the bottom of the screen. We need to see this memo, 202-224-3121. We'll put it up throughout the evening. Tell your member of Congress, release the memo. There's a ton of information tonight. Let me sum up what this all means. Clinton fixed the primary against Bernie. Strzok, Comey, and apparently Loretta Lynch exonerated Hillary without ever interviewing her or the key people in that whole email server scandal. The fix was in, it was rigged. Clinton and the DNC tried to influence the general. They bought and paid for Russian lies before an election and the fix was in there. And the Obama administration weaponized the powerful tools of intelligence to target members of the Trump campaign. The fix was in. Strzok and his mistress, Lisa Page, talked about an insurance policy, and now, key messages are missing. The fix is in. This is far worse than Watergate. It's a massive abuse of power and you are witnessing one of the biggest scandals in American history with a cover up to boot. Key players, Strzok, Page, Bruce Ohr, Rod Rosenstein need to be fired and investigated. Comey, Loretta Lynch, investigated. And I'm not talking about rank-and-file members of the FBI and Justice Department that do great work on in the intelligence community. I'm talking specifically about abuses committed by their very top officials in the deep state, in the FBI and the Department of Justice. And if, Robert Mueller, you are watching tonight -- and I'm sure you are and I'm sure your corrupt team of Obama-Hillary Clinton deep state which hunters are watching -- this witch hunt needs to be shut down, since you've clearly stacked the deck against, and started out with a biased investigation against President Trump. And finally tonight, the government shutdown, it's over. The president just signed a temporary bill and I told you it was no big deal. All the panic by the rest of the media was a waste of your time. All right. Now, we've got a lot to get to you. Joining us now is investigative reporter and Fox News contributor, we have Sara Carter. Also, Gregg Jarrett, Fox News legal analyst, and Congressman Matt Gaetz. All right. Let's talk about your -- well, you got a quote today in your article. Tell everybody. It's amazing."

Director Comey after, it's a false statement. That's a felony. Let's talk about obstruction of justice, a lot of interest and obstruction of justice. Explain to me -- I am listening to these explanations coming out regarding the missing emails. Now, Sean, I was at the lawyer, the American Center for Law and Justice brought the case against the Internal Revenue Service for targeting. And you may remember during that litigation --"

Companion case damages were also paid, injunction and damages. So, here's what you have got. The five most important months of this Russia probe, what is missing? Start with this. \"BuzzFeed\" published the fake Steele dossier on January 11, 2017. Are there any text messages between the two parties here, Page and Strzok? Answer, those are missing. Strzok interviews Michael Flynn on January 24, 2017, that's when he interviewed General Flynn. Are there text messages between Lisa Page and Strzok then? No, they are missing. James Comey is fired for his incompetence by the president of the United States on May 9th, 2017. Are there text messages between the parties during that transaction? No. Special counsel Robert Mueller is appointed on May 17, 2017, at any text messages there? No. But the next day, they start up again. So, the five months while this case is and it's interesting serious probe, this is the Russia collusion nonsense I'll call it, the missing text messages are just gone. So, what you got is a pattern or practice within these agencies, look, out of law school, I was a government lawyer. I worked for the chief counsel's office of the Internal Revenue Service as a government lawyer. The idea -- can you imagine going into the IRS and saying, I'm sorry, I lost my receipts and see how that works out in your audit? Not too well. So, here's what you got --"

Remember also when the department of justice started that investigation, internal investigation of the IRS targeting, I said that was a full investigation also. I stopped my clients from participating, because it was nonsense and the questions are ridiculous. Here is what you got. The five months, critical five months in the Russia probe. All of the sudden the two agents who by the way were on the special council staff after he was appointed, not before. They were all working on this Russian investigation, remember Strzok was the counter intelligence to chief FBI agent. His emails are just gone, his text messages are just gone, vanish and don't exist. Here is the question you have to ask yourself. If this is this significant what does this mean about the underlying matter that this is involve in? I heard on the Department of Justice today that is going to investigate this, you know Sean here is what I think, they need to bring in a lawyer that is dedicated to one thing only. This is not the first time this has happened by the way. They brought in lawyers, within the agency or brought in lawyers outside of the agency into the agency to find out what is going on here. This is inexplicable. There is no excuse for this. The FBI can't just write this off saying, must of been a technical glitch with Samsung, by the way every time there is a technical glitch we ended up recovering the document. Remember the technical glitch on the Iran negotiation with President Obama and the video was edited and they said it was a technical glitch. We found out in the litigation that we brought against the state department it was intentional edit by the state department to change the dating of when this is going this. It is illegal. Obstruction of evidence. You know, maybe the inspector. I hope what the previous panel said the inspector general has all this information. If not the FBI, Department of Justice better get it. If they can't get it from their existing systems they need to go to Samsung and get it from them. Here is the problem Sean, this is not just individuals they're individuals charged with investigating the Russia probe this. Isn't just random political talk. Explain the five months missing. That is more than 18 minutes. Gone and starts up the next day. The day after the special council point it, it starts back up."
