He was regarded as a little bit too much of a moderate on deregulation and things like that by the conservatives in the administration. It should be remembered he was a moderate alternative to the president's original choice for this department, Andy Puzder, who was considered the conservative darling for that job. The labor unions kind of supported Acosta's nomination at the beginning, and he got nine Democratic votes. And I think that moderation, which was a selling point at the beginning, some people in the administration never quite forgiven him for and may have helped take advantage of this moment to get him shoved out."

What happened? I think we have to assume that President Trump, watching the news coverage of this, expected that the story was going to continue, and as Mollie suggests, potentially even grow.

So this gives an opportunity for Republicans to ask questions that they probably wouldn't get answers to, but questions like why did you not investigate the Russian dossier that turned out not to be true? Why did you not investigate --"

      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "He doesn't want to. And it does seem like the Democrats are having some misgivings about it, but they seem to be internal misgivings because a lot of the junior members of the committee are saying wait a minute, I'm not going to get my moment in the sun."

And we're back now with the panel. Let's start with a new \"Wall Street Journal\" national poll out today of the Democrats running for president. Joe Biden still in the lead, this is a national poll, 26 percent. Elizabeth Warren in the second, moved up, 19 percent. Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders tied for third at 13 percent. And Pete Buttigieg, I guess the last member of what you'd call the top tier, at seven percent, he's in fifth place. Chuck, what does that tell you about the state of the race?"

Biden is still, perhaps somewhat less, but still comfortably in the frontrunner's position, and Elizabeth Warren is still the second choice. I think there's --"

We see job growth, wage growth, the stock market doing well. Anything can change, of course but our predictors are pretty wrong. The political problem is Democrats need the economy to be problematic so they can run on that, and the economy just keeps blooming."

A lot American allies very uncomfortable with the Trump administration's position on Iran, and yet behind the scenes a lot of nations are, I think, going to providing naval forces to support transit through the Strait of Hormuz. My loser of the week Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of Turkey, having delivering the S-400 Russian missile defense system off the back of a very embarrassing defeat in Istanbul mayoral race. He now faces sanctions. His economy is already weak. The sultan is heading for some dark waters."

He was upheld in the Supreme Court. He pushed back when the president tried to change his lawyers on him. He's been ultimately vindicated by the withdrawal of that question.
