You saw the verdict live here on \"The Story\" last night. Zarate, a seven-time felon, and illegal immigrant, deported five times, acquitted in the murder of 32-year- old Kate Steinle. The San Francisco jury finding him only guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The decision sending shock waves across the country as Zarate could technically be released from prison soon.

But California has a jail credit system where each day behind bars counts as two days. So, Garcia Zarate already has been in jail for 29 months, meaning he has five years of credit which is more than enough to cover the crime. But the Department of Justice has unsealed an arrest warrant for Garcia Zarate for violating his probation for a drug conviction in Texas in 2015. The warrant means that despite San Francisco's sanctuary city policy, the sheriff there is obligated to turn him over to the federal government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The question, then, becomes what does the federal government do with Garcia Zarate? We know the Department of Justice has amended the warrant to include felony weapon possession, which carries up to 10 years in prison. And the DOJ is also considering felony re-entry charges. But because he's been deported five times and there is no Kate's Law yet passing in the Senate, there are no mandatory minimum sentencing for illegal re-entry. But at the very least, the Department of Justice will have time to decide how to prosecute him. Here's what the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told Neil Cavuto just a short time ago.

And the Department of Homeland Security is not cooperating or communicating with the IRS or the Social Security Administration.

The false statement involve said presidential attorney Ty Cobb, in a statement mirror the false statement to White House officials that resulted in Flynn's resignation in February this year. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. And Cobb added the conclusion of this phase of the special council work demonstrate again that the special counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears away from prompt and reasonable conclusion. Flynn now admits he falsely told FBI agents in January that in his phone calls with the Russian ambassador the months before during the transition period, he never asked Sergey Kislyak to refrain from escalation in a diplomatic skirmish with the U.S. at that time. Flynn also falsely claim not to remember a subsequent call in which Kislyak apprised him with the Russian federation had indeed refrained from exhalation as Flynn had requested. Flynn also admitted having falsely told agency never asked the Russian ambassador on a separate occasion to vote against the pending U.N. Security Council resolution targeting Israeli settlements. And Flynn falsely told agents that he never receive from Kislyak any indication of Russia response to that request. Finally, the special counsel got Mueller -- Flynn, excuse me, to admit that he made, quote, materially false statements and omission on federal disclosure forms about his work as a lobbyist on behalf of Turkish interests. And all those admission could work against the special prosecutors if they seek to use Flynn on the witness stand against more senior figures including the president, because, Melissa, as Ty Cobb's statement shows any savvy defense counsel will surely seek to impugn the credibility of Mike Flynn on the witness stand by pointing out that he's already admitted having lied repeatedly to federal agents on federal forms, why should any set of jurors ever believe him when he's sitting on the witness stand?

But California has a jail credit system where each day behind bars counts as two days. So, Garcia Zarate already has been in jail for 29 months, meaning he has five years of credit which is more than enough to cover the crime. But the Department of Justice has unsealed an arrest warrant for Garcia Zarate for violating his probation for a drug conviction in Texas in 2015. The warrant means that despite San Francisco's sanctuary city policy, the sheriff there is obligated to turn him over to the federal government. The question, then, becomes what does the federal government do with Garcia Zarate? We know the Department of Justice has amended the warrant to include felony weapon possession, which carries up to 10 years in prison. And the DOJ is also considering felony re-entry charges. But because he's been deported five times and there is no Kate's Law yet passing in the Senate, there are no mandatory minimum sentencing for illegal re-entry. But at the very least, the Department of Justice will have time to decide how to prosecute him. Here's what the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told Neil Cavuto just a short time ago. Watch."

His exoneration as a complete travesty of justice.

I mean, there is so much outrage over this case, but listening to that guest talking to Neil Cavuto, the official who said, \"make no mistake, we will deport him,\" that doesn't offer any solace to any Americans because he's been deported before all this happened."

And I think he's going to prison for a little while, I hope that's the case when this warrant is served and they bring charges against him that emanate out of Texas. But this is a sickening thing to see that there he was on the block for justice and a jury in California decided they would pull and O.J. Simpson jury, and simply give him amnesty for the killing of Kate Steinle. And I say, he killed Kate Steinle -- and sure a person is innocent until proven guilty, there isn't a person in America who thinks that Zarate didn't kill her. So, if they don't want to find guilty of first or second- degree murder, or negligent homicide, and they found them guilty of a gun charge. Their anti-gun, but not anti-murder in San Francisco is what it looks to me credit."

They say we are the sanctuary cities, we are the sanctuary state; Gary Brownstein sanctuary legislation. They're anti- trump. And this is a way -- this is a spiteful thing.

And I looked at one of the details because I think a lot of the economic factors, this incentivizes employers, to hire illegal immigrants for jobs that maybe Americans don't want to do. But if you've been a lot around employment that would solve some of the problem at least, you talked about that you want to make the wages and benefits paid to illegal immigrants nondeductible for federal tax purposes. I mean, I almost threw up when I read that. I didn't realize you could deduct on your federal taxes, wages that you paid to someone who was here illegally. You're not supposed to hire and pay someone who is here illegally. How can you right now deduct that on your taxes?"

But the practice is that the IRS allows deductions, they won't check to see if you're hiring illegals. The Social Security Administration was stopped under Obama sending out no match letters, so hundreds of people can use the same Social Security Number and befalls illegal employees operating under that identification. And the Department of Homeland Security is not cooperating or communicating with the IRS or the Social Security Administration. This bill that I introduced, and I offered this as an amendment to H.R-1, this tax bill, that's being debated right over my shoulder right now as I stand here in this Capitol building is $254,000,000,000 pay for that says you can't deduct your wages paid to illegals, but if you're an employer and you use verify, then you get safe harbor.

They're talking about, when he's done with his time serve for this gun charge, which is going to be very soon, that he's going to be turned over to the DOJ, others are vowing to deport him. I'm worried that maybe none of that happens. I mean, he's been released before when others were looking to pick him up. What do think are the odds of that?"

Before they didn't want him; he was a low-level criminal who had merely drug and alcohol offenses on his record. They didn't issue a warrant when it all went bad, they came back and pointed a finger at the San Francisco authorities because that's what law enforcement does -- they blame each other. But this time, they will not let that happen. The first time, make no mistake, it was a mistake by the federal government and by ICE because they didn't issue a warrant. This time they will issue a warrant, they will grab him and they will try him on weapons violations or on the illegal entry. There's enough to try him. And you have the right point initially, we should not be deporting him. If you deport him, he'll come back. He belongs in federal prison."

      "speaker": "DAVID WOHL, ATTORNEY AND CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR",

And we all know that the local authorities in San Francisco, by the way, they had a detainer. They could have held Garcia Zarate for the federal authorities to pick him up before they released him last time. They just chose not to. They have a disdain for immigration law, they have disdain for law and order. And guess what? If the federal authorities come to pick him up, because he's going to be released when he's sentenced because of his credit for time served. If they decide to start the law again and release him, then the federal authorities will be detained, will be arrested, and will be prosecuted for obstruction of justice and America will applaud. So, we look out for that. Mr. Trump's passionate about this. He's been since I -- when I first met him, this was his number one priority. And now, this case, this acquittal just bolsters the wall, bolsters the sanctuary cities-- defunding -- and they're both going to happen."

I mean, doesn't it seem like Kate Steinle's family could sue the city of San Francisco? They didn't follow federal law or -- I mean, could they sue whoever dropped the ball here? It would be civil charges at least based on what happened -- go ahead."

The prosecutor's overreached, they overcharged. This was never a first-degree murder, it was never murder one, it wasn't premeditated. The shooter was 73 feet away from the victim, it ricocheted off a peer -- the bullet ricocheted off a pier. It was a complete accident. So, they were never going to get murder one.

And on the personal side, despite Democratic claims that this helps very few people, the joint committee on taxation says 60 percent, 60 percent of U.S. Households will get a tax cut; eight percent will pay him more money. And despite all the charges that this will only help the rich, that same committee found that for families making between $50,000-$75,000 per year, 80 percent of them get a tax cut of a $100 or more.

Sir, thank you so much for joining us tonight. One of the criticisms of this, as I have heard people say, that this is just a tax cut for corporations.

      "speaker": "MARK SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS",
      "utterance": "Well, let's say it does provide significant tax relief because what's happened across the globe is that other countries have lower their tax rate, which is why so many countries have relocated overseas and we've lost thousands and thousands of jobs. The reason we're lowering the rate to 20 percent is that puts us right about the average of an industrialized nations. In fact, Great Britain is going below that to 17 percent, Ireland's already at 12 percent, the countries that president recently visited in Asia are below 20 percent as well. So, by lowering that 20 percent, the Council of Economic Advisors study suggests that the average working families will see a $4,000 increase in their wages."

It is targeted towards the middle-income families, and so they will reduce the rates they're paying, they'll also credits for each of the children and their family. But, one that's important thing here is the individual mandate is something that 80 percent of people pay in that tax earning $50,000 or below.

If you cut corporate taxes for our viewers at home, that raises wages, it lowers prices on the stock they're going to go out and buy, it provides more jobs.

We're hopeful that Congress will begin pulling back on a lot of the programs that we have. But to your earlier point, the tax cuts generally grow, and we need that growth to actually pay for our national security needs. During the Obama administration, we grew at a 1.8 percent average.

Clearly officials here at the White House tonight are bracing for General Flynn, now actively cooperating with the special counsel's investigation, to say all manner of things. And with that in mind, the lawyer for the president has already begun painting Flynn as an unreliable witness, noting that he only served 24 days as White House national security advisor and describing him as an Obama administration official. The false statement involve said presidential attorney Ty Cobb, in a statement mirror the false statement to White House officials that resulted in Flynn's resignation in February this year. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. And Cobb added the conclusion of this phase of the special council work demonstrate again that the special counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears away from prompt and reasonable conclusion. Flynn now admits he falsely told FBI agents in January that in his phone calls with the Russian ambassador the months before during the transition period, he never asked Sergey Kislyak to refrain from escalation in a diplomatic skirmish with the U.S. at that time. Flynn also falsely claim not to remember a subsequent call in which Kislyak apprised him with the Russian federation had indeed refrained from exhalation as Flynn had requested. Flynn also admitted having falsely told agency never asked the Russian ambassador on a separate occasion to vote against the pending U.N. Security Council resolution targeting Israeli settlements. And Flynn falsely told agents that he never receive from Kislyak any indication of Russia response to that request. Finally, the special counsel got Mueller -- Flynn, excuse me, to admit that he made, quote, materially false statements and omission on federal disclosure forms about his work as a lobbyist on behalf of Turkish interests. And all those admission could work against the special prosecutors if they seek to use Flynn on the witness stand against more senior figures including the president, because, Melissa, as Ty Cobb's statement shows any savvy defense counsel will surely seek to impugn the credibility of Mike Flynn on the witness stand by pointing out that he's already admitted having lied repeatedly to federal agents on federal forms, why should any set of jurors ever believe him when he's sitting on the witness stand? Melissa."

Thanks for joining us, sir. So he pled guilty to lying to the FBI, and he was lying about whether or not he had reached out to the Russians before President Trump took office and the conversation there, but even if he did do that, it's not illegal. So the question everybody is left with is why would he lie?"

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, there is nothing in this indictment that move the ball significantly in terms of any crime associated with collusion and the Trump White House. What this does is it admits a crime committed by General Flynn in making false statement to investigators. That is very much predictable development and Washington people tend to go to jail not for the underlying scandal, but how they respond to it."

      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "We'll get to that in one second. You say he fell into the classic trap which is lying to federal authorities of any type, in this case the FBI about what went on. The question we're all left with is it doesn't make sense why he'd lie to them because what he went back and then was forced to say was true wasn't a crime. I mean, it may violet the -- act, but that's a zillion years old and everyone said that no one ever prosecutes based on that, so it doesn't make any sense. Help it make sense for us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, it's always a mystery to me when you have powerful figures who makes misinterpretation within the FBI. They're fully aware of these laws. Sometimes it's because there's cities fill with a personality type that feel they can talk their way around problems. Sometimes it's just a lack of memory. If there is an indication that Comey's people did not believe that he was intentionally evasive when he gave this information that would obviously change with Mueller's people. But what's interesting about this deal is it's a pretty good deal."

    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "OK. So the implication of that, that is a pretty good deal, is that he's giving them something in return. And it was said that he was directed to reach out by a senior official in the Trump transition team. There were reports earlier from ABC that they sort of walked back after the report tank the market, and the market came back as well, that he was willing to testify against the president. What's the likelihood of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, there's no indication that the president is the person being referenced here. There is a reference to helping in the prosecution of another person. That could be any number of people. So I don't think you can really speculate on this. It's clear that this is someone who is very high-ranking, had a lot of contact with a lot of people. But there is nothing here that indicates a conspiracy thus far. The most damaging type of information from Flynn would be that he misrepresented at the behest of someone. But I also would have to disagree about one thing. I think that Flynn would be an effective witness. I don't believe that he is such damaged goods."

      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, there's a couple of different possibilities. I mean, when you have someone like Flynn who serve a matinee target, you know, this is the guy you usually give deals to incriminate, not deals to benefit. You only do that if the charges would be difficult to prove against him, that's not the case here, or he brings deliverables. The question is deliverables against who? People suggested it might be Kushner, it might be Manafort, or could be someone else, but we really don't know."

His powerful message to other parents ahead. And breaking new details tonight in the Matt Lauer sexual-harassment scandal, one of the reporter who first broke the story is here on that.

The cast comes days after North Korea fired a intercontinental ballistic missile with the range of hitting anywhere in the United States. Hawaiian official say today's test was done to make sure the public know what they should do in case of an imminent attack. If a missile is launched, residents and tourists would have less than 20 minutes to take shelter. Also developing tonight, more women come forward accusing the former NBC today show cohost Matt Lauer of sexual harassment and more. We are learning the highest-paid anchor and news may not be seeing any more of that money. There's been speculation Lauer would receive a payout in the millions after all this, but new reports suggest he will not be paid, quote, past his last day of work. Meanwhile, NBC executives are facing mounting criticism about what they knew and when. As Variety reports, quote, several women told Variety they complained to executives at the network about Lauer's behavior which fell on deaf ears given the lucrative advertising surrounding today. Here now is the woman who wrote that expose, Variety reporter, Elizabeth Wagmeister. Now we were on Tucker Carlson Show last night, and you said you were getting more calls, and as you go out there and you're on the show and you advance the story, I imagine even more people who knew things and where victims have reached out to you, is that true?"

      "speaker": "ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, VARIETY REPORTER",
      "utterance": "That's absolutely right. I was scrabbling to get here on time because I've been on the phone all day long. So we have been getting -- when he was on Tucker with us last night, we cover the story, we've been reporting this for two months, and we feel really grateful that people are trusting us to reach out. They want those stories to be told. It feels like we're in a moment now where voices are finally being heard and listened too. So we've had a lot of women who either claimed that they have been harassed coming to us, but also just people who have information telling us I need to be off the record, but I want to share this with you. My inbox has been very full and my phone has been buzzing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "And it's not just about Matt Lauer, I mean, they've been coming out to you about. And that was my point on the show last night is when I said before this was going on, it's not an NBC problem, it's not a Fox problem, it's going on at every network. It's going on -- we're seeing it in politics, but the people I was specifically talking about when I predicted the state was coming months ago are still out there and they're working at NBC and other networks. Did you hear about other people beyond Matt Lauer?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGMEISTER",
      "utterance": "We have and I'm not going to name specific names, but you are right. This is a widespread problem. It's not just NBC, but when it comes to NBC, there's a lot of discussion about who knew what, how long they knew it for, and why they would be protecting Matt Lauer. Now the obvious answer is he made a ton of money for the network. He's been there -- was there, rather, for over 20 years. And The Today Show this past year brought in $500 million in advertising revenue. The show is a big moneymaker, but there are other questions too. We've had many women and many sources and our reporting tell us that they did raise their concerns about Matt Lauer's conduct with people in management position. Now of course NBC's statement said they were only aware of one claim, but I think they're referring to an official H.R. complaint and they're being a paper trail. People told us they did raise their concerns, they spoke to managers, and nothing was done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "So that's a really important part of this story for our audience to understand and it's a huge change that is happened. In the past when you heard about something when something we would go and either talk to a manager, but your only choice was talking to a manager, talking to H.R., or hiring an attorney. And all these things are really daunting because it could go on deaf ears, there could be retribution, or hiring an attorney could be really expensive and you still be retribution. Something has change where now all of a sudden because of the moment we're in, if somebody out there has a problem or knows of anything even if it didn't happen to them, they can talk to a reporter and you can investigate it."

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "So my question is, what has changed? Because in the past, if I had called another reporter about something that was going on in a network, that reporter would have been afraid to go with the story, similar to what we heard about happening with Ronan Farrow and the Weinstein story. The reporter -- they would -- gosh, I need so much evidence, I need proof, I need this, but now there's more belief. It seems like you guys are able to go -- what's the difference? What has happened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGMEISTER",
      "utterance": "You know, I think the difference is the moment that we are living in, and I don't mean this whole spiraling out of sexual harassment in Hollywood. What I mean is the era of social media has really changed. I actually interviewed Laura -- who actually works for the Fox affiliate in L.A., and she was one of the women who came forward with Harvey Weinstein. And she told me with social media, you can't hide anything anymore because you can put your story out there, and it's there and it's documented. So I think that's one big change. And also, in Ronan Farrow's piece for the New Yorker, he did write that one of the women, and I forget her name, but one of the women, she went to the police, they wired her, she went to the hotel, and nothing happened. So these women they feel like they're going to speak up and is going to happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCIS",
      "utterance": "And now there's social media and reporters and all these sort of things. Keep up the good work, keep us posted. You know, this is a way for people to get their stories out there. Thank you so much. Up next, he had his whole life in front of him, the son of one of our nation's decorated military heroes, the victim of the opioid crisis. Retired admiral Sandy Winnefeld with his story next."

      "utterance": "President Trump has made the nation's opioid crisis a top priority for his administration. Every nine minutes an American dies for a drug overdose. It is now the leading cause of death for people under the age of 50, tragic statistics our next guest knowns all too well. This past September, his 19-year-old son moved into his college dorm only to be found unresponsive three days later, the victim of an overdose of a fentanyl- laced batch of heroin. Earlier, Martha spoke with retired-four star army -- navy admiral, James Sandy Winnefeld, who previously served as vice chairman of the joint chief of staff, with a distinguish career that included helping lead combat operations immediately after 9/11. MARTHA MACCALLUM, \"THE STORY\" HOST: Admiral, thank you very much for speaking out about this and about your family's experience and for your service, of course, to the country as well. You write movingly about this in a piece that you just put out and you talk about the last days of his life and how excited you and your wife were that he was doing so much better when you dropped him off at college, sir."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. Jonathan had been through 15 months of intensive inpatient recovery. He was coming back as our son. It was remarkable to see his progress. He had gotten his emergency medical technician qualification. He wanted to help other people and he was really excited about starting school because he ultimately wanted to be a paramedic fireman. It's the Jekyll and Hyde nature of addiction that that molecule had buried itself so deeply in his brain that it came back and got him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, it's so heart wrenching. And why did he relapse after he had made so much progress?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WINNEFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a very insidious thing, addiction, particularly opioid addiction where that molecule buries its way into your brain and it never really leaves. The transition process from treatment into -- back into society, back into a normal life, is a very fragile process. He did not make it through that. As it turns out, as part of his EMT qualifications, the state of Denver ask that he gets an EKG qualification, and it turns out that where he was taking that night course was right near and open air heroin market, and it doesn't take much offering heroin to someone walking on the streets for relapse to occur and we're pretty sure think that's exactly what happened with Jonathan."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Unbelievable. Now you feel that ending that kind of situation, what do you think is the most powerful thing that can happen when you hear about the White House's efforts, do you feel like enough is being done and what specifically do you want them to do to prevent what happened to your son?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WINNEFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, this really is a national security emergency, not a public health emergency. When you consider over 64,000 people killed in the last year, and the White House figure is $504 billion of economic impact on this country each year, that sound like a national emergency to me. And to me -- I can't obviously spend all the time going into great detail, but there are five interrelated things that have to be done. We've got to raise the level of public awareness, particularly, lowering the stigma associated with addiction. We need to amped up and more creatively our prevention efforts in schools, in the workplace, and across society. We need to take the prescription process and get that under more control. We need to get the heroin itself under control by supporting law enforcement and other entities. And finally, we definitely need to increase the capacity, the quality, and the affordability of treatment that is so important."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And as you say and your wife says and you two have been so strong through this and I know that speaking out as part of what you want to do to try to fix this problem, but if it can happen in your beautiful, loving family to your wonderful son, it can truly happen to anyone."
