And it never made any sense from the beginning. I think what the more likely scenario is, is that General Flynn was out of money. How do we know that? Not because he's told me, but because he had to sell his house to pay his legal bills. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then what you have seen is, even though it's been a year basically since he said, look, fine, I lied to you guys, you can bust me on this, knowing that he's not going to get any jail time, Mueller then comes out, does -- says, oh, we're not going to give this guy any jail time, well, knowing that, for all this time, likely, this was just a way for General Flynn to just end the investigation against him.",

Right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes on Robert Mueller being forced to pull back the curtain on how the special counsel parlayed the controversial use of FBI tactics to take down Michael Flynn. Also ahead, Congressman Tim Ryan, the first Democrat to challenge Nancy Pelosi for House speaker, on a federal judge ruling Obamacare unconstitutional. Plus, Congressman Darrell Issa, who comes face to face with Jim Comey this upcoming week. And former Attorney General Michael Mukasey on the man President Trump picked to be the next attorney general. All that, plus the panel of Steve Moore and Art Laffer, as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn set to be sentenced this Tuesday for lying to the FBI. It comes as the special counsel sharply rebukes Flynn's legal team for suggesting that federal agents manipulated him into not telling the truth, this amid growing questions over how the FBI handled that interview. Joining me right now in an exclusive interview from the World Ag Expo in Tulare, California, is House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. Mr. Chairman, it's good to see you this morning.

I want to get your thoughts on all of that. But, first, we heard about the sentencing for Michael Flynn. He will be sentenced this week. But there's a lot of debate on whether or not the conduct that the FBI did in terms of getting him to say he lied was really not good conduct. Tell me about that. There was a Wall Street Journal op-ed, and they said it was entrapment, that Michael Flynn was trapped into saying that he broke the law. Your reaction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what was likely is, is that General Flynn was just out of money. If you look at some of the documentation that's come out in the last week, I think most notable is the one line that says that General Flynn actually knew that the agents must have had the transcripts. So, look, General Flynn is the former head of the DIA. He -- 30 years of military service. He has to know, when the agents start to talk about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, that they have the transcripts, not to mention that, remember, that -- some of that had already leaked out. So just General Flynn knows that they had the transcripts, so why is General Flynn going to lie about something that he knows they have exactly what he said? And it never made any sense from the beginning. I think what the more likely scenario is, is that General Flynn was out of money. How do we know that? Not because he's told me, but because he had to sell his house to pay his legal bills. And then what you have seen is, even though it's been a year basically since he said, look, fine, I lied to you guys, you can bust me on this, knowing that he's not going to get any jail time, Mueller then comes out, does -- says, oh, we're not going to give this guy any jail time, well, knowing that, for all this time, likely, this was just a way for General Flynn to just end the investigation against him."

What's your reaction to their conduct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, one of the things is, is that we were actually never able to interview the second FBI agent that was there in the interview. I would -- we have Chuck Grassley, Senator Grassley, and his team have been asking to get those -- the original FBI reports that came out of that Flynn interview. So there's so much that's -- that's out there that we need to know still, that I am really hopeful that the judge didn't just receive this interview with Peter Strzok that you saw that he got on Friday afternoon. I really do hope that he actually got all the memorandums, all the memos, everything that was written after that, because it was clear from all of our investigation that we have done that the FBI agents who had interviewed Flynn didn't think that General Flynn was lying. And then it doesn't pass a simple straight-face test that General Flynn would lie, when he knows that they have the transcripts of his conversation with the Russian ambassador."

And so if the FBI wanted to send agents into the White House itself to interview a senior official, you would work through the White House counsel, and they will be discussions and approvals on who would be there. And I thought, it's early enough. Let's just send a couple guys over."

    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "It's frightening, Maria, that the head of the FBI, who is on a 10 - year appointment, the reason that we have 10-year appointments is so that there is some continuity of government. So the job of the bureaucracy is to support no matter who the people decide wins the election. So whether it's a Republican or a Democrat, the bureaucracy there in Washington and the swamp should be there to support the administration, not take advantage of the administration. And that's why you -- that's why you hear this called the swamp there in Washington, D.C. It's for exactly cases like this, where you have the FBI director, who is on a 10-year term, who decides he's going to take advantage of a disorganized transition going into Washington, as he put it. And that is, I think -- above all else, that's alarming that anybody in the federal bureaucracy would think that way. And I think that's why you're seeing so many Americans disillusioned with Washington. And, in fact, I don't think you're going to -- Donald Trump has done everything he can do to try to drain the swamp, as he calls it. I don't think any of that's going to happen until you start to get some of these agencies out of Washington, D.C. When you have 90 percent of the populous in Washington, D.C., and 90 percent of the work force who vote extreme left and vote for Democrats, you have an unsustainable system. And so I think it would be helpful to get the EPA, Department of Interior, some of these agencies out to maybe where the rest of America lives, and they might be a little closer to the people."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "My guess is, is that the Mueller team, they had to get rid of Page and Strzok because the I.G. discovered that they were biased against the -- against the White House and the people that they were investigating. And so I think it was a simple matter of what we have seen DOJ and FBI do in numerous cases here, is that they -- they quickly move to hide the ball and cover up their tracks, hoping that no one would actually catch them in this. And the fact that you have two biased agents, and you would -- you would erase any of their phones, what should have immediately happened is, is those phones -- any dedicated public servant would have said, look, I'm not going to obstruct any investigation. These employees did wrong. Those phones should have been -- been turned over immediately to the I.G., so the I.G. could conduct an investigation. Since they didn't do that, you have to wonder. I mean, these are sophisticated operators, some of the best operators that we have in all of government, that have worked at DOJ and FBI for a long time. The fact that they wouldn't turn these over is just another alarming fact and a disturbing set of facts that continues in this whole fiasco."

Therefore, I think it's important, if the president doesn't want his hands on it, we have to have somebody, some office that's going to look at all of these issues and all of these documents that need to be declassified. I think, if the president was to create some type of office like this -- I'm going to be working with my colleagues to work on and send some example over to the president of a transparency type of office, so that -- so that the Congress, the American people, others can put in requests of documents or issues that they want declassified. That way, the president doesn't have to take this full burden, full burden on, and the Congress has somewhere where we can go to, to try to avoid the swamp creatures, let's say, from getting involved and ensuring that the American public is kept in the dark. We need to make sure that there's light. I always say that sunlight is the best disinfectant in Washington. The more that we can get declassified, I think the better. And I think an easy way to do it is to create an office that actually just works directly under the White House that specializes in evaluating this documentation to get -- and errs on the side of, the more sunlight, the better, to make sure that everything that we want declassified gets declassified."

Now you have got whistle- blowers coming out on the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation.

You have -- you have over 40 percent of the American people believe that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, even though there is not one shred of evidence that that happened. And, in fact, the only evidence that we know for sure is that the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluded directly with the Russians, OK, by hiring the foreign agent to go talk to Russians to get dirt on the other candidate. The same is true for the -- this Clinton Foundation investigation. Let's not forget that one of the lawyers for the Clinton Foundation is serving on Mueller's team looking into the president. Let's also not forget that you had the Clinton Foundation taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from not just Russians, but other countries, and at the same time while those countries had business before the State Department when Hillary Clinton was there. So there's -- there's all -- there's all kinds of circumstantial evidence. We have been looking this -- looking at this, under the direction of Peter King, our -- my colleague on the Intelligence Committee. We have -- we have lots of things that look really bad.

But what we found is that is, is that they're moving in with -- first with leverage, like loaning money, building infrastructure. I think most concerning is when they get ahold of the electrical grid, they get ahold of the banking system, and then they go in with companies like Huawei or ZTE, and they offer basically free infrastructure, so free communications infrastructure. And my warning to a lot of our allies in the countries that I meet with is, look, there's nothing for free. What the Chinese are doing with that is, is that they're ensuring that they control the communications infrastructure, so then they can monitor, for economic purposes, those businesses and others that they may want to get involved in, so that they have total control and manipulation capability over those countries and governments."

And in today's world, with the eve-growing and quickly-changing ways that we communicate, if -- if routers are put in -- and this is something that we have worked on for many years on the House Intelligence Committee, looking at -- routers can take that information and quickly route the information quickly back to China, where then they can comb through it."

And for us to lose any kind of universality or help to give these families for health care, I think is a mistake for our country. It allows us to be healthy, competitive. It's helped business in a lot of ways. So, I think this is a mistake by the court. And I don't quite understand it, because they're talking about the individual mandate, which in many, many states, there's an individual mandate for car insurance. That's something that has been done all over the country to say, we know you're going to get in the car accident, so you need car insurance.

They're doing everything right. And their kids need health care. I would hope we could come together. We used to be able to. Mitt Romney passed it in Massachusetts. The plan, ultimately, the Affordable Care Act plan, was really a Republican plan back in the day.

So, I think the impact won't be -- won't be huge, to be quite honest with you. But, again, it's a sign of the dysfunction in Washington. We have got to figure out how to come together here around some basic budgets. I mean, we believe in border security. I believe in border security. We have technologies today that are -- far surpass a wall. I mean, this is not the 15th century."

And let's find a pathway for people to pay a fine, pay their back taxes, learn English, if they don't already know it, and come into the country in the next six, seven years, and start paying taxes and contributing to Social Security and Medicare and the economy and all of these things.

And I think that's a -- that's a major reform, probably one of the biggest reforms we have seen in the Democratic Caucus in decades. And that will prevent the concentration of power in our House leadership, which is a big, big reform for us.

And I think the nominee for our party in 2020 is going to be somebody who's really focused on jobs and the economy and how do we, again, get ourselves ready to compete with Russia -- Russia and China, more China economically and Russia militarily, but how do we get ready to do that?

And now that Judge Sullivan has made it pretty clear that they, in layman's terms, violated his Miranda rights, tricked him into not having a lawyer, when, in fact, he was not only a suspect, but a target, and they had transcripts, this kind of conduct, we haven't seen in a long time. It is the reason that there was a Supreme Court decision on Miranda about informing rights. And I would not be surprised a bit that the conviction of Flynn is overturned because of the Justice Department and the FBI's misconduct, and that, in fact, we go potentially all the way to Supreme Court with new protections when the FBI and the Department of Justice lies to somebody and tricks them into making statements, and then charges them with a lie that they entrapped them in."

It certainly did look like what The Wall Street Journal called entrapment. What else do you want to get from Jim Comey? When we followed your investigation all year, and we know that there were abuses to the FISA court, do you think you could move that ball forward?"

But, certainly, the FISA abuse, we're going to learn more and more. Ultimately, for the first time ever, I believe, in the next Congress, the Senate might actually have to go to a federal judge and say, let's talk about the lies you were told, because we're getting stonewalled by this Department of Justice. But tomorrow's a big day to at least ask some very specific questions on new revelations and things that we didn't get to, because Comey very carefully put a hard stop in that allowed him to get out and take a breather."

Barr previously held the title under President George H.W. Bush from 1991 through 1993. Joining me right now is Michael Mukasey. He is former U.S. attorney general under President George W. Bush. Your Honor, good to see you."

      "utterance": "Couldn't be better. Terrific choice. Not only was he attorney general at one time, but he's -- the guy is a real lawyer. He was at one time the assistant attorney general in charge of what's called the Office of Legal Counsel. That is the office that is essentially the lawyer, the lawyer for the Justice Department and the rest of the government. It attracts the best people in the department. That and the Solicitor General's Office get the best lawyers. And he headed that department. So he is -- he's a super pick. And he's also..."

      "utterance": "Absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "I'm talking about the FBI putting its finger on the scale in the 2016 election, trying to stop Donald Trump, based on those texts from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. I'm talking about the handling of the Hillary Clinton investigation, where they wrote an exoneration letter before they even interviewed her. Do you think William Barr will -- will pursue those things?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "I do. I do. And he will pursue them to the extent that he has the authority to do it. And I think he's got enough authority to do both."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's kind of -- it's kind of sad, because the trope from the beginning was resist. And the notion that somehow politicians were sent to Washington simply to harass and conduct investigations of another administration is really disturbing."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Let me move on to Michael Flynn, because you don't think this was entrapment at all."

    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Entrapment has a legal meaning. It means overbearing somebody's will. In other words, if somebody resists committing a crime, you try to persuade him to -- please and so on. And giving somebody the opportunity to commit a crime that he's otherwise inclined to commit is not entrapment, even if it sounds unfair or looks unfair."
    },

    },

      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "That's an excellent question, because I think that the truth would have been -- would have been fine. He -- at the time that he spoke to Kislyak, he talked to him about Russian sanctions. He apparently also talked to him about the resolution condemning Israel for expanding its settlements in the West Bank and expanding settlements in East Jerusalem. And he had every right to do that. He was the designee to be national security adviser. It would have been malpractice for him not to do it. He was -- they -- they interviewed him, supposedly, as -- because -- the pretext was that they were investigating a violation of the Logan Act. The Logan Act forbids private citizens from talking to any foreign government with which we have a dispute..."

      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "... about the subject of that dispute. It's been on the books for -- since 1793. It's never been prosecuted successfully. The last -- there were two prosecutions, both unsuccessful. And nobody has been prosecuted for it in modern times, including Hanoi Jane and Dennis Rodman and all the other people who were off talking to people that we had disputes with."

      "utterance": "And yet he was, what, afraid of the Logan Act?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Well, he was -- he -- I doubt that he was afraid of the Logan Act. Nobody's afraid of the Logan Act. It's probably unconstitutional."
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, why lie?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "That's a very good question. The question was -- is whether he was afraid of possible scandals about Trump's contacts with the Russians. I don't know. But he couldn't conceivably have lied out of fear of a Logan Act prosecution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "We are where we before. There is -- the -- Mueller was put in place only because it was necessary to have somebody, to have an independent counsel to investigate the question of whether there was a relationship -- a criminal relationship between the Trump campaign and the Russians. There has been no showing of any such connection. Russians have been indicted for hacking. People have been indicted for crimes that have nothing to do with the Russians. Cohen has been. Manafort has been. But nobody makes that connection."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Right."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

Millions of Americans are now facing uncertainty with their health insurance coverage after a federal judge in Texas ruled that Obamacare is unconstitutional this Friday. Let's bring in our panel. Steve Moore is a distinguished visiting fellow at Project for Economic Growth at the Heritage Foundation. Art Laffer is the founder and chairman of Laffer Associates. He was also a member of President Ronald Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board. Gentlemen, it's always a pleasure to see you both. Thanks so much for joining us."

      "utterance": "Thanks, Maria."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Let's talk about this ruling from the Texas judge. Unconstitutional. You can't have a law if you don't have some something that punishes those who don't have health insurance. So, that's why he deemed it unconstitutional. Art Laffer, you first. Your reaction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's awfully good for the economy, to be very frank. If the Obamacare were knocked out, I think it would be a huge stimulus, because Obamacare basically is a huge form of government subsidies and spending. And government spending is taxation. And I think this would be very helpful and, by the way, would also help keep down costs. And those costs are rising very rapidly in health care."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, they sure are. And even though, on average, the cost was supposed to go down next year, in some states, it's still up 80 percent or 50 percent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "I know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, it depends on where you are. Steve, what's your reaction to this? And I guess the next question is, does the Supreme Court rule the same way? Or will the Democrats and Republicans be able to come together on a new health care package next year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "utterance": "Hi, Maria. Well, I'm not a -- I'm not a lawyer. So I can't tell you what the Supreme Court is going to do. But the central contradiction of Obamacare for people who favor it has always been, look, if this is such a wonderful health care plan for people, why do you have to force them to buy it? And liberals have never had a response to that, right? And so what -- it's really interesting what Trump is doing, regardless of what the Supreme Court decides. What doesn't Trump is doing has been phenomenal on health care. They're providing Americans alternatives to Obamacare that are much cheaper. And, in fact, I think, in the next couple of years, because of what Trump is doing, you're going to see health care premiums declining. And I have two sons that are late -- their late 20s just getting started with their career, Maria. They can't afford Obamacare. They can go out under Trump's plan and find a health insurance plan that costs them half as much as Obamacare."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, the next catalyst on this will be the Supreme Court ruling then, gentlemen, you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, the Supreme Court, just remember, the five justices that upheld ACA before are still on the court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Good point. OK. So you think that this could actually reverse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "By the way, Maria, I don't know that that's going to be determinative."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "But that's -- that's the way it is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "utterance": "You know, the other irony of Obamacare, by the way, is, remember, the title of that law is the Affordable Care Act."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "utterance": "And yet -- and yet the premiums for -- in most states have doubled since Obamacare was put in place. It's the unaffordable care act."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, very good point there, Steve."
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

      "utterance": "Yes."

      "utterance": "We might see a partial government shutdown on Friday, the 21st. What are the -- what's the impact?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "It's political primarily, I believe. I don't think there will be much economic impact. It's just not large enough. Most of the government is already funded. And it will be just a delay. For a lot of those others, those pays will be retroactively compensated for. But it's a political issue. And the question is, that political issue will determine which side has the strength and the political power to make it through."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. All right, real quick, the big debate for markets and for all of us are, are we going to see a slowdown in the economy in the next two years?"
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Steve, your prediction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOORE",

      "utterance": "Yes."
