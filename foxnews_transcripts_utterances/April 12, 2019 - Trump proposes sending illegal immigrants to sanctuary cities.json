Two sets of facts. Number one, it is the position of the Democratic Party that illegal aliens held by ICE should be released into the country, into our communities. During the negotiations to end the government shutdown, Democrats, their official position, negotiating position, was that we should limit amount the of beds that ICE to 35,000, and they expressly said for the purpose of forcing the Trump administration to release noncriminal aliens into the community. So they're for releasing them into the communities. Second, they created sanctuary cities. This is their policy, for the purpose of giving sanctuary to illegal aliens. You've got Mayor de Blasio wants to offer them free health care. You've got Stacey Abrams who wants them to vote in local elections. Governor Newsom wants to make the entire state a sanctuary.

During the negotiations to end the government shutdown, Democrats, their official position, negotiating position, was that we should limit amount the of beds that ICE to 35,000, and they expressly said for the purpose of forcing the Trump administration to release noncriminal aliens into the community. So they're for releasing them into the communities. Second, they created sanctuary cities. This is their policy, for the purpose of giving sanctuary to illegal aliens. You've got Mayor de Blasio wants to offer them free health care. You've got Stacey Abrams who wants them to vote in local elections. Governor Newsom wants to make the entire state a sanctuary.

      "utterance": "Yes. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": I think there are two frustrations at work. One is the president's and the administration's frustration at Congress for not tackling these immigration loopholes that are driving a lot of the illegal migration and asylum seeking. And the second frustration is more widespread. It's among Trump supporters and Republicans more generally who feel that progressives don't face up to the consequences of their own policy position, that they're all for sanctuary cities and for lax border security, but they don't have to feel the impacts that the communities on the border do."

They took some of those seats back except William Hurd who doesn't support the president on immigration. So when people say the border feels differently than Democrats, that's actually not necessarily true. They keep electing Democrats to those Congressional districts."

    {
      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "I think we are all making a mistake if we're focusing so much on the border, right? The Trump administration is checked by Congress, but presidents have a lot of latitude in foreign policy. You might want to take a step back and in addition to this legislative package they might be working on, think about some military, diplomatic, and political and economic assistance to the countries where these migrants are coming from and are being driven away from their homes by these gangs and state failure. There, in foreign policy, Trump would have far more latitude."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And the Secretary of State is actually in Latin America, I think, doing the opposite, trying to put leverage on some of those instead of doing it a different way. \"The New York Times,\" Marc, writes about this Homeland Security effort. \"It was not clear what Mr. Trump meant by his request or additional comments to Mr. McAleenan that he would pardon him if he encountered any legal problems as a result of taking the action of denying migrants along the border.\" The DHS has responded to this piece, saying \"At no time has the president indicated, asked, directed, or pressured the acting secretary to do anything illegal, nor would the acting secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our responsibility to enforce the law.\" A lot of things we don't know the context, whether they're said or not said, or whether there's jokes or not jokes, but DHS responded to \"The New York Times.\""

      "utterance": "I don't think that President Trump is actually serious about doing this. If he was and he could do it legally then that is fine, but I think he's trying to make a point, which is that the Democrats are becoming the party of the illegal immigration. It used to be if you go back and look at Chuck Schumer in 2009 where he gave a speech at Georgetown, said illegal immigration is wrong plain and simple. Democrats don't say that anymore. They've got de Blasio giving them health care. You've got Stacey Abrams talking about -- there was just a vote in the House, a symbolic vote, but a vote in the House. Only four Democrats voted against allowing illegal immigrants to vote in local elections. The party is becoming embracing illegal immigration, so he's basically saying, OK, you want them, you can have them."

I do think that they were given control of one of the Houses in Congress and it would be good politics and actually good policy too to come up with what a Democratic immigration policy looks like, so we're not just called the party of illegal immigration or open borders, because I actually don't think Democrats mostly are. That would be good for Democrats to do, and I would look to Nancy Pelosi to lead that effort."

We can't afford it anyway, and it's not happening!\" That's a result of the House Democrats canceling a vote on the budget plan about internal revolt, really, about that whole thing. We are back with the panel. Matthew?"

But that is not how the Democrats won the House. They won in moderate districts with centrist candidates. And as long as the party of AOC and Ilhan Omar, their House majority is in jeopardy."

      "utterance": "This is a hard set of cats to herd, let me put it that way. This is the challenge with having a diverse caucus, right. The Republicans had their challenges with the Freedom Caucus, we are seeing it now. But Matthew is right, the moderate Democrats are the ones who won this, who won the House. And the Democratic electorate writ large, as we saw from some data this week, is actually much more moderate than this progressive caucus. Nancy Pelosi has done a pretty good job up to this point at pulling them all together, keeping them together. This probably isn't the end of the budget discussion, but it was definitely a setback. They're in a three-day retreat right now at the House Caucus. I'm sure there is some interesting conversations."

      "utterance": "I think the prospects of the deal has always been bad, but I think the president is handling this correctly. Look, he's being patient with Kim Jong-un, he's keeping the door open for a deal. He's treating him respectfully, even with a little bit of flattery, but he's not letting the pressure off of the Kim regime. Keep in mind, we've now had two summits, and in each of those summits Kim Jong-un was expecting what his father got when he tried to cut a deal with the U.S., is they blow up a few useless nuclear facilities and we lift the sanctions and give them billions of dollars. And Trump has not done that, he hasn't lifted sanctions, hasn't unfrozen North Korean assets, hasn't ended the Korean War, hasn't given them diplomatic recognition. So he's not playing the North Koreans' game."

The truth is Russia has been helping North Korea avoid these sanctions. And we are in a position to call them out on it. Something like that might jar the process and maybe make North Korea more likely to strike some type of bargain."

My loser is James Comey, who told a conference this week that he never considered electronic surveillance to be spying. The man has a bestselling book.
