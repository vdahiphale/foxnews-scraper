Look, Romney reminds us that some people actually used to elevate country above party. And I was reminded when John McCain in 2008 said to that woman on the campaign trail, no, ma'am, he is not an Arab when she said that's that she thought Obama was. Do you think -- that was a decency, a fundamental decency which Mitt Romney has always, always exhibited. And who out there thinks that that's a fundamental characteristic of Donald Trump? You know, you look at what the economy is doing and where his standing is relatively to these other Democrats. He should be much stronger. It's that absence of decency. I think that's really what's dragging him down. And I don't know whether it's the State of the Union or however he's going to react to this or what his son is doing helps him.",

To me when you study what the framers said and the high bar that they said for removing a duly-elected President immediately from office and banning him or her from ever running again, it shows you that this was not to be undertaken lightly, it only applied to bribery, treason, high crimes and misdemeanors.

I've worked hard to get to ensure that there would be a vote on whether to proceed to witnesses and yet he doesn't think that that would be true of Mitt Romney.

      "speaker": "COLLINS",

And keep in mind that the House never issued a subpoena to John Bolton, that was one of the flaws in their case because they were in such a hurry to complete the articles before Christmas and yet then waited 33 days for transmitting them to the Senate. During that time, they could have subpoena John Bolton, they withdrew a subpoena to one of his top aides, Dr Charlie Kupperman. So, the House never pursued its remedies."

But there were so many of us who are Republicans in the Senate who were very critical of the call, the call was wrong, parts of the call were fine, but then the President mixed in asking a federal government to investigate a political rival and he should not have done that.

I think some of the things the President laid out in his State of the Union address last night are the things that America wants to talk about.

I'd love to say I think there's some great things that they're going to work together on, but they show that they care more about destroying the President than they do fixing problems in this country. They hate Donald Trump more than they love America. We've seen that play out over the last year and a half to three years since Donald Trump got elected. Every single day since the President took office, they have done nothing but try to take that election back and they continue to fail. And frankly, Donald Trump continues to get stronger. The more they attack him the better off he does in the country is hard to argue with any of the data points that the country is not doing infinitely better under this President. And just look at the things he laid out last night."

Do you think that there has been any impact of this whole process on him? Because he says you know that it was all perfect."

I do think going forward maybe he'll be more cautious in the way that he has those conversations, but I still don't think anything that he did in that conversation was wrong. He made a pledge to drain the swamp and go after corruption as did the newly elected President in Ukraine. And I think it was perfectly normal that two people who campaigned on that would discuss it in a phone call right after he was elected. To me, it seems perfectly normal. And in fact, a good thing that the President is trying to make sure that corruption is being looked into. So, maybe he's more cautious in the people that he includes around him. But I certainly don't think that he did anything wrong that he needs to change moving forward. One thing, I do hope that will change is the way that the Democrats approach the next several months and maybe they can work together. I think the President talked about some really incredible initiatives and some really things that could change how America moves forward over the next decade, in the next century. And it would be great if they would partner with the President on Opportunity Zones, eradicating AIDS, childhood cancer. There are so many things that they should be championing with the President instead of fighting against--"

A move prompting constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley to warn that Pelosi's actions will have lasting impact on the House adding \"if Pelosi cannot maintain the dignity and neutrality of her office at the State of the Union, she should resign as Speaker of the House of Representatives.\" Here now Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer, Co-Chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus.

We talked about paid family leave which the President talked about last night. We talked about infrastructure which we've been continuing to focus on how we rebuild our crumbling roads and bridges.

I mean what a great moment in bringing together a service member and his family, that was really heartwarming. There was so much where we and the young girl who survived, I mean to me it was a lot of the best of America we come together and actually focus together and work together. And I'm hoping and that's what I heard someone call me today about the Tuskegee Airmen because I have a Tuskegee Airmen in my district where I live, he was 100 years old, an amazing, amazing man to spend time with and you know that is what I'm hoping we all focus on and what we can get done working together, we've got a lot of work together.

I'm not going to second guess one of my colleague's motivation when they say it's -- they prayed about it and they -- their heartfelt. That's what I mean -- that's between the senator and his people back home. But to me, this was -- this -- all we did today was take a vote. It was a proxy vote on Donald Trump and his policies. And it was an abuse of a serious process. We don't settle our differences in America through impeachment. We settle them through elections. And this was the first partisan impeachment in the history of this country. I think Speaker Pelosi really hurt this country. She has tried to normalize impeachment as a routine political weapon.

If you look at 2016, he got 50 percent of the vote and half the delegates, this time around he got half that number of votes and half the delegates. And I actually had Warren and Biden, my view for them was they just needed to hit the 15 percent threshold and they did that. Now New Hampshire is a different thing. New Hampshire is a primary state. Certainly, I think Bernie is the favorite. You know, he beat Hillary by 25 plus points in 2016. He neighbors New Hampshire. I actually think Warren will outperform.

He's now officially a member of the resistance and should be expelled from the GOP.\""

You, ss I said you can have your opinions but when the team comes together at the end, he is somebody who hates Donald Trump. This is payback for 2016 for his failures. His failures. No one else's. And he's paying Donald Trump back through his vote today. And it's a disgrace."

Look, Romney reminds us that some people actually used to elevate country above party. And I was reminded when John McCain in 2008 said to that woman on the campaign trail, no, ma'am, he is not an Arab when she said that's that she thought Obama was. Do you think -- that was a decency, a fundamental decency which Mitt Romney has always, always exhibited. And who out there thinks that that's a fundamental characteristic of Donald Trump? You know, you look at what the economy is doing and where his standing is relatively to these other Democrats. He should be much stronger. It's that absence of decency. I think that's really what's dragging him down. And I don't know whether it's the State of the Union or however he's going to react to this or what his son is doing helps him."
