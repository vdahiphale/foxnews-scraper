I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" So much we don't know of what was the motivation behind the shooting today in San Jose. We have a pretty good idea of the shooter. We have very little about his motives and whether he might have been working with others. Again, this press briefing is going to be a little bit later in this hour, but, ahead of that, to Claudia Cowan on what she's learning in San Jose -- Claudia.",

That's where a gunman opened fire, killing eight people this morning, before turning the gun on himself. And authorities are also investigating the shooter's house about eight miles away, which went up in smoke right around the same time. It all started just after 6:30 a.m. this morning, local time, when police began getting calls of multiple shots fired at the maintenance facility here run by the Valley Transportation Authority, or VTA. It operates trains and buses for commuters all over Santa Clara County. According to one witness, there was a union meeting going on and a possible shift change happening as well. More than 2,000 people work for the VTA, and the gunman was one of them. He's been identified as 57-year-old Sam Cassidy, a technician who worked here at this yard. But, again, as you mentioned, the motive behind this shooting remains unknown, whether he was targeting anyone specifically. Those are questions that still need to be answered. Meantime, families are reuniting as we speak, hearing accounts of what went down. In the rush to escape the gunfire, some people hid out in empty railcars. Police have not said what kind of weapon was used or how long the shooter had worked at the VTA. But, in the meantime, the bomb squad is looking into that house fire. We are hearing reports it was filled with hundreds of rounds of ammunition, and officials with bomb-sniffing dogs also checking for explosives and other devices at both crime scenes and say there is no immediate threat to public safety. President Biden, we're told, carefully monitoring the situation. FBI agents also on scene helping local officials gather and process evidence and also try to determine a motive. Neil, Mayor Sam Liccardo was here just a short time ago. He called this a horrific day for the city of San Jose. No doubt about that -- back to you.",

They have proposed $7.1 trillion in spending since the 1st of the year. Very little of it, almost none of it has anything to do with COVID. It just has to do with spending, not paying for it or threatening to pay for it out of a tax bill that we believe was working very well whenever the pandemic started. And it's a big mistake. Let me make one example here. The $7.1 trillion, the normal discretionary spending to the federal government is $1.5 trillion. Every year, when you have covered us as we try to move that appropriations process forward, how much are we going to spend on defense, how much are we going to spend on everything else, that's total about $1.5 trillion by now. Used to be smaller. Last year, it was $1.5 trillion. This year, it would be about $1.5 trillion in the actual budget that the Biden administration gives us later this week. But in the off-budget spending, there's -- they're talking about almost four, five times what they're -- what we would normally spend. And it'll have an impact on the market. You can't give people check after check after check and not expect them to be competing more vigorously for what's out there than they would otherwise.",

Our two guidelines on infrastructure have been, it has to be really infrastructure, the kinds of things that people six months ago or every -- just people that talk about this issue would have believed, roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, water infrastructure, not the caring infrastructure, not that we're necessarily saying those things are bad. They're just not infrastructure. And the other guideline was, we are not going to get into the 2017 tax bill. It was producing great results at the beginning of the pandemic. Corporate rate made us more competitive all over the world for the first time in a long time. No inversions were occurring during that entire period of time between the time that bill went into effect. A lot of good things were happening. I think we can pay for the infrastructure part of the president's program, or at least the amount that -- what we're willing to do the infrastructure apart with user fees, with leftover money from the COVID spending. And you're right. We spent a lot of money during COVID in five bipartisan bills last year. But the Biden proposal for spending this year is double what we spent last year, when our economy was truly in a crisis. It -- we're no longer in a crisis. If we're in a crisis, it's likely to be the crisis of inflation driven by government spending.",

The option that the Democrats have that at one time they thought they were going to use was take this entire $2.5 trillion or package, where you had the caring infrastructure, the manufacturing infrastructure, the helping-people-at-home infrastructure, and they were going to do that as a reconciliation bill with 50 Democrats and the vice president.

Well, I remember walking through this airport wants to get a rental car and I was lucky to see 12 people on the whole walk. In fact, we actually shot video of it. Look at how dead this place was. The pandemic shutdown was in full effect, and people were simply not traveling. Airplane tarmacs became jumbo jet parking lots, today, almost back to normal and full of people. Memorial Day weekend this year far different than last year's. This is America's first holiday weekend with scaled-back travel restrictions and mask rules, and, of course, tens of millions of Americans, about 40 percent of the whole population, have now been totally vaccinated. And this translates into higher prices for pretty much everything travel- related. Flights are more expensive and difficult to books -- book. Planes are 90 to 95 percent full. Hotels are quickly filling up, all from pent-up demand after 16 months of pandemic. And that's also true for Airbnbs, whose prices are soaring, up 35 percent from a year ago. Rental cars are also very high in demand, and there is a national shortage of availability. Some travelers are actually paying 400 bucks a day to have some wheels. And on the ground, gas prices are high too, about $1 more per gallon than this time last year. And if you want to have a panini for lunch, well, Disneyland out in Anaheim, California, has got a deal for you. One panini, price tag, $99.99, yes, basically 100 bucks for a sandwich.

If you take a look at what capitalism, you see these woke mobs now, that CEOs are spending more time listening to these woke mobs than making sure they're doing the right thing for their shareholders and their customers. In banking, they should be focused on creditworthiness. I asked a question about, what about lending to oil and gas companies? What about lending to ranches? Of course, the climate change folks think they're terrible. And the answer I got was, frankly, pretty chilling. It says, we will continue lending to them, as long as they continue to meet their goals here basically to net zero carbon emissions. That's like saying, Neil, OK, you make widgets.

During this time, this was during a shift change, where deputies from the midnight shift and day shift were on at the same time going through a transition into different shifts. Once we received that information, deputies and surrounding officers immediately responded to the location and addressed the threat and the situation. They did not wait. They merely went into the scene and rendered first aid and rescued victims out of the building as fast as they can to figure out what was going on. I can tell you, this was a -- at a Valley Transportation Authority light rail yard, which is next door to sheriff's office headquarters. Immediately, once we received information of shots fired called, we immediately activate the Santa Clara County active shooter protocol, which activated multiple law enforcement agencies in the surrounding counties, as well as multiple fire department agencies, to initiate and activate the rescue task force, which is part of the active shooter protocol, which we will go into more detail. Multiple agencies showed up and assisted from local agencies within Santa Clara County, state level from the Office of Emergency Services, governor's office, the California Highway Patrol, and multiple federal agencies, from the Federal Bureau of Investigations, FBI, ATF, and Department of Homeland Security. I will tell you right now, with the numbers -- and it's still preliminary and it's subject to change -- we have eight victims that are pronounced deceased from today's incident from gunshot wounds. We also have one suspect who is deceased as well from this morning's incident. I can confirm with you that deputies did not exchange gunfire. And, right now, we're going to preliminary -- go with the assumption that it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound from the suspect, and deputies did not exchange gunfire. At this point, we have investigators on scene interviewing anybody that was on scene to see what exactly happened. And we have our CSI teams as well outside with -- along with conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigations assisting. Right now, if you're looking for a family member or loved one involved with this incident, we ask you to contact our reunification center, which is over here at 70 West Hedding. It's located at the Isaac Newton Auditorium. We have grief counselors on scene. The phone number to call is 408-209- 8356. I will repeat it one more time, 408-209-8356. So, this incident is going to take some time. And the reason why is because we're going to use the necessary methods to ensure the public safety for everyone. We actually had an explosives dog on scene which detected to -- some type of explosives material at the crime scene itself. At that point, we activated the sheriff's office bomb squad, who is currently on scene and render any type of suspicious packaging safe at that point. I will tell you, it's going to take a long time to render these areas safe. They have to go through every room in every building to ensure that everything is safe. So, that's such as in bringing in a bomb robot in there. And it takes time. So, I ask for your patience on gathering further information from here. It's going to be some time. Other than that, we have detectives on scene. We're doing everything we can. But I will tell you this. With the training that we have been doing with our active shooter protocol, this could have been a lot worse of a situation. This is a very unfortunate situation. But with the training and everything that we have with this protocol, this -- this could have been a lot worse than what it was, unfortunately.

And we're doing everything we can to help them, including the family reunification center. But I really want to commend the law enforcement in Santa Clara County. Several years ago, the sheriff's office, in conjunction with the county fire department, began a series of trainings for active shooter. And that training has happened throughout the county with law enforcement and all fire agencies. And why that differs is that, at the time there's an active shooter, as soon as we can get one team together, we go in. The first teams through the door were the sheriff's office and San Jose Police Department. And they're my true heroes. There was active shooting going on at that time. There were victims shot in two separate buildings. But they responded. They responded the way that they should. They took their life in their hands. And I know for sure that, when the suspect knew the law enforcement was there, he took his own life. Our deputies were right there at that time. So, it's a very complex investigation. We now know that San Jose is working on the house fire, and we're still putting that together. But our detectives are on scene and we're doing everything we can to identify the victims as soon as possible, so their loved ones can know. So, thank you very much for covering this.

You're going to learn over the course of the next number of days and weeks about the heroism of the San Jose police, saved lives, deputy sheriffs that ran, quite literally ran moments after, seconds after hearing about this incident, without any consideration of their own lives, and did an extraordinary job to save other people's lives. That said, there's a numbness I imagine some of us are feeling about this, because there's a sameness to this, anywhere USA. It just feels like this happens over and over and over again. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. It wasn't that long ago I was standing out here talking about the tragic loss of two children, one in a mother's arms, the Gilroy Festival, just here in this community down in Southern California and San Bernardino. Remember, a few years prior, Santa Barbara. Pick a state, and here we are, in the United States of America. We're experiencing something just not experienced anywhere else in the world. There's a sameness to this. And that numbness, I think, is something we're all feeling, all of us gathered here today looking at this scene, listening to governors, mayors, chiefs speaking, similar tone and terms, expression of condolences, all the right emotions and perhaps the right words. But it begs the damn question, what the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell's wrong with us? And when are we going to come to grips with this? When are we going to put down our arms, literally and figuratively, our politics, stale rhetoric, finger-pointing, all the hand-wringing, consternation that produces nothing except more fury and frustration, more scenes like this repeated over and over and over again? I say that not as a governor. I just say that as a father of four. I say that as a member of this community who cares deeply about it. So, we will - - we will have time to work through all of that. But one thing I just wanted to briefly speak to is the pain in those victims. I just spent -- we just had the privilege to spend the last few hours with the victims that are waiting to just learn if their loved one is still alive. They're dialing the phones. They can't find it. They are trying to go on and find a phone of the loved one, waiting to hear from the coroner, waiting to hear from any of us, just desperate to find out if their brother, their son, their dad, their mom is still alive. Just imagine being in their foot. I know everybody wants all the answers to all these questions, but there's no more important question and no more important answers that we owe than - - the victims of this senseless and tragic shooting. And so I'm not just going to express my condolences. I'm not just going to just express the usual platitudes. But let me just thank the heroism of those victims. The fact they can even stand up and support one another is remarkable. What a human act. And so I just want to -- we just want folks to know we're going to be there for the victims. I want folks to know, I'm here for you, Mr. Mayor, and the county, the state. And I know we have elected officials of all political stripes who want to be here for this nation. But it's time to deal with the endemic before this pandemic of gun violence, the preexisting condition, that, somehow, was sort of pushed aside last year, but now has raised its ugly head again this year, and wake up to this reality, and take a little damn responsibility, all of us, to do a little bit more and a little bit better this time, and move beyond the platitudes and the usual rhetoric that tends to mark not just these moments, but the aftermath of these moments, as all of you go away and this fades out of you, and then we rinse and repeat someplace else in this country. So, again, to the victims, to those that lost their lives and the families who lost their loved ones, yes, our hearts go out, but we are resolved to not make this meaningless, but to bring meaning at this tragic moment in our state and our nation's history. Again, thank you to all the men and women behind me and their courageousness and the incredible, incredible bravery that was demonstrable of the men and women of our San Jose Police Department and Sheriff's Office.",

Now, that, in itself, of course, may speak to a motive. But no officials, as you heard in that press conference, are confirming anything about why Mr. Cassidy may have carried out these horrific shootings today. One other thing to note, Neil, is that the home where Cassidy apparently lived, there was also a fire, which people were at -- the fire, firefighters responded to minutes after, after -- I want to emphasize -- the first calls, the first 911 calls about the shooting came in. So that may speak to a slow fuse in that building or perhaps some sort of device on a timer. That, in itself, speaks to what we heard about in this press conference, that they are concerned about the potential for explosive devices on the property of the VTA. The bomb squad is right there right now. Apparently, a bond-sniffing dog alerted at least twice to the scent of explosives. That's what gave them the alert. That is why the bomb squad was sent in.

That's where a gunman opened fire, killing eight people this morning, before turning the gun on himself. And authorities are also investigating the shooter's house about eight miles away, which went up in smoke right around the same time. It all started just after 6:30 a.m. this morning, local time, when police began getting calls of multiple shots fired at the maintenance facility here run by the Valley Transportation Authority, or VTA. It operates trains and buses for commuters all over Santa Clara County. According to one witness, there was a union meeting going on and a possible shift change happening as well. More than 2,000 people work for the VTA, and the gunman was one of them. He's been identified as 57-year-old Sam Cassidy, a technician who worked here at this yard. But, again, as you mentioned, the motive behind this shooting remains unknown, whether he was targeting anyone specifically. Those are questions that still need to be answered. Meantime, families are reuniting as we speak, hearing accounts of what went down. In the rush to escape the gunfire, some people hid out in empty railcars. Police have not said what kind of weapon was used or how long the shooter had worked at the VTA. But, in the meantime, the bomb squad is looking into that house fire. We are hearing reports it was filled with hundreds of rounds of ammunition, and officials with bomb-sniffing dogs also checking for explosives and other devices at both crime scenes and say there is no immediate threat to public safety. President Biden, we're told, carefully monitoring the situation. FBI agents also on scene helping local officials gather and process evidence and also try to determine a motive.

It's popping up in the darndest of ways in a myriad of numbers, from the price of chicken to pork or a variety of other things, including gas, including plane tickets, including cruise tickets. They're going up, up and away. What is different this time is, Americans seem to be willing to pay for those higher prices because they want to break out of this pandemic. You can't blame them for that. But when some big banking CEOs were on Capitol Hill today, they were asked about the threat of inflation and how real it was. Susan Li, what did they discover?"

Now, the White House and the Federal Reserve, Neil, say that the price spikes are only temporary, should come down. But it does risk overheating the economy, which will force interest rates to go up.

    {
      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "Well, I do think that's the case. And I think the largest reason for that is just the massive amount of spending that the Biden administration is talking about. They have proposed $7.1 trillion in spending since the 1st of the year. Very little of it, almost none of it has anything to do with COVID. It just has to do with spending, not paying for it or threatening to pay for it out of a tax bill that we believe was working very well whenever the pandemic started. And it's a big mistake. Let me make one example here. The $7.1 trillion, the normal discretionary spending to the federal government is $1.5 trillion. Every year, when you have covered us as we try to move that appropriations process forward, how much are we going to spend on defense, how much are we going to spend on everything else, that's total about $1.5 trillion by now. Used to be smaller. Last year, it was $1.5 trillion. This year, it would be about $1.5 trillion in the actual budget that the Biden administration gives us later this week. But in the off-budget spending, there's -- they're talking about almost four, five times what they're -- what we would normally spend. And it'll have an impact on the market. You can't give people check after check after check and not expect them to be competing more vigorously for what's out there than they would otherwise."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Senator, the fact of the matter is, though, that spending was excessive under Donald Trump. So were deficits and a building debt. I'm not trying to politicize it one way or the other. But there's a bipartisan deal to spend money. And I'm just wondering, does that mean that you are against this infrastructure package, even the one that your colleagues seem to be embracing closer to a trillion dollars?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "No, I think we're looking at an infrastructure package that we could pay for, and not pay for by getting into the 2017 tax bill. Our two guidelines on infrastructure have been, it has to be really infrastructure, the kinds of things that people six months ago or every -- just people that talk about this issue would have believed, roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, water infrastructure, not the caring infrastructure, not that we're necessarily saying those things are bad. They're just not infrastructure. And the other guideline was, we are not going to get into the 2017 tax bill. It was producing great results at the beginning of the pandemic. Corporate rate made us more competitive all over the world for the first time in a long time. No inversions were occurring during that entire period of time between the time that bill went into effect. A lot of good things were happening. I think we can pay for the infrastructure part of the president's program, or at least the amount that -- what we're willing to do the infrastructure apart with user fees, with leftover money from the COVID spending. And you're right. We spent a lot of money during COVID in five bipartisan bills last year. But the Biden proposal for spending this year is double what we spent last year, when our economy was truly in a crisis. It -- we're no longer in a crisis. If we're in a crisis, it's likely to be the crisis of inflation driven by government spending."

      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it should happen. One of the things we did talk about under the entire Obama administration and every six months in the Trump administration, the next thing we were going to get to was infrastructure. The country needs better roads, better bridges. We can compete more effectively if we are able to connect more effectively. We need that to happen. The option that the Democrats have that at one time they thought they were going to use was take this entire $2.5 trillion or package, where you had the caring infrastructure, the manufacturing infrastructure, the helping-people-at-home infrastructure, and they were going to do that as a reconciliation bill with 50 Democrats and the vice president. If they decide they're going to do it, that's the way they're going to have to do it, because I think Republicans are committed to infrastructure, infrastructure, and paying for that without getting into the 2017 tax bill and costing people jobs."

Well, I remember walking through this airport wants to get a rental car and I was lucky to see 12 people on the whole walk. In fact, we actually shot video of it. Look at how dead this place was. The pandemic shutdown was in full effect, and people were simply not traveling. Airplane tarmacs became jumbo jet parking lots, today, almost back to normal and full of people. Memorial Day weekend this year far different than last year's. This is America's first holiday weekend with scaled-back travel restrictions and mask rules, and, of course, tens of millions of Americans, about 40 percent of the whole population, have now been totally vaccinated. And this translates into higher prices for pretty much everything travel- related. Flights are more expensive and difficult to books -- book. Planes are 90 to 95 percent full. Hotels are quickly filling up, all from pent-up demand after 16 months of pandemic. And that's also true for Airbnbs, whose prices are soaring, up 35 percent from a year ago. Rental cars are also very high in demand, and there is a national shortage of availability. Some travelers are actually paying 400 bucks a day to have some wheels. And on the ground, gas prices are high too, about $1 more per gallon than this time last year. And if you want to have a panini for lunch, well, Disneyland out in Anaheim, California, has got a deal for you. One panini, price tag, $99.99, yes, basically 100 bucks for a sandwich. But Disney says it does serve six to eight people. Meanwhile, I just bought this panini next door here at the terminal at Starbucks, $8.03. That's a bargain. Oh."

And so I don't think that these prices, these high price tags will stay much beyond the summertime.

They have been stuck in their house for a year. But I think the bigger issue is, they are going to defer major purchases. You're going to see it in the housing market. People can't afford houses anymore. You're going to see in the auto market. There are no cars. There are no chips. Bad policy is creating more problems. You're going to see in lumber, construction. It is going to show up in major purchases. It's not going to show up in Vegas. It's not going to show up in the panini, but it's going to show up elsewhere. And I think that's where we're going to pay for it. And the consumer pays for inflation. Never forget, we all pay for these higher costs, and it passes through to every one of us."

So, if I want to go on a special vacation because I feel I have earned it, sure, maybe I will split -- spend the extra buck or two. But in the event that I really don't have to go, I don't ever want to feel like I have gotten taken advantage of, if you will. So, I will just say, no, forget all of that.

Well, that now has infiltrated the boardrooms of America. If you take a look at what capitalism, you see these woke mobs now, that CEOs are spending more time listening to these woke mobs than making sure they're doing the right thing for their shareholders and their customers. In banking, they should be focused on creditworthiness. I asked a question about, what about lending to oil and gas companies? What about lending to ranches? Of course, the climate change folks think they're terrible. And the answer I got was, frankly, pretty chilling. It says, we will continue lending to them, as long as they continue to meet their goals here basically to net zero carbon emissions. That's like saying, Neil, OK, you make widgets. But as long as you stop making widgets someday, we will keep lending to you. And so I'm very concerned that their ear is more in tune with this woke mob, woke capitalism than it is with doing the right thing for shareholders and for their customers."

      "utterance": "Deputies responded and received information that there are multiple shots fired calls located from that building. During this time, this was during a shift change, where deputies from the midnight shift and day shift were on at the same time going through a transition into different shifts. Once we received that information, deputies and surrounding officers immediately responded to the location and addressed the threat and the situation. They did not wait. They merely went into the scene and rendered first aid and rescued victims out of the building as fast as they can to figure out what was going on. I can tell you, this was a -- at a Valley Transportation Authority light rail yard, which is next door to sheriff's office headquarters. Immediately, once we received information of shots fired called, we immediately activate the Santa Clara County active shooter protocol, which activated multiple law enforcement agencies in the surrounding counties, as well as multiple fire department agencies, to initiate and activate the rescue task force, which is part of the active shooter protocol, which we will go into more detail. Multiple agencies showed up and assisted from local agencies within Santa Clara County, state level from the Office of Emergency Services, governor's office, the California Highway Patrol, and multiple federal agencies, from the Federal Bureau of Investigations, FBI, ATF, and Department of Homeland Security. I will tell you right now, with the numbers -- and it's still preliminary and it's subject to change -- we have eight victims that are pronounced deceased from today's incident from gunshot wounds. We also have one suspect who is deceased as well from this morning's incident. I can confirm with you that deputies did not exchange gunfire. And, right now, we're going to preliminary -- go with the assumption that it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound from the suspect, and deputies did not exchange gunfire. At this point, we have investigators on scene interviewing anybody that was on scene to see what exactly happened. And we have our CSI teams as well outside with -- along with conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigations assisting. Right now, if you're looking for a family member or loved one involved with this incident, we ask you to contact our reunification center, which is over here at 70 West Hedding. It's located at the Isaac Newton Auditorium. We have grief counselors on scene. The phone number to call is 408-209- 8356. I will repeat it one more time, 408-209-8356. So, this incident is going to take some time. And the reason why is because we're going to use the necessary methods to ensure the public safety for everyone. We actually had an explosives dog on scene which detected to -- some type of explosives material at the crime scene itself. At that point, we activated the sheriff's office bomb squad, who is currently on scene and render any type of suspicious packaging safe at that point. I will tell you, it's going to take a long time to render these areas safe. They have to go through every room in every building to ensure that everything is safe. So, that's such as in bringing in a bomb robot in there. And it takes time. So, I ask for your patience on gathering further information from here. It's going to be some time. Other than that, we have detectives on scene. We're doing everything we can. But I will tell you this. With the training that we have been doing with our active shooter protocol, this could have been a lot worse of a situation. This is a very unfortunate situation. But with the training and everything that we have with this protocol, this -- this could have been a lot worse than what it was, unfortunately. So, that, being said, I'm going to pass it on to Sheriff Laurie Smith, who's going to give you further information from there."

And we're doing everything we can to help them, including the family reunification center. But I really want to commend the law enforcement in Santa Clara County. Several years ago, the sheriff's office, in conjunction with the county fire department, began a series of trainings for active shooter. And that training has happened throughout the county with law enforcement and all fire agencies. And why that differs is that, at the time there's an active shooter, as soon as we can get one team together, we go in. The first teams through the door were the sheriff's office and San Jose Police Department. And they're my true heroes. There was active shooting going on at that time. There were victims shot in two separate buildings. But they responded. They responded the way that they should. They took their life in their hands. And I know for sure that, when the suspect knew the law enforcement was there, he took his own life. Our deputies were right there at that time. So, it's a very complex investigation. We now know that San Jose is working on the house fire, and we're still putting that together. But our detectives are on scene and we're doing everything we can to identify the victims as soon as possible, so their loved ones can know. So, thank you very much for covering this.

      "utterance": "Thank you. Let me thank the sheriff, the mayor, our police chief captain, all the men and women in uniform. You're going to learn over the course of the next number of days and weeks about the heroism of the San Jose police, saved lives, deputy sheriffs that ran, quite literally ran moments after, seconds after hearing about this incident, without any consideration of their own lives, and did an extraordinary job to save other people's lives. That said, there's a numbness I imagine some of us are feeling about this, because there's a sameness to this, anywhere USA. It just feels like this happens over and over and over again. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. It wasn't that long ago I was standing out here talking about the tragic loss of two children, one in a mother's arms, the Gilroy Festival, just here in this community down in Southern California and San Bernardino. Remember, a few years prior, Santa Barbara. Pick a state, and here we are, in the United States of America. We're experiencing something just not experienced anywhere else in the world. There's a sameness to this. And that numbness, I think, is something we're all feeling, all of us gathered here today looking at this scene, listening to governors, mayors, chiefs speaking, similar tone and terms, expression of condolences, all the right emotions and perhaps the right words. But it begs the damn question, what the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell's wrong with us? And when are we going to come to grips with this? When are we going to put down our arms, literally and figuratively, our politics, stale rhetoric, finger-pointing, all the hand-wringing, consternation that produces nothing except more fury and frustration, more scenes like this repeated over and over and over again? I say that not as a governor. I just say that as a father of four. I say that as a member of this community who cares deeply about it. So, we will - - we will have time to work through all of that. But one thing I just wanted to briefly speak to is the pain in those victims. I just spent -- we just had the privilege to spend the last few hours with the victims that are waiting to just learn if their loved one is still alive. They're dialing the phones. They can't find it. They are trying to go on and find a phone of the loved one, waiting to hear from the coroner, waiting to hear from any of us, just desperate to find out if their brother, their son, their dad, their mom is still alive. Just imagine being in their foot. I know everybody wants all the answers to all these questions, but there's no more important question and no more important answers that we owe than - - the victims of this senseless and tragic shooting. And so I'm not just going to express my condolences. I'm not just going to just express the usual platitudes. But let me just thank the heroism of those victims. The fact they can even stand up and support one another is remarkable. What a human act. And so I just want to -- we just want folks to know we're going to be there for the victims. I want folks to know, I'm here for you, Mr. Mayor, and the county, the state. And I know we have elected officials of all political stripes who want to be here for this nation. But it's time to deal with the endemic before this pandemic of gun violence, the preexisting condition, that, somehow, was sort of pushed aside last year, but now has raised its ugly head again this year, and wake up to this reality, and take a little damn responsibility, all of us, to do a little bit more and a little bit better this time, and move beyond the platitudes and the usual rhetoric that tends to mark not just these moments, but the aftermath of these moments, as all of you go away and this fades out of you, and then we rinse and repeat someplace else in this country. So, again, to the victims, to those that lost their lives and the families who lost their loved ones, yes, our hearts go out, but we are resolved to not make this meaningless, but to bring meaning at this tragic moment in our state and our nation's history. Again, thank you to all the men and women behind me and their courageousness and the incredible, incredible bravery that was demonstrable of the men and women of our San Jose Police Department and Sheriff's Office."

It is an extremely sad day in the history of Santa Clara County, but I'm also very proud of the response by law enforcement, and then the VTA family, taking care of the loved ones, the survivors of those that passed, and the district attorney's office that has stepped forward with the services they provided two years ago to the people in Gilroy and continue to provide every day and will provide to the survivors, loved ones, and family of those that passed.

We do know that he was an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. We do know that all of his eight victims, the eight people he shot dead, were also employees of the VTA. Now, that, in itself, of course, may speak to a motive. But no officials, as you heard in that press conference, are confirming anything about why Mr. Cassidy may have carried out these horrific shootings today. One other thing to note, Neil, is that the home where Cassidy apparently lived, there was also a fire, which people were at -- the fire, firefighters responded to minutes after, after -- I want to emphasize -- the first calls, the first 911 calls about the shooting came in. So that may speak to a slow fuse in that building or perhaps some sort of device on a timer. That, in itself, speaks to what we heard about in this press conference, that they are concerned about the potential for explosive devices on the property of the VTA. The bomb squad is right there right now. Apparently, a bond-sniffing dog alerted at least twice to the scent of explosives. That's what gave them the alert. That is why the bomb squad was sent in. And that is why the sheriff says this will be a long investigation, but, bottom line, eight people killed, the gunman apparently shooting himself -- Neil."

It's going to make it very difficult for the investigators, because, when you're looking for motive, you look into their media, their computers, their notes, their possessions, and then that all that is presumably not as accessible now. They can always get it in the cloud, but it takes a lot longer. But I see this person as unusual, in the sense that he was committed. He had a plan. He obviously was planning this out for a while. He had the wherewithal to make a bomb, plant a bomb, and kill eight people and himself, without a lot of wounded people."

But I think it's going to be related to his work. I think that's a developing theory, or that's a theory that law enforcement has now and just want to talk about. This is going to be the type of investigation where talking to people is going to be huge, getting within his social network and talking to the people that are close to him, because these mass shooters always flash red.
