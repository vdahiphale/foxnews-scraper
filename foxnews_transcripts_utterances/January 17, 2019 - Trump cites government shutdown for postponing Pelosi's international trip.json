And at the end of the day, the big question remains, what are the principles that the two side stand for? We know what the principle that Donald Trump is standing for right now, which has to do with border security, building the wall, whatever you think of that. What are the principles that Nancy Pelosi stands for and Democrats stand for? They want to save money? They don't have a very good track record. They want a more efficient way of dealing with the border? They don't have a very good track record at dealing with the border.

I actually agree with the outcome. I don't think there should be a State of the Union address while the government is shutdown. And I think that the CODEL is not an emergency and it can be postponed. I think the NATO commander's need a little assurance right now. They are afraid that the U.S. president is going to pull out of NATO.

MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: On one level it is not surprising. What is the one quality that is always attributed to President Trump? It's the fact that he is a counterpuncher. So what did Nancy Pelosi expect when she ostentatiously said, we can't have the State of the Union this year because of security reasons, which I'm sure they were going to be able to find workarounds. So instead of saying I'm going to hold a speech anyway, or I'm going to give the speech in a different location and send you the text, which he may still decide to do, President Trump has retaliated, as he usually does. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And I think this dynamic illustrates why we are no closer to reaching a compromise that we were last month, which is that both sides are now firmly entrenched and they are playing to their base.

We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I'm sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.

The problem here, and I think Donald Trump in that letter and Kevin McCarthy restated this as well, make a very good point. If the government is shut down, and maybe they believe that the crisis on the border is manufactured, but the crisis here is not manufactured. Why aren't you here negotiating? And at the end of the day, the big question remains, what are the principles that the two side stand for? We know what the principle that Donald Trump is standing for right now, which has to do with border security, building the wall, whatever you think of that. What are the principles that Nancy Pelosi stands for and Democrats stand for? They want to save money? They don't have a very good track record. They want a more efficient way of dealing with the border? They don't have a very good track record at dealing with the border.

People are really, really hurting. So to watch cable news today, if you're one of those people, I cannot imagine what it's like to watch the funny, sick burn coverage of this political smack down. I actually agree with the outcome. I don't think there should be a State of the Union address while the government is shutdown. And I think that the CODEL is not an emergency and it can be postponed. I think the NATO commander's need a little assurance right now. They are afraid that the U.S. president is going to pull out of NATO.

MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: On one level it is not surprising. What is the one quality that is always attributed to President Trump? It's the fact that he is a counterpuncher. So what did Nancy Pelosi expect when she ostentatiously said, we can't have the State of the Union this year because of security reasons, which I'm sure they were going to be able to find workarounds. So instead of saying I'm going to hold a speech anyway, or I'm going to give the speech in a different location and send you the text, which he may still decide to do, President Trump has retaliated, as he usually does. And I think this dynamic illustrates why we are no closer to reaching a compromise that we were last month, which is that both sides are now firmly entrenched and they are playing to their base. And when you have 80 percent of Democrats telling Nancy Pelosi, don't give him any money for the wall, and you 79 percent of Republicans telling President Trump, we need that wall or else, how are you going to reach a solution?"

All these freshmen Democrats who won Republican seats, whether they were Trump seats from 2016 or Clinton seats, are going to be blamed by their constituents soon for coming to Washington and voting no and not helping reopen the government.

At the end of the day it keeps coming back to the same question, and that is, when you remove all the tit for tat and all that kind of stuff, in the big picture fight you have Donald Trump who is fighting for border security, something that people in this town, both parties for 30-plus years have failed to do anything or at least failed to fix, and you have him on that side, and then you have recalcitrant Democrats in Congress arguing against doing that.

I don't think that's the case. And when I see this field emerge, I have to say, so far it's rather lackluster. Not very accomplished people or even people who have really professional campaigns or high name I.D. at this point. In 1988, there were seven dwarves that the Democrats ran. I think in 2020 we're going to have the 20 Smurfs. It is the same thing."

And when I met Naij's (ph) parents and her classmates and realized the pain and suffering that they were going through, I just knew I had to do more and I had to be a strong voice for that family and all the families who suffer from gun violence around my state and now the country."

Mitt Romney certainly evolved from when he was governor of Massachusetts to a nominee for the Republican Party. We are seeing that with a lot of these candidates, and we're going to continue having these discussions. I think that is not really new to the process. I think what stands out right now about -- and I agree with Matt, no one is really standing out. There is no center left voice right now. So if Biden wants to get in, that's fine. If Terry McAuliffe wants to get in, that's fine. No one is pushing back on the socialist progressive message right now, and these --"

But I think the people who are getting the most attention are these socialists in Congress who people are talking about taking anti-Israeli positions, and they are getting the most oxygen.

A veteran is thankful to two good Samaritans, 14-year-old twin sisters, Makhia and Makyla Vincent. They were walking to school in Detroit and they spotted a wallet on the ground. It contained a couple hundred bucks, cash, credit cards, and a military I.D. The girls returned the wallet to disabled veteran Mark Walsh, and he was so grateful for their act of kindness, he gave the girls all the cash in his wallet. The sisters say they plan on saving most of the money. They're going to spend a little bit. But, hey, that's good. The U.S. is good. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.
