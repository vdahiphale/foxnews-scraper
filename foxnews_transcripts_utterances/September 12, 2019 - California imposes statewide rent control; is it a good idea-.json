Americans can buy semiautomatic handguns and rifles, and millions of American men and women have done so, often for self-defense, sometimes for hunting. But that's what it's all about for a lot of people, protecting yourself, exercising your Second Amendment rights. And that is your right. And Democrats want to severely diminish it. Democrat candidate Beto O'Rourke has come up with an insidious way of restricting gun rights. He wants banks and credit cards companies to stop financing fun purchases and manufacturing. He tweeted his today, \"Credit cards have enabled many of America's mass shootings in the last decade. And with Washington unwilling to act, they need to cut off the sales of weapons of war today.\" There's the phrase again. Joining me now, Jeff Lord, former Reagan data and author of the book \"Swamp Wars\" and Luis Miranda, former DNC communications director.

And that he would cause even a second great depression. Now we have this booming economy and the Obama says that this is the continuation of the trends. The problem Austin with that line of reasoning is Trump has come in and reversed so many of the policies that Obama came in that - Obama had put place.

But beyond that, he compounded it by lying about the leaking to Comey unless he's lying and Comey is telling -- call Comey is telling the truth, we just don't know. So McCabe is the one in the middle right now. He is the first step I think the next you're going to see is the FISA affidavit and warrant which is going to turn out to have been even worse. Because Comey didn't just make false statement Comey lied under oath. Clearly without any doubts, when he made an appearance after Steele Dossier was vindicated and verified which it wasn't.

I think it violates about ten different rules of Justice Department. It could easily amount to a note obstruction of justice. McCabe makes it easy because he lied about it, which is a false statement. After all they have prosecuted Martha Stewart for a single false statement to the FBI. She wasn't an FBI agent. They're prosecuting Flynn for a single false statement when they knew the answer to it. If we have equal justice under the law, McCabe has to be prosecuted and so does Comey.

Instead they're running for TV cameras to promote some bill that's going to take away the rights away of law-abiding citizens. And admittedly, even by most Democrats, they will tell you that their bills wouldn't have stopped some of these mass shootings. And so President Trump has been actually focused on solving the problem. If you look at what he did with the Fix NICS bill that he signed in the law, that was focused on putting more data into the NICS system, the background check system, of criminals. There are a lot of criminals, people who committed actual crimes that should have stopped them from buying a gun and committing a mass shootings, but the data wasn't put in the system, even including mental illnesses. And that was the case, by the way, in Charleston, in Sutherland Springs, even in Parkland. And so the president has been focused on solving the problem."

We have a background check system, by the way, that has problems that we have been working to fix. Their idea is to say, if you're law-abiding citizen, you want to loan your gun to a friend, you can't do that or you'll go to jail for up to a year. That's lunacy.

You can't tell me that those areas are area that you would want to bring up children in, or those are environments you want to have your family in. Everyone knows it's the trust.

Now, you just can't go up to a counter at a gun store and buy a machine gun. That's illegal with a very, very narrow range of exceptions, mainly for specialty firing ranges or Hollywood studios. Americans can buy semiautomatic handguns and rifles, and millions of American men and women have done so, often for self-defense, sometimes for hunting. But that's what it's all about for a lot of people, protecting yourself, exercising your Second Amendment rights. And that is your right. And Democrats want to severely diminish it. Democrat candidate Beto O'Rourke has come up with an insidious way of restricting gun rights. He wants banks and credit cards companies to stop financing fun purchases and manufacturing. He tweeted his today, \"Credit cards have enabled many of America's mass shootings in the last decade. And with Washington unwilling to act, they need to cut off the sales of weapons of war today.\" There's the phrase again. Joining me now, Jeff Lord, former Reagan data and author of the book \"Swamp Wars\" and Luis Miranda, former DNC communications director. All right, Luis, would you be OK with Republicans pressuring banks to refuse financing in that way, for, let's say, women who want to get abortions?"

There is way too many for money to move, whether it's off the books, or whether it's through Bitcoin or Venmo, PayPal. Right now there's a lot more that we can do that I think is much more constructive to talk about, which is things like expanding background checks, and certainly red flag laws. It's not just Democrats that are pushing this. It's law enforcement itself that are identifying people who are clearly in the process of becoming threats and going after them. So if law enforcement is going after it, maybe we should codify it and make sure that it's working better for law enforcement."

But there's a political problem here that these folks, that Beto O'Rourke has opened up that's really going to backfire, and you touched on it. So if we can do this with guns, what about credit cards being used by someone who gets an abortion? What about donations to Planned Parenthood? What about donations to say the Progressive Latino Victory fund that works with illegal immigrants, they use credit cards for payment. This is a big problem, and Beto O'Rourke is going to rue the day."

Elizabeth Warren said that people who have overstayed their visas should essentially be on a track for citizenship. Joe Biden said people who have been convicted of crimes that are nonviolent should not go to jail, should be basically released from jail. Those are two issues, the gun control issue is a big issue, some parts of it popular, some parts of it not. But those two issues, do you think that's going to appeal to that independent voter on people who violated our immigration laws and just willfully overstayed their visas, 700,000 people, approximately, 666,000 just last year alone, they all should become American citizens according to Elizabeth Warren?"

Look at what Donald Trump is doing right now with vaping where he is seeing all these deaths happening and he's stepping in to restrict the type of products that tobacco companies can make for vaping products, right. So, there is a moment for the government to step in when something is becoming a public health threat. On the immigration side, I think it is it's true that Democrats in this case need to think about how do we solve the underlying problem of immigration, which is the status of people who have already been here with established roots, but also not be creating an additional magnet. And this is why there has to be a balance between how do you focus on people who are actually criminals. This is what we tried to do under the Obama administration was focus on people who had actual criminal records. And --"

We also have incredibly expensive housing and really right supply and a lot of abuses by tenants and tenant advocates. Now we're going to have that throughout California. The estimates are that we would have to quadruple the amount of housing starts in California for seven years in order to just catch up with the demand and stop the prices from going out of control. This new law is going to ensure that landlords and investors take their money and invest in other states, sell, the properties, let their properties deteriorate, and otherwise send this problem in the other direction.

We have people who lose their jobs and are immediately kicked out of their apartments. Or rent goes up 25 percent year after year. Look, I'm not going to disagree that small landlords, I have friends who are investors and developers. I talked to many of them. We need to streamline red tape to go along with the rent control, but I absolutely support it to keep families in housing and not living in cars with the rent increases that are happening here in California."

The fact that we have rent control is not going to move those families in San Francisco and L.A. into apartments here. That's nuts. The apartments are like $3,000 for a one bedroom apartment, and that's going to be the case regardless. What we have in California is laws like mandatory solar in new housing, we have restrictions, that NIMBY, not in my backyard groups refuse to allow housing near transportation, and as a result of that we have the 48th lowest in the nation ratio of housing to the demand. And none of that is going to be changed by rent control, confiscating people's property effectively. What we need, and I agree with Ethan, we need to get rid a lot of those regulations.
