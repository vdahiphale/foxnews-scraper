      "sentences": "Poll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots. But, when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view, so that they couldn't see what they were doing. And it became a little bit dangerous. One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows, again, with large pieces of cardboard. And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn't want anybody seeing the counting, even though these were observers who are legal observers that were supposed to be there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until 4:00 in the morning, and even though the polls closed at 8:00. So they brought it in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the batches came in, and nobody knew where they came from. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We have also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia. In multiple swing states, counting was halted for hours and hours on election night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared. And they all had the name Biden on them, or just about all, I think almost all. They all had the name Biden on them, which is a little strange. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes, because they talk about votes. And I think they should use the word legal, legal votes. We want every legal vote counted. And I want every legal vote counted. We want openness and transparency, no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after Election Day. You have Election Day, and the laws are very strong on that. You have an Election Day. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And they don't want votes cast after Election Day. And they want the process to be an honest one. It is so important. We want an honest election. And we want an honest count. And we want honest people working back there, because it's a very important job. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, that's the way this country is going to win. That's the way the United States will win. And we think we will win the election very easily. We think there's going to be a lot of litigation, because we have so much evidence, so much proof. And it's going to end up perhaps at the highest court in the land. We will see. But we think there will be a lot of litigation, because we can't have an election stolen like this. And I tell you, I was -- I have been talking about this for many months with all of you. And I have said very strongly that mail-in ballots are going to end up being a disaster. Small elections were a disaster. Small, very-easy-to-handle elections were disastrous. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is a large-scale version. And it's getting worse and worse every day. We're hearing stories that are horror stories, absolute horror stories. And we can't let that happen to the United States of America. It's not a question of who wins, Republican, Democrat, Joe, myself. We can't let that happen to our country. We can't be disgraced by having something like this happen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, it will be hopefully cleared up, maybe soon. I hope soon. But it'll probably go through a process, a legal process. And, as you know, I have claimed certain states, and he's claiming states. And we can both claim the states. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, ultimately, I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there's been a lot of shenanigans. And we can't stand for that in our country. Thank you very much. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Martha and Bret good evening to you. I think it's - from a 30,000-foot level, what we saw here is a president who was looking at the numbers tightening in races in places like Georgia and in Pennsylvania and looking at the results of what's coming in, in Arizona even though his campaign says that ultimately he will prevail in Arizona, looking at the numbers in Nevada as they are beginning to expand for Joe Biden. And I believe what we saw tonight is a president who believes that at the end of the day when all of these votes are counted, the election is not going to go his way, so he is trying to plan an alternate route to retain the White House. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The president saying a couple of moments ago I think we will win easily. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There is going to be a lot of litigation and I believe that this is going to end up at the Supreme Court. That doesn't sound like a president who was waiting for 270 votes to be allocated to one candidate or the other. The net candidate claims victory and the other can see its defeat. This sounds look a president who is going to look at the results come in and quite possible that Joe Biden in the end could end up with 270 or more electoral votes at which point it looks like President Trump is going to pull the trigger on even more litigation than we have seen so far. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I told you going into this that if the president had a grievance we were likely going to hear about it. He spent a lot of time, Bret, on your topic. What he called suppression polls, polls that showed that the president was going to lose certain states by anywhere from seven or 15 points or 17 points in the case of Wisconsin. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that the results were anything but what had been projected, the president calling those suppression polls designed to tell people that the cause is lost, stay home, it's not even worth coming out. And I think all of this is going to go into a big pot that the president's team is going to roll out as a way to challenge whatever election results we see later this week. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, in terms of fraud or abuse or found ballots or whatever the president talked a lot about that, but we haven't seen any widespread as evidence that that is the case. I did forward around a short time ago a letter from the Trump Campaign to the District Attorney in Clark County, Nevada, in which it is alleged that thousands of people who were not legal residents of Nevada cast votes in Clark County. I mean, that could be some evidence of fraudulent voting, we don't know. It's a claim at this point but other than that, Bret and Martha, I haven't really seen anything that would constitute any kind of flagrant fraud or abuse of the system. I haven't heard about it perhaps Fox News hasn't heard about it-- if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The president clearly didn't take any questions. But I don't know if Joe Biden, if he wins one more state will come out and say that's it, I'm the winner. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We are going to start building a transition team, which I'm sure that he's already doing as well because that would be the prudent thing to do because of a court decision goes your way, you want to make sure that you're not settling for five weeks behind. I believe that it happened in 2000 the transition teams were up and running on both sides. Certainly President Bush said that he was doing it. But I don't know that the Trump Campaign is going to respond to that favorably or if they're going to say we are not accepting the results of this election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And here's a litigation with which we are going to show that the election turned out a different way and I have no idea what evidence they would possibly present to back up that case that any court would look at and say you know what, you're right. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I mean, clearly back in 2000 when they had to recount in Florida, there was evidence. There were ballots that you couldn't read properly, there were butterfly ballots. You remember this all too well, Bret. Dimple chats, hanging chats, solid evidence that votes that were either legitimate or not legitimate and there were arguments on both sides. And this was argued by two of the finest attorneys in the country at the time, Ted Olsen and David Boyce at the Supreme Court. And ultimately the Supreme Court said stop the counting. But in this case, we don't have any of that evidence that they had back in 2000 so I'm not sure how the president makes the case? But I can tell you this that he has got teams of legal people who are working on that at this moment.",

I would say that the way the president spoke did seem to signal he was not confident that he would maintain his margins and that he would end up in court.

And one more thing, last week when I was in Pennsylvania, a Republican Strategist who was working on behalf of the president, not for the campaign, said look, if Trump has made a mistake in this, it was in denigrating mail-in voting. All those weeks went by when Democrats were banking votes every single day. People could mail them in, they could early vote at their convenience. They were doing it on Saturday and Sunday and Trump was saying we are going to vote in person, we are going to wait for this big dramatic Election Day turnout there will be this red wave that will swamp all that came before it. Meanwhile, Democrats already had so many tens of millions of votes in the bank.

I mean, you have the vote count which you're eluding to there and I know we have the numbers up as we are all speaking here. 64,000 vote margin between the two candidates at this hour and then the legal challenges to that vote count which we will get it in a moment. But just to add what the Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said, which she also said in the news conferences that we are almost there, that the overwhelming majority of the ballots have been counted and that it's just that the race is so close that we don't know who the winner is yet? And it's been getting closer throughout the day. We've been watching it, over 100,000, and then it goes down to 90,000, now at 64,000 in the lead the president has over Former Vice President Biden. I just looked at the Pennsylvania state website and they still say they have about 325,000 mail- in votes to count in Pennsylvania. 85,000 of those, Philadelphia County, 35,000 Allegheny County, which is Pittsburgh, so those are heavily Democratic areas that we are looking for to come in. Now on the legal front, Trump Campaign did ask the Supreme Court if they could be part of an existing legal challenge to the three-day ballot extension here in Pennsylvania. And the Attorney General in the state as a Democrat, came out tonight, tried to response opposing the Trump team's efforts to join that case and then we have the back-and-forth that's been talked about in Philadelphia where campaign officials from the Trump side, Pam Bondi, Corey Lewandowski and others announced earlier today they have scored this legal victory as they said it was in the appellate court that would allow the poll watchers to get in and get a close look at the action. But questions came up throughout the day about whether that was happening? So the Trump team late in the day filed a federal lawsuit trying to stop the Philadelphia count that they weren't getting access. We just read moments ago from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the federal court, a judge took that on, heard the arguments. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } First said that they should kind of figure it out on their own in a recess but then came back from the recess and said each side, Democrat and Republican could have 60 observers in the room as long as they keep their social distance because of COVID and that the account now should continue in Philadelphia. So that's where we are. The bottom line, you do have those legal challenges, we are trying to follow them piece by piece has developed its come up, Martha and Bret. But you also have the vote count and the president's lead shrinking throughout the day, just over 64,000 votes now. Back to you guys.",

The only question there is that there are a large number of provisional ballots and a large number of overseas military ballots which make that conclusion there a little more challenging. In Nevada, right now former vice president is ahead. It's not yet -- the distance between the former vice president and President Trump is not yet large enough given the amount of votes outstanding that we feel comfortable making a call in that state, but again, the vote is still coming in. It's been a little slower than we anticipated. We thought there would be a bigger dump of ballots today -- by dump I mean data dump. It North Carolina, the president has a fairly healthy lead, but the count is sort of very, very slow. We actually checked. I don't think the number -- the numbers -- the number of total ballots counted has actually gone down by about 28. Don't quote me on the number, but in the last 24 or 48 hours, so it has not been moving. Pennsylvania has been moving. There are a large number of ballots outstanding particularly in the Philadelphia area where I was with the former vice president has strength because of the urban area of Philadelphia. At that count we thought was going to go faster, it hasn't gone as fast as I think everyone would like in order to sort of determine who the winner is.

It's not your grandfathers or grandparents or even your parents Democrat Party. It's a party that's been as Congressman Ford just said, far left, identity politics, very much quiet about all the riots we saw. I also think that they probably Republicans benefited by President Trump reaching out to minorities getting a record number -- not quite a record, but I think the highest in 60 years, nonwhite support. I brought with me a prop here. This is a black voice for Trump. I was in rally in Pennsylvania. These are handed out and these are real very energetic outreach that are part of the Republican Party to reach out for black and Hispanic votes. I think that the number of black percentage about 12 percent supporting President Trump, that's up from 8 percent and Hispanic numbers up in the 30s and that's largely responsible for the tremendous showing in Florida and a lot of Republicans across the country benefited from that outreach effort and that probably helped keep more of these seats in the House under Republican control rather than Democratic control.",

But, when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view, so that they couldn't see what they were doing. And it became a little bit dangerous. One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows, again, with large pieces of cardboard. And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn't want anybody seeing the counting, even though these were observers who are legal observers that were supposed to be there. In Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until 4:00 in the morning, and even though the polls closed at 8:00. So they brought it in. And the batches came in, and nobody knew where they came from. We have also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia. In multiple swing states, counting was halted for hours and hours on election night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared. And they all had the name Biden on them, or just about all, I think almost all. They all had the name Biden on them, which is a little strange. I challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes, because they talk about votes. And I think they should use the word legal, legal votes. We want every legal vote counted. And I want every legal vote counted. We want openness and transparency, no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after Election Day. You have Election Day, and the laws are very strong on that. You have an Election Day. And they don't want votes cast after Election Day. And they want the process to be an honest one. It is so important. We want an honest election. And we want an honest count. And we want honest people working back there, because it's a very important job. So, that's the way this country is going to win. That's the way the United States will win. And we think we will win the election very easily. We think there's going to be a lot of litigation, because we have so much evidence, so much proof. And it's going to end up perhaps at the highest court in the land. We will see. But we think there will be a lot of litigation, because we can't have an election stolen like this. And I tell you, I was -- I have been talking about this for many months with all of you. And I have said very strongly that mail-in ballots are going to end up being a disaster. Small elections were a disaster. Small, very-easy-to-handle elections were disastrous. This is a large-scale version. And it's getting worse and worse every day. We're hearing stories that are horror stories, absolute horror stories. And we can't let that happen to the United States of America. It's not a question of who wins, Republican, Democrat, Joe, myself. We can't let that happen to our country. We can't be disgraced by having something like this happen. So, it will be hopefully cleared up, maybe soon. I hope soon. But it'll probably go through a process, a legal process. And, as you know, I have claimed certain states, and he's claiming states. And we can both claim the states. But, ultimately, I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there's been a lot of shenanigans. And we can't stand for that in our country. Thank you very much."

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Martha and Bret good evening to you. I think it's - from a 30,000-foot level, what we saw here is a president who was looking at the numbers tightening in races in places like Georgia and in Pennsylvania and looking at the results of what's coming in, in Arizona even though his campaign says that ultimately he will prevail in Arizona, looking at the numbers in Nevada as they are beginning to expand for Joe Biden. And I believe what we saw tonight is a president who believes that at the end of the day when all of these votes are counted, the election is not going to go his way, so he is trying to plan an alternate route to retain the White House. The president saying a couple of moments ago I think we will win easily. There is going to be a lot of litigation and I believe that this is going to end up at the Supreme Court. That doesn't sound like a president who was waiting for 270 votes to be allocated to one candidate or the other. The net candidate claims victory and the other can see its defeat. This sounds look a president who is going to look at the results come in and quite possible that Joe Biden in the end could end up with 270 or more electoral votes at which point it looks like President Trump is going to pull the trigger on even more litigation than we have seen so far. I told you going into this that if the president had a grievance we were likely going to hear about it. He spent a lot of time, Bret, on your topic. What he called suppression polls, polls that showed that the president was going to lose certain states by anywhere from seven or 15 points or 17 points in the case of Wisconsin. And that the results were anything but what had been projected, the president calling those suppression polls designed to tell people that the cause is lost, stay home, it's not even worth coming out. And I think all of this is going to go into a big pot that the president's team is going to roll out as a way to challenge whatever election results we see later this week. Now, in terms of fraud or abuse or found ballots or whatever the president talked a lot about that, but we haven't seen any widespread as evidence that that is the case. I did forward around a short time ago a letter from the Trump Campaign to the District Attorney in Clark County, Nevada, in which it is alleged that thousands of people who were not legal residents of Nevada cast votes in Clark County. I mean, that could be some evidence of fraudulent voting, we don't know. It's a claim at this point but other than that, Bret and Martha, I haven't really seen anything that would constitute any kind of flagrant fraud or abuse of the system. I haven't heard about it perhaps Fox News hasn't heard about it--"

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "We have not seen evidence yet John. And I just want to note something that was very stark was that, as the president is talking there about these various states, as he is saying that Democrats are stealing an election and that it's a corrupt system. On the other side of the screen, because of the way we have the graphics set up, literally the votes are going down in Georgia. Now a 3600 vote spread between President Trump and Former Vice President Biden in Pennsylvania, the spread now 64,000. That was happening as the president was talking. We have not seen the hard evidence. He claims that his campaign is going forward with these legal lawsuits and they are going to produce it, but those spreads are getting much more narrow and possibly will change as time goes on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "And again, all Joe Biden has to do is turn one of those states blue. It Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and he gets to 270. And so when he gets to 270, clearly I would think the Biden Campaign - now, Joe Biden said let's wait for it so maybe he will wait for the vote to be complete in all of the states. But the question I wanted to ask the president was let's say over the course of the next 72 hours the vote goes your way and you end up with 270, will you claim victory? The president clearly didn't take any questions. But I don't know if Joe Biden, if he wins one more state will come out and say that's it, I'm the winner. We are going to start building a transition team, which I'm sure that he's already doing as well because that would be the prudent thing to do because of a court decision goes your way, you want to make sure that you're not settling for five weeks behind. I believe that it happened in 2000 the transition teams were up and running on both sides. Certainly President Bush said that he was doing it. But I don't know that the Trump Campaign is going to respond to that favorably or if they're going to say we are not accepting the results of this election. And here's a litigation with which we are going to show that the election turned out a different way and I have no idea what evidence they would possibly present to back up that case that any court would look at and say you know what, you're right. I mean, clearly back in 2000 when they had to recount in Florida, there was evidence. There were ballots that you couldn't read properly, there were butterfly ballots. You remember this all too well, Bret. Dimple chats, hanging chats, solid evidence that votes that were either legitimate or not legitimate and there were arguments on both sides. And this was argued by two of the finest attorneys in the country at the time, Ted Olsen and David Boyce at the Supreme Court. And ultimately the Supreme Court said stop the counting. But in this case, we don't have any of that evidence that they had back in 2000 so I'm not sure how the president makes the case? But I can tell you this that he has got teams of legal people who are working on that at this moment."

We see the letter that you mentioned, John, which with regard to Nevada and this is really the first piece of any evidence that we know that the Trump lawyers have put forward, which is that they say 3,062 voters who moved from Nevada before the election still cast ballots in the election. They do not attach those lists here, of who those voters are, proving that they did actually place a ballot but that's the kind of thing that you would need to see in large numbers and all of these places - make any kind of impact."

There will likely be thousands more I'm also told that the Trump Campaign has the names of people who are deceased that had a ballot cast in their name.

What I'm surprised by is the utter silence on the part of the Republicans, really, who aren't echoing the president's claims, and not even Vice President Pence has been charging the same things.

All due respect, Bret, my respect enormously, you and John both talked about the numbers going down as he was speaking and that having some effect on him. Well, it may have some effect on him. Maybe depressing him, probably should be depressing about but that's totally independent of the truth of things and though John Roberts hasn't seen the evidence yet, doesn't mean that there isn't evidence. John cited Florida, but that wasn't solved in a day or two days or three days. You remember how long that took so I agree with Mara. If there is evidence, and I believe there will be, it should come forward and I think there is this very important and consequential circumstantial evidence the courts could make serious inferences from. Large batches of votes with not a single one for Donald Trump, and go where the evidence leads, but it is a little early to say well, we have improved anything yet, no, they have improved anything yet. It takes a while to make the case and no, the president is not going to say well, if I'm declared the winner I want to challenge it in court, because that would be evenhanded. He doesn't think it was stolen from Biden. He thinks it was stolen from him."

I think we kind of expected this when some of the other votes would come in. So that would have to - he would have to lose first. I think not only would he have to show evidence of widespread fraud, it would have to be the margin not only in his state, in the state that he is alleging, but in enough states where it would make a difference to the election, right? I mean, it would have to be - so there are a lot of hurdles. I would say that the way the president spoke did seem to signal he was not confident that he would maintain his margins and that he would end up in court. I would also add I'm very confident the Supreme Court would do the right thing. There are some people saying well, Trump appointed three of the justices. I don't think they're going to declare Donald Trump a winner if he didn't win. I want to see the totals and then I want to see the evidence and I'm hoping that when we have all that, it will be relatively clear, because if it's not, it's going to be poisonous."

So the whittling down that happened over time is what we expected as these mail-in votes started to come in.

He made that perfectly clear your thoughts?"

      "speaker": "BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, he basically repeated a number of themes he said Wednesday morning at that 2:30 in the morning appearance at the White House. I think one of the reasons to come out was that Joe Biden has been coming out and probably inching closer and closer to claiming victory even though no victor has been declared. So a couple of things you know, you were just discussing the Florida recount 20 years ago and there was one big thing about that, it was all in Florida. Florida was the big prize. It was the whole ball game, so the entire political world descended on Florida. Here you have so many moving parts Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada. And one more thing, last week when I was in Pennsylvania, a Republican Strategist who was working on behalf of the president, not for the campaign, said look, if Trump has made a mistake in this, it was in denigrating mail-in voting. All those weeks went by when Democrats were banking votes every single day. People could mail them in, they could early vote at their convenience. They were doing it on Saturday and Sunday and Trump was saying we are going to vote in person, we are going to wait for this big dramatic Election Day turnout there will be this red wave that will swamp all that came before it. Meanwhile, Democrats already had so many tens of millions of votes in the bank. So I think in retrospect, when this is all over, if he does lose, I think that's what the president will regret doing."

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, the access just seems very clear cut. Why should one campaign observers have to go to court to get - to observe people counting the votes? That just seems to me that it should be an open and shut case. On the specific question of corruption, stolen votes, we need to see more and I think I was saying yesterday that we need to see from the president's lawyers a series of specific allegations. I'm not talking about proof, I'm not talking about something that would hold up in court, but something for us to look at in which they allege big enough specific problems in places that matter. Here again we are talking Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada. We have - Scott Walker, the Former Governor of Wisconsin, Republican, coming out today and talking about statewide recounts that have taken place in the past in Wisconsin. And he said after all was said and done, they changed the vote totals by 150 votes, 250 votes, some very small number of votes that would not matter in this case. So the president needs to be - needs to make this case - it's not too late, it's only Thursday, but he needs to come out and begin to make this case that this, that this, and this were done in these important places."

I mean, you have the vote count which you're eluding to there and I know we have the numbers up as we are all speaking here. 64,000 vote margin between the two candidates at this hour and then the legal challenges to that vote count which we will get it in a moment. But just to add what the Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said, which she also said in the news conferences that we are almost there, that the overwhelming majority of the ballots have been counted and that it's just that the race is so close that we don't know who the winner is yet? And it's been getting closer throughout the day. We've been watching it, over 100,000, and then it goes down to 90,000, now at 64,000 in the lead the president has over Former Vice President Biden. I just looked at the Pennsylvania state website and they still say they have about 325,000 mail- in votes to count in Pennsylvania. 85,000 of those, Philadelphia County, 35,000 Allegheny County, which is Pittsburgh, so those are heavily Democratic areas that we are looking for to come in. Now on the legal front, Trump Campaign did ask the Supreme Court if they could be part of an existing legal challenge to the three-day ballot extension here in Pennsylvania. And the Attorney General in the state as a Democrat, came out tonight, tried to response opposing the Trump team's efforts to join that case and then we have the back-and-forth that's been talked about in Philadelphia where campaign officials from the Trump side, Pam Bondi, Corey Lewandowski and others announced earlier today they have scored this legal victory as they said it was in the appellate court that would allow the poll watchers to get in and get a close look at the action. But questions came up throughout the day about whether that was happening? So the Trump team late in the day filed a federal lawsuit trying to stop the Philadelphia count that they weren't getting access. We just read moments ago from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the federal court, a judge took that on, heard the arguments. First said that they should kind of figure it out on their own in a recess but then came back from the recess and said each side, Democrat and Republican could have 60 observers in the room as long as they keep their social distance because of COVID and that the account now should continue in Philadelphia. So that's where we are. The bottom line, you do have those legal challenges, we are trying to follow them piece by piece has developed its come up, Martha and Bret. But you also have the vote count and the president's lead shrinking throughout the day, just over 64,000 votes now. Back to you guys."

Those have been counted already, but then we saw it really swing towards Republicans and you know that a lot of Republicans were worried about mailing in their ballots and so they show up at the polls, and in Arizona, I was at a number of the polling places and there was just thousands of people showing up with their sealed ballots, dropping it off at the poll and those haven't even been counted yet.

We have taken into account the fact that there is -- that President Trump is likely to get I think you said 55 percent of the outstanding vote.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MISHKIN",
      "utterance": "Well, we're looking at all four of the states, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. As you can see, the Georgia margin is very, very slim for the president. There is a likelihood, given that, and given the way the vote is currently coming in, that former vice president Biden might take over in the coming days or the coming hours. The only question there is that there are a large number of provisional ballots and a large number of overseas military ballots which make that conclusion there a little more challenging. In Nevada, right now former vice president is ahead. It's not yet -- the distance between the former vice president and President Trump is not yet large enough given the amount of votes outstanding that we feel comfortable making a call in that state, but again, the vote is still coming in. It's been a little slower than we anticipated. We thought there would be a bigger dump of ballots today -- by dump I mean data dump. It North Carolina, the president has a fairly healthy lead, but the count is sort of very, very slow. We actually checked. I don't think the number -- the numbers -- the number of total ballots counted has actually gone down by about 28. Don't quote me on the number, but in the last 24 or 48 hours, so it has not been moving. Pennsylvania has been moving. There are a large number of ballots outstanding particularly in the Philadelphia area where I was with the former vice president has strength because of the urban area of Philadelphia. At that count we thought was going to go faster, it hasn't gone as fast as I think everyone would like in order to sort of determine who the winner is. And right now, our models are showing the potential for the former vice president to take the lead from President Trump, but it's not clear that it's in what we would call the call status. It's actually nowhere near that in our various models."

And so, I mean, Philadelphia is an area that has gone 80 percent or more for the vice president. There are other more rural areas of America that go by almost the same margin for the president, and so it's not surprising that when you put in ballots from a precinct or all the ballots from a precinct to be counted, it's not that surprising that either President Trump or former vice president Biden wind up with getting the bulk of that count. It doesn't mean anything nefarious, it's just unfortunately that we live as Americans, and we don't live with people we disagree with politically, economically, what have you, and just the reality of America."

The Trump campaign is correct, in my professional experience includes political consulting for Democrats when I worked in political consulting. I have over the past 12 years given a total, and it's out in the internet, in the past 12 years I've given a total of $800, 500 that went to a classmate of mine who was a congressman, a Republican congressman and another $300 went to a friend of a classmate who was a Democrat. So, $500 to Republicans, $300 to the Democrats. Some more money back before I was the head of the decision team here. The team totally agrees with the call.

Joining us now, as I tease moments ago, Deroy Murdock, contributing editor of National Review online, Fox News contributor and Harold Ford, Jr., former Tennessee Democratic congressman. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being with us. Harold, let me start with you. A surprising development, a surprising situation from this election in Congress for the Democrats."

      "utterance": "No doubt. Thanks again for having me on. I think, look, I listen to Heath Shuler. I ran against Nancy Pelosi many years ago. We both suffered the same results. Heath and I dead. But I do think there is some reality that have to be listened to (AUDIO GAP) policies and strategies that were employed this go-round probably have to be reevaluated. Socialism, radical left, spending or big spending, the exuberance for identity politics. A lot of that is going to have to be abandoned if there's any chance for Democrats to really not only be able to govern, but, you know, to assert their group again over the country. Finally, I'm so -- I feel bad for Mr. Mishkin, he is a statistician not just but statistician -- imagine if a quarterback threw three interceptions and blame the statistician, Mr. Mishkin, hang in there."

Listen, it's not just the House of Representatives, think about the state legislatures that were supposed to fall like dominoes to Democrats and now Republicans didn't lose those battles and now they're in a position really for redistricting to come and other things down the road."

    {
      "speaker": "DEROY MURDOCK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "That's right. I mean, we are all expecting -- a lot of people, not me necessarily, a lot of people were expecting a big blue wave, turns out to be a big blue trickle and I think a big part of it is that a lot of Americans just rejected the Democrat Party as it exist not. It's not your grandfathers or grandparents or even your parents Democrat Party. It's a party that's been as Congressman Ford just said, far left, identity politics, very much quiet about all the riots we saw. I also think that they probably Republicans benefited by President Trump reaching out to minorities getting a record number -- not quite a record, but I think the highest in 60 years, nonwhite support. I brought with me a prop here. This is a black voice for Trump. I was in rally in Pennsylvania. These are handed out and these are real very energetic outreach that are part of the Republican Party to reach out for black and Hispanic votes. I think that the number of black percentage about 12 percent supporting President Trump, that's up from 8 percent and Hispanic numbers up in the 30s and that's largely responsible for the tremendous showing in Florida and a lot of Republicans across the country benefited from that outreach effort and that probably helped keep more of these seats in the House under Republican control rather than Democratic control."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's very interesting to see the demographic shift. You know, it's not huge, but it's real in terms of the pickup and some of those percentages. Harold, you know, there's some a lot of outrage in some corners on that."

    {
      "speaker": "FORD",
      "utterance": "Look, black voters -- I like -- I respect Deroy's assessment of this and I appreciate the kind words but black voters remember, they were the ones that put Joe Biden over in South Carolina. They didn't go -- black voters in South Carolina didn't veer to the far left. Black voters are as serious and intentional about trying to find a candidate of whatever party, mostly Democrat in this country over the last hundred years, who can solve problems in a rational and serious way. So I think the party has to acknowledge that, continue to acknowledge that and again, like I said the other night with you guys or last night with you guys, I think that the country spoke loudly, clearly, a lot of contention, but the country is right down the center and as these results continue to come in, numbers continue to trickle in, it confirms that point."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

    {
      "speaker": "FORD",
      "utterance": "Well, Joe Biden never supported court packing. I do think the country is against defunding the police, as I am. They are against unfairness. I think there's probably concern that we might not have -- should have not pushed a nominee with before this election. So, there is no doubt the center politics, it's a little nuanced but at the end of the day, people want rationality and hopefully that's where we headed."

    {
      "speaker": "MURDOCK",
      "utterance": "It's a total failure of their mandate. It's supposed to be a news organization. If the President of the United States comes out, particularly in a very fraught and difficult time like this, you cover him. You can bring people in afterwards that disagree and say why he's wrong but people ought to know what the president state has on his mind what we are trying to figure out who the next president is in a very divided country. I think they totally failed their viewers tonight by not allowing the president on air."
