      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". Buckle up. Busy night tonight. The radical socialist field, 2020 Democrats is a dumpster fire filled with hypocritical far left candidates who are willing to do and say anything for power. Coming up tonight, we will have full coverage of this, well, frankly, now, really disturbing field of politicians including one unhinged candidate, maybe you can guess who it is, who is ready to lock up American gun owners if they do not turn their weapons over to the federal government. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But first, let's turn our attention to a very important \"Hannity Watch\" as we investigate tonight the investigators. Now, tonight, the tide is turning dramatically. After Thursday of this week, the gig is up for the hate Trump media mob, the Democratic allies, who for over two and a half years have been pushing their tin foil hat conspiracy c theories and outright lies about collusion. Now, they don't know it yet, but it's done, it is over, it is finished. No collusion, no obstruction. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yes, there's going to be a few that cling to a few sentences, offer more lies, more fake news, more fake legal analysis. But in the end, they are forever exposed for the liars and partisan hacks that they are. They have put this country in danger, our constitutional republic in danger. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, on Thursday, the Mueller report will be released by the Attorney General Barr, and with only minor, legally mandated reactions. And it will be what is the final nail in the coffin to the credibility of America's biggest Russia collusion conspiracy theory. It's over. They don't know it yet. Now, that includes so-called reporters at \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times.\" They actually won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for perpetrating a hoax. Now, that prize frankly should be revoked. I think it could be rewarded to the real journalists, the real investigative reporters that we have every night on the show and my radio show, the people who have been right the entire time. All along exposing, layer by layer, every single issue involving what is the biggest abuse of power obstruction scandal in history. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The only difference is, they have evidence that has been reported over the course of two years on this show. And unlike so many in the media mob, we are not blinded by hate. We follow the truth, the evidence, due process. Now, sadly, the same cannot be said about the media mob. Now, they reported their anti-Trump garbage, lies, propaganda, over and over again with their anonymous sources. And, of course, they're just doing the Democrats' bidding. They are tied at the hip, manufactured crisis. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And on Thursday, they will do a predictably one last time with all the phony lying outrage they'll be able to manufacture. They want to bludgeon President Trump, which has been their goal all along, by any and all means necessary, and they have only one day left. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, just breaking moments ago, Sara Carter's reporting that three of those Democrats, Congressman Elijah Cummings, Maxine Waters, and the cowardly Adam Schiff actually signed a secret pact behind closed doors, vowing to target President Trump and subpoena all of his financial and banking records -- oh, by the way, which means more evidence. They've even moved on from collusion. This letter obtained by Sara Carter from Congressman Jim Jordan, it is now raising serious concern over this secret agreement to take down a president. And according to a congressional source, quote: This is not how committees normally operate. The Democrats aren't interested in legislating, only attacking the president. Sara Carter will join us in a moment and give us that full report. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But that's what the president is up against and has been up against from day one. Now, if the president cured cancer tonight and gave every American $5 million and adopted their sick agenda, they would still hate him. Here's my prediction: When the Mueller report is released on Thursday, the same people that have lied all along, this is going to find something, anything in the report to bludgeon the president. By the way, it's not going to work again. Many on the left are already speculating that the 30- plus hours of testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn is going to be the linchpin providing the damning evidence of wrongdoing. OK, let's do something the media mob won't do. Let's take an honest look at truth and facts. We know for a fact the special counsel found no Russia collusion between Trump or anyone in his campaign. As a matter of fact, we have the quote from the Mueller report right here. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is from the Mueller report: The investigations did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No collusion. We also know for a fact that three previous investigations also cleared the president. And when it comes to the claims that the president obstructed justice, we also know for a fact that Mueller did not charge the president with obstruction. And we know that Barr, Rod Rosenstein, the DOJ's nonpartisan Office of Legal Counsel and, yes, and conjunction with talking to the Mueller team, cleared the president from any charges. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's a fact that President Trump did not fire Mueller. They're going to say, well, he wanted to fire him, but he didn't. They're going to say, well, he wanted to fire Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions. OK, he didn't. He didn't impede any investigation anywhere. He didn't interfere with General Flynn's case, except wishing that he wouldn't get in trouble and he got in trouble. And as Comey said, the president is right to fire him for any reason or no reason at all. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, did the president talk about these things? Yes. Did he talk about them a lot? Yes. The witch hunt, the Democrats on Mueller's team, firing Sessions, Rosenstein, hoping that General Flynn, a 33 year military hero wouldn't get hurt -- kind of like all the deep stat guys. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They talked an awful lot about things, too, like wearing a wire to spy on the president. They talked about trying to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove a duly elected president. Well, they didn't do it, but they talked about it a lot. So, if a president expresses frustration, just like those FBI DOJ guys, about them being investigated are not getting their political by over a serious crime that he didn't commit, it's not obstruction. Also, there is no intent, very important as it relates to the law. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Calling out the Trump-hating Democrats who Mueller appointed to probe this whole thing, that is not obstruction. Frankly, that was the right thing to do. And last but not least, firing Comey, not obstruction. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And, by the way, here's the good news. President Trump summed it up perfectly when he tweeted out, Mueller, the A.G., and the A.G. based on Mueller findings on great intelligence have already ruled no collusion, no obstruction. These crimes were committed by crooked Hillary, the DNC, dirty cops, and others. Investigate the investigators -- which we have been doing. Now, the tables have finally turned. This is their last rubber bullet.  And it will hit and it will fall to the ground, and it's all over. Now, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Bill McGurn, smart guy, calling for a grand jury -- he is right -- to investigate factors that are in the deep state and abuse power. Quote: If the Federal Bureau of Investigation is to recover its lost reputation -- by the way, I don't agree with that. Not rank-and-file, upper echelon -- the first item on Attorney General Bill Barr's agenda must be to make good on something that set off a frenzy when he proposed it last week: an honest accounting of the FBI spying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Yes, they spied on Trump. They did. Many times. Many ways. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Anyway, the attorney general has already vowed to establish a team, thankfully, to investigate our federal government spying on the Trump campaign. Great article today by Andrew McCarthy -- he'll join us in a few minutes -- detailing some of this potentially illicit surveillance, writing, quote: Less than a year ago, we learned the Obama administration had used a confidential informant to spy, to approach at least three Trump campaign officials in the months leading up to the 2016 election, straining to find proof that the campaign was complicit in the Kremlin's hacking of Democratic emails. Now, of course, Andy McCarthy is referring to Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and Sam Clovis, who were all approached by an informant with the name of Stefan Halper. That's only the tip of the iceberg. Trump's campaign associate Carter Page was also electronically surveilled. By the way, can somebody teach Comey what that means? After Comey and others signed off on that FISA application, the bulk of coming from the coming from the unverified, unverifiable, uncorroborated dirty Russian dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And let's not forget about the nearly 350 percent increase in unmasking requests by top Obama officials in the election year of 2016. What did Obama know? When did he know it? By the way, Strzok and Page say all the decisions were made by Loretta Lynch. What did she know? When she did know it? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, I think Susan Rice has questions to answer. Brennan, Clapper, even creepy Uncle Joe, what did they all know, when did they all know it? Now, soon, we'll begin to have the answers to these important questions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In a letter to the director of national intelligence, Congressman Jim Jordan, Congressman Mark Meadows, they have now requested that 53, we only got seven, 53 closed door testimony transcripts be made public. I'm sure Jerry Nadler will join them because he didn't want the release of the Starr report. Already, we have received the testimony of Bruce Ohr, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, James Baker, other FBI and DOJ officials who were involved in the witch hunt, and it was, against Donald Trump, the free passage given, of course, they literally gave a get-out-of-jail-free card because they like Hillary. They thought, the guy that interviewed her, Peter Strzok, she should won 100 million to zero. Yet she committed real crimes. We have a massive amount of classified material that was found on that unsecured private server that was managed by Platt River Networks. It was in a bathroom closet. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } She committed a real crime, and thus had a real intent to obstruct justice by destroying the evidence of that crime. Hence, the 33,000 deleted, acid washed emails. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the media on Thursday, they are going to pretend they care about obstruction of justice. Meanwhile, all of them will ignore the biggest slam-dunk obstruction of justice case in history. That's right, Hillary's case. And just like Democrats, remember, they believed all the Kavanaugh accusers. \"I believe.\" They believe. But their silence is deafening when it comes to lieutenant governor of Virginia, oh, he's been accused of rape and violent sexual assault. So, where are all the \"I believers\"? You know, obstruction matters, but only if it's Trump, not Hillary Clinton. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Charges of rape, serious sexual assault only matters if you're appointed by Trump but not the Democratic lieutenant governor of Virginia. Look at your screen, a clear violation of the Espionage Act, 18 USC 793. There is the law. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why was Hillary cleared? Because the investigation was rigged. Why did Comey and Strzok start writing an exoneration in May? They didn't interview here until July. Why did they take out gross negligence, the legal standard, and replace it with extreme carelessness? Why did Peter Strzok allow two other people in the interview room when he was interviewing Clinton on July 2nd, 2016?  Comey exonerated her on July 5th. They had written that first in May. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why did Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch really talk about on that secret meeting on the tarmac in Phoenix just before Hillary was cleared? Did Lynch, the FBI, did they work in concert together to clear the Clintons?  Did they rig that investigation when it's obvious she committed multiple felonies because she was the one that should win 100 million to zero and Trump supporters were nothing but smelly Walmart voters? From Hillary Clinton's rigged investigation, spying on the Trump campaign, to committing a fraud and FISA abuse, to unmasking American citizens and abusing the powerful tools of intelligence, to everything in between, we will now finally get the answers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I know that media won't go there because then they'd have to admit they are wrong. They won't apologize, they won't retract. They won't say, jeez, this ensemble cast got it right. Don't hold your breath. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We're going to have a lot more on this throughout the show. But, first, we also must report tonight on our \"Hannity Watch\" on the radical socialists, 2020 Democrats. It's been a very revealing way for some of the far left sycophants trying to become president. We start with the current mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Yes. That guy, Mayor Pete. Peter Buttigieg is his name, who said that the Electoral College is just one big Republican manipulation of the system. OK. Watch this. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So, I think it's very telling that, you know, rather than invite an inquiry into what caused this investigation to take place in the first place, what they are doing is attacking the people who simply want answers to simple questions, how did this get originated?

There were some chuckles as was noted on that clip from that other network. But this is very strange, and I don't know if it's necessarily out of step. I think Michelle Obama has been known for being very honest. And she doesn't tend to edit herself. I think that when she does it's a deliberate effort to do so. This may have reflected more of her point of view. But the problem here is it's not just insulting to men and for every woman and man out in that audience who didn't quite know why she was insulting them. But it relies also on the other side of the coin which is the gender stereotype of women that all women are supposed to be either great mothers or only women can raise children or only women can be good parents. Now, the best scenario is two parents who love those kids and we know that love is love and it's about you know the nature of who can love a child. And that is also of course a part of the problem of her remarks is the gender stereotyping that the left is normally going out against. She really destroys in that regard. And this is one of my points about the left and liberals. If you scratch the surface a little bit. If you scratch the surface a little bit you get these real opinions that are quite the opposite of what they've been arguing for.",

Kelly, Smollett had been overcharged quoting here pedophile with four victims, 10 counts washed up celeb who lied to cops, 16 meaning counts. In the messages, Foxx acknowledges having recused herself, but is clearly still involved quoting just because we can charge something doesn't mean we should. Magats response \"agreed.\" We can get a hard look at how we charged the cases and get it to something that covers what needs to be covered without being excessive and ultimately pointless. And on the day the charges were dropped, Foxx texted that she had just spoken with Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, \"laugh out loud.\" He's at the police recruit event needed to know how to answer questions from press told him essentially deferred prosecution paying 10k restitution to the city and completed community service. He was told, we were just dropping the charges. He seems satisfied with the explanation except Eddie Johnson was furious with the decision as was then Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Smollett is now being sued by the city. Meantime, now to Lori Loughlin, a source close to the actress is telling Entertainment Tonight that those who orchestrated the cheating scandal misled Loughlin about the severity of her involvement and that she and her husband were under the impression, they were breaking rules, not laws. The source goes on to say, \"they realize how serious the charges are, but feel that once the judge hears their story, he will see they had no bad intentions.\"  The legal experts say, it's difficult to imagine any judge thinking of $500,000 bribe is based on good intentions.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". Buckle up. Busy night tonight. The radical socialist field, 2020 Democrats is a dumpster fire filled with hypocritical far left candidates who are willing to do and say anything for power. Coming up tonight, we will have full coverage of this, well, frankly, now, really disturbing field of politicians including one unhinged candidate, maybe you can guess who it is, who is ready to lock up American gun owners if they do not turn their weapons over to the federal government. But first, let's turn our attention to a very important \"Hannity Watch\" as we investigate tonight the investigators. Now, tonight, the tide is turning dramatically. After Thursday of this week, the gig is up for the hate Trump media mob, the Democratic allies, who for over two and a half years have been pushing their tin foil hat conspiracy c theories and outright lies about collusion. Now, they don't know it yet, but it's done, it is over, it is finished. No collusion, no obstruction. Yes, there's going to be a few that cling to a few sentences, offer more lies, more fake news, more fake legal analysis. But in the end, they are forever exposed for the liars and partisan hacks that they are. They have put this country in danger, our constitutional republic in danger. Now, on Thursday, the Mueller report will be released by the Attorney General Barr, and with only minor, legally mandated reactions. And it will be what is the final nail in the coffin to the credibility of America's biggest Russia collusion conspiracy theory. It's over. They don't know it yet. Now, that includes so-called reporters at \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times.\" They actually won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for perpetrating a hoax. Now, that prize frankly should be revoked. I think it could be rewarded to the real journalists, the real investigative reporters that we have every night on the show and my radio show, the people who have been right the entire time. All along exposing, layer by layer, every single issue involving what is the biggest abuse of power obstruction scandal in history. The only difference is, they have evidence that has been reported over the course of two years on this show. And unlike so many in the media mob, we are not blinded by hate. We follow the truth, the evidence, due process. Now, sadly, the same cannot be said about the media mob. Now, they reported their anti-Trump garbage, lies, propaganda, over and over again with their anonymous sources. And, of course, they're just doing the Democrats' bidding. They are tied at the hip, manufactured crisis. And on Thursday, they will do a predictably one last time with all the phony lying outrage they'll be able to manufacture. They want to bludgeon President Trump, which has been their goal all along, by any and all means necessary, and they have only one day left. And, by the way, just breaking moments ago, Sara Carter's reporting that three of those Democrats, Congressman Elijah Cummings, Maxine Waters, and the cowardly Adam Schiff actually signed a secret pact behind closed doors, vowing to target President Trump and subpoena all of his financial and banking records -- oh, by the way, which means more evidence. They've even moved on from collusion."

    {
      "speaker": "This letter obtained by Sara Carter from Congressman Jim Jordan, it is now raising serious concern over this secret agreement to take down a president. And according to a congressional source, quote",
      "utterance": "This is not how committees normally operate. The Democrats aren't interested in legislating, only attacking the president. Sara Carter will join us in a moment and give us that full report. But that's what the president is up against and has been up against from day one. Now, if the president cured cancer tonight and gave every American $5 million and adopted their sick agenda, they would still hate him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Here's my prediction",
      "utterance": "When the Mueller report is released on Thursday, the same people that have lied all along, this is going to find something, anything in the report to bludgeon the president. By the way, it's not going to work again. Many on the left are already speculating that the 30- plus hours of testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn is going to be the linchpin providing the damning evidence of wrongdoing. OK, let's do something the media mob won't do. Let's take an honest look at truth and facts. We know for a fact the special counsel found no Russia collusion between Trump or anyone in his campaign. As a matter of fact, we have the quote from the Mueller report right here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "This is from the Mueller report",
      "utterance": "The investigations did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. No collusion. We also know for a fact that three previous investigations also cleared the president. And when it comes to the claims that the president obstructed justice, we also know for a fact that Mueller did not charge the president with obstruction. And we know that Barr, Rod Rosenstein, the DOJ's nonpartisan Office of Legal Counsel and, yes, and conjunction with talking to the Mueller team, cleared the president from any charges. It's a fact that President Trump did not fire Mueller. They're going to say, well, he wanted to fire him, but he didn't. They're going to say, well, he wanted to fire Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions. OK, he didn't. He didn't impede any investigation anywhere. He didn't interfere with General Flynn's case, except wishing that he wouldn't get in trouble and he got in trouble. And as Comey said, the president is right to fire him for any reason or no reason at all. Now, did the president talk about these things? Yes. Did he talk about them a lot? Yes. The witch hunt, the Democrats on Mueller's team, firing Sessions, Rosenstein, hoping that General Flynn, a 33 year military hero wouldn't get hurt -- kind of like all the deep stat guys. They talked an awful lot about things, too, like wearing a wire to spy on the president. They talked about trying to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove a duly elected president. Well, they didn't do it, but they talked about it a lot. So, if a president expresses frustration, just like those FBI DOJ guys, about them being investigated are not getting their political by over a serious crime that he didn't commit, it's not obstruction. Also, there is no intent, very important as it relates to the law. Calling out the Trump-hating Democrats who Mueller appointed to probe this whole thing, that is not obstruction. Frankly, that was the right thing to do. And last but not least, firing Comey, not obstruction. And, by the way, here's the good news. President Trump summed it up perfectly when he tweeted out, Mueller, the A.G., and the A.G. based on Mueller findings on great intelligence have already ruled no collusion, no obstruction. These crimes were committed by crooked Hillary, the DNC, dirty cops, and others. Investigate the investigators -- which we have been doing. Now, the tables have finally turned. This is their last rubber bullet.  And it will hit and it will fall to the ground, and it's all over. Now, \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Bill McGurn, smart guy, calling for a grand jury -- he is right -- to investigate factors that are in the deep state and abuse power. Quote: If the Federal Bureau of Investigation is to recover its lost reputation -- by the way, I don't agree with that. Not rank-and-file, upper echelon -- the first item on Attorney General Bill Barr's agenda must be to make good on something that set off a frenzy when he proposed it last week: an honest accounting of the FBI spying. Yes, they spied on Trump. They did. Many times. Many ways."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Anyway, the attorney general has already vowed to establish a team, thankfully, to investigate our federal government spying on the Trump campaign. Great article today by Andrew McCarthy -- he'll join us in a few minutes -- detailing some of this potentially illicit surveillance, writing, quote",
      "utterance": "Less than a year ago, we learned the Obama administration had used a confidential informant to spy, to approach at least three Trump campaign officials in the months leading up to the 2016 election, straining to find proof that the campaign was complicit in the Kremlin's hacking of Democratic emails. Now, of course, Andy McCarthy is referring to Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and Sam Clovis, who were all approached by an informant with the name of Stefan Halper. That's only the tip of the iceberg. Trump's campaign associate Carter Page was also electronically surveilled. By the way, can somebody teach Comey what that means? After Comey and others signed off on that FISA application, the bulk of coming from the coming from the unverified, unverifiable, uncorroborated dirty Russian dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton. And let's not forget about the nearly 350 percent increase in unmasking requests by top Obama officials in the election year of 2016. What did Obama know? When did he know it? By the way, Strzok and Page say all the decisions were made by Loretta Lynch. What did she know? When she did know it? Also, I think Susan Rice has questions to answer. Brennan, Clapper, even creepy Uncle Joe, what did they all know, when did they all know it? Now, soon, we'll begin to have the answers to these important questions. In a letter to the director of national intelligence, Congressman Jim Jordan, Congressman Mark Meadows, they have now requested that 53, we only got seven, 53 closed door testimony transcripts be made public. I'm sure Jerry Nadler will join them because he didn't want the release of the Starr report. Already, we have received the testimony of Bruce Ohr, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, James Baker, other FBI and DOJ officials who were involved in the witch hunt, and it was, against Donald Trump, the free passage given, of course, they literally gave a get-out-of-jail-free card because they like Hillary. They thought, the guy that interviewed her, Peter Strzok, she should won 100 million to zero. Yet she committed real crimes. We have a massive amount of classified material that was found on that unsecured private server that was managed by Platt River Networks. It was in a bathroom closet. She committed a real crime, and thus had a real intent to obstruct justice by destroying the evidence of that crime. Hence, the 33,000 deleted, acid washed emails. Now, the media on Thursday, they are going to pretend they care about obstruction of justice. Meanwhile, all of them will ignore the biggest slam-dunk obstruction of justice case in history. That's right, Hillary's case. And just like Democrats, remember, they believed all the Kavanaugh accusers. \"I believe.\" They believe. But their silence is deafening when it comes to lieutenant governor of Virginia, oh, he's been accused of rape and violent sexual assault. So, where are all the \"I believers\"? You know, obstruction matters, but only if it's Trump, not Hillary Clinton. Charges of rape, serious sexual assault only matters if you're appointed by Trump but not the Democratic lieutenant governor of Virginia. Look at your screen, a clear violation of the Espionage Act, 18 USC 793. There is the law. Why was Hillary cleared? Because the investigation was rigged. Why did Comey and Strzok start writing an exoneration in May? They didn't interview here until July. Why did they take out gross negligence, the legal standard, and replace it with extreme carelessness? Why did Peter Strzok allow two other people in the interview room when he was interviewing Clinton on July 2nd, 2016?  Comey exonerated her on July 5th. They had written that first in May. Why did Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch really talk about on that secret meeting on the tarmac in Phoenix just before Hillary was cleared? Did Lynch, the FBI, did they work in concert together to clear the Clintons?  Did they rig that investigation when it's obvious she committed multiple felonies because she was the one that should win 100 million to zero and Trump supporters were nothing but smelly Walmart voters? From Hillary Clinton's rigged investigation, spying on the Trump campaign, to committing a fraud and FISA abuse, to unmasking American citizens and abusing the powerful tools of intelligence, to everything in between, we will now finally get the answers. I know that media won't go there because then they'd have to admit they are wrong. They won't apologize, they won't retract. They won't say, jeez, this ensemble cast got it right. Don't hold your breath. We're going to have a lot more on this throughout the show. But, first, we also must report tonight on our \"Hannity Watch\" on the radical socialists, 2020 Democrats. It's been a very revealing way for some of the far left sycophants trying to become president. We start with the current mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Yes. That guy, Mayor Pete. Peter Buttigieg is his name, who said that the Electoral College is just one big Republican manipulation of the system. OK. Watch this."

Most Americans don't want this. Most Americans don't want the conservative agenda that we are now seeing, the extreme agenda that we are seeing in Washington. In fact, it is precisely for that reason that they have to interfere with democracy with things like voter suppression or clinging on an Electoral College that overrules the will of the American people. It is precisely because the American people by and large don't want what they are selling that they are relying on manipulations of our political structure in order to keep their agenda in place."

If he wants the good people of his home state of Indiana to have a voice in the presidential election -- I like the people from Indiana -- he should probably rethink what is his unconstitutional stance on the Electoral College because without our current system, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and California, they would decide every national contest. His state of Indiana, for that matter, New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, all those red states down South, they would be totally ignored. It wouldn't matter. Is that with the good mayor wants? Now, sadly, Mayor Pete is not the only Democrat trampling on the U.S. Constitution. California Congressman Eric Swalwell, well, he's actually running on an anti-Second Amendment agenda. Look at this. Now, first, he suggested the federal government could easily disarm Americans because it has nukes, OK? But on Sunday, he took it down a notch and said that he just supports jailing Americans who don't comply with his plan to seize guns that he classifies as dangerous. Here comes the government.

There is no question -- there should be no dispute that surveillance happened, whatever you want to call it. The issue is, was it properly predicated? And I think what we are seeing now, there seems to have been an insufficient predicate, and all I can say is from my own perspective, if I had authorized an investigation of the president, if I had used the government's counterintelligence powers in order to investigate the campaign of the opposition party and people were calling me out about whether I had a good reason for it, I wouldn't be able to wait to tell you what it was. So, I think it's very telling that, you know, rather than invite an inquiry into what caused this investigation to take place in the first place, what they are doing is attacking the people who simply want answers to simple questions, how did this get originated? What was the reason for it?"

I now have a copy of the letter to which you refer, and that is Elijah Cummings got a letter from Congressman Jim Jordan, as he, Maxine Waters, and cowardly Schiff, Adam Schiff, apparently were sending out secret memorandums of understanding about how to get Trump at the next level. So, even though Thursday ends collusion, ends obstruction, in all reality and truth, and begins everything we've talked about for two years, now, they want to go to the next conspiracy theory.

I mean, Congressman Jordan, who is the ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, actually discover this within recent days, that Adam Schiff, as well, Maxine Waters, and Elijah Cummings -- Elijah Cummings, who's the chairman of the committee, basically withheld those from the ranking member, and that's against the committee rules. So, they basically sign these memorandums of understanding in secrecy. So it's kind of like a pact between all of them to go after and target President Trump. One of the things they wanted was Mazars USA LLP, which was Trump's former accounting firm while he was in the private sector, and they want all the documentation, all financial records going back to 2009. I mean, this is really incredible. And they are going to have a huge fight on their hands, because once again, the investigation, Robert Mueller's investigation, has been wrapped up. They found no conspiracy, no collusion with Russia. We have seen it on the other side. And as far as obstruction, there were no obstruction charges whatsoever. So, now, they are looking for something else. They're digging deeper, but they have a huge fight on their hands. I know Congressman Jordan, Congressman Meadows and others are very angry about this, and I don't think they are going to get any of that documentation anytime soon."

Then, we have, let's see, criminal referrals by Nunes. Then, we got the Horowitz report, the Huber report, then we'll eventually get the FISA applications, the bulk of which was based on the Hillary bought and paid for Russian lies, then we'll get 302s, and Gang of Eight information, this really is just starting, except this time there is a real evidence, not hype."

We know the top-line conclusions, and it's understood there is no evidence of collusion. But don't forget that the information that Bob Mueller was given by the FBI included a lot of dirt that hasn't been out yet. Remember, we know that Bruce Ohr, he was having other conversations with Christopher Steele, with Fusion GPS. He was passing this along to the FBI, and these are probably things that Mueller looked at as well. Democrats are going to comb through this report and they're going to throw all that out there.

I think Michelle Obama has been known for being very honest. And she doesn't tend to edit herself. I think that when she does it's a deliberate effort to do so. This may have reflected more of her point of view. But the problem here is it's not just insulting to men and for every woman and man out in that audience who didn't quite know why she was insulting them. But it relies also on the other side of the coin which is the gender stereotype of women that all women are supposed to be either great mothers or only women can raise children or only women can be good parents. Now, the best scenario is two parents who love those kids and we know that love is love and it's about you know the nature of who can love a child. And that is also of course a part of the problem of her remarks is the gender stereotyping that the left is normally going out against. She really destroys in that regard.

But I think we need to keep that in mind, it's weird how Democrats keep doing that and keep surprising us with these kinds of opinions, isn't it?"

When we come back, we do have updates on two scandals one involving Lori Loughlin, Jussie Smollett and Trace Gallagher has a full report. Also, Candace Owens will be here confronted by a group of protesters, some with their faces covered in a really scary scenario at a college campus yesterday. She'll give us all the details."

      "utterance": "Yes. She said, she was scammed in this and before we get to that show and we have breaking news coming out of Chicago, two weeks before dropping the charges against Jussie Smollett, The Chicago Tribune reports that State's Attorney Kim Foxx sent text messages to her top Deputy Joseph Magats calling Smollett, a washed up celeb, but also said that compared to R&B star R. Kelly, Smollett had been overcharged quoting here pedophile with four victims, 10 counts washed up celeb who lied to cops, 16 meaning counts. In the messages, Foxx acknowledges having recused herself, but is clearly still involved quoting just because we can charge something doesn't mean we should. Magats response \"agreed.\" We can get a hard look at how we charged the cases and get it to something that covers what needs to be covered without being excessive and ultimately pointless. And on the day the charges were dropped, Foxx texted that she had just spoken with Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, \"laugh out loud.\" He's at the police recruit event needed to know how to answer questions from press told him essentially deferred prosecution paying 10k restitution to the city and completed community service. He was told, we were just dropping the charges. He seems satisfied with the explanation except Eddie Johnson was furious with the decision as was then Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Smollett is now being sued by the city. Meantime, now to Lori Loughlin, a source close to the actress is telling Entertainment Tonight that those who orchestrated the cheating scandal misled Loughlin about the severity of her involvement and that she and her husband were under the impression, they were breaking rules, not laws. The source goes on to say, \"they realize how serious the charges are, but feel that once the judge hears their story, he will see they had no bad intentions.\"  The legal experts say, it's difficult to imagine any judge thinking of $500,000 bribe is based on good intentions.

Turning Point USA Communications Director Candace Owens was confronted by protesters, some wearing masks, how well courageous of them while she was walking on U Penn campus yesterday. She was on her way to give a speech. Here's what happened. Candace Owens joins us now with more. Candace when I first met you, we had a very direct conversation. I don't know if you remember it. And I remember warning you that a lot of people will hate you for being a conservative. And an African-American.

Under the eight years of Obama, minorities in America were disproportionately negatively impacted by his policies, eight years. Trump becomes President, we have record low unemployment African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment. We're breaking every record imaginable. The people that are benefiting the most are the same people that were hurt the most under Obama's policies. Will this begin to resonate because I think you agree with me on that.

That is why they are upping their attacks on me because they think that I am a part of the reason why it is resonating in the black community. I have said this, I said this on your show back when I was first on it. There will be a black exit, a Blexit from the Democrat Party. In 2020, the black vote is fully on the table and they are petrified because they rely on the black vote. We are talking about moving at five points and the Democrat Party is toast. These antics that you're seeing is really their fear. The updated KKK as I like to call them and TFA covering their faces harassing me trying to get me deplatformed."

I will forever and I encourage all black Americans who have the audacity to think for themselves, walk through the front door. If Ruby Bridges could do it at six years old in the 1960s. I sure can do it in 2019 in a free country of America being blessed by a great presidency."
