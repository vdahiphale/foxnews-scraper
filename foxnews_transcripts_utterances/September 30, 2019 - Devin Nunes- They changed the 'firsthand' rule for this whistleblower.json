Oh, another city run by liberals. Well, getting out of the New York/Washington Acela corridor, it always reminds me that Americans are generally a lot fairer, smarter, and more practical-minded than a lot of the bigwigs in politics and the media, especially in so-called flyover country. They have a pretty keen sense of what matters, where the solutions might be found, and what's not working. A lot of folks approached me - well, no pies were thrown, thank goodness - but they approached me with comments like these. Laura, what's with all the craziness in Washington? Is this going to hurt the economy? Why don't they just let the voters decide next November?

Second, while a Quinnipiac poll shows 47 percent support impeachment, it also finds 56 percent of voters believing that lawmakers supporting it are doing so based on partisan politics, not the facts.

I just want to remind your viewers tonight, in October 17 of 2016, CBS News said, head-to-head matchup, Hillary Clinton defeats Donald Trump 51-to-40 in a complete blowout. Obviously, three weeks later, Donald Trump wins the election. And so, look, these polls are driven by what they think the actual American people want to see. So they're trying to set the narrative. The media is no longer just reporting the news. They're making the news. And what they want to do, in my opinion, is they want to get the American people behind this impeachment by saying \"Americans support this by and large. This is something that we all want.

That's the focus of tonight's Angle. It was nice to get out of Washington last week even if it was only for a few days in Chicago. Oh, another city run by liberals. Well, getting out of the New York/Washington Acela corridor, it always reminds me that Americans are generally a lot fairer, smarter, and more practical-minded than a lot of the bigwigs in politics and the media, especially in so-called flyover country. They have a pretty keen sense of what matters, where the solutions might be found, and what's not working.

Many of them are angry with America. They don't care if impeachment is bad for the country, if it's going to hurt our economy, or even the President's ability to conduct foreign policy. Why don't they care? Because they think we're basically a racist country that hasn't made amends. They think we're destroying the environment. They think our history is one long narrative of victimization. They think much of our patriotic tradition, our art, our music, our monuments are all symbols of oppression and ignorance. They think we're a nation founded by evil white men from whom we have basically nothing to learn. They think that our electoral system that it even allowed Trump to win just confirmed, in their minds, that the system has to be scrapped altogether."

What a wit, by the way, about Ukraine or because they really think Trump is conspiring with another country to rig the 2020 election? They don't think any of that. In fact, I'd argue that impeachment for this nothing-burger phone call is itself a form of Democrat election interference. And by the way, the Democrats are fine with using impeachment as a political weapon. Oh, boy, are they fine! Because they see impeachment as a way to punish not only Trump, but us. After all, we elected him. Remember, they called us deplorables. We're clinging to our guns and our religion. And when Obama said, punish your enemies, he was talking about you. Cory Booker, last week, used the word \"despicable\" to describe Trump voters. The left now is so radical that they believe any election result is crooked if it doesn't advance what they consider to be legitimate social justice causes. In other words, if you win and you're a conservative, you really haven't won, you've stolen the election, always.

It's also why they rely so heavily on life tenure judges to legislate from the bench on everything from immigration to abortion. Take the issues away from the American people. Again, they can't trust the voters. The Nancy-Ocasio-Pelosi democrats see the voters as speed bumps on the way to the progressive promise land. But watch out, kids, because these speed bumps have spikes. And if your party stays on this anti-democratic road, you won't just lose a tire, you're going to blow an axle. And that's THE ANGLE. In moments, we're going to debate just how much the Democrats are risking with this ridiculous impeachment push and how it's turning off a wide swath of American voters.

Sol, the Democrats clearly believe they have an impeachable offense on their hands. Do you agree? SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No, I don't agree.

So he has until Thursday to provide us the facts, the evidence, the emails. Why did they - because they admit that they changed this regulation. OK? This guideline, they changed it because of this whistleblower. He admits it in his own press release. So the mainstream media is trying to cover this up. The Inspector General, he may be happy with the press he reads in the mainstream media, but come Thursday, if he doesn't provide the actual evidence, all the communications, we will see him on Friday and we will interview him on this.

They may have abused other policies and procedures by targeting U.S. citizens with sources, confidential sources, completely outside of the guidelines.

They have tried to encourage the attorney general to recuse and undermine his credibility. And then the final thing is to malign any legitimate investigation looking into the Ukrainian connection as part of the investigation about the origins of the Russia investigation that led to the investigation of the president and the appointment of a special counsel. And the great news here is that be careful what you ask for, because the avalanche is coming. In October, Michael Horowitz is likely to release his report. And in the midst of all of that, there will be likely referrals to the Department of Justice for prosecution. And at the same time John Durham is conducting an investigation, and the attorney general is dead serious about the fact that he is going to get to the bottom of this, which is an entirely legitimate theme. And as you suggest, Laura, that does not mean that the former Vice President Joe Biden who is a current presidential candidate is immune from legitimate investigation."

That's fruit of the poisonous Trump tree.

And if you read the statement, which I'm not convinced that the leaker actually wrote, but if you read the statement, it is based on absolutely nothing but hearsay and terrible accusations against the president of the United States that are not substantiated by anything even in the statement. The so-called whistleblower says 12 times that he had no direct evidence to what he is saying, 18 times that he overheard the evidence from, quote- unquote, several U.S. government officials, never mentioning their name or their identities at all. And Laura, if this was a court case, as you know, based on hearsay, the judge would throw it out.

So that in itself I think needs to be looked into. And most alarmingly, at least to me, having been in the CIA, is the fact that the whistleblower complaint form properly prohibited hearsay information, as it should. And yet secretly, without anybody knowing it, the whistleblower complaint form was changed and altered to allow, unbelievably, hearsay, in other words second or third party information for this kind of complaint.
