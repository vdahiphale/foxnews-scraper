Some conservatives now as you just heard me reference are self-quarantining after interacting with someone infected with the Coronavirus at CPAC. Matt Schlapp is one of those in self-quarantine.

Plus, Hillary Clinton is decrying her innocence or crying for her innocence in a new documentary. And did Biden really endorse President Trump, no, he didn't.

They should continue to have these no-nonsense briefings to the press, preferably I think at the same time every day that would also be very reassuring. Now, as I said weeks ago, total transparency, even about the bad stuff is going to go a long way to calm things down. Public is going to know; we're going to get through this. We're America.

We need to get back to made in America, especially when it comes to essential items that we cannot do without like medical supplies, medical devices, prescription and over-the-counter medicines. China has a virtual monopoly on the ingredients used in antibiotics. We should never have allowed that to happen. It's time to decouple, incentivize companies to bring manufacturing back home. We need to be less dependent on global markets and more self-sufficient.

We've got to be stronger on these borders. My final point. While some people are being flown back to Mexico pending their cases, thousands are still getting in. Impossible to screen completely for health. You bet. It's impossible to do this. Now is not the time for us to take in any extra burdens on our schools, my son's schools, by the way, are closed all week in Montgomery County, Maryland. We don't need any more burdens on the schools or the health care system. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And finally, although Trump can't order the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and impending agency, we all should keep pressure on the Fed to do that. Rates should be lowered. Another stimulus needed.

If Democrats want to stand in the way of these commonsense measures, let them go to their constituents and defend that move. Look, bad things happen. This virus is one of them. But setting off panic around the world is not the answer. We need to calm everything down. Proposed smart legislation will help do that. Now think about this. If Trump, like day after day, is saying that he has a plan that's going to save the U.S. economy and yet Pelosi just grandstands. She won't meet. She won't compromise. She won't even allow a vote. Then Americans will have all the information they need to make an informed choice in November and inoculate the United States from the Democrats virus of failed leadership. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Remember, a President Biden? He's going to make it more certain, not less certain, that we're dependent on the very country that allowed this virus to spread. China. And that is not the way to go. And that's THE ANGLE. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right.

Obama could not get nominated to the Democratic Party leader in this environment based on his positions. So that pivot is really interesting.

If you're an elderly person or have a serious underlying condition, avoid tight closed places. A lot of people. Don't take a cruise maybe. Everyone else, wash your hands. Use good judgment about your daily activities, pragmatic thinking especially if you've been overseas recently and one of the hardest hit areas. The President's Coronavirus team is literally working around the clock to fight the epidemic spread and to give the public the most up to date information and guidance. They should continue to have these no-nonsense briefings to the press, preferably I think at the same time every day that would also be very reassuring. Now, as I said weeks ago, total transparency, even about the bad stuff is going to go a long way to calm things down. Public is going to know; we're going to get through this. We're America. We do big things. We get through tough stuff. But apart from fighting the medical issues and the public health aspect of this nasty virus, there are four steps the President himself can take in an effort to protect America from sustaining deep economic wounds. Steps by the way that harken back to his original America First agenda. Number one, immediately send your infrastructure proposal to Capitol Hill. No more delays. If the parties were working in good faith, it should have happened years ago. Call Pelosi and Schumer. Bring him back to the White House. No more drama, no more finger pointing by Nancy or running out or photo ops or running to the mic or the cameras, just get it non.

Number three, propose a new U.S. industrial policy that's good for businesses and workers. We need to get back to made in America, especially when it comes to essential items that we cannot do without like medical supplies, medical devices, prescription and over-the-counter medicines. China has a virtual monopoly on the ingredients used in antibiotics. We should never have allowed that to happen. It's time to decouple, incentivize companies to bring manufacturing back home. We need to be less dependent on global markets and more self-sufficient. This latest crisis makes the wisdom of Trump's America First agenda all the more compelling. We can't keep flooding America with migrant families on the bogus asylum pretense either. We've got to be stronger on these borders. My final point. While some people are being flown back to Mexico pending their cases, thousands are still getting in. Impossible to screen completely for health. You bet. It's impossible to do this. Now is not the time for us to take in any extra burdens on our schools, my son's schools, by the way, are closed all week in Montgomery County, Maryland. We don't need any more burdens on the schools or the health care system. And finally, although Trump can't order the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and impending agency, we all should keep pressure on the Fed to do that. Rates should be lowered. Another stimulus needed. You bet. If America enters a formal recession, well, Americans across every socioeconomic group, every age group, every ethnicity, every state, every county will suffer, many greatly. If Democrats want to stand in the way of these commonsense measures, let them go to their constituents and defend that move. Look, bad things happen. This virus is one of them. But setting off panic around the world is not the answer. We need to calm everything down. Proposed smart legislation will help do that. Now think about this. If Trump, like day after day, is saying that he has a plan that's going to save the U.S. economy and yet Pelosi just grandstands. She won't meet. She won't compromise. She won't even allow a vote. Then Americans will have all the information they need to make an informed choice in November and inoculate the United States from the Democrats virus of failed leadership. Remember, a President Biden? He's going to make it more certain, not less certain, that we're dependent on the very country that allowed this virus to spread. China. And that is not the way to go. And that's THE ANGLE. All right. Joining me now as my voice is holding up, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

But my next guest did, because he's the head of CPAC and that's Matt Schlapp, ACU Chairman and he joins me now from self-quarantine. Matt, I've never seen you on Skype. It's very interesting.

For the record, if I do get the Coronavirus, I'm attending every MAGA rally I can. Another Twitter troll said the Coronavirus has been detected at an attendee at CPAC, an event that many Trump officials attended. The Trump administration may have to be quarantined, which is actually good news for America.

If the press wants to try to cover the Coronavirus, they have to cover it wherever it goes, including two liberal events where a lot of Democratic senators and congressmen gather. And I think what we're going to learn with this virus is, yes, we all have to listen to our doctors and the health care experts, and that's what Mercy and I have been doing. But part of that is if you're older or your immune system is compromised, you need to take special care, healthy people that run into one person that may have the virus.

But at this event, the press people asking whether the President got tested, did the President get tested. And I don't know if he got tested or not, but it's just like ridiculous.

That is - that's responsible public health, calm thinking in a crisis like this. Well, I saw the President at CPAC and the Vice President, they're scrubbing their hands all the time.

I don't think that's good for anyone, not just the economy, but also people's own immune systems, that negative energy, that negativity that people unfortunately, a lot of them are spewing on Twitter about this, ginning up the outrage and chaos isn't good for your own ability to find out this virus.

To wish the coronavirus on anyone, anyone, especially the president of the United States, or just anyone, forget the president, but with such glee. There seems to be an enjoyment factor when the market collapses today, or when the virus is spread, or where there is another death. There are actually people on Twitter who are celebrating, that is the state of American politics today. Allie, close it out."

Last week employees over at the publishing house, Hachette, they staged a walkout to protest the publishing houses Woody Allen memoir, forthcoming Woody Allen memoir. He is accused of sexual abuse, but nothing has ever been proven. Following that walkout, Hachette canceled the Woody Allen biography. Look, I think Woody Allen is as creepy as the next guy, but here you have Bill Clinton, an admitted abuser of women, so far as I can see, not one Hulu employee has protested. There is no staged walkout. And here he is using this documentary to clear up his name, justify his actions. I guess it's Me Too, but not you, Bill. I guess that's how this works over at Hulu."

Manipulated media is when you have deep fakes and they use it to put words in people's mouth or distort their intention. Obviously, Biden was not endorsing from. But it does speak to his inability to assemble sentences on the fly, Laura, and it raises questions about his cognitive state and ability to even read a script. Watch the full clip for context."

They say apparently the DNC and Biden campaign agreed to a seated town hall style debate, Laura, with audience questions. The Sanders campaign is now balking. They say wait a minute, we want a say here, too. So there may be some compromise along the way. But Laura, they are electing here, and for the first time voters are being asked to support not a presidential candidate, but a vice presidential candidate. Joe Biden is not the man he was, and I think that is partially what the Sanders campaign is pointing out."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Beyond normal, that is actually a good name for a show. Maybe next time. Biden's caretakers have other ideas. \"Axios\" is reporting that Biden advisors describe a return to normal plan. Biden wants known, trusted people around him, many from the Obama years. Who was unmasking whom here? That includes swamp creatures like John Kerry, Susan Rice, and good old Sally Yates. Joining me now is Charlie Hurt, \"Washington Times\" opinion editor, FOX News contributor. Also with me is Scott Bolden, attorney and former chair of the D.C. Democratic Party. Charlie, it looks like he is planning for Obama's third term, and a lot of these people have been waiting in the wings working with consulting groups and itching to go back in and do exactly what? CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  Exact what they did for the eight years that President Obama was there. But it's interesting, first of all, the pivot for Biden to suddenly start running on Obama's record, after the past two years we have seen them running away from it, because, of course, the Democratic Party is running away from Obama. Obama could not get nominated to the Democratic Party leader in this environment based on his positions. So that pivot is really interesting. And then the other thing is, as you point out, there is this thing that we see every couple years where you have people who are signaling to all of the swamp creatures that if you just help me get the nomination and get me into the White House, I will put you back in the White House. I'll give you --"

      "utterance": "I think it's real early. We have got nine months before the election, or eight months before the election. This is projecting, if you will. But I am not so surprised that Biden is running on Obama's record because he has beaten Bernie Sanders pretty badly. And if you look at the Obama economy, he inherited the worst from Bush II and he created 16 million jobs, he put 20 million on health care. That is not really a bad record to run on. And by the way, the media focuses on Bernie Sanders and the far left of the party, but I've argued with you and on the show several times that it is the middle Democrats, the business Democrats, the conservative Democrats that are putting Biden I had. And Biden is headed towards this nomination."

But my question is this -- could you imagine Bernie Sanders playing some silly game like this right now where he goes and gets some willing reporter, sends some signals that this is who we are going people our administration with. Bernie would not do that, and that is exactly why Democrats are so fearful of Bernie Sanders, because they want the safe bet.
