And she even said, listen, it was Rosanna Arquette that came forward to tell me this, and kind of owning it, to say I should have done something.

I think Hillary Clinton's was more contrived earlier in the week, basically saying, well, I and many others have no idea. But Jane Fonda was owning it saying, I don't know why I didn't come forward. I probably should have. It wasn't my story to tell. It's complicated. KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Yeah. I think it was one of her better public interviews and appearances to be quite honest. I think maybe it would give people pause and reflection to think about if there's something they've seen or they've experienced or someone has told them about and coming forward and actually making a difference, you know, ahead of time. But you can tell the truth, being very genuine, being very authentic. You know, a lot of -- I guess, veracity and what it seems like in terms of her story and she was specific. And she even said, listen, it was Rosanna Arquette that came forward to tell me this, and kind of owning it, to say I should have done something. I could have done more, especially with her name and her clout and, you know, her position in Hollywood. GREG GUTFELD, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: It's not the first time she's picked the wrong side, let's be honest. JESSE WATTERS, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: No."

And you just think Harvey is the only fur ball, I don't think so. I think the positives -- what we can get out of this is we no longer need to take any moral lecturing from these holier than thou celebrities who are telling us about climate change, about the environment, who lecture us on sexism in the workplace, or racism when they have been living with this secret. We've talked about this before. There's no such thing as an open secret if everybody knows about it. It's actually a secret that you're hiding. They tolerated this. And, I don't know. I don't think I will ever be able to take any moral advice from Meryl Streep again."

She didn't want to be the crusader against Weinstein and stand there alone, and all hell would rain down on her legally, politically, and P.R. wise if she choose to do that. So a lot of women are now coming forward because other women are coming forward. And I think the more people to come forward it's going to create a title wave, and hopefully you get justice at the end of that. But the cover up a lot of times they say is worse than the crime. All the board members at the Weinstein Company, apparently they had language in his contract that sexual assault or misdemeanors, so to speak."

They have a lot of deals with the Weinstein Company, through Bravo, through NBC Universal, so that raises a lot of questions about why they didn't go for it with the story.

But then, Patricia Arquette, a former playmate, accused Oliver Stone of harassment, and that's kind of explicit. We don't have to go in to it here. But you could see as the accusation start to fly -- you can see why people don't say anything because they end up in this position where they actually have to backtrack their words.

And then, when she complains about it, all that happens is he doesn't appear at her parties or any event that she's involved with. And just as an aside, her dad turns out to be Philip K.

He's trying to frame this as I am not a sexual predator, I am someone who has a sex addiction problem, so therefore I'm, you know, less culpable, and it's like a built-in excuse.

But they essentially were licensing criminal sexual conduct and saying that it was OK for you to do this as long as you pay us back.

So then, in people talking about why NBC executives didn't do this, they say, well, you know, some of the executives say it wasn't quite the same story. But they also say Ronan Farrow, of course, the son of Mia Farrow, had been involved with his sister making allegations against Woody Allen. And I'm wondering if people think, you know, this whole industry and all the connections, they just aren't sure.

When the president had done this already two times after he was sworn in, he said he did not want to do it again. He ran on his campaign saying that the deal was one of the worst that United States has ever signed on to. He was mad because -- well, that this technical compliance might be true in some cases, but that the spirit of the deal was not being lived up to, and that, in particular, talks about how Iran, for example, was sending in -- mailing in its own soil samples."

And then, I thought was extremely bold, and the additional step taken that I don't think people saw throughout the week until it was announced today, is that he singled out the Iranian revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization. And I think that that is actually the first time that's ever been done about another country's actual military, to call them a terrorist organization. Extremely bold. But I also note that tonight, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said that his country will continue to stick to the nuclear deal despite U.S. President Trump's accusation that they've violated the spirit of it, and it's much stronger than Trump believes. So, I think, as Jesse and I was talking in the break, that's Jesse is right that Rouhani loves the deal because it was a better deal for Iran that it was for us."

We're all safer, even Juan, as a result of President Trump's passion today, even though he did kick it to congress which is a little risky if congress can do something in 60 days. They have a lot on their plate. I'm not so confident. We'll see what happens. But, like you've said the revolutionary guard, they're causing mayhem in Iraq. They're exporting terror through Hezbollah and through Hamas. Israel came out today extremely happy about this. The Saudis, extremely happy about this. All of our allies never thought this was a good deal. If you look at what happened with North Korea."

And now we're under a nuclear umbrella. So that was a lesson. Trump took that lesson and is now looking at using it with the Iranians. So what do we do now? If we get out of the deal, are we safer? Everybody says, oh, no, we're not as safe if we get out. I think we're absolutely more safe. They're not even letting us inspect military sites. How is that impossible to violate? I mean, that is the key ingredient to having the deal, full, unfettered inspection. If that's not on the table and they're continuing to test their ballistic missile program, and chanting death to America, it's not a good deal."

How about the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, he said that, in fact, Iran has held up their end of the deal. And then so you come to options. Number one option, congress does nothing, right? OK. And the fact Jesse said that's the most likely outcome. Second, impose economic sanctions on Iran that would kill the deal. Or third, open up new negotiations. But, of course, we're not offering anything in terms of new negotiations. We're not saying, oh, we'll give you this in exchange for that, so why would they negotiate? So we come to Rouhani, the president. Rouhani is the moderate in this situation in Iran. He wants a deal with the U.S. because he is trying to moderate a lot of the Iranian negative influence in the Middle East. It's the ayatollah who was delighted that this deal is done because the ayatollah is now saying to all the other partners, and by the way, that includes Russia, China, Britain, France, who all like this deal and don't want to decertify, and saying to them you can't trust the United States. They make deals and they break them. Do you know what this is about? This is about Donald Trump not doing ObamaCare, not being able to do tax reform, not doing a wall, and now he's saying to his base, oh, but I did this. This is terrible."
