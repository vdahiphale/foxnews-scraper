They are Brett Kavanaugh from the DC Circuit, the Sixth Circuit's Raymond Kethledge and Amy Coney Barrett of the Seventh Circuit. Now Kavanaugh is kind of the steady Washington insider, the 53 year old sits on the same powerful court that served as stepping stone for three current Supreme Court Justices as well as the late Anthony Scalia. He clerked for retiring Justice Kennedy and he had deep ties to his former boss President George W. Bush. Another former Kennedy clerk, Judge Raymond Kethledge. The 51 year old who's known for being a bit of a loner. He's less high profile and has less of a judicial record than Kavanaugh but he's also a lot less controversial which could help him get confirmed, help him get through this Senate. And then there's Amy Coney Barrett, the only female finalist, we believe. She has seven children, she clerked for the late Justice Anthony Scalia and she's a devout Catholic. But her writings on overturning judicial precedent have raised a red flag with a very critical Republican Senator Susan Collins who fears that she might overturn Rowe versus Wade.

Today the Democratic Party is the party of open borders, multiculturalism, and environmentalism, positions that reduce wages, divide communities, and undermine economic prosperity. The traditional base of white working class Democrats either cannot relate to or are opposed to these policies and as a result have been leaving the Democratic Party in droves.\" Joining us now to debate is Garland Nixon, a radio talk show host and Democratic strategist, along with actor and current Republican Congressional candidate in California, Antonio Sabato Jr. Thank you both for joining us this morning.

President Trump just wrapped up a big rally in Montana a short time ago making waves, as you can imagine, with everything from immigration to Maxine Waters to his favorite nickname for his favorite senator in Massachusetts. We've got it all covered for you this evening plus three candidates are said to remain for President Trump's Supreme Court pick, that's what Fox News is reporting tonight. We've got new details on the Democratic onslaught against whoever the finalist is, no matter who he or she may be. And why we could be seeing the Democratic Party self-destruct before our eyes. News alert to you this is not your daddy's Democratic Party, more evidence tonight. But first, the battle over ICE and illegal immigration. It burst into new levels of intensity, and you might say, insanity over the July Fourth holiday with Democrat backed protests taking place across the country on Independence Day. I don't know about you but when I think Independence Day, I think protesting law enforcement. And we shouldn't be surprised after abolish ICE has become the new rallying cry for many, and not just the hard left, just the straight up left, listen. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, D—VT.: I think that this this disastrous immigration policy should be abolished. I happen to have voted against the formation of ICE back in 2002."

One protester climbed New York statue of Liberty yesterday to wave the abolish ICE banner leading to the evacuation of Liberty Island and of course plenty of American citizens and others didn't get access to Lady Liberty yesterday. After hours the protester was finally pulled down and arrested, rightfully so, by law enforcement but she could barely wait to speak out to the public following her release, listen."

We will not stand for these vile Democrat spears against our law enforcement."

Well joining us now with reaction tonight from Irvine California former ICE agent, Claude Arnold, we've got immigration attorney Allen Orr, joins us live from Washington DC and with us in studio, former INS agent Michael Cutler. Thank you gentlemen all for joining us this morning. Michael I'll start with you here in studio. You were with the INS which is the precursor to ICE. After 911 ICE was formed but yet you say even this iteration after 911 of ICE is not enough."

      "speaker": "MICHAEL CUTLER, RETIRED INS SENIOR SPECIAL AGENT",
      "utterance": "No it's not. We've got about 6,000 ICE agents for the entire country. More than half of them aren't even doing immigration enforcement. The 911 commission to which I provided--"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",

      "speaker": "CUTLER",
      "utterance": "If we're lucky. Correct the immigration laws from the interior and if we look at the 911 Commission Report and I provided testimony to the commission, multiple failures of the immigration system, particularly a lack of meaningful interior enforcement, immigration fraud, visa fraud, made it possible for the terrorists, not only in 911, but they looked at other terrorists and almost all of them exploited vulnerabilities in the immigration system. So no we've got 3,000 ICE agents enforcing immigration law versus 20,000 border patrol agents, 45,000 TSA employees and 37,000 police officers just for the city of New York. ICE is almost non-existent anyway, why in the world would you get rid of it?"

    {
      "speaker": "CLIVE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE AGENT",
      "utterance": "So as a point of correction, I too was with the INS before ICE was created. But as a point of correction, there's the enforcement removal operation division has about 6,000 officers and agents itself and all they do is civil immigration enforcement, the interior enforcement. Then Homeland Security investigations, the special agents, half of their duty is immigration enforcement, they have 6,000 agents. So if you wanted to say they spend half their time investigation immigration crimes, then I guess you could say 3,000 of them are getting on with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Fair point but 3,000 or 6,000 is still not a lot compared to other agencies as well. But talk to me about your work on the ground every day. You're accused of being a terrorist, you're accused of being a thug, you're accused of being inhumane. Talk to me about the job of an ICE agent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARNOLD",
      "utterance": "That obviously is ludicrous because ICE was born out of 911 and one of its primary responsibilities is counter terrorism and national security. They have the second largest presence on the federal joint terrorism task force of any other federal agency. They not only investigate immigration crimes related to national security threats but they also investigate customs violations related to the same thing. So export violations, export of technology that are going to bad actor countries like North Korea, potentially China. And of course the immigration stuff, disrupting and dismantling the organizations that smuggle people, goods into the US to threaten our national security."

You talked, at least I what I've read, about structural reforms to ICE as opposed to abolish ICE. But the rhetoric on the left is abolish, what's the difference in your mind?"

Before there was ICE there was INS and INS doesn't exist anymore and now ICE does exist and we still protect our borders. So this conversation about abolish ICE really is a little bit of a political fringe on both ends of the parties. So we sort of think about this for a minute, it's not about a political conversation right now--"

We are putting our platform on human rights and humanitarian rights because in your montage what was missing were the women separated from their children and this delay of 3,000 kids or maybe more that we don't know about so this conversation about ICE really isn't so much about ICE but really about this humanitarian problem we have at our border and this blown out consideration of saying, \"Oh, ICE isn't doing enough\" when in fact your first guest said CBP really is at the border, there are enough people there. We have officers in New York City so what is this great concern about what ICE is really doing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Good and it's a fair point, you talked about, Allen, about securing the border. Michael I know INS and ICE are internal enforcement but if you had the border secured, then need for ICE at the border wouldn't exist."

      "speaker": "CUTLER",
      "utterance": "We have 50 Border States, the notion that everything happens on the Mexican border is wrong. None of the 911 hijackers ran the Mexican border, go back to the 911 report. We have 50 Border States. Any state that lies on the northern and southern borders or has international airports or has access to our 95,000 miles of coast line are borders states."

      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "Do you have a little bit of an agreement with Allen though? You're saying you don't think ICE is structured properly right now, but you're argument is ICE isn't ICE enough, there aren't enough ICE agents."

    {
      "speaker": "CUTLER",
      "utterance": "Well I'll tell you who would agree with that also is the former chairman if the House Immigration Subcommittee, a Republican by the name John Hostettler. I was at a hearing with 44 months after 911, he complained that the way DHS was put together deemphasized border security and immigration enforcement. And it's remarkable 44 months after 911, that's how long it took us to win the Second World War, at that hearing we were told that they were still working on a mission statement for immigration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ORR",
      "utterance": "Exactly, even today I mean I think part of the issue that we should look at is that they really haven't had a clear mission as your guest said. They're doing this and this and this and this so what is that clear mission that they need to be doing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "But then is the answer to abolish or is the answer to refine or refine down the core mission to the fact that we don't have our arms around who's coming into the country. The President had the made the point about mare faced immigration, we don't have that right now. So until we do, would we want ICE out there aggressively enforcing our laws?"

      "utterance": "We are a country of laws and I don't think the problem here is the characterization of the issue. People applying for asylum at the southern ports is not illegal immigration, they have a right to apply for asylum, the numbers are but the problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",

      "utterance": "So it's absolutely right, ICE is essential and they are not uSed to their full effectiveness. You know, both on the left and the right there has been an ignorance oF interior enforcement. So when they passed the Immigration Control Act of 1986 the idea was, \"Okay give amnesty to people and now we're going to secure the borders and we're going to do interior enforcement. We're going to make sure that only people who are authorized to work can work\" but as long as the border is not secure, the magnet for people to come here is employment. When not enforcing that--"

      "speaker": "ARNOLD",
      "utterance": "I think they're used to it. I mean when you do this, Mr. Cutler can attest to this, it's very political. As the political winds shift, we just adjust, we're very resilient and so those agents are very resilient. Immigration enforcement is a politically charged topic and they know depending on who's in the White House, who's in the Congress the political winds will change and they--"

      "utterance": "I agree but it does. But here's what's been left out of interior enforcement, it's not just making arrests, it's going after immigration fraud. Goodness, we've given citizenship to terrorists, not only overstays. The Tsarnaev family got political asylum claiming credible fear, \"We can't go home\", they went home as soon as they got asylum. One of the brothers was a naturalized citizen, Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square bomber, a naturalized citizen. We are processing applications for citizenship, giving the keys to the kingdom to aliens without doing the investigations that are necessary to properly vet them. That's the problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "That strikes me as a good idea. Allen you talked about ports of entry. Why wouldn't the emphasis just be, if you're coming here seeking asylum, you have a legitimate issue, go to a port of entry. But as the president has pointed out, if you're going to sprint across that border knowing what you're doing is illegal, why are you given and afforded all the rights of a citizen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ORR",
      "utterance": "I don't think they're sprinting across the border as we always claim. There's a little bit of zero tolerance about people who enter between ports of entry. People are coming here to file for asylum which is a natural American law and I think if we did revamp the-"

It's about sort of reforming the system and making it work instead of backlogging the immigration than it already is, the 6,000 cases for asylum that are waiting in the courts. A huge backlog of Indian nationals and Chinese nationals waiting for legal immigration processes is not the answer. Instead of shutting down the United States and saying everybody needs to have this extreme vetting. What is this extreme vetting, I'm waiting on that memorandum to see what it is."

Well the interviews? They're over at the White House and a short list of three people, we're being told, remain as potential Supreme Court picks by President Trump. He's set to announce the final decision at 9 pm Eastern, this upcoming Monday night. And Democrats, of course, are doing everything in their power to whip up their base no matter who choice is. The resistance, it must continue. Joining us now with the latest is Fox News correspondent Kristin Fisher. Kristin, good evening."

      "utterance": "Hey Pete. Well President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One tonight that his short list has shrunk to four and he thinks that he's narrowed it down to two or three finalist. Now our sources tell Fox News that those finalists are three Appellate Court Judges, all of whom are widely regarded to be constitutional Conservatives. They are Brett Kavanaugh from the DC Circuit, the Sixth Circuit's Raymond Kethledge and Amy Coney Barrett of the Seventh Circuit. Now Kavanaugh is kind of the steady Washington insider, the 53 year old sits on the same powerful court that served as stepping stone for three current Supreme Court Justices as well as the late Anthony Scalia. He clerked for retiring Justice Kennedy and he had deep ties to his former boss President George W. Bush. Another former Kennedy clerk, Judge Raymond Kethledge. The 51 year old who's known for being a bit of a loner. He's less high profile and has less of a judicial record than Kavanaugh but he's also a lot less controversial which could help him get confirmed, help him get through this Senate. And then there's Amy Coney Barrett, the only female finalist, we believe. She has seven children, she clerked for the late Justice Anthony Scalia and she's a devout Catholic. But her writings on overturning judicial precedent have raised a red flag with a very critical Republican Senator Susan Collins who fears that she might overturn Rowe versus Wade. Now President Trump says he hopes to have have made his decision by Sunday. Then on Monday, a big prime time announcement at the White House, something he made official during that rally tonight in Montana, listen here."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",

      "speaker": "FISHER",

One liberal group is planning to spend millions, millions of dollars on advertising and activism in the senators' home states, Alaska and Maine which is the exact same strategy which they used to help defeat the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare last year. But, of course, Pete this is going to be a much more difficult fight for the Democrats to win, Pete."

As we mentioned, Democrats are throwing the kitchen sink at President Trump's Supreme Court candidates. None more than at Judge Amy Coney Barrett. You can't put it any other way, an incredibly qualified US Court of Appeals judge who is a devout Catholic and a mother of seven children. The left's hypocrisy on her is so thick you could choke on it. Joining us now for reaction is Carrie Severino, policy director of the Conservative Judicial Crisis Network and a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas along with attorney and radio talk show host Leo Terrell. Thank you both for joining us this morning. Carrie let me start with you, so the criticism of Amy Barrett and knowing how accomplished she is, is that maybe she is just too devout of a Catholic. Yet the left usually sees a qualified female candidate, and especially somebody who's already been confirmed with 55 votes, as someone who would be, yet again, breaking the glass ceiling. Why the resistance to Amy?"

What I think is happening here is you're seeing people like Senator Feinstein who are very threatened by an accomplished, articulate but conservative woman because that really puts the lie to they're identity politics. She does not to their line and they're feminist idea of what a woman should be and she understands how to defend her position. So I think that's someone are very threatened by her, that's why we saw the hard attack on her during her confirmation hearings with that famous but so strange line, \"The dogmas lives loudly within her\".

So take Roe v. Wade as an exam Kerry, there a lot of folks who look at jurisprudence on the left and the right and say that the right found there in Roe v.

That's the argument laid out by writer Ian Henderson in a new piece on the conservative website \"America Greatness.\" He writes in part, and I quote, \"Increasingly so more whites are realizing that the economically center left and socially, culturally conservative part of FDR and JFK no longer exist. The old Democratic Party was a pro-labor, pro- union party. Today the Democratic Party is the party of open borders, multiculturalism, and environmentalism, positions that reduce wages, divide communities, and undermine economic prosperity. The traditional base of white working class Democrats either cannot relate to or are opposed to these policies and as a result have been leaving the Democratic Party in droves.\" Joining us now to debate is Garland Nixon, a radio talk show host and Democratic strategist, along with actor and current Republican Congressional candidate in California, Antonio Sabato Jr. Thank you both for joining us this morning. Garland, I'm going to start with you. As a member of that party, do you feel like a party of yesteryear is no longer the party today, and as a result we you are losing crucial blocks of support?"

      "speaker": "HEGSETH",
      "utterance": "So you are agreeing with the thesis of the piece?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NIXON",
      "utterance": "Yes, but for totally different reasons, because I think the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezes and the Ben Jealouses of the world, and the Bernie Sanders are moving in a right direction, which is a populist movement, which is based on policy and not on identity politics, and that is why they are having success. And they're going to get their base to the polls. And you win by getting your base to the polls, not by running to Republicans."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",

Part of what isn't mentioned in the piece is socialism which you see candidates being elected with that label as well. Antonio, is socialism, identify politics, open borders, and environmentalism a winning formula?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANTONIO SABATO, ACTOR AND CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "No, it's a negative formula for everyone in this country. They're not the Democratic Party. They are the socialist party. I love presidents like JFK. That was the last guy for me as far as the Democratic Party. But after that and what we've seen in the last few years, especially under this new administration and the attacks that we receive every day, violence. I've never seen that before and I'm fighting against it. I think it's a sign of bullying. And I think people are walking away from the Democratic Party, and they know the Republicans are there to support America and our flag and our constitution. And that's what we're here to do, to bring prosperity and peace. That's what we want. And we want to protect our country. What's more important than that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",

Yet at the same time very much beholden to environmental interests who have a different priority and have sunk industries that President Trump has said I want to bring back because I want clean water and I want clean air, but I don't want ridiculous environmental regulations that undercut entire industries. Garland, how do you square that circle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NIXON",
      "utterance": "By disagreeing with you because I don't think industries have been sunk by environmental regulations. I think industries have been sunk by poor decisions and deregulated environments. These two things are not the same. Just because we have a clean environment, we don't have to poison ourselves just to have a strong economy."

    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",

      "speaker": "SABATO",

Why don't we talk about the people of the United States and taking care of them? Why don't we talk about the homelessness in California, why don't we take care of them? We are always talking about everything else but the American people. And that's why I'm running because I want Ventura County to be on top again, to be number one, and that's what I'm there to support and represent in November. And the Republican Party is there for the American people. We're here to make sure not only that the country is clean but is actually going to the next level and being great again at so many levels. So what we've seen in the last year and a half is great. What we've seen in taxes, our military, our border, everything is going smooth. But they want to fight it. They want to fight everything that this president is doing every day, and the Republican Party."

      "speaker": "HEGSETH",

But Garland, I was interested in one thing you said earlier, that identity politics is not the future. The whole hyphenated future as opposed to believing we are all Americans regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation. This piece argues that the Democratic Party is based in identity politics fundamentally, and that will be its undoing. How do you undo viewing people as a subgroup as opposed to a set of principles?"
    },

      "speaker": "NIXON",

Right now if you look at the polls, I don't care what you are called, if you go with legalizing marijuana, 64 percent of Americans are in favor. If you go with bringing our troops home from foreign wars you're getting close to 70 percent. So I don't care if you call yourself the Whigs, socialist, or whatever. If you are running for policies that most Americans agree with according to the polls, you're probably going to get more people to the polls and you're going to win."

And when the answer becomes Medicare for all and legalize marijuana, which is a legitimate policy position, that's fine, and socialism, that doesn't in America strike me as someone that will work."

No country under socialism has ever worked and will ever work, and especially in the United States of America has no place in this country whatsoever. But it would be great if the Democratic Party would actually work with this president, because at the end of the day, we are trying to make America great, keeping it great, doing what's best for the American people, not what's best for your party, not what is best for the leaders of your party but what's best for Americans. And Americans are waking up and they are saying we don't want to go for this anymore. This is a false lie. We are going to vote Republican because at the end of the day the Republican Party cares for the American people. That is the most important thing for me, elect people who actually care and love this country."

So it is not something that Obama initiated. But Obama became far more aggressive with it, and it seemed as if his administration believed that everyone belonged in college. And this has done a disservice for many students who were not prepared for the colleges that they have been able to gain admission. And so for black students, it results in situations where only about 38 percent graduate in six years. Many students incur debt, and they leave school, they have the debt, they don't have a college degree. They could have been successful at a lesser school or one that was more appropriate for that qualification, or maybe they were someone that could have gone into trade school."

These groups have pushed back religiously on the undoing of this policy by this president. This policy is not about whether kids do well on college campuses. This policy is making sure that we have a pool of people that are able to get into colleges and universities around the country. Right here in South Carolina, our flagship university has had issues with African-American students, same GPA, same test scores as people who do not look like them could not get into the school. So I know what that feels like. I know what it's like to be in that situation. So for this policy to be rolled back, this is simply a political move.

Case in point, take a listen to author and columnist Max Boot, who I will say I've known for years and found before to be a thoughtful guy. He claims to still be principled conservative, but listen."

They have just shown that they have no willingness to uphold the Constitution and their oaths of office. So the only way we're going to get accountability in Washington is by electing Democrats."

Joining us now to analyze is Howard Kurtz, the host of \"Media Buzz\" airing Sundays at 11:00 a.m. eastern right here on the Fox News Channel. Howard, thanks for being here. What do you make of the increasing rhetoric, anti-Trump rhetoric, from never-Trumpers."

But it is bit hard to grasp how they are now openly rooting for Democrats given that they have spent their whole careers opposing them as the party of big government, big spending, weak foreign policy. And it's hard not to notice, I'm not saying this is their motivation, but it's hard not to notice that these defections bring them favorable publicity, MSNBC contracts, and new respect from the left."

      "speaker": "HEGSETH",

And again, as I said, I have known Max Boot, smart, thoughtful guy on a lot of foreign policy stuff. But to say vote for Democrats, that's just a -- I can't add it up."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I understand from their point of view. They're saying they still feel they're conservative and President Trump is taking the party in a different direction. That's fine. But what troubles me in saying root for Democrats, what troubles me is some of the overheated rhetoric. For example in a column just the other day Max Boot wrote that the GOP has become a white nationalist party with a conservative fringe. He has also compared it to postwar Germany and Japan. It needs to be destroyed to it can be rebuilt. And I think that betrays how much they hate this president. But also the columns aren't having much of an impact on actual voters, because you look at the numbers and Trump is enjoying a record 90 percent approval among Republican voters, and they are in something of an echo chamber I would say."

How much to you think his decision to resign was driven by the media hysteria. He's made his own mistakes, but the media really went after him relentlessly. Was the media playing an oversized hand here?"

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "There is no question that Scott Pruitt made a lot of mistakes at EPA. Also no question most in the mainstream media didn't like his policies at the EPA of pruning and changing the direction of regulations and all that. But a lot of these stories really did reach a point where anybody else would have been gone from the cabinet months and months and months ago. Asking aides to find a job for his wife and that sort of thing. Laura Ingraham tweeting just the other day that he is the swamp and needed to go. I think even Republicans realize, some of them, at least, that he was becoming a political liability for the president who accepted the resignation today."

They were our Iraqi allies who fought alongside us against Al Qaeda terrorists. They fought alongside U.S. troops, putting their lives on the line every single day. They were targeted by name by Al Qaeda. Bakr and his family, Bakr is here. His family is coming here as legal immigrants and soon as citizens. They fought for many years to make sure they could get here. As we celebrated our nation's independence yesterday and freedoms this week, I got the chance to take Bakr around New York City for the first time. He'd always wanted to see it. He came and visited with me. Watch."

They are an amazing family. Welcome to America, Bakr. We are so happy to have you here. And that is all the time we have tonight. I am Pete Hegseth in for Laura Ingraham. Be sure to follow me on Twitter and @PeteHegseth. I will be back in this seat for better or for worse tomorrow evening, not morning. Until then, Ed Henry is filling in for Shannon Bream tonight.
