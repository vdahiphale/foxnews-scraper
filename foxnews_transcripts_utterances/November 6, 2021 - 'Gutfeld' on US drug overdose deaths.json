Obviously, obviously somebody cancelled. Yes. We tried everybody including the janitor with the lazy eye. But -- and I'm very excited. We got a first time guest Dr. Carl Hart. Carl is a professor of psychology at Columbia. Relax, Kat. He doesn't do outpatients. But Dr. Hart, where's that book? Dr. Hart wrote one of the bravest books you're going to find. Drug use for grownups. Oh, there it is. That was my major at Berkeley. I still can't believe you didn't ask me to write the foreword. So the book is about legalizing drugs. It might piss some of you off, but that's what the drugs are for. But the book isn't just about legalizing the easy ones like pot or mushrooms or the window cleaner that Kat mixes with Gatorade. But heroin. Now this is when people say no, no, no, not heroin. Look what that drug does. The lost souls on the streets haunting city corners like ghostly zombies living for a fix. That's true. We indeed have problems. But here's the deal. That's happening while the drugs are illegal, yet they're easier to get than COVID. Even my cats -- even my cat is dealing drugs.",

We find other country's militaries to fight the drug trade, then let anyone walk across the border with a bindle up their butt. It's more counterproductive than a broom that shoots glitter. In 2019, over 70,000 people died from overdoses in the U.S. That's 70,000 more people than have read Kilmeade's new book. Make a joke about drug death. But during the pandemic, that number exploded, probably because we were all trapped inside watching CNN. But what is causing this wave of death? Don't blame prescription opioids because as we cut down on that, the death rates skyrocket. No, today overdoses are driven by fentanyl. And like the coronavirus and cheap patio furniture. It's made in China. It comes through our southern border and it's mixed into other street drugs to kick it up a notch. It's basically hamburger helper for junkies. Tell us, Lara Logan,",

How many Americans are dying every year and we hear nothing about it. I mean, go to San Francisco, nobody cares that you got people standing on the street, pissing on themselves and, you know, and defecating everywhere you know, and unable to function.

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "sentences": "So during 12 months of the pandemic, nearly 100,000 Americans have died from O.D.s. That's a 30 percent jump. Experts blame it on this stay- at-home orders. I don't buy it because when it comes to this stuff the government is like our presidents underpants. Full of crap. I feel bad just saying that. But especially when it comes to health, it's true. Remember the nutrition pyramid. It was everywhere? Classrooms, waiting rooms, that shed where I keep the au pair. But also cereal boxes. Yes, imagine that. A box of carbs says you should stuff your face with carbs. Sadly, my chart had a typo. And I was eating 30 pounds of crabs a month. But it's cereal company telling you to eat more carbs. It's like the diamond industry telling you how many months salary you should spend on an engagement ring. We thought we were following the science but we should have been following the money. Cookie Crisp had parents thinking kids started their day right by eating a bowl of cookies. It's amazing. It's like those stories about fake doctors tricking women into physical checkups. That's what this is. And yes, I stopped doing it years ago. They repossess my van. But this chart was dead wrong and deadly. You had processed carbs in huge quantities turning healthy kids into mini Brian Stelter. Right now our adult obesity rate is 42 percent up from 34 percent just 10 years earlier. The only thing rising faster is our blood sugar. So what's that got to do with drugs? Well, the same people who lied about food are lying about drugs. Right now, when the government or media reports O.D.s, just like the crime stats, they never get specific. They never tell the whole truth. It's about illegal fentanyl, not prescription drugs. And it's not overdoses, it's poisonings. People buy drugs with fentanyl in it and they die. People -- including people that you know, from Tom Petty to Michael K. Williams, to athletes and actors, but the people you heard of dying of opioid overdoses, it's actually fentanyl poisoning, not prescriptions, but a poisons used to kill people deliberately. It's the biggest story you aren't hearing because all you hear is the word overdoses. And the worst part of this, patients who rely on legal opioids for cancer pain, and other diseases can't get them because we -- we've conflated safe drugs with fentanyl, but that's pretending two totally different things are the same, like CNN and news. Wrong way for a joke. When it's really actually terrorism, and it drives legal users to illegal stuff and they die because they can't control the dosage. Or like hot dogs they just don't know what's in it. Imagine you could only buy cigarettes illegally. But one cigarette had a thousand times the nicotine, you would die, or at least sound like Kat. But instead you can go to any market and buy a carton. In San Francisco they even let you take it, but the dosage is controlled. Meanwhile, stats show addiction is actually rare among prescription opioids and overdoses are nearly impossible to find. I bet you didn't know that. Because we're operating on the lie of all drugs bad and punish the law abiding. Here's an analogy you'll understand. What's the biggest complaint by gun owners? No, it's not that the gun jams when watching The View. It's that the laws -- it's that the laws punish the law abiding while doing nothing about illegal guns fueling street violence. It's the same argument here. We punish the law abiding and let the lawless killed. We'll even provide clean needles, so it's the spiked drugs they die from. But sadly, we target the decent person who administers drugs safely in a safe environment like a doctor's office or Kat's apartment. But it's time we stop this death. It's also time to let people seek the relief they choose. And if they don't hurt anyone, and it's nobody's business. Everyone on this planet has a right to relief, whether it's a martini, a joint or an opiod, because frankly I'm tired of buying clean urine from Steve Doocy. But if you need any D.M. me.",

      "sentences": "That's right. You know, this infrastructure vote has been a long time in coming. There's a long time running joke in Washington that it's infrastructure week and it never was. This is in fact, infrastructure week because the House of Representatives is in fact voting on this bill right now. The Senate approved this bipartisan plan back in August. Here was the holdup. You had these liberal Democrats, the progressives who were not willing to provide their votes for the infrastructure plan until they got things kind of etched in stone on the social spending plan. The $1.75 trillion plan which just a couple of weeks ago was $3.5 trillion and even higher than that. What has happened in the past hour, and you refer to these two recesses and why they're here working late on a Friday night, they're trying to get this across the finish line. What has happened is that there was an agreement between the moderate Democrats and the Liberal Democrats. The moderate Democrats secured a deal that they would get a start on the social spending plan no later than the week of November 15th. And tonight, the progressive Democrats would provide their votes for the infrastructure bill, and also for a procedural vote to tee up that social spending bill perhaps later this month. So the reason they have to do this is that Democrats only have a three vote radius in the House of Representatives. So if you lose, you know, less than a handful of votes, they cannot pass a bill on their own. Now on the infrastructure bill, keep in mind that there is a coalition of anywhere from about nine to 15 Republicans who are willing to vote yes. And I'm looking at the scoreboard right now. There are five Democratic nos on the board. But there are 10 Republican yeas and I should also say that even though this vote is not closed, yet nothing is final until they actually gavel it down in the chair, announces the total. They have 219 yeas on the scoreboard right now. The House of Representatives right now has 434 members. So the magic number is 218. There one above that. So this bill has basically passed and the House and Senate are in alignment. This could conceivably go to the president immediately and he could sign it into law. That's the first part of President Biden's domestic policy agenda here. The problem that you had is that you had this disagreement between progressives and moderates, and they just did not have the votes. If they had the votes earlier in the day, Ashley, they probably would have voted. How Speaker Nancy Pelosi does not go to the floor and lose. That's what she always says she held off all day long. And guess what they have the votes to pass this bill tonight, Ashley?",

Professor Bruce Monger, what a great name, Monger, e-mailed his class to narc on two maskless students so he could fail them. This would seem like the perfect time to avoid detection though by wearing masks. Last week fearmonger, see what I did there? E-mailed his introductory oceanography class describing the pair in detail. \"One student is a male with red hair and a fairly prominent hooked nose. His hair was pretty long, thick and wavy. The other student is a male sitting to the left he has short brown hair, maybe 1-1/2 to two inches in length and a small nose.\" This guy is really obsessed with noses. We just have names for that. For the record, Monger can be described as a puffy hair ginger with teeth like Gary Busey. He then concluded if when I find the identity of these two students, I will be failing them both for this semester. So yet again, another introductory oceanography professor that let the power -- let the power go to his head. That happens all the time. But after this e-mail went viral the school stood by the jackass but admitted his e-mail was inappropriate, saying Monger, \"Regularly advise to students of the mask requirements. He described the student's physical characteristics in ways that do not reflect Cornell values.\" He has since acknowledged that his approach was not handled in an appropriate manner. Yes, it's the describing people that's the only problem, not the notion that the vaccinated unmasked are putting the vaccinated mask at risk or that he enlisted other students to narc. He's been replaced for the rest of the semester by Professor Splash. I take a class from that guy. You're a professor.

Obviously, obviously somebody cancelled. Yes. We tried everybody including the janitor with the lazy eye. But -- and I'm very excited. We got a first time guest Dr. Carl Hart. Carl is a professor of psychology at Columbia. Relax, Kat. He doesn't do outpatients. But Dr. Hart, where's that book? Dr. Hart wrote one of the bravest books you're going to find. Drug use for grownups. Oh, there it is. That was my major at Berkeley. I still can't believe you didn't ask me to write the foreword. So the book is about legalizing drugs. It might piss some of you off, but that's what the drugs are for. But the book isn't just about legalizing the easy ones like pot or mushrooms or the window cleaner that Kat mixes with Gatorade. But heroin. Now this is when people say no, no, no, not heroin. Look what that drug does. The lost souls on the streets haunting city corners like ghostly zombies living for a fix. That's true. We indeed have problems. But here's the deal. That's happening while the drugs are illegal, yet they're easier to get than COVID. Even my cats -- even my cat is dealing drugs."

We find other country's militaries to fight the drug trade, then let anyone walk across the border with a bindle up their butt. It's more counterproductive than a broom that shoots glitter. In 2019, over 70,000 people died from overdoses in the U.S. That's 70,000 more people than have read Kilmeade's new book. Make a joke about drug death. But during the pandemic, that number exploded, probably because we were all trapped inside watching CNN. But what is causing this wave of death? Don't blame prescription opioids because as we cut down on that, the death rates skyrocket. No, today overdoses are driven by fentanyl. And like the coronavirus and cheap patio furniture. It's made in China. It comes through our southern border and it's mixed into other street drugs to kick it up a notch. It's basically hamburger helper for junkies. Tell us, Lara Logan,"

And when China got all that capability, that's how they found the analogues for fentanyl, which they then introduced as a street drug made a deal with the Mexican cartels. And now they've got, what? How many Americans are dying every year and we hear nothing about it. I mean, go to San Francisco, nobody cares that you got people standing on the street, pissing on themselves and, you know, and defecating everywhere you know, and unable to function. And what do they say? Well, let's reduce the mandatory minimum sentencing for fentanyl. That's what the Biden ministration Justice Department is working on right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "So during 12 months of the pandemic, nearly 100,000 Americans have died from O.D.s. That's a 30 percent jump. Experts blame it on this stay- at-home orders. I don't buy it because when it comes to this stuff the government is like our presidents underpants. Full of crap. I feel bad just saying that. But especially when it comes to health, it's true. Remember the nutrition pyramid. It was everywhere? Classrooms, waiting rooms, that shed where I keep the au pair. But also cereal boxes. Yes, imagine that. A box of carbs says you should stuff your face with carbs. Sadly, my chart had a typo. And I was eating 30 pounds of crabs a month. But it's cereal company telling you to eat more carbs. It's like the diamond industry telling you how many months salary you should spend on an engagement ring. We thought we were following the science but we should have been following the money. Cookie Crisp had parents thinking kids started their day right by eating a bowl of cookies. It's amazing. It's like those stories about fake doctors tricking women into physical checkups. That's what this is. And yes, I stopped doing it years ago. They repossess my van. But this chart was dead wrong and deadly. You had processed carbs in huge quantities turning healthy kids into mini Brian Stelter. Right now our adult obesity rate is 42 percent up from 34 percent just 10 years earlier. The only thing rising faster is our blood sugar. So what's that got to do with drugs? Well, the same people who lied about food are lying about drugs. Right now, when the government or media reports O.D.s, just like the crime stats, they never get specific. They never tell the whole truth. It's about illegal fentanyl, not prescription drugs. And it's not overdoses, it's poisonings. People buy drugs with fentanyl in it and they die. People -- including people that you know, from Tom Petty to Michael K. Williams, to athletes and actors, but the people you heard of dying of opioid overdoses, it's actually fentanyl poisoning, not prescriptions, but a poisons used to kill people deliberately. It's the biggest story you aren't hearing because all you hear is the word overdoses. And the worst part of this, patients who rely on legal opioids for cancer pain, and other diseases can't get them because we -- we've conflated safe drugs with fentanyl, but that's pretending two totally different things are the same, like CNN and news. Wrong way for a joke. When it's really actually terrorism, and it drives legal users to illegal stuff and they die because they can't control the dosage. Or like hot dogs they just don't know what's in it. Imagine you could only buy cigarettes illegally. But one cigarette had a thousand times the nicotine, you would die, or at least sound like Kat. But instead you can go to any market and buy a carton. In San Francisco they even let you take it, but the dosage is controlled. Meanwhile, stats show addiction is actually rare among prescription opioids and overdoses are nearly impossible to find. I bet you didn't know that. Because we're operating on the lie of all drugs bad and punish the law abiding. Here's an analogy you'll understand. What's the biggest complaint by gun owners? No, it's not that the gun jams when watching The View. It's that the laws -- it's that the laws punish the law abiding while doing nothing about illegal guns fueling street violence. It's the same argument here. We punish the law abiding and let the lawless killed. We'll even provide clean needles, so it's the spiked drugs they die from. But sadly, we target the decent person who administers drugs safely in a safe environment like a doctor's office or Kat's apartment. But it's time we stop this death. It's also time to let people seek the relief they choose. And if they don't hurt anyone, and it's nobody's business. Everyone on this planet has a right to relief, whether it's a martini, a joint or an opiod, because frankly I'm tired of buying clean urine from Steve Doocy. But if you need any D.M. me."

But there are easy fixes to this. Just like they do in Europe, we can have these things called drug checking. Drug checking facility allows people to submit small samples of their drugs. And then they get a chemical printout and then a fentanyl is in it, then we -- everyone knows that fentanyl is in it, and you don't take it or you scale back how much you take.

We're joined now by Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram who has closely been following all the action on Capitol Hill. Chad, around 10:00 it got a little bizarre because they took a recess for 15 minutes. And then they came back for a couple of seconds. And now they're back in and they are voting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "That's right. You know, this infrastructure vote has been a long time in coming. There's a long time running joke in Washington that it's infrastructure week and it never was. This is in fact, infrastructure week because the House of Representatives is in fact voting on this bill right now. The Senate approved this bipartisan plan back in August. Here was the holdup. You had these liberal Democrats, the progressives who were not willing to provide their votes for the infrastructure plan until they got things kind of etched in stone on the social spending plan. The $1.75 trillion plan which just a couple of weeks ago was $3.5 trillion and even higher than that. What has happened in the past hour, and you refer to these two recesses and why they're here working late on a Friday night, they're trying to get this across the finish line. What has happened is that there was an agreement between the moderate Democrats and the Liberal Democrats. The moderate Democrats secured a deal that they would get a start on the social spending plan no later than the week of November 15th. And tonight, the progressive Democrats would provide their votes for the infrastructure bill, and also for a procedural vote to tee up that social spending bill perhaps later this month. So the reason they have to do this is that Democrats only have a three vote radius in the House of Representatives. So if you lose, you know, less than a handful of votes, they cannot pass a bill on their own. Now on the infrastructure bill, keep in mind that there is a coalition of anywhere from about nine to 15 Republicans who are willing to vote yes. And I'm looking at the scoreboard right now. There are five Democratic nos on the board. But there are 10 Republican yeas and I should also say that even though this vote is not closed, yet nothing is final until they actually gavel it down in the chair, announces the total. They have 219 yeas on the scoreboard right now. The House of Representatives right now has 434 members. So the magic number is 218. There one above that. So this bill has basically passed and the House and Senate are in alignment. This could conceivably go to the president immediately and he could sign it into law. That's the first part of President Biden's domestic policy agenda here. The problem that you had is that you had this disagreement between progressives and moderates, and they just did not have the votes. If they had the votes earlier in the day, Ashley, they probably would have voted. How Speaker Nancy Pelosi does not go to the floor and lose. That's what she always says she held off all day long. And guess what they have the votes to pass this bill tonight, Ashley?"

But keep in mind that this is a plan that was supported by Mitch McConnell, the Minority Leader in the Senate. But there are some provisions in this -- in this particular piece of legislation which Republicans definitely do not like and that's why the super majority of Republicans are voting no on this bill this evening."

Professor Bruce Monger, what a great name, Monger, e-mailed his class to narc on two maskless students so he could fail them. This would seem like the perfect time to avoid detection though by wearing masks. Last week fearmonger, see what I did there? E-mailed his introductory oceanography class describing the pair in detail. \"One student is a male with red hair and a fairly prominent hooked nose. His hair was pretty long, thick and wavy. The other student is a male sitting to the left he has short brown hair, maybe 1-1/2 to two inches in length and a small nose.\" This guy is really obsessed with noses. We just have names for that. For the record, Monger can be described as a puffy hair ginger with teeth like Gary Busey. He then concluded if when I find the identity of these two students, I will be failing them both for this semester. So yet again, another introductory oceanography professor that let the power -- let the power go to his head. That happens all the time. But after this e-mail went viral the school stood by the jackass but admitted his e-mail was inappropriate, saying Monger, \"Regularly advise to students of the mask requirements. He described the student's physical characteristics in ways that do not reflect Cornell values.\" He has since acknowledged that his approach was not handled in an appropriate manner. Yes, it's the describing people that's the only problem, not the notion that the vaccinated unmasked are putting the vaccinated mask at risk or that he enlisted other students to narc. He's been replaced for the rest of the semester by Professor Splash. I take a class from that guy. You're a professor.

Exercise helped produce (INAUDIBLE) bide which chemists say is responsible for those good feelings that exercise produces.

But no one said anything about the fact that, he this guy almost caused him to kill himself or hurt himself, and he inhibited and he didn't go hit the guy.
