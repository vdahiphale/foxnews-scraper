Mollie, your take today? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": The whole premise of today was that the movie would be better than the book, that the Mueller report didn't do what they wanted it to accomplish in book form, so if they had visuals that it would help people understand the case against the president. What I don't think anybody expected was that Mueller would present himself as doddering, as lacking command of anything to do with the investigation, and thereby raising a whole host of questions about who actually was in charge of this Mueller investigation. A lot of people just gave it leeway because they respected him, and seeing today, I don't think anyone thinks that he was in charge. It had been previously reported that 13 of his 17 associates were Democrats, zero were Republicans, nine were Democratic donors, six were Hillary Clinton donors, some were pretty close allies of the Clintons. One attended a Hillary Clinton election rally. So I think you're going to start seeing many more questions about precisely who was running this investigation and to what end. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But you listen to the Democrats tonight, and there is like a dejected feeling, that they had expectations for today. AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": This is absolutely not the day that Democrats had wanted to be. I agree with the movie. If there's a Rotten Tomatoes rating, I don't know what the good or the bad is, like you're supposed to have more rotten tomatoes or fewers, it was a bad version of that movie. I do think if you're thinking about -- maybe one of the winners in this on the Democratic side is somebody like Speaker Nancy Pelosi and some of the moderates in the House who had been pushing back against a rush to impeachment. They really don't want to see this. They'd rather see the House and their colleagues focused on some of these issues like health care, as they did in the 2018 election. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so what I'm looking for is whether this actually tamps down, put the brakes on. I don't think it's going to change anybody's mind who does believe the president needs to be impeached.

      "speaker": "BRET BAIER, HOST",
      "utterance": "The president taking a victory lap of sorts today after two massive hearings with the former Special Counsel Bob Mueller. A lot of Democrats weighed in on Twitter and elsewhere. One of them the former senior advisor to President Obama, David Axelrod, who tweeted at one point today during the hearings, \"This is very, very painful.\" Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen. Mollie, your take today? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": The whole premise of today was that the movie would be better than the book, that the Mueller report didn't do what they wanted it to accomplish in book form, so if they had visuals that it would help people understand the case against the president. What I don't think anybody expected was that Mueller would present himself as doddering, as lacking command of anything to do with the investigation, and thereby raising a whole host of questions about who actually was in charge of this Mueller investigation. A lot of people just gave it leeway because they respected him, and seeing today, I don't think anyone thinks that he was in charge. It had been previously reported that 13 of his 17 associates were Democrats, zero were Republicans, nine were Democratic donors, six were Hillary Clinton donors, some were pretty close allies of the Clintons. One attended a Hillary Clinton election rally. So I think you're going to start seeing many more questions about precisely who was running this investigation and to what end."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Amy, the question now is what goes forward, and we are going to deal with that in the second panel. But you listen to the Democrats tonight, and there is like a dejected feeling, that they had expectations for today. AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": This is absolutely not the day that Democrats had wanted to be. I agree with the movie. If there's a Rotten Tomatoes rating, I don't know what the good or the bad is, like you're supposed to have more rotten tomatoes or fewers, it was a bad version of that movie. I do think if you're thinking about -- maybe one of the winners in this on the Democratic side is somebody like Speaker Nancy Pelosi and some of the moderates in the House who had been pushing back against a rush to impeachment. They really don't want to see this. They'd rather see the House and their colleagues focused on some of these issues like health care, as they did in the 2018 election. And so what I'm looking for is whether this actually tamps down, put the brakes on. I don't think it's going to change anybody's mind who does believe the president needs to be impeached. They are not going to walk away and say because of the speech and hearing I am no longer in favor of this. But I do think you are no longer going to see the number of Democrats saying I favor impeachment to continue to rise."

      "speaker": "REP. TED LIEU, D-CALIF.",

      "speaker": "ROBERT MUELLER, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SPECIAL COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "That is correct. I want to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr. Lieu, who said, and I quote, \"You didn't charge the president because of the OLC opinion.\" That is not the correct way to say it. As we say in the report and as I said at the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "So there was this thought that it was the aha moment, and then the beginning of the next hearing he walked it back. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": It got everybody excited for about an hour, and then it went away, which actually points to a bigger feature of today's hearings, which is apart from the concerns about Mueller's performance, it didn't have any news in it. When Mueller said that he would have indicted were it not for the OLC ruling, that was a big deal. Then he walked it back. The thing that Democrats seem to feel is a great accomplishment was Mueller said he did not exonerate the president. We have known that since that day in March when Bill Barr, the attorney general, wrote a letter summarizing the major findings of Mueller's report. He included it there, and we've known it ever since."

      "speaker": "MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE",
      "utterance": "I agree with Byron. And look, I don't think any of us knew that Bob Mueller was so fragile, and that was a surprise. But other than that, this was a slow-motion train wreck. Anyone could have seen from the day the Mueller report came out, it was clear -- for most Americans this was about a conspiracy with Russia to undermine our democracy. And once that was established by the Mueller report that that did not happen, then the Democrats should have just said, OK, case closed, let's move on. And there was a poll in May when this came out, Harvard/Harris poll, 80 percent of Americans say they want their congressional representatives working more on infrastructure, healthcare, immigration than investigations of Donald Trump. They decided not to do that and to focus on this, and it's completely overshadowed their agenda. \"Washington Post\" reported that the DCCC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did focus groups which showed that Americans believe they are preoccupied with investigations and it's completely overshadowing their agenda. That's why Pelosi was the winner today, I agree with Amy, because she's been trying to push them off of this and get attention on the agenda she won on so she can keep the House, and this is taking the wind out of the sails."

And I think it's still the case that moving the ball on how people feel about Mueller, the investigation, whether they think impeachment is the right thing or the wrong thing to do wasn't going to be changed. The only question was whether there was going to be some more pressure from activists and from their own members to push this forward. So in some ways like this needed to happen, and now the band-aid has been sort of pulled off, and theoretically Democrats go on and do other things. But realistically, it still going to be part of the --"

But also I think the facts don't seem to change things, that the big problem Donald Trump did was win the election, and know there was no collusion, obstruction, the idea that being angry about being falsely accused of being a traitor is impeachable, I think that wouldn't sell either. But I think they'll just keep going in some attempt to get something done. The big change I think is that there were Republicans who really did trust the Mueller investigation on the grounds that Robert Mueller was running it alone. He was the only Republican affiliated with it, and he apparently had no idea what was going on. So I think you're going to see some people -- you're going to see an increase in the ranks of people who think that maybe the investigation was not handled properly and that there were deep problems with it."

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Republicans got no answers for their questions. They had questions about the dossier. They had questions about the mysterious circumstances with Joseph Mifsud and George Papadopoulos and starting investigation. They got nothing from Robert Mueller, who said that he wasn't going to talk about it because it's the subject of another investigation. By the way, his investigation went on for almost a couple of years before some of these were started. But on the bigger issue, there is really always been two parts to the Trump-Russia investigation. There has been the what Russia did part, and then there's the get Trump part. And if Democrats had focused on the what Russia did part, there could have been a lot of bipartisan agreement. Mueller thought it was very serious, Republicans thought it was serious, Democrats thought it was serious, and they could've talked about what to do. But the get Trump part stumbled them. And ask any of them if they are now in favor of impeachment, and they weren't before."
