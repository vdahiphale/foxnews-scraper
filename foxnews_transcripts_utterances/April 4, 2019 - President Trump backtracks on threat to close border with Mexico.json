We spoke -- we reported this morning that people around him thought he was more likely than not to edge off closing the ports. And the primary argument that people close to him told us, what he was receptive to is the effect it would have on economic growth. And we were seeing numbers in terms of the amount of commerce that's passing through some of these busy ports on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump doesn't want to do anything in the year and a half now before his re- election that's going to hammer the stock markets or have a dampening effect on economic growth. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So I think you are seeing him recalibrate and, I mean the car tariff issue is very, very complicated because you have a deal that he struck that hasn't been approved by Congress with Canada and Mexico, a new NAFTA which wouldn't allow them to do this. And then you also have the separate issue of Trump asking the Commerce Department to provide a national security rationale for car tariffs which there is going to be a legal challenge there. So, the bottom line is it's very, very complicated but this is Trump pivoting off the very hard line position that he outlined last week. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",
