Utility crews came in from all over the country, from Michigan, from Florida, to get the lights back on, and at this hour, there are still more than 50,000 people without power according to the Massachusetts Emergency Management map app that they have. When you talk about the course of the storm, a lot of coastal flooding. Lots of problems to the south city of Boston, from Plymouth, lots of flooding out Nantucket, and at this hour the flights are finally beginning to get off the ground. But Boston Logan Airport still seeing a lot of cancellations and delays, and just to the south of us in LaGuardia, 45 percent or so delays and cancellations. So, today a beautiful sunny day to get things up, back in the air, and off of the ground and getting cleanup going, likely the kids will be back in school on Monday -- Dana.",

But we will give you a live look around Central Park. You can see there's really not too many issues out here right now. The light fluffy mix, though, is creating picturesque views here but Long Island was hit with about 2 feet of snow, while the storm moved out overnight, it left behind a large cleanup task. So it's not beautiful everywhere around New York. The roads are still pretty messy. The Department of Sanitation has crews on 12-hour shifts, working to clear the snow and ice for the roads, preparing for Monday's commute.

I mean, literally in his first week in office last year, he gave Vladimir Putin his number one foreign policy priority, an extension of a badly one-sided arms-control treaty. And then he gave his number two foreign policy priority right away by waiving sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that is being built between Russia and Germany. Along the way, he's also let out a Russian cyber criminal before his prison sentence was up. Just a couple days ago at a press conference, he declared that a minor incursion in Ukraine might not elicit a strong Western response, and there are reports this morning even that the administration has already taken the toughest sanctions off the table, sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industry, and removing it from the international banking system. So, again, if Vladimir Putin has seen what Joe Biden has done over the last year and then he saw his fecklessness in Afghanistan, and I'm afraid that he thinks now is the time to go for the jugular in Ukraine, which he has wanted to do for as long as he's been in power.",

You can want to secure our southern border effectively and change our laws that so many of these illegal immigrants are taking advantage of, while at the same time recognize that if Russia invades Ukraine, it won't just be bad for Ukraine and for Eastern Europe, but it will be a signal to bad guys around the world that they can push even harder to harm American interests.

And, of course, the Democrats in the media condemned that. But it's now become increasingly obvious in last year that the lab is almost certainly the origin of this coronavirus. Unfortunately, it looks like some parts of our government helped fund the research there. And bureaucrats like Tony Fauci and Francis Collins even try to cover up these inquiries two years ago. They encouraged the kind of left-wing scaremongering campaign about me and anyone else who pointed to the lab as a possibility. The world needs to know the origin of this virus and China needs to be held accountable for it, especially as we go into these Olympics that never should have been given to China, that should have been pulled from China a year ago and should have been rebuilt elsewhere.

I hope he speaks for all of his colleagues, and that they will vet whomever the president puts forward in a serious and robust way. That person deserves to be vetted that way because it's a lifetime appointment. I look forward to seeing who the president appoints and I'm sure it will be a person who's competent, has great legal judgment, and has the experience to serve on the court for a long period of time. Doug, you have 20 seconds in you on the Supreme Court?",

Boston also seeing the biggest single day snow record, 23.6 inches. Now, throughout the course of the storm, some hundred thousand people were without power. Very gusty storm, a lot of high winds. Utility crews came in from all over the country, from Michigan, from Florida, to get the lights back on, and at this hour, there are still more than 50,000 people without power according to the Massachusetts Emergency Management map app that they have. When you talk about the course of the storm, a lot of coastal flooding. Lots of problems to the south city of Boston, from Plymouth, lots of flooding out Nantucket, and at this hour the flights are finally beginning to get off the ground. But Boston Logan Airport still seeing a lot of cancellations and delays, and just to the south of us in LaGuardia, 45 percent or so delays and cancellations. So, today a beautiful sunny day to get things up, back in the air, and off of the ground and getting cleanup going, likely the kids will be back in school on Monday -- Dana."

Well, it's beautiful here in Central Park, a very picturesque scene, lots of people out enjoying the winter elements here in Central Park, according to the weather service, rather, take a look, they had about 8 inches of snow here that fell and it's that light fluffy stuff so that's what caused a lot of the visibility issues. But we will give you a live look around Central Park. You can see there's really not too many issues out here right now. The light fluffy mix, though, is creating picturesque views here but Long Island was hit with about 2 feet of snow, while the storm moved out overnight, it left behind a large cleanup task. So it's not beautiful everywhere around New York. The roads are still pretty messy. The Department of Sanitation has crews on 12-hour shifts, working to clear the snow and ice for the roads, preparing for Monday's commute. Today, less flight cancellations, both are operating, LaGuardia and JFK, at about 50 percent. But still a lot of work needs to be done, Dana."

We're making sure we're sharing information and context as best we can. I can't speak for what President Zelensky is saying or what he is seeing and certainly what he is saying about what he's seen, but we've been nothing but clear and transparent about our concerns here at the Pentagon over this rapid buildup over the last few months around the border with Ukraine and in Belarus, not to mention, you know, maritime activity by the Russians in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. So, what we said, Dana, is that he has a lot of options, he Putin has a lot of options available to him if he wants to further invade Ukraine and he can execute some of those options imminently."

Again, as Secretary Austin said on Friday, he has a lot of options, a lot of capability available to him. He could do something on a small scale, he could do something on a fairly large scale, and he continues to add troops to that border with Ukraine. We are watching that even over the course of this weekend, so he increases his ability to choose options and to do something if he wants to act militarily. The other thing that we said though, Dana, is it doesn't have to come to conflict. We still believe there's room and space for diplomacy, and we'd like to see that be the solution here."

And one of the things about sanctions is once you trip that, then the deterrent effect is lost. So I think we've been very, very clear that we are going to look at sanctions and economic consequences, the likes of which we have not looked at before, or even considered even as far back as 2014. We don't want to lose that deterrent effect. The other thing is, you know, the Russians talk about it. One of the last things they want is a strong and bolstered NATO on their western flank. But if he does another invasion inside Ukraine, that's exactly what they're going to get. They're going to -- you're going to see the United States and our NATO allies bolster our capabilities on the Eastern flank of the alliance."

Germany certainly giving everyone a little bit of headaches and heartburn given that it's got such a reliance on Russian in terms of its energy. You had France wanting to go its own way. Turkey is a very strange ally at this point in NATO's history. Given all of this and going forward, do you believe that NATO can survive, and should it survive?"

The secretary spoke with his French and German counterparts just on Friday morning before he went out to the press room here, and they were very good conversations. The French and the Germans are the same level of concern out of them about what they're seeing from Russia doing (ph) as we have. Now, each country in the alliance has to act within their own dictates. Of course, they're sovereign states, but both of them are deeply concerned about what we see Russia doing and both of them are incredibly strong NATO allies. Germany hosts thousands of U.S. troops on their soil. We couldn't have fought the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without their support.

Listen to \"The Wall Street Journal\", this is editorial from this week. The self-created energy vulnerability of the West is one of the horrifying marvels of the age. You have to go back to the disarmament of the 1920s to recall a time such willful self-delusion. Even as President Biden races to rescue Europe, his build back better plan would send the U.S. down the same road of energy disarmament. John, does the Pentagon factor in the United States' own energy partner when it considers what all needs to be done to protect us in the future?"

We've been very consistent about our one China policy. And I think they see the way we have marshaled allies and partners throughout the Indo Pacific region. Five of our seven treaty alliances are in the Pacific, and they know that. And we're working on those alliances and partnerships, and I think some of what you're seeing out of their activity is a recognition on their part that we and our partners and our allies are actually only getting stronger, only getting more resolved to see a free and open Indo Pacific."

We are in close coordination and consultation with our allies and partners. That just -- that's not just South Korea, but Japan as well, about the threats that the burgeoning ballistic missile program by Kim Jong Un continues to present. And we noticed this launch over the weekend. We have condemned that. It is a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and we're going to be discussing that with, again, allies and partners on the world. I mean, but the other thing is here, we've got to make sure that that alliance on the Korean peninsula is strong. We remain committed to a denuclearized Korean peninsula. We remain committed to diplomatic talks. We told Pyongyang, we're willing to sit down without precondition to have those kinds of dialogues, but obviously, Kim Jong Un wants to go a different way.

I think it's important -- and we said this routinely -- that all neighboring nations, particularly in that region, should have a stake in a more stable Syria, we don't want to see refugee flows, we certainly don't want to see the conflict expand.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR)",
      "utterance": "Well, Dana, it's not so much the Pentagon's position now, as it has been Joe Biden's weakness and his appeasement of Vladimir Putin for the last year. I mean, literally in his first week in office last year, he gave Vladimir Putin his number one foreign policy priority, an extension of a badly one-sided arms-control treaty. And then he gave his number two foreign policy priority right away by waiving sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that is being built between Russia and Germany. Along the way, he's also let out a Russian cyber criminal before his prison sentence was up. Just a couple days ago at a press conference, he declared that a minor incursion in Ukraine might not elicit a strong Western response, and there are reports this morning even that the administration has already taken the toughest sanctions off the table, sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industry, and removing it from the international banking system. So, again, if Vladimir Putin has seen what Joe Biden has done over the last year and then he saw his fecklessness in Afghanistan, and I'm afraid that he thinks now is the time to go for the jugular in Ukraine, which he has wanted to do for as long as he's been in power."

That's like adding the entire population of Nebraska to this country. But you're right, Dana, you can be concerned about both. You can want to secure our southern border effectively and change our laws that so many of these illegal immigrants are taking advantage of, while at the same time recognize that if Russia invades Ukraine, it won't just be bad for Ukraine and for Eastern Europe, but it will be a signal to bad guys around the world that they can push even harder to harm American interests. Imagine what it will say to Xi Jinping if he sees Russia invade Ukraine and just get a few mealy-mouthed sanctions slapped on it. As you mentioned in the first segment of your interview today, that China just sent dozens of airplanes into Taiwanese airspace last week, the biggest incursion in months. I think it's not a coincidence that that's happening right now as the West seems divided under Joe Biden's leadership in Europe."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not ridiculous, and it is happening, I can tell you, Dana. First, we have had a whistle-blower for many months, we've gotten hundreds and hundreds of calls about the kind of egregiously inappropriate training sessions that commands have had around the world. And second, while the diversity of America may be reflected in our military and strength, something I saw in my years in the army, it's not something that our military needs to constantly obsess about. Troops fight for the flag on the shoulder, and they fight for the man and a woman to their left and right. If you undermine their belief that that flag stands for a good and moral country, if you undermine their belief that the man and a woman to their right is fighting for them, irrespective of their skin color, are they going to be as motivated to fight as they otherwise might be? Are they going to enlist? The Army just missed its enlistment targets for the year, Dana. And also, do you think those Chinese pilots that are flying into Taiwanese airspace are getting hammered for hours and hours of training about structural racism or diversity? Do think those Russian troops on Ukraine's border are going to have to stop and take lectures on climate change? Something tells me not. We need our military to be focused 100 percent on protecting America."

We're in year three of the pandemic and way back when it was first becoming publicized that it was happening, you took a lot of flak from some quarters in which you suggested it might've been a Wuhan lab leak. Even \"The Washington Post\" corrected that. I'm sure you were gratified by that. But I want to ask you -- does it matter kind of now more than ever that we get to the bottom of how this happened, even while China is about to have this great propaganda opportunity to show the world that they can host an Olympics even though they unleash this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "It very much does, Dana. A couple years ago now that I first said that maybe the virus came from that lab. I didn't even assert it as fact, I just said it's a question we should ask, whether it came from this food market that didn't even have bats present, or maybe it came from the lab a few blocks down the street where they research novel coronaviruses that originated in bats under the leadership of a scientist whose nickname was literally \"The Bat Lady\". And, of course, the Democrats in the media condemned that. But it's now become increasingly obvious in last year that the lab is almost certainly the origin of this coronavirus. Unfortunately, it looks like some parts of our government helped fund the research there. And bureaucrats like Tony Fauci and Francis Collins even try to cover up these inquiries two years ago. They encouraged the kind of left-wing scaremongering campaign about me and anyone else who pointed to the lab as a possibility. The world needs to know the origin of this virus and China needs to be held accountable for it, especially as we go into these Olympics that never should have been given to China, that should have been pulled from China a year ago and should have been rebuilt elsewhere. We can't let China have a big propaganda victory without any inquiry into their role in spreading this plague around the world."

You've probably seen the video of illegal immigrants being transited to a bus station at Brownsville, to what a DHS official called was their final destination. Well, Dana, any illegal immigrant's final destination should be back in their home country. We've even seen reports, Dana, of DHS coaching illegal immigrants on how to use their arrest warrants to board an airplane when they get to a TSA checkpoint. Just think about how crazy that is.

I can't say that I've got wild expectations that Joe Biden is going to nominate someone who I think I can support or many Republicans can support because I've seen dozens of his nominees to the lower courts, and they've almost to a person been left-wing ideologues who think judges should make the law rather than apply and uphold the Constitution and the laws as they are passed. I can say one thing that I won't do, and I doubt any Republican will do, is engaged in the kind of grotesque smear campaign against the character of fine men like Clarence Thomas or as we saw what happened with Brett Kavanaugh two years ago. We'll give a thorough vetting into any nominees' legal philosophies, as well as their career and their character and their temperament, but we're not going to do what Democrats do, which is simply make up smears against a nominee. And I -- I hope that that never happens again."

Former RNC Communications Director Doug Heye, Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich, and my co-host on \"THE FIVE,\" former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford Junior. Great to have all of you here. Jacqui, I want to go to you first. The administration has made some pretty serious warnings in Ukraine, but the president of Ukraine has pushed back on that. Here's something that Zelensky told reporters on Friday. Quote, I don't consider the situation now more tense than before. There is a feeling abroad that war is here. That's not the case. Jacqui, the White House has again pushed back on that. What is the challenge here for Biden to speak -- help NATO speak with one voice?"

But I think the president and the White House, they're up against this acknowledgment that this is going to happen if they risk downplaying it, that it's going to be a really terrible thing for them. And, also, they've got Americans in Ukraine who they've got to be concerned about. So they've got to really deliver honest messaging about the severity of this situation and they've also got to have a unified voice with NATO. And I think that's something that Putin is really trying to divide right now. He's trying to sort of capitalize on the fractures within NATO, disagreements among allies about what the sanctions package might look like, Nord Stream 2, those kind of things. And so the White House has to be very consistent with its messaging and make sure that it doesn't open itself up to some sort of vulnerability that Putin could then use to play into his hand buried"

It is certainly playing into his hands and he thinks into a positive way. But I would counter a little bit what your previous guests said. I thought that Senator Cotton laid out some of the -- some of elements, but really didn't offer a counter. I thought what Mr. Kirby said at the outset, which is diplomacy remains foremost on our minds, it appears that many of our allies in NATO are prepared to implement strong sanctions as well. I know you asked, Dana, if he would enumerate some of those sanctions. He refused to do so, which I thought was smart to do. I thought the piece yesterday and \"The Wall Street Journal\" by Peggy Noonan, where she said that, you know, we're used to being lucky as a nation, but luck is not a -- luck is not something you should get used to in these kinds of situations. This is a test for us and I think most important for me and foremost on my mind is the question you asked Mr. Kirby at the end. China is watching. And what do they take from this? So, we have to be prepared. We have to fortify the alliance, ensure that our allies understand what we're doing and try to speak in one voice and in concert in whatever action or actions we have to take."

These were union jobs that were going to help American energy independence. Europe has these same problems. And as the Biden administration continues to talk about America is back and trying to shore our allies, this should be an opportunity for Biden to show strength and to show real leadership in moving NATO forward and unifying NATO. Russia, right now, is looking and probing for any sign of weakness that they can. And as Congressman Ford mentioned, it's not just Russia that's looking at this, it's China as well."

It comes at a moment when the president has been struggling to get out from under these terrible poll numbers when it comes to inflation, foreign policy, Covid, all these things that have been dogging the administration. We know from our reporting that Justice Breyer did not feel forced out, that this was a decision that he made, but it certainly benefits this president. Although, you know, he just did say at the year-end press conference that he had done a pretty poor job of reaching out to black voters. This gives him a moment to show that he's going to make good on his campaign promise. And you see Jim Clyburn, congressman who really is credited with rescuing his flailing campaign, make a strong push for Michelle Childs. The White House has not said -- or given any indication of who is on the short-list.

Presidents Reagan, Obama, Clinton, and even President Trump, and now President Biden are going to give us more women on the court. I'm a little concerned when I hear people conflating political philosophy and political ideas and their own personal aspirations in politics with what they think the nominee might be. I was most encouraged hearing Senator Cotton say he would have an open mind on the committee. I hope he speaks for all of his colleagues, and that they will vet whomever the president puts forward in a serious and robust way. That person deserves to be vetted that way because it's a lifetime appointment. I look forward to seeing who the president appoints and I'm sure it will be a person who's competent, has great legal judgment, and has the experience to serve on the court for a long period of time.

I also hope that D.A.'s across the country listen. We have to take violent offenders off the streets. I think some of the bail laws, or at least the motivation for the bail laws nationally were to ensure that non-violent offenders didn't sit in jail for long periods of time than if they were convicted, not to release violent offenders. Second, anyone that shoots a cop, that shoots a police officer, there should be no bail for and there should be a mandatory minimum. And I would even go further, but that's not for -- that's not a topic of the show. We should have and make clear to people that's not going to be tolerated. Second, you got to put more police officers on the street. And here in New York you have to flood our subways with cops because if you don't have a transportation mode for people in the city to go to school, to go to work, to go wherever they choose, New York won't be the city that it's been."

I wonder if the White House is paying attention. Let's look at it. In 2021, 73 law enforcement officers were intentionally killed in the line of duty, the most since 9/11. This week, six officers were victims of gun violence in a period of less than 48 hours. And 2021 saw record homicide rates in nine cities.

They often talk of at the initiatives from their Department of Justice to crack down on things like ghost guns. But the crime that's happening in cities, that is an issue that people vote on. And, you know, you're going to need to see the White House take a more serious look at that going into the midterms if they have -- want to have any impact on the midterm races because this is something that is going to come back to haunt them if they end up taking two soft of an approach. Have pulled back from weighing in on the policies of these prosecutors who have been coming under fire for being too soft on crime. And the president's going to be going to New York on Thursday to talk about crime. But they haven't been facing questions on it as much as other issues, and I expect that they will more and more as we get closer to the midterms."

And as we have these philosophical conversations about Build Back Better and what the size and scope of government should be, people want their government to do the things well and competently that it should. And when you're told that your municipality government can't keep the lights on -- and this is happening brought the country -- it's a failure.

And, the winter Olympics begin Friday in Beijing without dignitaries from the United States, which is protesting China's detention of more than a million Uighur Muslims.

I think the best way to combat the propaganda that might come during the Olympics is just for U.S. athletes to do what they do best, which is to win metals. The IOC -- we should weigh in with the IOC going forward. It seems odd that we'd be having this debate or conversation just a week before the Olympics.

And we also know that Putin -- Taiwan is, you know, sort of what Xi is looking at. Everyone's keeping an eye on Putin to see what we do in response to that because we recognize that Taiwan is part of one China and if the U.S. doesn't do anything and NATO doesn't do anything to stop Putin from taking over a sovereign country, then that's giving a green light to Taiwan. So this is all very interconnected.
