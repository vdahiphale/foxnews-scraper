      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Emily Compagno, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, this is “The Five.” Fox News alert, actress Felicity Huffman headed to prison, a judge sentencing her to 14 days behind bars, a $30,000 fine, and one year probation. Huffman is the first parent to face punishment in the bombshell college admission scandal. The Hollywood star admitted to paying $15,000 to rig her daughter's SAT's score. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Huffman crying in court, showing remorse and admitting she broke the law, but the judge siding with the prosecutors who pushed for prison time instead of just probation. The news not just impacting Huffman, you should know that others involved in the cheating scheme including Lori Loughlin who pleaded not guilty are still awaiting their fate. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Dana, let me go to you. This is very interesting in that, you know, the prosecutors had asked for a year -- one month to 15 months. She ends up now with 14 day sentence, is that fair? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, what her lawyers were saying that she should probably be allowed just to have probation, and to stay at home, and maybe do 250 hours of community service. However, because, remember, if this is a financial situation where she has a lot of money. So, having her pay a big fine is not really a punishment because they have plenty of money. That could -- $30,000 fine for somebody else would be really out of reach. I do think that prosecutors are saying we've got to send a message. She's not going to be able to stay at home in her Hollywood Hills luxury with an infinity pool. They actually used those words. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so, I think that this is a sign that the other parents that are awaiting their sentencing, because many of them pled guilty, they're probably going to face the same thing. I do wonder what Lori Loughlin is thinking though, because if she -- this goes to trial, if she wins, she wins, and then maybe all of this stuff is for not. But if she loses, she's probably looking at a lot more time than -- I'm looking at Emily, because I don't really know. But I'm assuming she would be looking at a lot more time than 14 days.",

You and I talk about earlier, too, the fact that I was worried, frankly, as a citizen that she would get zero prison time because, for me -- first of all, the government punishes inchoate crimes, right? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There's a reason why conspiracies are illegal. It's not just about whether you actually went through with it, or whether the crime was actually able to be committed and there was some type of, quote, victim that people have been arguing. Here, even the probation office said, well, it's an economic offense. It was actually a lot more than that and it was straight up fraud. And so, I have seen for a tax evasion case for a few thousand dollars probation office deny and refuse to endorse someone requesting home confinement with a disabled dependent. And here she was arguing for one with her infinity pool. As the prosecutor said, she was morally clueless and it was out of a sense of entitlement only. So I'm 100 percent am grateful that she, at least, got some jail time.",

But when we know the myriad reasons it wouldn't work, especially because it would end in violence and because it wouldn't work in terms of sheer numbers and because of the serial component of all of these guns and all the registration needed and et cetera, et cetera. Everything would fall through the cracks. So, to me I see it as perhaps coming from a place of authenticity, but absolutely ineffective. And it will never fly.",

      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST",
      "utterance": "Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Emily Compagno, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, this is “The Five.” Fox News alert, actress Felicity Huffman headed to prison, a judge sentencing her to 14 days behind bars, a $30,000 fine, and one year probation. Huffman is the first parent to face punishment in the bombshell college admission scandal. The Hollywood star admitted to paying $15,000 to rig her daughter's SAT's score. Huffman crying in court, showing remorse and admitting she broke the law, but the judge siding with the prosecutors who pushed for prison time instead of just probation. The news not just impacting Huffman, you should know that others involved in the cheating scheme including Lori Loughlin who pleaded not guilty are still awaiting their fate. Dana, let me go to you. This is very interesting in that, you know, the prosecutors had asked for a year -- one month to 15 months. She ends up now with 14 day sentence, is that fair?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, what her lawyers were saying that she should probably be allowed just to have probation, and to stay at home, and maybe do 250 hours of community service. However, because, remember, if this is a financial situation where she has a lot of money. So, having her pay a big fine is not really a punishment because they have plenty of money. That could -- $30,000 fine for somebody else would be really out of reach. I do think that prosecutors are saying we've got to send a message. She's not going to be able to stay at home in her Hollywood Hills luxury with an infinity pool. They actually used those words. And so, I think that this is a sign that the other parents that are awaiting their sentencing, because many of them pled guilty, they're probably going to face the same thing. I do wonder what Lori Loughlin is thinking though, because if she -- this goes to trial, if she wins, she wins, and then maybe all of this stuff is for not. But if she loses, she's probably looking at a lot more time than -- I'm looking at Emily, because I don't really know. But I'm assuming she would be looking at a lot more time than 14 days."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Right. And we've talked about this before that when you go to white collar crime federal detention facilities, essentially all the people in there with 10 year and 15 year sentences, those are not the ones who pled out. Those are the ones who went to trial and it's the juries that level these harsh sentences all the time. You and I talk about earlier, too, the fact that I was worried, frankly, as a citizen that she would get zero prison time because, for me -- first of all, the government punishes inchoate crimes, right? There's a reason why conspiracies are illegal. It's not just about whether you actually went through with it, or whether the crime was actually able to be committed and there was some type of, quote, victim that people have been arguing. Here, even the probation office said, well, it's an economic offense. It was actually a lot more than that and it was straight up fraud. And so, I have seen for a tax evasion case for a few thousand dollars probation office deny and refuse to endorse someone requesting home confinement with a disabled dependent. And here she was arguing for one with her infinity pool. As the prosecutor said, she was morally clueless and it was out of a sense of entitlement only. So I'm 100 percent am grateful that she, at least, got some jail time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "All right. So, Jesse, I'm gonna -- if that was the prosecution's case, let me give you the defense case, right? The defense case is she wasn't involved in any of the fraud with regards to, you know, ginning up an athletic record for the kid. What she did was she -- and she writes this in a letter to the court. She said she did this out of maternal devotion, insecurity. Her daughter has a learning disability. And the daughter, by the way, got a 1420 on the SAT score out of a max of 1600. And her lawyer said she's remorseful. You know, there's no need to jail her because the message to the other parents is don't do this. And there's no need to put this talented actress in jail."

      "utterance": "Especially -- so it might even be too late, and she has to come crawling back to the prosecution and beg them. But I don't know. I think she might be too far along. The other thing it is, this has destroyed not only the relationship with the daughter, because the daughter now says, mom, why didn't you trust me? Why didn't you think I could do this myself? So that's out the window. And then William H. Macy, her husband, how does he watch his wife go to prison and you didn't think he was involved in this at all? Somehow he gets out of this. I don't know how. Great lawyering. Maybe there wasn't a hard-trail evidence, but that's a really awkward situation. And then finally, this country loves watching celebrities go down in flames. If you're a world class celebrity, like Greg Gutfeld, when it comes -- when he goes out in flames, you let people just dancing on his grave. So I don't want to sit here and dance on her grave. I hope she, you know, survives her stint and recovers nicely."

And, yet, some of the mainstream media coverage of him called him decent up from disaster last time and reassuring. I found his response to the questions of systemic racism, as I said, literally appalling. And to me, he showed that he was disqualifying, that he will not be able to take on Trump in any form or fashion because he's unable to even engage in a conversation about the systemic racism that people on the left are wanting to ask about.

I think about Eric Garner, and I know why -- Eric Garner died in a police action. But the police action wouldn't have happened if they didn't have a stupid ass law banning the selling of loose cigarettes. That's what led to that confrontation to that death. So it's not necessarily the police confrontation that lead to violence, it's the stupid laws. This could end with -- he's so stupid.

But when we know the myriad reasons it wouldn't work, especially because it would end in violence and because it wouldn't work in terms of sheer numbers and because of the serial component of all of these guns and all the registration needed and et cetera, et cetera.

No, those are real people. It's five-year-old Elijah and his 90-year-old great grandfather Richard Bain. They decide to recreate the lead characters from the movie in a photo. As you recall, the film is about an elderly widower who takes a thousand balloons, ties them to his house and floats away to see the jungles of South America. Elijah also took a picture with his great grandmother Caroline Bain, movie nominated for five Academy Awards. But I want to nominate Elijah for bringing the spirit of this movie to life, fun, family and adventure."
