And I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the Party will have to come from our presumptive nominee. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I think that he needs to do more to unify this Party to bring all wings of the Republican Party together, and then to go forward and to appeal to all Americans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I know: What a jerk. I mean, sure, conservatives should despise group think and embrace individualism, but it's time to get to the program. So what if you're worried about a guy who changed parties five times, hedges on taxes, contradicts himself on foreign policy, favors raising the minimum wage, linked Ted Cruz to JFK's death, blamed Bush for 9/11, ridiculed the war hero and took a picture with a taco salad while saying I love Hispanics? I, for one can't wait to see how President Trump celebrates Martin Luther King Day. What will he eat then? I kid the Donald. Anyway, Ryan says he's not ready and some true conservatives are mad that Ryan won't back a liberal Republican. But it's nice to see the same people who are cheering disruption just weeks ago, now demanding unity. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For me, Trump's killing of ideology is great. If only he replaces it with principles. As for Ryan, you don't have to worry, he's meeting Donald next week, and 10-1 they'll end up eating taco salads in Trump Tower. And then all of our noted principled conservatives can relax as another one falls in line. Finally, what does the current president have to say about this? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",
