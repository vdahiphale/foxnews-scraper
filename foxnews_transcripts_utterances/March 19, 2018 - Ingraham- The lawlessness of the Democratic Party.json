Plus, do you believe students organized millions of anti-gun marchers and hundreds of protests this Saturday? We are going to tell you who really did. And also, the IRS admits to knowing about millions of cases of taxpayer fraud by illegal immigrants. Guess how many prosecutions? It will make your jaw drop.

Well, you will notice that none of McCabe defenders that you just heard mentioned the actual reasons for his dismissal because those are very inconvenient. He's charged with leaking information about an ongoing investigation, the one into the Clinton email scandal to 'The Wall Street Journal.' Attorney General Sessions said that McCabe lacked candor about those leaks and at times he did so under oath. That's a big no-no.

And by the way, for other Clinton bundlers contributed $130,000.00 to Mrs. McCabe's campaign, not a bad haul. That doesn't constitute at least the appearance of a conflict of interest for her husband, who was investigating Mrs. Clinton?

The average working person has to suffer as violent, illegal alien offenders roam free after being released from jail in places like Oakland and down in L.A., and by the way, these are the same people who made all kinds of lame excuses for the rioting and destruction by mobs in Baltimore following Freddy Gray's death, and ditto for the nights of looting and fires -- those terrible events in Ferguson following the police shooting of Michael Brown. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, recall that juries acquitted the police officers in each case. By the way, the same type of people who, going back to the Obama era, they didn't bat an eye when Eric Holder declined to prosecute IRS official Lois Lerner for discriminating against conservative 501(c) Groups, and didn't care that Eric Holder's stonewalled congress regarding the fast and furious scandal, which by the way, I forgot until today, which led to a criminal contempt of congress resolution against Holder. And of course, we all remember, there were no repercussions for Susan Rice. Remember when she went out and lied to the American people about what spurred that attack on our government compound in Benghazi, Libya? In fact, the only person who was actually charged after four Americans were killed there, including the U.S. Ambassador, was a man named Ahmed Abu Khattala, and he was found not guilty of 14 of the 18 counts against him, unbelievable, no accountability. Let us not forget the Democrats who once prided themselves on caring about protecting civil liberties -- they don't seem at all bothered about using the vast power of our intelligence services to spy on members of Donald Trump's campaign team. Although the Democrats and their media surrogates seemed fine with this, by any means necessary approach, I do not think most Americans are. Check this out. It's a new Monmouth poll that finds that over half of the American public is either very or somewhat worried that the U.S. Government is monitoring their activities and invading their privacy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, they are noticing the overreach of the deep state and they don't like it. This matters to voters. It should. If any of us had done what McCabe did, we would probably already be in jail and he may yet be. To understand the dangers at play here, remember when President Trump vowed to reform the intelligence services as he came into office?

Notice in customary Clintonian fashion she didn't really apologize for what she said. She apologized to those of you too stupid to understand what he meant. Hillary then made matters worse by justifying her claim, writing 'It's not that crazy when you think about our ongoing struggles to reach gender balance, even within the same household. I did not realize how hard it would make many who heard it.' And this tone-deaf woman is still trying to figure out what happened? Please.

So when the government learns of wrongdoing, shouldn't it act immediately without regard of who cares when someone is retiring? If it was wrong, it was wrong and that's what the Justice Department did here. Well, you will notice that none of McCabe defenders that you just heard mentioned the actual reasons for his dismissal because those are very inconvenient. He's charged with leaking information about an ongoing investigation, the one into the Clinton email scandal to 'The Wall Street Journal.' Attorney General Sessions said that McCabe lacked candor about those leaks and at times he did so under oath. That's a big no-no. Now, with a response on Friday night, McCabe claims the media leaks were done with the permission of the former FBI Director Jim Comey."

Someone is lying here. And we haven't even talked about Andrew McCabe's conflict of interest. He should have recused himself from investigating Hillary Clinton since his wife Jill, when she was running for state office in Virginia, received nearly $468,000.00 from Clinton Powell-Terry McAuliffe's pack. And by the way, for other Clinton bundlers contributed $130,000.00 to Mrs. McCabe's campaign, not a bad haul. That doesn't constitute at least the appearance of a conflict of interest for her husband, who was investigating Mrs. Clinton? It is patently obvious at this point that the Democrats and their media toadies will defend and/or ignore any lawlessness, so long as it achieves their political end, which is, what, to win back power in Congress and eventually run President Trump out of office."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I was thinking about this. This endorsement of lawlessness, looking the other way at conflicts of interest, this isn't an isolated incident for the left. Remember, these are the same people who applaud the compassion and the courage of public officials who push sanctuary policies in cities like Chicago, Hartford, Connecticut, and all across California. The average working person has to suffer as violent, illegal alien offenders roam free after being released from jail in places like Oakland and down in L.A., and by the way, these are the same people who made all kinds of lame excuses for the rioting and destruction by mobs in Baltimore following Freddy Gray's death, and ditto for the nights of looting and fires -- those terrible events in Ferguson following the police shooting of Michael Brown. Now, recall that juries acquitted the police officers in each case. By the way, the same type of people who, going back to the Obama era, they didn't bat an eye when Eric Holder declined to prosecute IRS official Lois Lerner for discriminating against conservative 501(c) Groups, and didn't care that Eric Holder's stonewalled congress regarding the fast and furious scandal, which by the way, I forgot until today, which led to a criminal contempt of congress resolution against Holder. And of course, we all remember, there were no repercussions for Susan Rice. Remember when she went out and lied to the American people about what spurred that attack on our government compound in Benghazi, Libya? In fact, the only person who was actually charged after four Americans were killed there, including the U.S. Ambassador, was a man named Ahmed Abu Khattala, and he was found not guilty of 14 of the 18 counts against him, unbelievable, no accountability. Let us not forget the Democrats who once prided themselves on caring about protecting civil liberties -- they don't seem at all bothered about using the vast power of our intelligence services to spy on members of Donald Trump's campaign team. Although the Democrats and their media surrogates seemed fine with this, by any means necessary approach, I do not think most Americans are. Check this out. It's a new Monmouth poll that finds that over half of the American public is either very or somewhat worried that the U.S. Government is monitoring their activities and invading their privacy. In other words, they are noticing the overreach of the deep state and they don't like it. This matters to voters. It should. If any of us had done what McCabe did, we would probably already be in jail and he may yet be. To understand the dangers at play here, remember when President Trump vowed to reform the intelligence services as he came into office? Do you recall the chilling response of Senator Chuck Schumer at the time?"

And even when they are caught, as McCabe was, Democrats will defend them because they all share the same goal. At every level, the Democrats have either willingly enabled or tolerated lawlessness, conflicts of interest, and ranked bias within our government, because they want power back. And that's why they've contorted themselves into these pretzels to protect Hillary, and that's why they are relentlessly pursuing Donald Trump. But I'm telling you, this approach may end up backfiring. President Trump's approval numbers have gone up four percent to 43 percent in the last month. Maybe I'm being too optimistic, maybe. But I think Americans have a strong sense of innate fairness and if the Democrats idea of public service is seeming to embrace weaponizing intelligence, spying on American citizens and yet dismissing obvious criminal acts, when committed by their own party or illegal immigrants, well they made themselves need a November miracle to pull off the kind of wave election that they've been banking on, we'll see -- and that's the 'Angle.' Joining me now for reaction from New York is conservative commentator Monica Crowley, who is a Senior Fellow at the London Center for Policy Research and with me here in Washington, (Feld Homelake) (sic.), former White House special counsel to Bill Clinton and author of the new book, 'The Unmaking of the President 2016: How FBI Director James Comey Cost Hillary Clinton the Presidency' great to see both of you.

We have seen the unprotected class as Peggy Noonan once very incredibly and extraordinarily called them and she was right about that. The unprotected class has been in revolt now against the elite ruling class. So, Senator Rubio's comments there about -- well, he may have committed provable crimes, but he still should have been able to retire with the full benefits and with respect. No. We are a nation built on the rule of law. You either have rule of law that extended -- that's extended and applied to everybody equally, or you don't.

LANNY DAVIS, AUTHOR OF, 'THE UNMAKING OF THE PRESIDENT 2016: HOW FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY COST HILLARY CLINTON THE PRESIDENCY': Well, first of all, I never thought I'd say the words, 'I agree with Senator Rubio', but I do agree. And most people, I think, get the difference between the decision on the merits, which I think McCabe was deservedly relieved by briefing the press and he actually explained himself, that we have the FBI follow the rules. The problem with James Comey and McCabe is the FBI should not follow its own rules; you have to follow the policies of the Justice Department.

Now, the FBI has to follow the constitution to the letter -- whenever we prosecute somebody, whenever we investigate someone, we have to follow all the rules of evidence, all the criminal procedures. The CIA doesn't do that, so I'm not surprised that Brennan comes up with this idiotic statement that he makes, because, again, he can operate on conjecture.

They have to tell the truth and they can't nuance the truth and they can't spin it. They have to tell the whole story the way it comes out factually, and McCabe knew that.

And then in 2017 the IRS also discovered 1.2 million cases of illegal aliens filing tax returns with Social Security numbers that were either fake or belonged to someone else. Isn't that nice? And when asked by CNS News how many of those thieves had been referred for criminal prosecution, the IRS replied that it did not know. It didn't know, what? Let's discuss how this could happen with a former IRS investigator Joseph Banister. All right, Joe, it's great to see you. OK, when I first read this today, I guess this came out on Friday and we didn't get to it because of all the McCabe stuff, if you or I cross the IRS, we are toast, let's face it.

You mentioned Lois Lerner earlier, Commissioner Koskinen, I was really amazed that there was a firing at the FBI because it's one-zero, one being FBI and zero being the IRS. They just don't follow the law. The American people have no idea how much fraud and corruption goes on inside the agency.

Very few people trust the government. And this case of illegal aliens filing tax returns with fake numbers, getting refunds with fake information, robbing the U.S. government of tax dollars, is mindboggling.

Actually Americans are better off if an illegal aliens makes up a Social Security number because as the statistics in the report show over a million numbers that were accurately issued by the Social Security Administration belonging to regular Americans, over a million of those were used by illegal aliens on W-2 forms. And the only way that the IRS found out about this is by the treasury inspector general looking into what goes on here and they see a W-2 with a Social Security number on it and a tax return with an I-10 on it, and they say wait a second, somebody with an I-10 isn't supposed to have a Social Security number."

So it could have a boomerang effect, but they are going to register a lot of people to vote. Stephen, great work on the piece. And a big serving for humble pie for some of the loudmouths on the left. That's next."

      "utterance": "For fun let's call it the diva apology tour. A number of lefty ladies are issuing mea culpas, isn't that nice, after getting stung with bad press following idiotic remarks. Let's begin, because it's always fun to begin with the Clintons, with Hillary, who recently caused such an uproar in India when she wasn't falling down the stairs that even Democrats are disowning her. They were especially outraged over her latest explanation for her presidential election loss, what happened. She said that basically men pressured women to vote for Trump. Women are too stupid to think for themselves. That's what my take was. But instead of apologizing she wrote on Facebook, quote, 'I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be misinterpreted.' Notice in customary Clintonian fashion she didn't really apologize for what she said. She apologized to those of you too stupid to understand what he meant. Hillary then made matters worse by justifying her claim, writing 'It's not that crazy when you think about our ongoing struggles to reach gender balance, even within the same household. I did not realize how hard it would make many who heard it.' And this tone-deaf woman is still trying to figure out what happened? Please. At least MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle issued an apology, an actual apology, after mocking the face of Larry Kudlow, the president's new pick to lead his National Economic Council."

      "utterance": "He ended by saying however things work out it will be God's will. That's an interesting way to talk about being the National Economic Advisor to the president, God's will? As Larry Kudlow says, it's God's will."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Do I have something to toast? Yes, St. Joseph's feast day. Kudlow took exception and he tweeted on Friday, 'Sneering at faith and God's will, why still on air? She apparently believes people in business and economics should not have faith.' Ruhle reversed course the next day, tweeting 'I apologize if my comments came off as dismissive of his faith. I would never question another person's belief in God.' Kudlow didn't even point out the inappropriate word choice. We all make grammatical mistakes, but graciously he accepted Ruhle's apology. And then there's Joyless Behar. Something possessed her to make these comments in February about Vice President Pence."

      "utterance": "Good for her. I'm glad she did. But these apologies seem to be driven by complaints sometimes rather than conscience. But however grudging, they serve an important purpose. And each puts the intolerant left on notice to think twice before they utter in public what they probably say about conservatives behind closed doors. The silent majority, silent no more. So be careful. We'll be right back. 'The Last Bite' is next."

      "utterance": "Before we go, it's time for 'The Last Bite.' This bizarre era of American politics took a fresh turn into these surreal today. Actress Cynthia Nixon of 'Sex and the City' fame, you all watched that in the 90s, right, officially announced her candidacy for governor of New York. In a surprise twist, get this, she's running as a pro-Trump Republican. Just kidding. Of course she's running as a Democrat, and running to the hardcore left of Governor Andrew Cuomo in the upcoming Democratic primary. Fortunately, Ms. Nixon's acting repertoire should prepare her for the brutal day-to-day political conduct with New York's legislature. CYNTHIA NIXON, 'SEX & THE CITY': I've got to go. There's a big pile of tutus coming at me. OK, we need to have another talk."

And I heard Nixon by the way got some good reviews for her recent appearance on Broadway. Somehow I think in this case, though, her political act may be closing out of town. Well, we want to tell you that all week long we're going to be doing a special series on the lawlessness of the Democrat Party. You do not want to miss it. It's not a day, not a night. And we want to hear from you about tonight's show. Tweet me @IngrahamAngle. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the 'FOX News at Night' team takes things from here. Miss Shannon.
