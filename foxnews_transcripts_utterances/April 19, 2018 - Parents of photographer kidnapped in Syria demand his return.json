Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?\" So, that as there is a bit of what you might call a whoa nelly moment in the investigation for the lawyer in New York, Michael Cohen tonight. While we are far from the end of all of this to be sure. Tonight, we have learned that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told the president on a visit to the White House that Mr. Trump is not a target of the Michael Cohen investigation. Some of the reporting on the raid and word that Michael Cohen was ready to flip and testify against the president may be a bit ahead of excuse.

But instead, what we're seeing is some of the onetime FBI officials who've been challenging the president's candor, namely James Comey and Andrew McCabe as you just noted in that tweet, are facing new scrutiny themselves tonight. Bottom line is Bloomberg kicked a lot of this off today by reporting that in a meeting last Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein again told the president he's not a target in the Mueller probe. The president instead is a subject of the investigation, meaning his conduct is under investigation, but there's not enough evidence to charge him. That point had been reported last month. What's significant is Rosenstein was now repeating this for the first time since the president's longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had his home and office raided. And Fox News is specifically hearing Rosenstein also told the president he's not a target of the separate Cohen investigation. That is new. We pressed Rosenstein's office for his version of the conversation. We got this statement: \"As Department officials have said consistently in testimony and elsewhere, we don't comment on conversations with the president.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Important to note, though, Mueller has not ruled out making the president a target in the future based on evidence that could emerge -- the same could happen in Cohen investigation, which may explain why the president, late today, also beefed up his legal team, adding an ally who's a former federal prosecutor, Rudy Giuliani. The former New York City mayor has been sharply critical of the FBI and Justice Department for going light on Hillary Clinton, while turning up the heat on the president. Well, one of those FBI officials who has challenged the president is McCabe, who was fired for leaking and then lying about it. Now, the inspector general at the Justice Department has sent a criminal referral to the U.S. Attorney here in D.C. over allegations that McCabe lied to internal investigators of the FBI. CNN asked Comey what he thought about McCabe lying. Watch.",

Now, we know that when Chuck Grassley asked FBI Director Comey, at the time, whether or not he had ever been a source for any information that went out to the press on this investigation, he said never and he said never twice.

But in August of 2012, he was kidnapped while he was reporting in Syria, just days after his 31st birthday. Before he disappeared, he posted on Facebook a message to friends and family who had questioned why he would stay in such a dangerous place and here's what Austin said: \"I'm living in a place at a time and with the people where life means more than anywhere I have ever been because every single day, people here lay down their own for the sake of others. Coming here to Syria is the greatest thing I've ever done and it is the greatest feeling of my life.\" Now, more than five years and eight months later, no one knows exactly where Austin, or who is responsible for his disappearance.

Tonight, we have learned that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told the president on a visit to the White House that Mr. Trump is not a target of the Michael Cohen investigation. Some of the reporting on the raid and word that Michael Cohen was ready to flip and testify against the president may be a bit ahead of excuse. So, this news tonight, while not conclusive, is a sign that perhaps a tap on the brakes a little bit in order here."

But first, Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry live at the White House with all the late breaking news tonight. Ed."

    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Martha, and there's a lot new signs tonight that President Trump is not a criminal target in either the Michael Cohen or Robert Miller investigations. But instead, what we're seeing is some of the onetime FBI officials who've been challenging the president's candor, namely James Comey and Andrew McCabe as you just noted in that tweet, are facing new scrutiny themselves tonight. Bottom line is Bloomberg kicked a lot of this off today by reporting that in a meeting last Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein again told the president he's not a target in the Mueller probe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "The president instead is a subject of the investigation, meaning his conduct is under investigation, but there's not enough evidence to charge him. That point had been reported last month. What's significant is Rosenstein was now repeating this for the first time since the president's longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had his home and office raided. And Fox News is specifically hearing Rosenstein also told the president he's not a target of the separate Cohen investigation. That is new. We pressed Rosenstein's office for his version of the conversation. We got this statement",
      "utterance": "\"As Department officials have said consistently in testimony and elsewhere, we don't comment on conversations with the president.\" Important to note, though, Mueller has not ruled out making the president a target in the future based on evidence that could emerge -- the same could happen in Cohen investigation, which may explain why the president, late today, also beefed up his legal team, adding an ally who's a former federal prosecutor, Rudy Giuliani. The former New York City mayor has been sharply critical of the FBI and Justice Department for going light on Hillary Clinton, while turning up the heat on the president. Well, one of those FBI officials who has challenged the president is McCabe, who was fired for leaking and then lying about it. Now, the inspector general at the Justice Department has sent a criminal referral to the U.S. Attorney here in D.C. over allegations that McCabe lied to internal investigators of the FBI. CNN asked Comey what he thought about McCabe lying. Watch."

I'm not the judge in the case, I'm not the discipline -- decision-maker in the case. I think it is accountability mechanisms working and they should work because it's not acceptable in the FBI or the Justice Department for people to lack candor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, except Comey has been charged with candor problems of his own. Republican Charles Grassley has said four of the seven memos Comey leaked about his interactions with the president had classified information, even though Comey said in sworn testimony last year, he deliberately let classified information out of his memos so that they could be leaked. We're hearing the Justice Department will soon release redacted versions of those Comey memos, so we may be able to finally sort it out. As for McCabe, his camp put out a statement: \"We're confident that unless there's inappropriate pressure from the high levels of the administration, the U.S. Attorney's office will conclude it should decline to prosecute.\" But a former Justice Department official said today that given the fact that criminal referral is coming from the inspector general, who nonpartisan, it carries a lot of weight, Martha."

      "utterance": "So, talk to -- you know, you listen to Ed's set up piece, and you heard all of this, he said, is popping tonight with regard to McCabe, and with regard to what the president has been told about the Michael Cohen investigation in New York, what jumped out at you in all of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "One key element, I believe, is that the president has been told again he's not a target, and this is from the deputy attorney general for the United States. So, that's pure gold. Of course, things could change, because of the facts and all of that. The second thing is that the inspector general who is a career official at the Justice Department has made this criminal referral -- that's a very important step, it's a dangerous step obviously for Mr. McCabe. But it shows that these guardrails are working, that these accountability mechanisms, as Director Comey said in 'The Lead' are, in fact, in place, and I think that should be a great assurance to the American people. The third thing that jumps out at me is that the president has hired a brilliant lawyer. Of course, everybody knows that America's mayor is a lawyer, but I would tell you this based on my personal experience with Rudy Giuliani, there's probably no better lawyer in the United States to handle this kind of very high-profile situation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Very interesting. I want to zero in for a moment on Andrew McCabe and James Comey, because they're going after each other here and the president just said as much in the tweet that he put out, he felt that James Comey had thrown Andrew McCabe under the bus, but what Andrew McCabe has been criminally referred to for is lying to FBI investigators about releasing information, you know, acting as a source and then saying he didn't to a story in the Wall Street Journal. Now, we know that when Chuck Grassley asked FBI Director Comey, at the time, whether or not he had ever been a source for any information that went out to the press on this investigation, he said never and he said never twice. And then, he came back and said, well, I did leak information to a friend of mine because I wanted to get it out there to start a special counsel. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "It's extraordinarily serious. First of all, lying to Congress, like lying to the FBI, like lying under oath, and he was under oath when he's testifying before Congress. It's an extremely serious thing. It's a potential felony."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But says he was a private citizen at the time. When asked about this, he was a private citizen, I was just sharing some information with a friend."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "No, but he was carrying information that he received in his or created in his capacity as director of the FBI. He just can't do that. It's totally inconsistent with the FBI's conduct. It's ethical constraints. And the office of professional responsibility of the FBI, I think, would confirm this: you don't leak. You don't get documents out of FBI headquarters at the Hoover building and then start sharing them directly or indirectly with the reporter. So, it's a very serious breach of what the FBI stands for, which is integrity. And so, both Mr. McCabe and Mr. Comey really have a lot to answer for now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And we're going to -- we expect that we're going to get the full inspector general's report, which will go back and look at the decisions that were made in the Hillary Clinton investigation by former FBI Director James Comey. He doesn't seem to be worried about that at all right now, but clearly, that is part of the subject of this ongoing investigation. I do want to ask you about this Michael Cohen matter bit, because this has been an investigation that sort of began with Robert Mueller's investigation to Russia. Now, it has gone, sort of, down the chain, and it should be pointed out that the federal investigators sort of kicked this part of it up to New York and said there are financial issues that we're concerned with Michael Cohen and it appears tonight that is what Michael Cohen and not with the president, at least based on what we know so far. But is this an investigation that has gone too far away from its original mission? And Stormy Daniels has, you know, sort of become the new Monica Lewinsky, one would say."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "Well, except there's -- the enormous difference here is the Lewinsky face of the investigation. I was trying to -- it was about lying under oath and encouraging others to lie under oath. It was about the abuse of power. So, it's a totally different kettle of fish, but the Cohen thing is very troubling to me. Any time that a lawyer's office is raided, I believe all Americans should be concerned about that. What's the justification? No, there was of safeguard in place, there was judicial review, but I'm very concerned about the process that's going to be followed to protect the attorney-client privilege, which is sacrosanct in American law and it should be. It's one of the most important elements to protect the liberties of the people. So, I'm very concerned. The jury is out, but I think everyone should be concerned about the process, and to make sure that the process is carried out now with great care and sensitivity of the individual liberty."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I want to squeeze in one more question about Michael Flynn because I can only imagine what he thinks when he looks at all of this information about Andrew McCabe and potentially even James Comey. You know, definitely, McCabe according to this report, lying to investigators, that's exactly what he was accused of."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "Well, that's right. I think one of the things that has been brought home in the Mueller investigation, with different guilty pleas of a recent sentencing, don't lie, tell the truth to investigators. And all the more important when you go before a grand jury. Just don't lie, tell the truth. We have a protection, it's called the Fifth Amendment privilege, don't lie. If you can't keep from lying without incriminating or inculpating yourself, just say: I'm going to invoke the Fifth Amendment. It's a great constitutional protection."

And then, that's the great foundation for many of the pilots who go on to the airlines. And they have great training programs too with the airlines, and you really just -- I always say you fight like you train and train like you fight and it just kicks in.

And what we're learning about is this concerted effort both by the Syrian regime and the Russians to hide the truth of what happened there and mask the evidence. As you say, the OPCW has been unable to visit those sites, supposedly because of safety concerns after claims they were fired at by rebels yesterday. The numerous sources here as well as in Douma have told us that's not true. In fact, rebel fighters in Douma were bused out of the area ten days ago, and they are being in other parts of Damascus. And in fact, it's because of the chemical attacks, the rebels have finally did deals with Russia to leave. And there is more mounting evidence that the regime is trying to hide the truth.

And students, you know, from Georgetown, undergrad, and led by a remarkable young man, Ari Goldstein, who's graduating in May this year, class of 2018, along with the administration, the faculty, the staff of Georgetown, they've been tremendously supportive in putting this exhibit together, which is really reflective of who Austin is.

Just moments ago, we got word that James Comey's memos that he typed up in the FBI vehicle when he was on his way back from his meeting with President Trump to the FBI, he wanted to memorialize exactly what had happened in that meeting as you all remember. Those notes have now officially been transferred to congress. There's a redacted version that is allowed to be released, because the classified information is blocked out. And then, there's an un-redacted version which will not be released because it includes classified information, and that's a whole other subject because Mr. Comey, at one point, suggested there wasn't any really classified information in there, so more on that as we get it. SEN. TIM KAINE, D—VIRGINIA: I voted for him for CIA director. I think he's got a great intel background, but he just has a track record of statements that are sort of anti-diplomatic during the discussion about the Iran deal. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D—CONN.: I think he set a poor example in terms of American values, so I will strongly oppose his nomination."

Today's Wall Street Journal editorial took a jab at Democrats and some Republicans who are giving Pompeo push back asking, quote, who needs a secretary of state? But, today, President Trump backs up his decision, tweeting, 'Democrats are obstructing good, hopefully great, people wanting to give a big portion of their life to work for our government, hence, the American people. They are slow walking all of my nomination, hundreds of people. At this rate it will take 9 years for all approvals.' One of our next guests says the Democratic obstruction is karma. Former Clinton senior advisor, Philippe Reines is tweeting, quote, Senator Bob Corker, who wrote, Mike Pompeo deserves a vote and confirmation of the secretary of state. Remember both Hillary Clinton and John Kerry got 94 votes. And Philippe' writes, 'you know what's memorable, Senator Corker? Merrick Garland getting zero votes, so suck it up.' He's always so expressive in all of his tweets. Phillipe, good to see you. Steve Hayes, good to see you as well. Thank you both for being here. You know, but doesn't it point to, sort of, a lack of civilized behavior on the hill when you look back at the records of the way that Condoleezza Rice, and Colin Powell, rather, and John Kerry were approved by vast majorities. And yet, Mike Pompeo who went to, you know, as a Harvard graduate, and graduated at the top of his class from West Point, seems to have some problem with him, Philippe."

Rand Paul at the moment is the biggest impediment to Mike Pompeo making it out of committee, let alone on the floor. And, I think in terms of tradition, the congress -- the Senate has been differential to the president very much, especially in their first cabinet. But 15 months later, and President Trump got his whole first cabinet without a problem, except for the labor secretary who pulled out himself. But 15 months later, you have Rex Tillerson who was fired, David Shulkin who was fired. You have Tom Price who was fired."

But, I want Steve to weigh in here as well on the basic question which is, is this something that should be approve -- the person the president would like to see at the state department, and he was approved roundly, 66 votes in his favor, Steve, when he was being considered for CIA."

      "speaker": "STEPHEN HAYES, THE WEEKLY STANDARD",
      "utterance": "Yeah, look, I think the default should be to approve the president's nominees. And I would say the argument that Philippe is making would, in fact, are in favor of confirming Mike Pompeo. He's somebody who has had a successful tenure in his 15 months at the CIA. He went in, in a difficult position as an elected official, as a Republican, as somebody who was going to represent the Trump administration when the president-elect was in a fight with the intel agency, and he won over the bureaucracy and conducted himself by all accounts as a very effective CIA director. So, isn't that somebody that you would want to have in Donald Trump's ear? He's doing things like negotiating with North Korea, or fixing the Iran deal. I would think the Democrats would be desperate to have somebody who as stable and thoughtful of character as Mike Pompeo is."

      "utterance": "I promise I'll let you finish. But in the past, it has been a very bipartisan, and there's always going to be some people on both sides of the fence who vote no. But, the fact is, that there's been this, sort of, vote of confidence that the president is the president, he should have the person that he wants in this position. And, you know, the person doesn't have three heads or, you know, something ridiculously egregious that -- it's courtesy to let him go through with those moves. There's no courtesy left, though, it would appear."

Look, I think there've been less than a dozen in our nation's history of cabinet secretaries who've been voted down. I'm not sure Mike Pompeo is going to be the next one. You already had a Democrat, today, who said that they're going to vote for him. So, the only reason it wouldn't happen would be if Rand Paul took really extreme procedural steps. And -- but I think after 15 months again, people are weary. And let's not forget, Mike Pompeo had a hearing, and he said things during the hearing that people were concerned by, both Democrats and Republican. So, I mean, that's the job. The senate is not a rubber stamp. There's a balance between being differential to the president's base."

That's not because."

It was during a birthday trip to Vegas in 2013, where Mr. Cox attended the David Copperfield show at the MGM Grand Hotel. Cox was among the audience members selected for lucky 13. That's a famous Copperfield illusion where 13 audience members appear to vanish. Except, now we know that when the big curtain comes down, stagehands replaced the audience members in the chairs on stage, and the lucky 13 are taken out a back door and led through the bowels of the MGM Grand. They go down alleys, around corners, even through a kitchen until, they magically appear in the back of the theater. But Gavin Cox claims during that secret trip, he fell, dislocated his shoulder and hit his head. He said the hotel was under construction at the time and he tripped over debris. The hotel and the show say the pathway was clear, but on the witness stand, the show executive producer did acknowledge that participants are told nothing. Watch."
