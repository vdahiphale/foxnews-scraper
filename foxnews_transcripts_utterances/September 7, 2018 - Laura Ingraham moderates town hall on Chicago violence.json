Now, last week I went to Chicago to discover the reason for the staggering levels of violence. Violence destroying the south and west sides of the windy city. And I wanted to expose the city's impotent political response to it. So we spoke to victims, politicians, religious leaders, all of whom who are on the ground. What they have to say is going to shock you. But these voices need to be heard. Now, we learned this week that Chicago's Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel, will not be seeking a third term. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, one can only hope that a new mayor will bring peace and some healing to a city in desperate need of both.

      "sentences": "Good evening everyone, I'm Laura Ingraham and welcome to the first ever INGRAHAM ANGLE town hall. Now, first I'd like to thank the city of Chicago and our audience here for hosting us for an incredibly important discussion. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Chicago is one of the truly great American cities, spectacularly beautiful in the summer and winter. But in recent years, its gang violence problem has reached epidemic proportions, a level of violence just unacceptable for anywhere in America. The city is on pace for more than 2,000 shootings this year, which will mark the fifth straight year it's topped that grim mark. And just so you get some perspective, since 2011, the year that Rahm Emanuel took office as mayor, there have been over 4,000 murders in this city. That's more than the 3,481 soldiers who were killed in action in operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2010, if you can believe it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And it's not just the level of violence in the city that's the problem. It's the lack of justice. According to an analysis conducted by the \"Washington Post,\" Chicago police have made an arrest in only about 27 percent of homicides since 2010. That's the lowest rate of any city \"The Post\" examined. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For non-fatal shootings, it's even worse. The University of Chicago Crime Lab tells us just 10 percent of shootings resulted in arrests in 2014. And by 2016, the latest year available, that number had dropped to just five percent The unsolved crimes undoubtedly fuel a vicious cycle of distrust between law enforcement and community. And no one is immune from this violence. Throughout the hour, we're going to talk to members of law enforcement, community activists, religious and political leaders, as well as members of the audience, to try to figure out why this tragedy is unfolding in Chicago and how to stop it. Let's get started tonight with Anthony Napolitano. He's a former police officer and the sole Republican in Chicago's 50-seat city council. Martin Prieb, who is a member of Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police, and Kevin Graham, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Chicago Lodge 7. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Anthony, let's start with you. This is so both heartbreaking and infuriating. We have a world of violence across the globe. Heart breaking stories every day, but as Americans, I can't imagine we find this level of violence in a city as spectacular as Chicago, with its rich history, acceptable. What do we do?",

And I wanted to expose the city's impotent political response to it. So we spoke to victims, politicians, religious leaders, all of whom who are on the ground. What they have to say is going to shock you. But these voices need to be heard. Now, we learned this week that Chicago's Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel, will not be seeking a third term.

      "utterance": "Good evening everyone, I'm Laura Ingraham and welcome to the first ever INGRAHAM ANGLE town hall. Now, first I'd like to thank the city of Chicago and our audience here for hosting us for an incredibly important discussion. Chicago is one of the truly great American cities, spectacularly beautiful in the summer and winter. But in recent years, its gang violence problem has reached epidemic proportions, a level of violence just unacceptable for anywhere in America. The city is on pace for more than 2,000 shootings this year, which will mark the fifth straight year it's topped that grim mark. And just so you get some perspective, since 2011, the year that Rahm Emanuel took office as mayor, there have been over 4,000 murders in this city. That's more than the 3,481 soldiers who were killed in action in operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2010, if you can believe it. And it's not just the level of violence in the city that's the problem. It's the lack of justice. According to an analysis conducted by the \"Washington Post,\" Chicago police have made an arrest in only about 27 percent of homicides since 2010. That's the lowest rate of any city \"The Post\" examined. For non-fatal shootings, it's even worse. The University of Chicago Crime Lab tells us just 10 percent of shootings resulted in arrests in 2014. And by 2016, the latest year available, that number had dropped to just five percent The unsolved crimes undoubtedly fuel a vicious cycle of distrust between law enforcement and community. And no one is immune from this violence. Throughout the hour, we're going to talk to members of law enforcement, community activists, religious and political leaders, as well as members of the audience, to try to figure out why this tragedy is unfolding in Chicago and how to stop it. Let's get started tonight with Anthony Napolitano. He's a former police officer and the sole Republican in Chicago's 50-seat city council. Martin Prieb, who is a member of Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police, and Kevin Graham, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Chicago Lodge 7. Anthony, let's start with you. This is so both heartbreaking and infuriating. We have a world of violence across the globe. Heart breaking stories every day, but as Americans, I can't imagine we find this level of violence in a city as spectacular as Chicago, with its rich history, acceptable. What do we do?"

      "utterance": "The biggest problem I think right now in the city of Chicago is they're not breaking it down into three different groups of what's plaguing our city. You got an incredible amount of narcotics that come through the city of Chicago. You got an enormous amount of guns on the street that last year alone or (inaudible) 2018 alone, almost 5,200 guns have been recovered. We have a sale of stolen merchandise there part of a criminal element on the street that it's just -- it's a multimillion dollar industry. So you don't just have gang-bangers running around shooting each other. This is a fight over territory. This is a fight over who's making money on the street right now. And if you can't get to the streets and say, hey, you got to stop the narcotics that are coming in the boat loads and we have to get more guns off the streets, then we have to realize that the criminal element is using the streets to sell stolen merchandise, we'll never going to get ahead of this problem. I mean, your number was actually wrong. We had -- we're over the 2,000 mark of people shot in the city of Chicago already and we have 375 homicides. So we have surpassed the number of people shot. I always say if you imagine how many of them missed."

We didn't do that. We have always at the FOP tried to interject our solutions to the problem, but when it requires money, we are shut out. Our opinion doesn't count. That's part of the problem. And that's what has to change. We certainly want to go out there and do the job that we were hired to do, but because they have decided to have more police oversight, they've accepted the ACLU and their long stop carts because they have decided that we're going to work 12 hour days. We're not going to allow people time off. That all wears on police officers and that is what has contributed to the problems in this city."

So, I just wonder, whatever happened to the good cop/bad cop, you know, where there's one group of police officers we might be afraid of, but then there's the good cop where they can share, you know, who is murdered, what's the crime or anything like that and we can get more, you know, crime solved for our community and to help everyone."

And many of these cases, these claims against the police are bogus. And they're used to push this narrative of police corruption that is quite often fraudulent. And the city pays out on these and creates this industry of suing police officers that, in turn, lends itself to more police oversight. And even good police officers and I believe the overwhelming majority of them are good, I think when officers do something wrong, it's generally it's a mistake. But all officers now in Chicago face an absolutely ludicrous level of oversight and potential lawsuits and criminal charges by a prosecutor that is clearly anti-police. And so this is one of the reasons that the police are unable to do the kind of effective police work that they want to do. Policing is an art and the city has now set up in so many levels --"

You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't. Why am I going to do this job?

The bigger line that is harder to cross is in the neighborhoods when nobody wants to talk about what they saw for many reasons. They don't want to get stitches.

But I really do believe we have to step up to the plate and take responsibility and stop waiting for people to come in an save the day for us. We have to start developing businesses. We have to start training individuals. We have to start making sure we have schools that are properly educating our children in our neighborhood. And then someone has to say to our parents, look, we have to take responsibility for our children. We cannot allow our children to run rampant and unharnessed and not deal with them and discipline them. We have to do a better job in our community making sure that we cover all bases. And we cannot continue to blame anyone for those issues. We have to take advantage and start doing the things for ourselves."

It especially is difficult in Chicago and especially in the poorest neighborhoods. Young men without role models, mothers doing their very best, working hard. They seek role models in all the wrong places. And the gangs are there to fulfill their roles. What about that, the family part of this equation?"

Black death is a hustle. That's the basic problem of being in Chicago. Every time you have a high level of shootings and homicides, the police have to do overtime. You've got all these community groups, they need millions of dollars. As a matter of fact, Arne Duncan received $130 million. With $130 million I can hire every black man in Chicago for the next 30 years, OK? Black death is a hustle."

Although we have to have personal responsibility, we still have a taxpayer base. We have to have taxpayers that pay taxes, get the responsibility. And we must also get the services that the government is supposed to give. We must have that. When you look at the homicide rate, it's 17 percent for 2017. I'm convinced that it's not an urgency for this administration. When 83 percent of the people who are murdered, people are still running the streets, that's a problem. We need to get these murderers off the streets, and that means increasing the capacity of the detectives unit. There's only 1,100 detectives. In 1990 when we had 2,000 detective, we have 65 percent homicide clearance rate."

People downtown are still going to be safe. People on the north side are still going to be safe. And so it seems like a strategic plan of gentrification by this administration."

If the streets are unsafe, if people are afraid to walk out on the street, you're not going to get big businesses moving in to have those good paying jobs to keep young men and women feeling like there's another way except to join a gang. So it's a cycle of a nightmarish cycle without safety. All of you, thank you very much. Incredible conversation.

I'm not even from here and I'm getting more angry as we've gone on in this town hall. But we have to channel this to answers and solutions.

There was a guest in the first block who said that there is a myth about distrust between police and community. That's a false narrative. Certainly Laquan McDonald proves that out in terms of data. But in terms of this, your question, if there's one thing that can change, it's always going to end up with jobs and opportunity. And as I interviewed a number of residents throughout the city of Chicago, that was one thing that they yelled. There were so many that were married to the life because they had no exposure to anything else. So outside of saying I want jobs and opportunities, there no path to get there. And that's honestly something that needs to be worked on sincerely."

And there was a young boy about five years old with his mother sitting underneath one of the bus enclosures. And I waved to the young man, and I started playing with the radio. And when I looked over at the young man he went like this to me. He was five years old. I realized how deep this problem really was."

And I know you've been advocating for President Trump to come in and do a town hall. We're having it. He does haven't to come here to do the town hall. He can just bring the solutions, sincerely, and that's what we're looking for. And you need help. We need mental health services. There's so much that's needed in this community. I think Mace (ph) Jackson rightly pointed out that the unemployment rate for African-Americans in the state of Illinois is the highest in the country. That's been the case. If you are an African-American man in the city of Chicago between the ages of 18 and 24, 47 percent of you are unemployed and out of school."

I talked to a dear friend who is in the audience, Charles McKeever. I talked to him about it. He said, listen, I'll hire him. He spoke to him already, so he's already hired, this guy that you just saw in that last piece. So I think that speaks to, if you bring the resources to the door step, a lot of people will take them. But those resources have to be there."

You have to have skills, basic skills that you learn in school or from your parents. That's part of it. You can't just show up and say give me -- you have to show up and want a job and get the proper training to do that. And that's a great sense of fulfillment to get your first pay check, even if it's not as much as you want, if it's taxes and everything else, but to get your first pay check and it's legitimate. That's a great feeling. Who wants to be in a gang? It's not a good life. You'll end up dead, most likely."
