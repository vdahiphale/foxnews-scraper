Some of the drafters at the time clearly evidenced a belief that non- citizens that come to this country, whether they're diplomats or undocumented would not have immediate citizenship for their children. And so, there's a good debate here. There are three different types of interpretations that have been put forward. I can't imagine how people can say with such certainty that this language means that anyone in the United States for any reason can have a citizen when they give birth on our soil. That's not evident from the text of the amendment. Many people at the time clearly didn't hold that view. Now, it's not -- that's not a frivolous view, there's good faith arguments on both sides.

You didn't see a lot of coverage of the rabbi of the congregation, Rabbi Jeffrey Meyer who said that of course, the President is welcome, that he's welcome anytime reminding people that he is a citizen of this country, that the rabbi is a citizen and that that is his president. That's the proper posture. It's one that the country has done a pretty good job with. In previous incidents, we've had controversial presidents for a while now, but generally, the country comes together in unity to condemn acts of terrorism and that's a good place to be.

Again, it has been a missed opportunity I think for the media in that they have used this not as a time of unity but for -- to two to demonstrate that they're not very good at covering issues like this fairly. They're literally blaming Donald Trump for these horrific acts of anti-Semitism -- horrific acts of anti-Semitism which is inappropriate on multiple levels. Not only is he not an anti-Semite but it's a form of scapegoating. What this shooter did at the synagogue in Pittsburgh was scapegoat Jews for -- he thought he thought Jews were to blame for everything that was wrong in the world. That's scapegoating.

TMZ is also reporting that Bulger, who was confined to a wheelchair was wheeled into a secluded corner of the prison outside the view of surveillance cameras and beaten to death. He was found lying on the ground at 8:20 this morning. Remember, Whitey Bulger was an FBI informant for many years and actually ratted out his gang's biggest rivals. Experts in organized crime say this may have been payback a long time coming. In the mid-1990s it was a corrupt FBI agent who tipped off Bulger that he was about to be arrested. Bulger then fled and remained on the lam for 16 years, becoming the FBI's most wanted criminal. And despite his face routinely being featured on national news and a film about his life, \"The Departed\" winning best picture in 2006, Whitey Bulger was somehow able to hide in plain sight living with his longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig in a seaside condominium in Santa Monica. After getting a tip in 2011 the FBI raided the condo and found fake I.D.s, numerous weapons and $800,000 in cash. Bulger was then convicted on a laundry list of charges, including his part in 11 murders, though some investigators believe he killed dozens along with racketeering and money laundering charges. Catherine Greig was also convicted on lesser charges and is scheduled to be released from prison in 2020. Whitey Bulger to gain the nickname as a kid because of his blonde hair had been serving his life sentence at a prison in Florida, but he apparently threatened a prison employee and was transferred to the Hazleton prison in West Virginia. He was killed just a few hours after arriving and is the third inmate killed in Hazleton in the past seven months. The prison union says the facility is severely understaffed. Martha?",

All of this debate turns on these six rather ill-chosen words. Is to what was meant by being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Some of the drafters at the time clearly evidenced a belief that non- citizens that come to this country, whether they're diplomats or undocumented would not have immediate citizenship for their children. And so, there's a good debate here. There are three different types of interpretations that have been put forward. I can't imagine how people can say with such certainty that this language means that anyone in the United States for any reason can have a citizen when they give birth on our soil. That's not evident from the text of the amendment. Many people at the time clearly didn't hold that view. Now, it's not -- that's not a frivolous view, there's good faith arguments on both sides. But the Supreme Court has never said with any clarity or finality what it means. The only --"

If the amendment means that anyone in the United States can produce a child who is a citizen, then, obviously the president can't change it, neither can Congress. One interpretation is that it's left to Congress, and in that case, he still can't change it with an executive order, but Congress can. So an executive order is not the ideal way to go here. He's adding baggage to an already difficult challenge."

But you know, in terms of the first part of that, we're going to get to the second part of it within a moment with Brit Hume.

    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, the best tool is to go to Congress and follow the lead in this case of Lindsey Graham, and to seek legislation. It's a good thing for this to be reviewed by the court. The Supreme Court ruled many years ago that a Chinese family was entitled to the citizenship of their child who was born on U.S. soil. But that family was here as legal residence. And many people who adopt the more narrow view of this amendment believe that, that with citizens would fit that narrow interpretation.

But that doesn't make it racist. I mean, racism is a pretty clear thing, it is the belief in the superiority of one race over another and you have to pretty well express that it seems to me to be considered a racist. And I think the case that's constantly made, and you hear it. It's not even a case, it's the assertion that's constantly made, the casually made flung about that Donald Trump is a racist is simply not substantiated. And for Joe Scarborough, who ought to know better, to say something like that as casually as he did there, it seems to me is, is what is an example of why the media are having so much trouble building public support these days. It's declined to near record low levels and this kind of stuff is what's part of it."

But, you know, bringing up the topic, discussing it, he later changed his mind about how he felt about it. But the idea that discussing it. Now, I understand that there's a -- you know, a perception which may be true that this is political with one week to go, and that it's -- you know, sort of throwing more red meat where the president thinks it will help them out a week from now. But the idea that you can't even discuss it without being labeled a racist is I think something we all have to sort of really stick, take a step back and think about here."

And that was that racism in America became absolutely unacceptable. I mean, the overwhelming consensus in this country is anti-racist, and that is why it has become unfortunately since then, a cudgel in the hands of those who would use it to attack others. Because if you can be successfully labeled a racist, you're a finished. I mean, that is about as damaging that -- as anything you can have. So, it's tempting for demagogues to fling that term about. What you don't expect is people who are supposed to have some sense in the media. Who even if they are -- you know, if they were entitled to express their opinions to be tossing around a term like that. It's just totally improper. And earlier, you know, you had a quote from a White House correspondent for CNN who labeled this a stunt, and said it was a -- you know, it was a bogus threat at the border. Well, maybe it is. But is that the job of a beat reporter to be saying that, or is that the job of one of their editorialists, one of their opinion dispensers?

If you look what's going on around this country, if you get outside of New York City where the opinions seem not to differ very much among journalists, you don't see this attitude. They don't feel like you're an emergency. Now, they may have trials and tribulations, they may have policies they don't like. But you know, with unemployment at these levels with this stock market still way higher than it was when he took office and so on, I don't think people think this is an emergency, and I don't think that increasing the defense budget and taking a different posture around the world constitutes an emergency. The thing about Trump, is he says a lot of extravagant things, but if you - - if you follow him with any -- with any thought, you notice that his bark is far worse than his bite."

I want to get one last thought for you on the politics of that suggestion. REP. PAUL RYAN, R—WISC., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order. You know, as a conservative, I'm a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution. And I think in this case, the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process. But where we obviously totally agree with the president is getting at the root issue here, which is unchecked illegal immigration."

So, I think -- you know, on balance, the members, the leaders on the Hill are not lining up with the President on this idea of an executive order. Look, I think the language of the 14th Amendment is pretty clear. I don't think you can do this by an executive order. It'll be interesting to see if it gets tested in the court. But one can only imagine, for example, Brett Kavanaugh, what he's devoted -- his devotion to the text of the Constitution, ruling on an executive order by a president that says, \"I'm revoking this.\" I don't have a sense that the kind of judges that the president has promoted to the bench are going to take anything other than a dim view of this."

You saw a lot of media highlighting of people saying that the President shouldn't represent the country at the Tree of Life Synagogue. You didn't see a lot of coverage of the rabbi of the congregation, Rabbi Jeffrey Meyer who said that of course, the President is welcome, that he's welcome anytime reminding people that he is a citizen of this country, that the rabbi is a citizen and that that is his president. That's the proper posture. It's one that the country has done a pretty good job with. In previous incidents, we've had controversial presidents for a while now, but generally, the country comes together in unity to condemn acts of terrorism and that's a good place to be. It has been disappointing to see the media, mainstream media figures and other people on the left use it as a political cudgel."

And even at a very controversial time, you know, she gave the example of what happened in South Carolina, also there was the Gabby Giffords shooting in Arizona and I think what you saw was people largely responded to President Obama's remarks and speaking on those issues in good faith. They generally commended him for his work at those times. That is a -- that is a much better way to be. Again, it has been a missed opportunity I think for the media in that they have used this not as a time of unity but for -- to two to demonstrate that they're not very good at covering issues like this fairly. They're literally blaming Donald Trump for these horrific acts of anti-Semitism -- horrific acts of anti-Semitism which is inappropriate on multiple levels. Not only is he not an anti-Semite but it's a form of scapegoating. What this shooter did at the synagogue in Pittsburgh was scapegoat Jews for -- he thought he thought Jews were to blame for everything that was wrong in the world. That's scapegoating. The proper response to violent scapegoating is not to scapegoat other people to say that President Trump or Republicans are the reason that these types of things happen. That's a very inappropriate reaction."

What do you think about that?"

It exists all across the political spectrum and it is very disappointing to see people not deal with the anti-Semitism problem in their own corner, use it again as a political cudgel against other people. A lot of what we've seen with the recent -- with recent spate of anti-Semitic rhetoric or violence has come from the left and it can come from the right as well.

TMZ is also reporting that Bulger, who was confined to a wheelchair was wheeled into a secluded corner of the prison outside the view of surveillance cameras and beaten to death. He was found lying on the ground at 8:20 this morning. Remember, Whitey Bulger was an FBI informant for many years and actually ratted out his gang's biggest rivals. Experts in organized crime say this may have been payback a long time coming. In the mid-1990s it was a corrupt FBI agent who tipped off Bulger that he was about to be arrested. Bulger then fled and remained on the lam for 16 years, becoming the FBI's most wanted criminal. And despite his face routinely being featured on national news and a film about his life, \"The Departed\" winning best picture in 2006, Whitey Bulger was somehow able to hide in plain sight living with his longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig in a seaside condominium in Santa Monica. After getting a tip in 2011 the FBI raided the condo and found fake I.D.s, numerous weapons and $800,000 in cash. Bulger was then convicted on a laundry list of charges, including his part in 11 murders, though some investigators believe he killed dozens along with racketeering and money laundering charges. Catherine Greig was also convicted on lesser charges and is scheduled to be released from prison in 2020. Whitey Bulger to gain the nickname as a kid because of his blonde hair had been serving his life sentence at a prison in Florida, but he apparently threatened a prison employee and was transferred to the Hazleton prison in West Virginia. He was killed just a few hours after arriving and is the third inmate killed in Hazleton in the past seven months. The prison union says the facility is severely understaffed. Martha?"

He was a horrible, horrible person, and I can't say that I'm unhappy that he is dead tonight. You know, he lived to age of 89. That's a lot longer than most of his victims lived obviously. And--"

And he was a vicious criminal who killed people in cold blood and so now he ends up by getting killed in cold blood in prison. I don't know who killed them, really. I'm kind of surprised that there would still be this kind of up feeling about him are in organized crime. Most of the people that he -- that he double-crossed are either out and fairly old and, or they're dead. This is -- this is a perfect ending for him, though."

In reality, as we get pushed towards greater levels of vitriol and greater levels of emotion we want to defeat the enemy until they are crushed, until we went completely. But in reality, that's a shortsighted view. There's going to be at tomorrow. There's going to be a next week. You have to deal with the people who were your opposition. And in many ways, it's that balance. The Federalist papers the design of the United States is designed for that and I've seen it in conflict as well. We really need leaders who are mature enough to see a middle growth."

And when we look at that comparison like Boss Tweed and Margaret Thatcher, what we're really doing is exploring why they would emerge as leaders, and what we find is they're not two-dimensional caricatures. They're really very rich holistic flawed people and that's what we've got a look at in our leaders now, not only in the leaders we see and we follow, but the leaders we select for the future."

We've had females in school for now. Seventeen more years in young people. There's a generation coming up in Afghanistan. They won't tolerate the foolishness that my generation is actually running in the country. So, I think that there's great hope for the future but there's frustration between now and then."

He hangs up his portrait in the White House. But one the obsessions of Andrew Jackson was bad press. And when I see Donald Trump again, I think over the top like Jackson did and just say fake news to everything. It just gets people like Jarvis, one of Axios or people here at Fox News exercise. Well, who you mad at? Are you mad a network to puts on a panel of five people all who hate you as much, you know, as a hate you a lot? Or were you mad at people that are reporting news that might not be positive, or you're just mad that these people are not on your side. So what Jackson did which I thought was appropriate, then Jackson which is clip the newspaper articles. And when he saw them he'd say hey, what's to deal with you. And we even have a picture he used to bind the, put them in binder. He was obsessed with it. And he keeps these binders right by his chair and those of the binder stayed back to he used to keep up until the day he died."

Or he would write it back and flip it over and mail it back to them, and said fix this, you got it wrong. He hired his own White House new service and he said call the White House news. If he like the reporters he hired that reporter and he says, now I want to tell the stories the way I want it. I mean, Donald Trump might try to do that but that's why he's not the first. I was reading Bush 41. He was upset every day about the way the press was treating. It's not unusual. It's just that this, I think the president makes things worse by being so aggressive in the retort."

The Clintons complained about the press so they were all over them all the time, so certainly that's not new. But I think, you know, the term \"enemy of the people,\" obviously gets people riled up, but you know, the president doesn't ever hesitate to use it. He thinks it works for him."

When he goes to his people they both go to big crowds and explain the story. That's why they both were successful. And keep in mind for Trump haters, Jackson was just as powerful after he left the White House than when he was in the White House because everyone come to him for advice and try to get some power.
