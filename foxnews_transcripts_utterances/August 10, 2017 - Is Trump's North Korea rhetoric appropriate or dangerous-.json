      "sentences": "I think we've seen diplomacy, certainly, for at least a generation now, and that hasn't work in placating them. What we're seeing now, of course, is Donald Trump using their language. So when you're thinking about either business negotiations or political diplomacy, it's about making sure you're speaking in a manner that your counterpart is going to understand. And they would understand the fire and fury comment I think more than anything else. And I can allay your fears a little bit about how Kim Jong-un might respond to that. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal noted that the threat was unusually specific to Anderson Air Force Base at Guam. They've always made threats against us but they were vague. This was very specific. Today, the New York Times is reporting that it's changed to attacking the waters. And that's a very different dynamic than in fact specifically targeting American military and, of course, the American citizens on Guam. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, of course, none of that is acceptable because once you've got the missiles going, we're going to have to respond. When it comes to rhetoric and what the North Koreans would understand, this is the point that had to be made, which is that he is not Obama. He's not Clinton. He's not Bush. That this is different and it's serious, and they have to take it seriously. If Un doesn't understand that, perhaps the people around him do, But China now understands that in fact this will be very different. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

This is different. Now having said that, I work for the delegate from Guam as his military legislative assistant earlier in my career, Robert underwood, he's now the head of the University of Guam. And I talked to him earlier today. And he said we on Guam we're American citizens. We feel like we're being treated like hostages.

These are American citizens who live by our laws who were actually occupied by the Japanese during World War II. I think what would be really useful to point out that this is not just some island out in the middle of nowhere. These are Americans. This is American territory, American citizens. And I think that rhetoric -- imagine if it was your state. Imagine if he said, go ahead, hit California. See what happens to you next. Not good. Now having said that, the one thing I want to add, Tammy, to your analysis is we're best when we're united. When the United States present a united front around the world, that's when we're strongest. When we have the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, John McCain, and the ranking member of the Senate foreign relation committee, Ben Cardin, openly critical of how the president is handling that, not good. I would have love to see diplomacy right here at home with President Trump reaching out to Congress forming that unified front as they did in the U.N. and then present it to the world.",

And Mitch McConnell I think is a huge mistake, just politically, speaking in front of a rotary group, kind of slamming the president when he doesn't know really how to handle this. When the fact is President Trump is the president for a reason, a Q poll indicates that the Congress has a 10 percent approval rating. Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are around 87 percent disapproving. So when it comes to how Americans are viewing what's going on, Congress is not winning here. And the president I think is actually literally giving him another chance. And look, Newt Gingrich resigned when his approval rating was at about 30 percent. So when you are at 10 percent, maybe there should be some automatic combustion or something. But there really is a point where you have to admit that you failed, that you've done something wrong, and not resign from your positions, but step down from leadership to give people another chance. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Spieles worked for the Democratic Party-affiliated group Harrisonburg Votes and was being paid to register as many people as possible. But Spieles was caught when the city's registrar recognized that one of this so called registered voters submitted by him was actually dead.

When these stories, may happen at both sides, are then taken up by state legislatures who then try to suppress votes through illegal voter I.D. lost like what happened in North Carolina, which the Supreme Court said that was illegal, that's the problem. In other words, you take the stories and you say we should crackdown voter fraud. You don't take these stories and say, so let's deliberately disenfranchise African-American or students or other groups against the constitution.

This is also a guy who's not afraid to buck leadership because we saw that with President Obama over the Iran deal, which is part of the reason why he was relieved of his duties at central command."

And she's a political independent who was worked on campaigns for both Republicans and Democrats, a New York Times bestselling author, and is an independent conservative after years of work as a community organizer on the left, she specializes in the psychology of politics, I like that, very, very interesting. So Tammy, what is your take on all of this? The fire and fury, people are concerned that it might be giving Kim Jong-un some ideas."

    {
      "speaker": "TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think we've seen diplomacy, certainly, for at least a generation now, and that hasn't work in placating them. What we're seeing now, of course, is Donald Trump using their language. So when you're thinking about either business negotiations or political diplomacy, it's about making sure you're speaking in a manner that your counterpart is going to understand. And they would understand the fire and fury comment I think more than anything else. And I can allay your fears a little bit about how Kim Jong-un might respond to that. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal noted that the threat was unusually specific to Anderson Air Force Base at Guam. They've always made threats against us but they were vague. This was very specific. Today, the New York Times is reporting that it's changed to attacking the waters. And that's a very different dynamic than in fact specifically targeting American military and, of course, the American citizens on Guam. Now, of course, none of that is acceptable because once you've got the missiles going, we're going to have to respond. When it comes to rhetoric and what the North Koreans would understand, this is the point that had to be made, which is that he is not Obama. He's not Clinton. He's not Bush. That this is different and it's serious, and they have to take it seriously. If Un doesn't understand that, perhaps the people around him do, But China now understands that in fact this will be very different."

      "utterance": "Well, it's very troubling. I mean, let's be serious about this. These are real people's lives, including Americans lives. And I'm reminded of the missile of October, the missiles crisis that President Kennedy face. This is serious, serious stuff. So I'm trying very hard not to turn this into a political tit for tat. This is different. Now having said that, I work for the delegate from Guam as his military legislative assistant earlier in my career, Robert underwood, he's now the head of the University of Guam. And I talked to him earlier today. And he said we on Guam we're American citizens. We feel like we're being treated like hostages. We're being threatened essentially by both sides. When President Trump says go ahead, let's see what you've got. These are American citizens who live by our laws who were actually occupied by the Japanese during World War II. I think what would be really useful to point out that this is not just some island out in the middle of nowhere. These are Americans. This is American territory, American citizens. And I think that rhetoric -- imagine if it was your state. Imagine if he said, go ahead, hit California. See what happens to you next. Not good. Now having said that, the one thing I want to add, Tammy, to your analysis is we're best when we're united. When the United States present a united front around the world, that's when we're strongest. When we have the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, John McCain, and the ranking member of the Senate foreign relation committee, Ben Cardin, openly critical of how the president is handling that, not good. I would have love to see diplomacy right here at home with President Trump reaching out to Congress forming that unified front as they did in the U.N. and then present it to the world."

As much as the Democrats have loved diplomacy which has not worked, there are tough, tough things we can do with China in terms of trade. The U.N. agreement over the weekend does not touch oil imported into North Korea from China, refined products. It doesn't really address a lot of the foreign slave workers that are overseas."

The sanctioning of the Chinese Bank. I mean, President Trump has taken diplomatic and economic actions as well that are very positive, and trying to push back against North Korea.

You're hearing comments from Secretary Tillerson and Mattis. And so, one thing President Trump said even during the campaign and recently is he doesn't want to telegraph exactly what we're going to do, but there has to be a verbal response to the North Koreans because that's what they do understand. At the same time, the Chinese know a very specific dynamic like the THAAD system in South Korea. That has a powerful radar. There're concerns that could see into China. They're also worried about massive refugee problems on their border. A few months ago they moved tens of thousands of troops to the North Korean border. And if you have a unified Korea, they know that that means the United States will be on their border, so this is what China is concerned about."

And even, Mike -- to your point, Tammy, Mike Pompeo said in the Aspen Security Forum this would have been in July. He was talking about separating. If you want to call it regime change, call it that. He was talking about separating Kim Jong-un from his missiles. It would be a great thing to denuclearize the peninsula, to get those weapon off of that, but the thing that is most dangerous about it is the character who holds the control over them today.

And Donald Trump, I think, I think, I mean it's hard for me to tell. I think he's trying to show the Chinese that this time he's serious about cracking down on trade, about cracking down on currency. The Trump card, if you will, that they've always use is North Korea. Now maybe that's a brilliant strategic play. I hope it is for all of our sakes.

This is what -- I think informs the president -- should inform all of us about the nature of the regime, whether or not they're willing to hurt innocent people.

Look, I think that the moment the grand jury was impaneled, every single person who would have been concerned about or is under investigation should have made sure that they had their really nice pajamas on from that day forward, because this is expected. Paul Manafort, Carter Page is under suspicion, of course, Michael Flynn, so this is not surprising. And for the president's attorney to chime in this way, I think the more significant charges that they took privileged and confidential information that he'd worked on with his lawyer. Remember, this was the day after he spoke to the Senate committee, which means he would have been preparing a great deal. And a month after, he belatedly filed as a foreign agent. All of this happened within that framework. And also, last point, they had inherited this investigation from U.S. attorneys. So this wasn't from the beginning. So, in a lot of ways, are acting on an investigation that had already developed the information that I think that they felt they needed to move on."

I think that's clear, a lot of them are Clinton lawyers and those sort of things. However, when it's something this extreme, you have to stop and think, OK, probably maybe he did something that had never been done before.

Now, I will point out that when my former boss, President Clinton, was being investigated by a special prosecutor. The whole Monica Lewinsky scandal grew out of that, and he was investigating something completely different.

When the fact is President Trump is the president for a reason, a Q poll indicates that the Congress has a 10 percent approval rating. Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are around 87 percent disapproving. So when it comes to how Americans are viewing what's going on, Congress is not winning here. And the president I think is actually literally giving him another chance. And look, Newt Gingrich resigned when his approval rating was at about 30 percent. So when you are at 10 percent, maybe there should be some automatic combustion or something. But there really is a point where you have to admit that you failed, that you've done something wrong, and not resign from your positions, but step down from leadership to give people another chance."

But the fact is, they were supposed to get the job done. And this is rocketed. And Donald Trump also had the senators over the White House. He was talking to everybody. And what was shocking of course -- and we have to look at this. I don't think it was a failure of Mitch McConnell. I think it's exactly what he wanted."

And then this bill that they came out with was essentially an assurance company bailout. That's not a conservative thing. So we've been arguing at that point? That they were too afraid to do what they said that were going to do all along."

The 2012 terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, of course, resulted in the death of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador, Chris Stevens. D.C. District Court Judge, Amit Mehta rolling that the State Department has not fulfilled its duty and properly searching for all relevant documents that Clinton may have gotten from or sent to her top aides including Huma Abedin.

Now, you'll have to forgive me for the irony that while we have a President under investigation by a special prosecutor was still talking about Benghazi. It's like the White Whale in \"Moby-Dick\". They can't get enough to this stuff. OK. Produce the documents, I don't care. I mean that's what's supposed to happen. And while we're at it, let's let Mr. Mueller and the special prosecutor's team do their job, too. It's got to be the same treatment on both sides. If you love the investigation of Hillary Clinton and you think they ought to follow the law, then you should say exactly the same thing about the FBI and Mueller and Trump, because they are all part of the same thing. We are a nation of laws. And then look around the world, most people live at the opposite end of a gun being pointed at them, and that's how they view their government. At least in this country, we are a nation of laws and I say, let it go forward."

And if the State Department couldn't even come through its own state.gov records for these e-mails, it is shameful that this has not happened. And the loved ones of those four individuals, they deserve every lead to be turned over. And that's what it boils down to, because they were lied to. They were lied to from day one about what really happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "And that's the big problem here. It's that, this wasn't just like what we think there's more. We know of all -- when they got their first order, they only looked at Hillary server and outside e-mails. They did not look through their own .gov accounts for Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan e-mails that they had immediate access, too, that were live in their system. And this becomes then the real story, that there was -- with this part of a cover-up? Or is it the same civil servants that chose to not to look? And I agree that we're nation of laws. But nobody was prosecuting those laws for the last eight years. And now suddenly, the law really matters, and I'm glad. And that's why President Trump is the President. But we have to look at who made the choice to not look, and again, by default, perhaps to cover up, and are they still there, are they still making decisions? And this comes down to President Trump. When are you going to deal with these holdovers when it comes to how we get work done and whether or not this kind of absurdity is going to continue so many years afterwards with American family still waiting for justice?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "And I also look at this from the lens of a double standard and the coverage, because here with Benghazi, we had four Americans that were killed, we had an administration that was intentionally dishonest with us. Just after they said that, al-Qaeda was on the run, two months before in election, they told us one thing, Hillary Clinton was e-mailing her daughter something different, telling the Egyptian Prime Minister something different, the Libyan President something different, yet telling the families of those four dead Americans something entirely different. We have an administration that lie to us, yet you look at the breathless coverage of the Russian investigation with President Trump, where nobody has died. Some four people died and there's a complete double standard in the interests of the media and the way that that was covered in the way that the Russia investigator --"

      "utterance": "A college student in Virginia is going to the slammer for, wait for it, registering dead people to vote for Democrats, 21-year-old Andrew Spieles, a student at James Madison University in Virginia, was sentenced to 100 days in the big house for fraudulently registering deceased citizens among others to vote leading up to the 2016 election. Spieles worked for the Democratic Party-affiliated group Harrisonburg Votes and was being paid to register as many people as possible. But Spieles was caught when the city's registrar recognized that one of this so called registered voters submitted by him was actually dead. Voter fraud commissioned by President Trump is ridiculed from the left, but there you go, David?"

    {
      "speaker": "GOODFRIEND",
      "utterance": "Yes, it happens all over the place. When we had a former Colorado GOP chair who cast a vote for his dead wife, he got in trouble. We had in Miami, a ballot stuffing scandal by Republicans. We had a Trump voter in Iowa who voted twice and explained to authorities that that's because the system is rigged. Here is the problem. When these stories, may happen at both sides, are then taken up by state legislatures who then try to suppress votes through illegal voter I.D. lost like what happened in North Carolina, which the Supreme Court said that was illegal, that's the problem. In other words, you take the stories and you say we should crackdown voter fraud. You don't take these stories and say, so let's deliberately disenfranchise African-American or students or other groups against the constitution. And which is unfortunately what happens a lot of times with the stories."
