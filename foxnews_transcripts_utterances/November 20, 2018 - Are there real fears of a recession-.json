It could certainly be argued that you can draw a direct line from Gary Hart's alleged affair with Donna Rice through Bill Clinton's with Monica Lewinsky to Donald Trump's denial of an affair with Stormy Daniels and his boast about grabbing women. If there was ever a bar for the personal behavior of presidential hopefuls, it perhaps began to be lowered when Gary Hart, the Democratic front runner in 1987 was photographed late in the evening at his D.C. townhouse with a woman who was not his wife. That woman, Donna Rice, then 29-year-old model had apparently met Hart famously on a yacht named monkey business. And after photographs of the two together were published in the Miami Herald, Hart was asked whether he had ever committed adultery. His reply, \"I don't have to answer that.\" But days later, Hart suspended his campaign saying he'd, quote, \"made some mistakes\" and while not admitting to an affair in the immediate aftermath, the discussion was all about Hart's behavior. As Time magazine memorably put it, quote, \"He denied there was anything improper about his friendship with Donna Rice even though it is far from customary for 50-year-old men to spend weekends away from their wives hanging out with commonly actresses who have appeared on Miami Vice.\" Since then, the actions of the Miami Herald in staging the initial stake out to capture photos of Hart and Rice have been questioned while the media coverage of the sex lives of politicians has become ever more intense.",

And we went to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and we ask them to sign it. Trump signed it and Hillary Clinton sent a letter of support. And to make sure to defend and protect children from sexual exploitation in the digital world by enforcing the existing federal laws.

I read tweet all the time, but this is the first tweet I've ever written. I'm a veteran, I love America, I'm going to kill myself tonight. I have lost everything, I have nobody. Nobody cares. I'm in a parking lot with my dog and everything I own. Bye.\" His tweet was answered almost immediately by actor James Woods, who wrote, \"Tell me where you are.\" Followed by this, \"Think about this. A lot of vets I understand have come to where you are tonight and if you can just push this decision off tonight at least maybe you would inspire another vet to seek help. You can save another man too by waiting to do this.\" We got in touch with the local police where we eventually found him. He is now safe and unharmed, and he does not wish to be contacted. He is safe, as we know, tonight. This story strikes a nerve with a lot of people including our friend Karl Rove, who has been in a similar situation with his own family. He recently wrote an op-ed entitled \"My mom's suicide was preventable.\" And Karl joins me now with his untold story. Karl, good to have you here tonight.",

She lost her home, she lost what little money she had. She came to a rough time in her life and, my sister, my little sister, who was very close to her, they had a meal and friends had rallied. And somebody said here is a place where you can live, and somebody said, well, I've got a used car you are welcome to have. There is a feeling, you know, of optimism about being able to come out of this, and the next day, she committed suicide. And it's a reminder that this is, if you talk about it, and if you, if people are going through a rough patch like that or if they are abusing alcohol and drugs and the intense, sort of abrupt relationships where they are erratic and particularly aggressive, there are lots of signs of people who are contemplating this, and the best and talking about this. A lot of people talk about it and nobody asked. But the most important thing we need to do is remove the stigma of saying I am in a very dark place and I need help. And my mother was not able to ask for help or seek help, but that was a different time. I mean, today, perhaps she would not have died because somebody might have identified it. A lot of people can be help with their depression, their bipolar condition with drugs. But it's something that touches far more people than most Americans imagine. After I wrote that piece in June, I cannot tell you for the next five or six weeks I'd be traveling through an airport and somebody would come up to me and say, thanks for writing about it. I had a suicide in my family. My brother committed suicide, my mother, my father. And we, as a society, really need to focus on those because these are -- these are -- I mean, every life is precious. And the loss of life that we see in suicides, like veterans. Veterans commit suicide at about a rate half as large as the rest of America. So, if people want to do something about it, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has an excellent web site. There is also great information on the web site of the National Suicide Lifeline. God bless James Woods. Happy Thanksgiving to him.",

Prompt with some knowledge at the top, whether it was a crown prince or not, we don't know for certain. And it's going to be a long road back for them. But we do need them in the region, and I think we should point out that some of the people that are pushing on the other side. Iran got rid of an FBI agent, murdering an FBI agent, right? Has put IEDs out there that blow up American servicemen. I mean, there's Erdogan's put a lot of people in jail, and so forth. So, there are a lot of bad people out there. And they have to what -- I think what we need is a Nixon moment at which we had after Tiananmen Square when President Nixon went over to China and said, you guys screwed up badly.

And yet, you've got the Democrats ACLU running to the courts when they have no alternative or no plan B for what we're supposed to do with these people coming towards the U.S. border. So, it defaults to the president to have to deal with this. Now, of course, we're going to litigate it. So, I think the president is on pretty firm ground there."

Said I'm going to think about it over Thanksgiving. I don't know what happened behind closed doors. But now, she has decided that she is not going to challenge Nancy Pelosi. Do you think they made some kind of deal? Look, I always thought Nancy Pelosi was going to -- was going to win this with experience. She didn't get to the top by, by being weak. And the problem they had is they never had someone in the first place. What the Democrats wanted to do was have her step down, and then they would go in. But it tells you that they're afraid of her to go through. So, what she was going to do is look at how many votes she needed, whipped the count, find out how many votes she was short. And then, make whatever deal she needed to make. What's interesting is about the latest objections most of the people in the beginning that said I'm not going to support her for speaker where people like Conor Lamb from Pennsylvania, campaigning as a moderate. But some of the complaints are now coming from the Democratic Left about Mrs. Pelosi. So, it will be interesting. But I think, if I had to bet my House, I would bet it on Mrs. Pelosi."

      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, first of all, I don't think we really know what -- what's gone on there. But I think it would be sort of red meat for his adversaries if he if he tries to do that. So, I don't know. I think, again, it's kind of -- I think right now, what's happening is both sides are sort of staking out their territory. And -- you know, there's a question about whether they're going to be able to work together. And I think if the Democrats decide that this is going to be all-out war we're not going to let him achieve anything. I think that, that is going to be a tactical and a strategic error on their part. Because people elected them, they don't like Donald Trump. I agree with that, but they really want some answers on things like health care, and the stagnation of wages which is partly caused by the high cost of health care. And I think also the immigration problem."

      "utterance": "Yes, and I think that's probably right that there is no collusion, yet. Recall that last week, the president in a tweet storm attacked and really assaulted Robert Mueller and his investigation. I think that kind of puts pressure on Mueller to sort of come up with something other than try to withdrawing from this, as many people think they should wind it down.

A trade war is not good for the economy. In fact, it's really horrible. But I do think the other policies in this administration are great and I think trade will turn out to be good. The tax cuts are the best I've seen in first term of any president. The deregulation is phenomenal, I think Powell at the Fed is doing a great job --"

    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "No, you've got to have the market rate set by the market not by some Fed Chairman, frankly. And at 20 percent interest rates which we had when we came into office, that's way too high it killed the housing market.  When the rates are too low, it kills the funds going into the housing market. We had the eight worst years in new housing starts per 10,000 population in the last eight years, it was just terrible. And we need to have markets rate set by the market, not by the Fed. And I think that's a great move what Powell is doing, moving the back up to normal. That's the way it should be done. But the rest of the policies, I mean, Martha, seriously, there's nothing out there that I see that would cause this economy to move into a recession or a depression or anything else. I think Larry Kudlow is exactly correct on this. And I just hope the trade stuff moves faster and we get a free trade deal right away. I mean the -- President has told me personally he doesn't want to use tariffs. That's the only leverage he has to get them to negotiate and cut tariffs and cut barriers. But Austan is completely correct that a trade war would be catastrophic."

This -- the tax cut has been in place starting January 1, 2018. The stock market is down since the -- since the tax cut came into effect.

This is the problem with blanket statements each of these cases are individual, each circumstance is unique and each needs to be treated as such. Each accuser and accused deserves to have the opportunity to tell their side of the story. That is how our system of justice works in this country. Now, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is demanding after a year of studying how these cases have been handled on college campuses across this country, under strict rules that were imposed on them by the Obama administration that there was a lack of justice in the way they were often carried out.  In many cases, young men were rightfully punished and kicked out of school and the women who accused them were vindicated. In others though, young men were kicked out after a sham hearing in which they were not even allowed to see the evidence against them, in some cases, they were not permitted to have a lawyer present with them during the proceedings while they were interrogating by a panel of three professors who were chosen by the school.

I mean, it -- you know there was a problem, and the problem was there were situations and instances where young women were getting sexually assaulted and maybe it was a high-profile athlete or someone like that at a college campus and it got pushed under the rug and certainly that's happened. The response was to create imaginary epidemic or an imaginary crisis that existed were statistics of one in five and one in four the women in college are being sexually assaulted which are just -- it's lunacy.

And in 15 minutes they canceled school, so I just hung around school helping out because the fire is on the east side of town, I didn't think there would be any rush for me to get out.

His downfall the first of many that we have seen since then. My next guest was the woman at the center of that story and she has decided to step back into the spotlight tonight.

It could certainly be argued that you can draw a direct line from Gary Hart's alleged affair with Donna Rice through Bill Clinton's with Monica Lewinsky to Donald Trump's denial of an affair with Stormy Daniels and his boast about grabbing women. If there was ever a bar for the personal behavior of presidential hopefuls, it perhaps began to be lowered when Gary Hart, the Democratic front runner in 1987 was photographed late in the evening at his D.C. townhouse with a woman who was not his wife. That woman, Donna Rice, then 29-year-old model had apparently met Hart famously on a yacht named monkey business. And after photographs of the two together were published in the Miami Herald, Hart was asked whether he had ever committed adultery. His reply, \"I don't have to answer that.\" But days later, Hart suspended his campaign saying he'd, quote, \"made some mistakes\" and while not admitting to an affair in the immediate aftermath, the discussion was all about Hart's behavior. As Time magazine memorably put it, quote, \"He denied there was anything improper about his friendship with Donna Rice even though it is far from customary for 50-year-old men to spend weekends away from their wives hanging out with commonly actresses who have appeared on Miami Vice.\" Since then, the actions of the Miami Herald in staging the initial stake out to capture photos of Hart and Rice have been questioned while the media coverage of the sex lives of politicians has become ever more intense."

And it was mine and it lasted for about 15 months. But really, by the grace of God I returned back to my Christian faith and decided to take the high road. I went underground almost seven years and little did I know I would actually be using the pain of my own sexual exploitation and abuse and even a date rape when I was 22 years old and be fighting to protect the dignity and safety of children and young women now in the digital world. Because like, one of your previous guests just said, even, you know, rape on campuses and by all is women, is at an all-time high. And in fact, Martha, two years ago right before the election, we actually issued the first ever children's internet safety presidential pledge. And we went to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and we ask them to sign it. Trump signed it and Hillary Clinton sent a letter of support. And to make sure to defend and protect children from sexual exploitation in the digital world by enforcing the existing federal laws. So, now we've got a first-time president, our president for the first time in history that has agreed to do that and now we are looking at our new A.G. appointment and we have got to get to the obscenity laws enforced. They have not been enforced since John Ashcroft."

And it's a reminder that this is, if you talk about it, and if you, if people are going through a rough patch like that or if they are abusing alcohol and drugs and the intense, sort of abrupt relationships where they are erratic and particularly aggressive, there are lots of signs of people who are contemplating this, and the best and talking about this. A lot of people talk about it and nobody asked. But the most important thing we need to do is remove the stigma of saying I am in a very dark place and I need help. And my mother was not able to ask for help or seek help, but that was a different time. I mean, today, perhaps she would not have died because somebody might have identified it. A lot of people can be help with their depression, their bipolar condition with drugs. But it's something that touches far more people than most Americans imagine. After I wrote that piece in June, I cannot tell you for the next five or six weeks I'd be traveling through an airport and somebody would come up to me and say, thanks for writing about it. I had a suicide in my family. My brother committed suicide, my mother, my father. And we, as a society, really need to focus on those because these are -- these are -- I mean, every life is precious. And the loss of life that we see in suicides, like veterans. Veterans commit suicide at about a rate half as large as the rest of America. So, if people want to do something about it, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has an excellent web site. There is also great information on the web site of the National Suicide Lifeline. God bless James Woods. Happy Thanksgiving to him."
