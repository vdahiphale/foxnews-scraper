It's true. You don't have to clap. He can't hear you. According to the latest Harvard Harris Poll, Trump rose to 80 -- 48 percent, Biden dropped to 46. How is Biden even at 46? In a normal world he'd be at two percent just ahead of losing your home in a tornado. Yes. There's a lot of things more popular than Joe Biden. Tinnitus, painful rectal itch. Kamala Harris. But I repeat myself. It's true. Harris is doing better than Joe in nationwide polling, which is easy to explain. She's doing nothing. He's doing something. And research shows the less illiberal actually works, the more popular they are. It's because when they do work, they destroy things. They're like a bull in a China shop. One that Joe and Hunter are probably silent partners in. Except they're more like rats in a sinking ship. Or maybe they're snakes in the grass. Or perhaps they're --",

Watching reruns of Matlock. Drinking a juice box and waiting for the transfusion. Those were the days when Joe only came outside just once to predict six more weeks of winter. But then he won and had to get to work. And since then, it's been a groundhog day of policy failures, gaffes and catastrophes. So they loaded Joe up with Prevagen and relief factor. And they -- and they pointed him to the White House, where after eight attempts he found the entrance. And got to work and boy, was that a bad idea? Have you checked America 2021 under Joe? It's now a strangely hobbled, chaotic mess. In short, Biden remade the country in the image of himself. It's true, the country's just two weeks away from getting hair plugs. The decline reflects his own consistent decline. It's sad, he's falling apart faster than a whopper you're trying to eat while driving. Yet he claims he has things under control. Like he had Afghanistan under control, like he had the pandemic under control, like he has his bladder under control. Now, the only thing under control is Joe controlled by whom? Well, let's talk about murder. Homicides have risen 30 percent in 2020. The biggest rise since national records began in 1960. You know, the same time Julie was born. We're witnessing -- we're witnessing the biggest spike in 60 years. It's like Back to the Future except that DeLorean can't afford the gas. But that's not how the media reports it. NBC claims that crime is actually falling faster than CNN ratings. How do they get to that idiotic place? Have they been dining with Don Lemon?",

Anyway, they base this drop in crime on a report by a left-wing think tank which deceptively combined seven different types of crime coming up with an overall crime number which NBC embraced like an unpaid intern at a hot tub party. Shout out to Matt Lauer. Because thefts are four times more frequent than violent crimes. The overall number hides the rise of violent crime in cities. They're cutting violent crime numbers with non-violent crime numbers. The way a coke dealer would cut his product with powdered laxatives. What did that ruin a few dates back in the 90s? In fact, sorry, the NBC is reporting is like telling a mugging victim to cheer up because male fraud is slightly down. So why would they do that? Well, the spike in murder follow the unrest after George Floyd's killing unrest that was cheered on by the media. They chose not to report on the riots, the looting and arson because it would taint the narrative of a greater American oppression, in effect we deserve the assaults. But now the data implicates the media and the Dems who let their cities descend into mayhem. In a perfect world, Jeff Zucker would be sharing a cell with Nancy Pelosi. I wonder what the angry black male thinks.",

It makes me so mad, I just want to run home to my birthing person. In 1993, Ginsburg wrote the decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman's life, to her well-being. When government controls that decision for her she's being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices. But the ACLU deleted every single womanly reference and female pronoun, \"The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a person's life to their well-being.\" When the government controls that decision for people. Meanwhile, the ACLU social media team is brainstorming even more tweeted deletions to come. Focusing only on pop music, like the classic Helen Reddy song I am person. It's really -- it's really a jam. And Cindy Lauper's Non-Cisgendered Humans Just Want To Have Fun. And what about Frankie Valli's Big Non-Binaries Don't Cry?

Yet, they wanted more not fewer restrictions, even though they had a greater chance of getting run over at the protest than they did succumbing to the Coronavirus. That protest is more upside down than Joe Biden on a flight of stairs. College kids have come a long way from the free speech protests of the 60s. Back then, they burn bras now they wear them on their faces. About 50 students laid on the ground while others do chalk outlines around them, which is how they play hopscotch in Chicago. It's so tasteless, it's so tasteless, you'll think you have COVID. And here's the best part he was organized by Campaign to Organize Graduate Students or COGS. Finally, an accurate acronym, because only cogs would chant this. What do we want? Mask mandates. When do we want it? Now. And if we don't get it, shut it down. Now it could be that they really do fear for their health, but it could also be they're just really ugly and a mask increases their chances for dates. I did that when I was young.

Not one of you, no one out that door. It takes one sentence and there's no more ground. The carpet has been pulled. It's not just me that this has happened to, it's happened to a lot of people.\" Depp, of course, was referring to his public legal battle with his ex, Amber Heard, in which they both accuse each other of domestic violence. The count basically ruled in favor of court actually by tossing a Debs libel suit. I made no sense and I don't care. So, it's canceled culture as bad for Johnny Depp as it is for any ordinary slap. He has piles of money for lawyers and influential friends to support him. And although he lost a few acting gigs, he still has his castle. Perhaps, if he broadened his concern about this house this hard left McCarthyism to include the victims who aren't weirdos who own chocolate factories, then we feel bad for him.

It's true. You don't have to clap. He can't hear you. According to the latest Harvard Harris Poll, Trump rose to 80 -- 48 percent, Biden dropped to 46. How is Biden even at 46? In a normal world he'd be at two percent just ahead of losing your home in a tornado. Yes. There's a lot of things more popular than Joe Biden. Tinnitus, painful rectal itch. Kamala Harris. But I repeat myself. It's true. Harris is doing better than Joe in nationwide polling, which is easy to explain. She's doing nothing. He's doing something. And research shows the less illiberal actually works, the more popular they are. It's because when they do work, they destroy things. They're like a bull in a China shop. One that Joe and Hunter are probably silent partners in. Except they're more like rats in a sinking ship. Or maybe they're snakes in the grass. Or perhaps they're --"

      "utterance": "That's a new system we're testing out. I think it works. Which brings us to Joe. Remember how beloved he was when he was chained to a radiator in a basement? Watching reruns of Matlock. Drinking a juice box and waiting for the transfusion. Those were the days when Joe only came outside just once to predict six more weeks of winter. But then he won and had to get to work. And since then, it's been a groundhog day of policy failures, gaffes and catastrophes. So they loaded Joe up with Prevagen and relief factor. And they -- and they pointed him to the White House, where after eight attempts he found the entrance. And got to work and boy, was that a bad idea? Have you checked America 2021 under Joe? It's now a strangely hobbled, chaotic mess. In short, Biden remade the country in the image of himself. It's true, the country's just two weeks away from getting hair plugs. The decline reflects his own consistent decline. It's sad, he's falling apart faster than a whopper you're trying to eat while driving. Yet he claims he has things under control. Like he had Afghanistan under control, like he had the pandemic under control, like he has his bladder under control. Now, the only thing under control is Joe controlled by whom? Well, let's talk about murder. Homicides have risen 30 percent in 2020. The biggest rise since national records began in 1960. You know, the same time Julie was born. We're witnessing -- we're witnessing the biggest spike in 60 years. It's like Back to the Future except that DeLorean can't afford the gas. But that's not how the media reports it. NBC claims that crime is actually falling faster than CNN ratings. How do they get to that idiotic place? Have they been dining with Don Lemon?"

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, you know what, Don enjoys any meal without Brian Stelter under the table begging for scraps. Anyway, they base this drop in crime on a report by a left-wing think tank which deceptively combined seven different types of crime coming up with an overall crime number which NBC embraced like an unpaid intern at a hot tub party. Shout out to Matt Lauer. Because thefts are four times more frequent than violent crimes. The overall number hides the rise of violent crime in cities. They're cutting violent crime numbers with non-violent crime numbers. The way a coke dealer would cut his product with powdered laxatives. What did that ruin a few dates back in the 90s? In fact, sorry, the NBC is reporting is like telling a mugging victim to cheer up because male fraud is slightly down. So why would they do that? Well, the spike in murder follow the unrest after George Floyd's killing unrest that was cheered on by the media. They chose not to report on the riots, the looting and arson because it would taint the narrative of a greater American oppression, in effect we deserve the assaults. But now the data implicates the media and the Dems who let their cities descend into mayhem. In a perfect world, Jeff Zucker would be sharing a cell with Nancy Pelosi. I wonder what the angry black male thinks."

And we're all getting splattered with the blood. And that's what is controlling Joe and ideology. He doesn't even understand. Joe is now unpopular because we can all see what many of us saw a year ago, like one of Hunter's dates. This was just a trick. America was fooled into thinking he was as middle of the road as a squashed possum. But in fact, he was an empty vessel like a newborn child's mind whose parents could fill with good or evil values.

In doing so they erased an entire gender. She fought so valiantly for. Rendering her quote, as toothless as the Real Housewives of Appalachia. It makes me so mad, I just want to run home to my birthing person. In 1993, Ginsburg wrote the decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman's life, to her well-being. When government controls that decision for her she's being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices. But the ACLU deleted every single womanly reference and female pronoun, \"The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a person's life to their well-being.\" When the government controls that decision for people. Meanwhile, the ACLU social media team is brainstorming even more tweeted deletions to come. Focusing only on pop music, like the classic Helen Reddy song I am person. It's really -- it's really a jam. And Cindy Lauper's Non-Cisgendered Humans Just Want To Have Fun. And what about Frankie Valli's Big Non-Binaries Don't Cry?

Yet, they wanted more not fewer restrictions, even though they had a greater chance of getting run over at the protest than they did succumbing to the Coronavirus. That protest is more upside down than Joe Biden on a flight of stairs. College kids have come a long way from the free speech protests of the 60s. Back then, they burn bras now they wear them on their faces. About 50 students laid on the ground while others do chalk outlines around them, which is how they play hopscotch in Chicago. It's so tasteless, it's so tasteless, you'll think you have COVID. And here's the best part he was organized by Campaign to Organize Graduate Students or COGS. Finally, an accurate acronym, because only cogs would chant this. What do we want? Mask mandates. When do we want it? Now. And if we don't get it, shut it down. Now it could be that they really do fear for their health, but it could also be they're just really ugly and a mask increases their chances for dates. I did that when I was young. But while our college kids are falling apart charter schools are rising in popularity enrollment has increased nationally by seven percent over the last 18 months.

The one of the things that Johnny Depp he's a lovely actor and I mean you know, I agree I don't think everybody's life should just be destroyed even for something like this. But you know, the one lesson from Johnny Depp is you never sue for libel. We learned all sorts of things in court about both him and Amber Heard or embittered, as he called her it turned out because it turned out that both of them accused the other of deprecating in the bed right in Britain we go to the bathroom and we'll think this was very strange behavior. And it's just -- were funny like. They were very proper, and so that went down badly and, and, and, you know, literally they ended up airing their dirty linen in public."

When you have liberals in Hollywood that are saying speaking out against cancel culture, you know, maybe this is not the right thing to do. Look, this is America you don't want to watch Fox, you don't want to watch another channel, you can change the channel, you have a choice, and we can do that. I don't agree with these boycotts and look, I'm glad some of these celebrities are speaking out against, against campus culture. It's something we've been feeling for a long time.

I'm grateful we don't have to do it ourselves, it's a dream come true. I'm not complaining but on the weekends. I don't wear any makeup. I have my glasses on. I have my hair up in a bun. I don't have to wash my hair if I don't want to. I'm in sweatpants. And I love it. So if this is sexy, and I can wear these mittens and be warm and cozy coat or maybe a snuggie, I'm OK with it --"

And so, I only noticed that every year at Halloween, a whole set of Americans get canceled for life for something they've worn. And I, I sort of think there are probably two options for America at this stage. Either your stay at home on Halloween, and you don't go out, you don't dress as anything. Or you should just go for the nuclear option and have one year where you all go as a village people or something and you just sit and stop it and then everyone can have a great Halloween every year after."
