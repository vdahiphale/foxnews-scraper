We've now come back to this being the official position of the governor of Virginia and, quite frankly, the Democratic Party. This is another example of the Democrats putting themselves outside of the mainstream of America by taking radical positions that are completely out of touch with most Americans. Even a majority of pro-choice Americans find the idea of third trimester abortions abhorrent. A Gallup poll shows that 60 percent of American support first trimester abortions. It drops to 28 percent in the second trimester, third trimester just 13 percent. And I bet you if you ask those Americans if you support the date of birth, it would be almost zero.",

Either the legislature changed or the governor changed. And we saw this on the Republican side back in 2011 going the other way. And so when we talk about the issue and polling on the issue of abortion, this is where we end up. You have about a quarter of Americans who believe there should be no restrictions at all, about a quarter that say there should be no abortions at all, and then the rest of the country says there should be under certain circumstances, there can be restrictions. And so the debate then is always over what does certain circumstances mean. In the battles in 2011 and 2012, Democrats were arguing that Republicans were going above and beyond what should be considered appropriate conditions. Vaginal ultrasounds, which was what was happening in Virginia, that was a controversy a few years ago, right. What should those rules be? Now it's going to be the debate over this. And so I think just as there was a big backlash on the vaginal ultrasound, there will be a backlash on this, and you end up with legislation that may just end up on the margins rather than all the way over. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The bill was defeated, which is important to point out, but this conversation is happening in different state houses around the country about what to do with abortion rights, pro-choice bills. This particular day has brought a lot of reaction. Ben Sasse, Senator, released a statement, \"This is morally repugnant. In just a few years pro- abortion zealots went from safe, legal, and rare, to keep the newborns comfortable while the doctor debates infanticide. I don't care what party you are from. If you can't say that it's wrong to leave babies to die after birth, get the hill out of public office.\" Marco rubio, \"I never thought I would see the day America had government officials who openly support legal infanticide.\" Nikki Haley, \"What is happening in our country? This literally makes me sick to my stomach. Adoption is always an option.\" The Virginia governor's office put out a clarifying statement, saying he did still support the bill but he was talking about a specific part of it. Let's bring in our panel, \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen, Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co-founder and president.

We've now come back to this being the official position of the governor of Virginia and, quite frankly, the Democratic Party. This is another example of the Democrats putting themselves outside of the mainstream of America by taking radical positions that are completely out of touch with most Americans. Even a majority of pro-choice Americans find the idea of third trimester abortions abhorrent. A Gallup poll shows that 60 percent of American support first trimester abortions. It drops to 28 percent in the second trimester, third trimester just 13 percent. And I bet you if you ask those Americans if you support the date of birth, it would be almost zero."

You saw President Trump as candidate really attack Hillary Clinton on this in at least one debate, several times, though, and some people said that was one of his better exchanges with candidate Hillary Clinton. AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": This is also one of these issues, and we are seeing it happening at the state legislative level because we saw a change in power and many of these states, right. Either the legislature changed or the governor changed. And we saw this on the Republican side back in 2011 going the other way. And so when we talk about the issue and polling on the issue of abortion, this is where we end up. You have about a quarter of Americans who believe there should be no restrictions at all, about a quarter that say there should be no abortions at all, and then the rest of the country says there should be under certain circumstances, there can be restrictions. And so the debate then is always over what does certain circumstances mean. In the battles in 2011 and 2012, Democrats were arguing that Republicans were going above and beyond what should be considered appropriate conditions. Vaginal ultrasounds, which was what was happening in Virginia, that was a controversy a few years ago, right. What should those rules be? Now it's going to be the debate over this. And so I think just as there was a big backlash on the vaginal ultrasound, there will be a backlash on this, and you end up with legislation that may just end up on the margins rather than all the way over."

Let's go to abortions should be made available to, and when Amy was talking about this, this is how they break it down. \"Anytime,\" you see first three months, \"Rape, incest, or to save the mother,\" and there you see the breakdown. When do you believe a person's life begins? At conception, 42 percent, and you see the breakdown there and the percentages. Again, this is a recent poll January 8th through the 10th. And then the Supreme Court and abortion, make it legal without restriction, allow states to make certain restrictions, and that's where the majority is. It's a plurality, but go ahead."

Republicans, when they were putting restrictions on abortion, that was a 75 percent position. That Knights of Columbus poll you showed said 75 percent would support abortion only in the first three months, the cases of rape or incest, save the life of the mother, or only to save the life of the mother. So when Republicans are putting reasonable restrictions on abortion, those are things, the 75 percent position. What Democrats are doing are doing a 13 percent or less position, which is saying up until the moment of birth. If you want to see a party that has officially become a party of death, that's it."
