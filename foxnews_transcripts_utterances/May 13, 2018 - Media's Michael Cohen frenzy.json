And why did a top newspaper mentioned a false (inaudible) about her marriage. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" When President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal it was huge global news, front page headlines everywhere. But on CNN and MSNBC that night, the story got bump down the lineup for the latest on Michael Cohen. The New York Times and other outlets confirming that an American company, with strong ties to a Russian oligarch who's been banned from the U.S., had paid the president's personal lawyer $500,000. Cohen also took in millions of dollars from such major corporations as AT&T, Novartis and Korean Aerospace Industry. So, just how much media attention does this deserve? Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Gillian Turner, a Fox News correspondent here in Washington. Mollie Hemingway, senior editor of The Federalist and a Fox News contributor. And Capri Cafaro, a Washington Examiner contributor and former Democratic Senate Leader in Ohio. Julian, these disclosures about Michael Cohen are news, period. But are they more important than the global impact of the president walking away from the Iran nuclear agreement?"

And I ask because I think the answer is so obvious, which is no, they are not more important than U.S. nuclear threats -- the nuclear threat against the United States from Iran and North Korea and the fact that the administration saved three American hostages this week. I think that when it comes to the president pulling out of the Iran deal in particular, the widespread panning from the media was really a reflection of what the policy community was saying in this incidence. And by that I mean, analyst across the board even folks who were initially critical of the deal -- the negotiations as they unfolded said now that we are in the deal it's important we stay in the deal so that the U.S. is perceived as living up to it's word. So I think the media was reflecting that sentiment a expressed by the --"

But let's come back to Cohen as other channels seem do a lot. What does it tell you about the focus of CNN and MSNBC, at least in primetime going wall to wall with the news that the confirmation of the original charges thrown our by Michael Avenatti about Cohen getting $500,000 from this American company with very close ties to this Russian billionaire, Victor Vekselberg, who as it turns out has been questioned by Robert Mueller's office?"

    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, it was interesting that this was one of the things that was highlighted. I think it's actually important to point out right away that we know this information because there was a criminal leak from some government agency. Now, whether the was the special counsel or the Treasury Department, this us just the latest in a tremendous series of criminal leaks. This one lays claim they're going to be investigating. We've had a lot of leaks that haven't been investigated. It's designed to create a narrative and obviously the Russia thing was pulled out. It was an American company actually who paid, the Essential Consulting, and they do have Russian ties and that name that you mentioned has been herd before because that was also the donors of the Clinton Foundation and what not. But there is clearly an attempt to tie this to Russia conspiracy theory, and I thought what was much more interesting this week was the Department of Justice or some other intelligence agency, leaking to the Washington Post what they were suggesting was that they had a mole on the Trump campaign. That's a massive change in a really big important story that has not been getting a lot of coverage."

CAPRI CAFARO, WASHINGTON EXAMINER Well, I think that it deserve coverage but I think the question becomes, what do journalist focus on? It seems the, you know, the CNN and the MSNBCs of the world and other mainstream media have focused more on the salacious side, the building the narrative as Mollie mentioned. There are some serious issues here that I think warrant more scrutiny. One being, would it have been necessary for Michael Cohen to for example be registered lobbyist with the federal government if he's going to represent companies like AT&T --"

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

I'm talking here about these big companies, you know, and so if not - I'm not defending this practice but D.C. is a swampy place. This has gone on for many, many administration. Will you hire someone who is a friend of somebody who is high up in the White House or the president because you were looking for access and somebody that can carry your message?"

So there is no surprise that the press has zeroed in on Michael - of this, you know, revelations about Michael Cohen's lobbying firm called Essential Consultants, strange name. But Essential Consultants, and they are mega million dollars deals with big companies."

Not excusing it at all, but some people is acting just so shocked over it. Let's come back to Michael Avenatti.

I thought the (inaudible) showed that he had a $175 million in free coverage on the various networks and I think it is worth asking like who is this guy? How does he have access to special counsel or Treasury Department documents? Who are his connections? Who's paying for this? We know that ostensibly represents Stormy Daniels. She had said she's not paying him. I think it's worth finding out just a little bit more about this thing that is driving so much of the coverage."

You know, you have a different Michael Cohen who lives in Canada. He's wrong. Ninety-nine percent of it was right. I mean, don't you think that television anchors and reporters need to question him more aggressively rather than just putting him on show after show after show saying OK, what do you got? Come on, what do you got on Trump? What do you got on Stormy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAFARO",

Michael Avenatti is absolutely a self-promoter and I think that they really just want to continue to again, focus on the more salacious aspects of it and there has not been a counterpoint to, you know, what Mollie and others have said. There is no questioning of Michael Avenatti. It's just tell us more dirt and there is no checks and balances, and that's not journalism. And I want to make one other interesting point about Avenatti. I just saw it today in Politico. They just reported that Michael Avenatti had dinner just this weekend in New York with Ronan Farrow, who famously just, you know, took down the New York attorney general. So, I'm sure that wasn't just a friendly visit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, there's been a little question with Michael Avenatti. In my view and often not aggressively enough, I mean it is kind of an imbalance because Michael Cohen is basically not talking so reporters chasing him into a taxi and he said this was inaccurate. His attorney is not out there very much. And then you have another lawyer who seems to let's just say enjoy being on television. He speculated by getting his own show one day. I understand why the media cover him, he's a camera ready guy, but does it seem a little imbalanced to you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "It seems imbalanced. Laura Ingraham made the point in the opener of the show that -- Avenatti is treated sort of like an analyst or a commentator on these programs when in fact he's the representative representing one specific interest in a case. I would just say then isn't it incumbent upon the Trump team to try to counterpoint to that narrative. If he's the lawyer representing Stormy Daniels, Mr. Trump's the president - - the president's representative should be speaking out more as well."

Highly possible in this kind of environment, but it's pervading not just the White House but all of Washington. I don't know that the media coverage is fair of Kelly Saddler in the sense that calling on the calls for her to resign, which has been getting air time over and over whether journalist are saying it or commentators who say, I think I have to go through the staff and breakdown. But the general calls for her to resign actually holds her to a higher standard than the commander-in-chief, meaning who calls to the president to resign when he made -- pretty much did the exact same thing during the campaign when he mocked John McCain's tenure as a prisoner of war."

She has a public (inaudible) issued any statement at all. Good for Fox, Capri, for banning Tom McInerney over those comments. I mean, torture eventually breaks everyone. John McCain was in Hanoi prison for five and half years. He can't lift his arms over his head because of the beatings that he went through. He repeatedly refused early release because he was an admiral's son. He didn't think he should go home out of turn, and I don't think he deserves that kind disparagement."

But I think that the issue surrounding this joke coming out of the White House is one of a larger narrative about the lack of civility in Washington and in political discourse at large. That you know, we have come to the point where it is OK to basically disparage even, you know, a prisoner of war who has severed this country admirably. I mean, we had all these discussions surrounding, you know, the crassness of the White House Correspondent's Dinner. John McCain deserves our outrage too."

And as Meghan pointed out, his legacy is secure. There is this idea in this town that you can leak information and very passive aggressively share what other people said, and that's considered civil. And it's uncivil to say something privately. I think a lot of people look at this and see it as a kind of junior high school theatrics where you say, oh you know, Becky says you're not very pretty. I mean that's not -- that's sharing negative information and it comes off very petty and I think it's important that we understand that civility should employed both privately and with the leaks."

I think this article really crossed the line on several occasions. The most glaring to me was when it talked about how the president is never photographed with Barron Trump. So, they were clearly trying to portray this fractured image of the first family, and it felt forced at times. I do think that some people will read this article and take it with a grain of salt and maybe say, you know, part of it is true, part of it isn't.

Now, the interesting thing here is that when she did unveil her initiative, she was very affectionate with the president. And then you see headlines rolling in that said, oh, that moment was forced, it seemed staged and stitched up. They can't really win no matter what they do.

These are shocking and appalling allegations. There are many questions that remain unanswered, especially who knew what and when they knew it, and we see this shift to this Washington Post article that headline is Trump, Schneiderman, (Inaudible) and the changing shape of sex scandal. So it completely changed from the important investigation that had been done, that needed to be continued and followed up onto try and to tie in Republicans and particularly President Trump."

She was never even interviewed. Let me get you two on one other thing, which is the President tweeting. This is after a study by a conservative media group, reflecting other studies as well that network news coverage of the President has been 90 percent negative, but the President tacked onto that tweet.

But the actual mainstream media in Europe has been very unkind to her, making derogatory comments about her race, making derogatory comments about their coupling. It's been really brutal for them."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And I'm sure in Harry's case, it's not unrelated to the fact that his mother Diana died being chased by paparazzi."

      "utterance": "But look, Americans love royal weddings, sure that's why you're going. There's a whole lot more interest on this one because of Meghan Markle, I mean American, an actress, biracial, divorced, not exactly your typical Kensington Palace bride."

      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "No. And she's also 37 year's old, meaning she's an adult. She's not a young -- you know Princess Diana was I think 21 or something. But everything about her is different, and this is why the mainstream media has rightly pointed out just the fact of who she is modernizing the monarchy. In one fell swoop, she's changing the face of things, and I think that's good for everybody."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I love that you talked to a British source about these feelings because it lets us know what it looks like from a journalist point of view. I mean we all think it's a great but I guess if you're Meghan Markle and suddenly you're suddenly you're so scrutinized, it's got to be difficult."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Well, if you'll remember at the beginning of their courtship, Harry's press team had to put out a statement defending her and telling the media to lay off, because it was so bitter and ugly. From the beginning, this has been a problem."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Have a great trip, Gillian Turner, great to see you. Still to come, an apology from MSNBC's Nicole Wallace, and a New York Time's story that turned out not to be fake news."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Nicole Wallace, the Bush White House official and John McCain campaign aide, turned MSNBC host, was skewering Sarah Huckabee Sanders, (Inaudible) Baghdad or with the administration's refusal to apologize to McCain over a sick joke when she said this about the press secretary."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NICOLE WALLACE, MSNBC",
      "utterance": "How do you resist the temptation to run up and wring her neck? Why can’t she just say, \"If a staffer said that, we’re going to get to the bottom of it and she’ll be fired\"?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Ring her neck? Well, Wallace has tweeted an apology: I used poorly chosen words and I'm sorry. That was the right move. Can we all just dispense with the violent imagery? New York Times reported that Homeland Security Secretary, Kristin Nielson was so upset after President Trump had berated her in a cabinet meeting for not securing the border that she came close to resigning, but a DHS spokesperson called the story false, except the Chief of Staff John Kelly later told Fox's John Roberts that he had called Nielson, his former deputy to implore her not to quit, which means that despite the denials, the Time's piece was essentially right.
