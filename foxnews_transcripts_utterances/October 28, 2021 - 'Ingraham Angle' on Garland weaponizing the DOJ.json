Now, in 2009, when the Tea Party took off, the issue that had so many Americans energized was the opposition to Obamacare. In 2021, the issue is education. The one good thing about the awful, terrible pandemic is that parents had the time to burrow into their children's schooling, and many were horrified about what they saw.

But they were badly mistaken. Now, parents and citizens alike see how activists promoting a deeply anti- American agenda have wormed their way into almost every facet of the educational experience. While parents should be upset about this, and their concerns are not political, they're practical. Parents are saying, 'Hey, my kid's not reading and writing at grade level'. But somehow they have time to hold assemblies on diversity, equity, inclusion and police brutality. Or are they saying, in school they put more focus on George Floyd than George Washington. Parents should be demanding answers, because schools have become a minefield for Democrats, of course. The Biden administration just reflexively took the side of school boards against the parents. Now, after the National School Board Association pleaded for relief, claiming its members were under siege, the Department of Justice snapped into action. I've never seen anything like it. In their own memo, they warned of a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, and promised to take action if necessary. It sent a chilling message to moms and dads, pretty much anyone interested from coast-to-coast. Be aware joining a movement that we essentially linked to domestic terror. When a firestorm then erupted, the National School Board Association pulled back. They saw they had created a bit of a ruckus, so they apologized for the descriptions of parents as violent harassing menaces. But when press today on why the DOJ has also rescinded its follow-on letter, Attorney General Merrick Garland just dug in.",

Rosiak's story notes that, McAuliffe's former law firm, one he has recently reported some income from, is currently fighting on behalf of a school that covered up one of the cases where a student was brutally assaulted. \"The Hunton Andrews Kurth law firm is battling a young woman who says she was repeatedly raped on her Fairfax County middle school campus as a 12-year old and then she was slashed with a knife, burned with a lighter, penetrated and gang raped.\" Here now is the reporter who broke this story.

It hired him in 2019, paid him over a quarter million bucks a year. And since that time, 2019 Fairfax County public schools has paid Hunton Andrews $9 million. Now, why do school systems pay that much money to lawyers? They do it to fight parents. They do it to fight kids who allege that they were wronged in schools by the inaction or action of school system officials. And so, when Terry says, he supports the educational establishment. That's what he means. It's the special interest of administrators who have their own interests, which are different than parents. And so, they're trying to get this - they were trying to get this poor girl, as you described, it's worse that the allegations are true. It's worse than the Loudoun rape case.

They want it not to be judged by a reasonable person, but by a \"trained school official\", which is kind of funny if you think about it.

MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER, \"APOCALYPSE NEVER\" AUTHOR: Sure, thanks for having me on, Laura. As you know and most Americans know, gasoline prices are up 60 percent over the last year. We feel the pain at the pump. I think what most people don't know is that it didn't need to be like that. Petroleum prices have been rising over the last half-decade, but investment in oil and gas exploration is down by half of what it was 10 years ago. It should have risen, but a combination of both shareholder and activist campaigns put pressure on the big oil and gas companies in the United States to really slow down or even stop the amount of oil and gas drilling that they were doing, and exploration. And it's also the heavy subsidies for renewables meant that we weren't making the investments to the United States that we needed to make. We have a lot of oil and gas in the United States in our shale that we get through fracking. It's an amazing technological revolution. But we are just leaving it there because we haven't made those investments. And as a result, we now see Biden just pleading with OPEC to increase oil production.",

They've waved environmental regulations. And it's a global market for oil and gas. So if United States had been making investments we should have been making five years ago instead of letting the investments drop by half -- by the way, we are at 25 percent less investment that we need just to keep oil prices down to where we were. So if we had been doing what we should've been doing and really developing this incredible asset that we have, we would be seeing a significant continuation of the transition from coal to natural gas, which of course is half as carbon intensive as coal and has been the big driver of lower emission.

But they were badly mistaken. Now, parents and citizens alike see how activists promoting a deeply anti- American agenda have wormed their way into almost every facet of the educational experience. While parents should be upset about this, and their concerns are not political, they're practical. Parents are saying, 'Hey, my kid's not reading and writing at grade level'. But somehow they have time to hold assemblies on diversity, equity, inclusion and police brutality. Or are they saying, in school they put more focus on George Floyd than George Washington. Parents should be demanding answers, because schools have become a minefield for Democrats, of course. The Biden administration just reflexively took the side of school boards against the parents. Now, after the National School Board Association pleaded for relief, claiming its members were under siege, the Department of Justice snapped into action. I've never seen anything like it. In their own memo, they warned of a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, and promised to take action if necessary. It sent a chilling message to moms and dads, pretty much anyone interested from coast-to-coast. Be aware joining a movement that we essentially linked to domestic terror. When a firestorm then erupted, the National School Board Association pulled back. They saw they had created a bit of a ruckus, so they apologized for the descriptions of parents as violent harassing menaces. But when press today on why the DOJ has also rescinded its follow-on letter, Attorney General Merrick Garland just dug in."

It's like magic. It just goes away. How convenient. Sounds like there's another school board that needs to be replaced. Taxpaying parents fund the public schools and rightly deserve answers and accountability. Any politician, I mean, any politician who stands in the way of this legitimate exercise of parental rights, and any bureaucrat who uses procedural gimmicks to insulate himself from criticism, should be tossed from office as soon as possible. This spells political defeat from McAuliffe of and countless Democrats who believe they're above reproach, as long as they're woke. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Utah Senator Mike Lee, who was at today's hearing with the Attorney General Merrick Garland. Senator Lee, it was fascinating to watch this unfold.

And most criminal prosecutions occur under state law in state court systems. I asked him to identify what the base is for federalizing this? He couldn't, he wouldn't, he didn't. Why?

If you could identify them as a domestic terrorist network, then - then - then yes, that would perhaps be appropriate to get the Department of Justice involved. And of course, you can't, because that's absurd. And the entire exercise today was absurd. I've never seen anyone take so much time in order to explain something that really should have just been dismissed with, 'We screwed up. We screwed up badly. I'm sorry'.

Not just because of how he has downplayed the sexual assaults of these students in Virginia high schools, but also because of what the Daily Wire's Luke Rosiak is now reporting. Rosiak's story notes that, McAuliffe's former law firm, one he has recently reported some income from, is currently fighting on behalf of a school that covered up one of the cases where a student was brutally assaulted. \"The Hunton Andrews Kurth law firm is battling a young woman who says she was repeatedly raped on her Fairfax County middle school campus as a 12-year old and then she was slashed with a knife, burned with a lighter, penetrated and gang raped.\" Here now is the reporter who broke this story. Luke Rosiak for the Daily Wire. Luke, his response would be, I imagine, the word former ok should count. It's a - his former law firm. He is no longer associated with it. Is that valid?"

This law firm has been doing essentially the dirty work of school systems ever since they were on the wrong side of Brown versus Board in the 1950s. It hired him in 2019, paid him over a quarter million bucks a year. And since that time, 2019 Fairfax County public schools has paid Hunton Andrews $9 million. Now, why do school systems pay that much money to lawyers? They do it to fight parents. They do it to fight kids who allege that they were wronged in schools by the inaction or action of school system officials. And so, when Terry says, he supports the educational establishment. That's what he means. It's the special interest of administrators who have their own interests, which are different than parents. And so, they're trying to get this - they were trying to get this poor girl, as you described, it's worse that the allegations are true. It's worse than the Loudoun rape case. Just last month, they were trying to get that case tossed out of court on a procedural basis involving the girl's desire to be anonymous, which I think we can all understand why a rape victim would want to be anonymous."

But here's how the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. \"The jury found that Smith had sexually harassed Doe and that the harassment had been severe.

And the reason they care about this case, in particular, is because they're trying to change the interpretation of Title Nine, and set a precedent that would apply to schools all over the country in a way that's much more favorable to administrators and less favorable to kids and victims. What they want is not a reasonable person standard, would a reasonable person think you were informed of sexual assault. They want it not to be judged by a reasonable person, but by a \"trained school official\", which is kind of funny if you think about it. And they actually cite a case as precedent, where a principal was repeatedly informed that a teacher was a child molester. And then she was told that a kid was sitting on his lap. And she said, 'Oh, it's probably just innocent', like father-son type thing. Well, it wasn't innocent. But their argument was - that lady wasn't held responsible, because in her mind, she was naive but she didn't - she wasn't being a reasonable person. But in her train judgment, she didn't act.

He's always treated his political enemies as people to just disparage and destroy. And I frankly think that Republican candidates should take away an understanding of how the Democrats now do politics. This is not about disagreeing with somebody. They are trying to turn half of the country into second class citizens, from the vaccine mandates to Attorney General Garland going after parents as domestic terrorists. They're trying to make it impossible to live a normal life. If you think the way that we think, if you act the way that we act.

And the changes that he agrees should be made to how society functions. We are confident we are going to move ahead to have the biggest investment addressing the climate crisis in history by the United States. We're creating targeted manufacturing credits that will help grow domestic supply chains for solar, offshore and onshore wind, expanding access to rooftop solar and home electrification. And we are talking about a historic effort to make critical investments in environmental justice."

      "utterance": "And tax credits for weather-stripping. In other nothing to solve the energy crisis we're in right now. Nationwide the price of gas is at a seven year high because of the skyrocketing oil prices brought about by shrinking supply. That's Biden's fault. And Biden's solution, to earmark $500 billion for climate programs in the reconciliation bill now. So how will more handouts for solar, wind, and electric end up lowering energy prices? My next guest points out it's largely because of insane climate policies and the activism going along with it that we are facing an energy crisis now. Joining us now is Michael Shellenberger, author of \"Apocalypse Never, Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All.\" Michael, explain this link in the activism in the place we find ourselves now. MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER, \"APOCALYPSE NEVER\" AUTHOR: Sure, thanks for having me on, Laura. As you know and most Americans know, gasoline prices are up 60 percent over the last year. We feel the pain at the pump. I think what most people don't know is that it didn't need to be like that. Petroleum prices have been rising over the last half-decade, but investment in oil and gas exploration is down by half of what it was 10 years ago. It should have risen, but a combination of both shareholder and activist campaigns put pressure on the big oil and gas companies in the United States to really slow down or even stop the amount of oil and gas drilling that they were doing, and exploration. And it's also the heavy subsidies for renewables meant that we weren't making the investments to the United States that we needed to make. We have a lot of oil and gas in the United States in our shale that we get through fracking. It's an amazing technological revolution. But we are just leaving it there because we haven't made those investments. And as a result, we now see Biden just pleading with OPEC to increase oil production."

      "utterance": "It's so embarrassing. And Putin is just laughing all the way. China is building all these coal plants. I think even Germany is relying again on coal, given the energy shortage they are going to face this winter. So who wins here?"

      "speaker": "SHELLENBERGER",
      "utterance": "Obviously the people that made the investments in oil and gas are doing very well. So certainly, Russia is doing well, the Saudis are going to make out well. Basically, everybody in OPEC, everybody outside of the United States, outside of western Europe, you are absolutely right. Both China and India were facing blackouts. They've had to reopen coalmines. They've waved environmental regulations. And it's a global market for oil and gas. So if United States had been making investments we should have been making five years ago instead of letting the investments drop by half -- by the way, we are at 25 percent less investment that we need just to keep oil prices down to where we were. So if we had been doing what we should've been doing and really developing this incredible asset that we have, we would be seeing a significant continuation of the transition from coal to natural gas, which of course is half as carbon intensive as coal and has been the big driver of lower emission. So Biden is going to go to climate talks, United Nations climate talks, in a couple of weeks, and basically at the same time that he's demanding that we use a lot more oil from abroad."

      "utterance": "It's unilateral energy disarmament. We are just unilaterally giving up one of our greatest assets, other than our freedom, which is our energy supply, which has huge repercussions for our national security. The World Economic Forum, Michael, has had outsized influence on this entire climate debate, pushing for a global reset of capitalism. How important has that been as we move forward?"

      "speaker": "SHELLENBERGER",
      "utterance": "Yes, in \"Apocalypse Never\" I describe three forces behind apocalyptic environmentalism and the push for renewables. It's both big financial interests, Black Rock, other shadow banks. We see obviously big industrial renewable energy companies, really the desire for Europe and big green NGOs like the World Economic Forum to push for power over global economies. And then finally it's a religious impulse. You have to keep in mind, we've been told for 10 years that solar and wind are cheaper than existing electricity, and now they are proposing a half-trillion in subsidies."
