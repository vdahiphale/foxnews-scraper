We hardened soft targets, cockpits, air marshals, airports became fortresses. Why not pursue that plan as well? Terror is like water, it seeks the path of least resistance; block one area, they seek another. Leaders should seek and secure those areas, like say, awards shows. Yes, as starlets tweet away on gun control, flexing their naive outrage in trite sentences, what's happening behind the curtain? The Hollywood Reporter notes that red carpet security is under heightened scrutiny. Who knows what that means, but I doubt it means less security, fewer armed guards, fewer police, fewer dudes with earpieces and trunk-sized necks. You can bet those events will be hardened even more because we need to protect our stars. So they can continue telling those of us who are less secure and less important, that our lives mean less than theirs.",
