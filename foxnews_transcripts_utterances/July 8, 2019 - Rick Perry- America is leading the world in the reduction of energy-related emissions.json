But behind the walls of his mansion, prosecutor say that he was running a sex trafficking operation.  And in a bizarre legal proceeding that played out in Florida, he got what amounted to a very sweet deal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But this time, the Southern District of New York has Mr. Epstein, and this thing may be about to get very ugly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Both of these men have vigorously denied these claims. Buckingham Palace called it false and without any foundation. Dershowitz, says that the accuser is a proven liar. In 2008, Epstein struck what has been now called the deal of a lifetime with Florida prosecutors. He pleaded guilty only to state charges of child prostitution despite a 53-page investigation that resulted in an FBI indictment. He went to jail for only 13 months. But during that time, he was allowed to leave, go to his office during the day, and then, check back in, in the evening.

We interviewed more than 100 people, the president, Supreme Court justices, and senators. And what really struck us I think was just these stories of courage, you know, people like Ashley Kavanaugh, who prays that her husband is not going to get the nomination. She'd gone through this before. She knew how brutal it was. Once he gets it, she is right there with him. After she does your show, her hairdresser recommends she comes in for a touch up and while she's there she has to deal with the revelation of some completely scurrilous allegations about serial gang rape and just what it was like to go through that. And women like Leland Keyser, who tried very hard to be able to support her friend. This is a lifelong Democrat who did not want Justice Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court, and she was expected and in fact, pressured to come up with something to support her friend. She was unable to. She remembered that summer extremely well. She did not remember anything that would help out Christine Blasey Ford and she ends up having to tell the FBI that. That took amazing courage given her political views.",

      "utterance": "All right, everybody. Breaking tonight, look out below, this is a story that is about to heat up in ways that could get very uncomfortable for some powerful people. As Jeffrey Epstein looks for ways to potentially minimize his future jail time. Once known as an international moneyman of mystery, Epstein ran in social circles that included presidents and princes. But behind the walls of his mansion, prosecutor say that he was running a sex trafficking operation.  And in a bizarre legal proceeding that played out in Florida, he got what amounted to a very sweet deal. But this time, the Southern District of New York has Mr. Epstein, and this thing may be about to get very ugly."

    {
      "speaker": "GEOFFREY BERMAN, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK",
      "utterance": "Epstein is alleged to have abused dozens of victims by causing them to engage in sex acts with him at his mansion in New York and at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. The victims were all underage girls at the time of the alleged conduct. Were given hundreds of dollars in cash. The underage girls were initially recruited to provide Epstein with massages. These massages became increasingly sexual in nature that would typically include one or more sex acts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Unbelievable. That's where it allegedly happened.  Investigators broke in to that door. And they say that they broke into a safe in there, if they just announces today, and said that they seized hundreds of nude photographs of underage girls, and the reports that we've seen that 14, 15 years old, and that age rays marched in and out of this house over and over again over the course of these years in his townhouse. Today, Epstein pleaded not guilty. Reports are that in some of his address books over the years, and we have to be very careful here because these people that you're looking at right now have not been accused of anything at all but he did have contact with them. Reportedly flying on Epstein's private plane. Bill Clinton did several times in the early 2,000. And, in fact, Bill Clinton has just put out a statement, breaking news on this, this evening. I'm going to show it to you in just a moment. Also now, President Trump, way back in 2002 called him a terrific guy.  Now, over the years, some of his associates were caught enough -- caught up, I should say, in actual accusations involving Epstein. A young woman says that she was forced to have sex with his friend Prince Andrew and his lawyer Alan Dershowitz. Both of these men have vigorously denied these claims. Buckingham Palace called it false and without any foundation. Dershowitz, says that the accuser is a proven liar. In 2008, Epstein struck what has been now called the deal of a lifetime with Florida prosecutors. He pleaded guilty only to state charges of child prostitution despite a 53-page investigation that resulted in an FBI indictment. He went to jail for only 13 months. But during that time, he was allowed to leave, go to his office during the day, and then, check back in, in the evening. Now, the prosecutor handling Epstein's case at that time was Alex Acosta, who is now President Trump's labor secretary. Here he is during his confirmation hearing because as you would imagine, he was asked about his role in the case back then. Watch."

So, my next guest demanded after reading this explosive story that came out in Miami Herald just about a year ago asked the Department of Justice to start to look into just how that whole deal in 2008 came about. And whether or not there was a way to reopen this case on different grounds. And the DOJ did open this brand new layer of Investigations. Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse joins me now. Senator, thank you very much for being here. What was it about this case that -- you know, drew your attention so strongly, and got you so involved in reopening it?"

But this is what government is for. It's to defend weak victims like all these girls. Now, many of them, I guess, are 30-something women. But these little girls were raped by this guy and trafficked by this guy. In the Miami Herald reporting from late November and early December is really incredible. And they did -- those journalists did some really extraordinary work and service to their neighbor. And I chaired the Judiciary Committee's oversight subcommittee. And so, I reached out to the Department of Justice repeatedly in December and January saying they have to reopen this investigation."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

He says that the evidence, you know merited that the deal that they struck that he has to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. That he has did serve time and he believes that there was nothing wrong with the agreement. What do you say to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SASSE",
      "utterance": "Well, let's draw a few distinction. So, first of all, just as an objective manner, this guy victimized dozens probably scores of little girls. And the sentence he got was pathetic, and every mom and dad in America -- frankly, not just moms and dads but anybody with a heart should be heartbroken by what happened here to those girls, to those victims, but also with the absurdity of a sentence that short. Now, there are two investigations. So, I started demanding this in December, unfortunately, the Attorney General Barr, during his confirmation hearings in January, pledged that DOJ would reprioritize this issue. And in February, they started an investigation. But we should distinguish between two of them. The criminal matter pursuing Jeffrey Epstein right now is a Southern District of New York investigation. And as disgusting and sick as this story is, this is good news today. That that's the N.Y. has opened this investigation. Lots of good prosecutors there and in the FBI have been looking into this case. So, that's a great investigation. The other thing that's happening, is the Office of Professional Responsibility inside the Department of Justice has been looking at the question of how could he have gotten this ridiculously light slap on the wrist sweetheart deal? So what that he's a billionaire? So what that he's rich and powerful and has the best lawyers' money can buy? He victimized a whole bunch of people and law should be on the side of those little girls."

    {
      "speaker": "SASSE",

And so, that's what the Southern District of New York has been able to do in reopening this case. I don't want to comment about the particular people inside the chain of command in the Department of Justice 10 years ago because there's an ongoing investigation now that the Office of Professional Responsibility is conducting. And they're going to be reporting back to us in the judiciary committee. And then, we'll have a lot more to say."

There's a story in the New York Post today -- and I think we have pictures of the two young women as they arrived at court. Courtney Wild was 14 years old. She said, \"And I was in braces.\" She said that he convinced her to bring him 70 to 80 girls who were 14 to 15 years old over the course of those years. She's the person on the right. On the left is Michelle Asada who said that she was, you know, told to give massages that became increasingly sexual in nature. You know, how is this different, I guess, the question is from, you know, I think of these young women in these tragic stories who are basically kidnapped and they're -- you know, held against their will in these cases."

And so, the end of slavery is something that we celebrate in America, rightly. But I don't think a lot of Americans understand, they're actually more slaves on the globe today that at any point in human history. And so, human trafficking is a scourge and we need to be pursuing this.  Again, government does a whole bunch of crap, it shouldn't have any business involved in trying to regulate the size of your soft drinks. Government ought to be doing a lot more of this going after bastards like this guy. And it shouldn't -- this isn't a time for people to say, always a Republican or a Democrat going to be implicated.

So the president has got a great story to tell not to mention the jobs that get created and the wealth and the quality of life that comes with that.  So I don't -- I don't find it hard at all that President Trump is talking about the environment, talking about the economy in the same breath."

You know, I think that the EPA under President Obama was criticized by businesses in America for being too aggressive in terms of increasing regulations that businesses felt were you know, unfair in many cases, and you all have worked to roll those back. You know, the EPA isn't even an agency that we hear a lot about in the Trump presidency. We don't -- you know we haven't heard from you a lot on this front in that. Why is that?"

I travel internationally a substantial amount selling LNG all across the country.  36 different countries now are buying liquefied natural gas from the United States. And frankly, you know, the EPA shouldn't be heard from when I think about it. This ought to be an agency that's out there doing its work, getting rid of the regulations that are stopping businesses from getting done what they need to do, and putting practices into place that help clean up the environment. America is leading the world in the reduction of energy-related emissions.  I mean, that's a great story. It's one that we ought to be parroting and talking about and being quite proud of. So Thursday, when we had the great tribute to America and American military, one of those stories is about American energy and the freedom that's being delivered around the globe by American LNG in particular."

I think we're removing those older inefficient power plants. I'll give you a good example. In the State of Texas, when I was the governor, NOx emissions went down 60 percent. SOx, the sulfur dioxide emissions went down by 50 percent. We had an almost 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide. So the fact is that as we put more old inefficient plants offline and replace them with liquefied natural gas, with gas plants basically, you're going to see a continual reduction of emissions and particulate matter."

And if you look at a tradition and the Obamas are basically traditionalists, they're not going to go out and endorse or try to say anything that's going to skew the situation.

Whereas women, as I've always argued as a feminist, women are as complicated as men are. Women can be as bad as men or as good, or as wrong or as right as men have been, and this is a good example of that. Here you've got five women in the same party, very, very different points of view, and going after each other. But there's a reason why Nancy Pelosi has been in Congress for a very long time and seems to understand that you can't punish people or abandon them based on your politics of wanting to hurt, as an example, President Trump. That there needs to be money at the border, that real lives are being affected. And at the same time, they argue, the squad if you will, that they seem to think that it's twitter that matters.

In many ways, I think, she's more effective now than she was the last time she was speaker of the house. She saw that there was a dilemma at the border. If you have these horrible conditions that the four young women were complaining bitterly about, heartfelt complaints, drinking water from toilets and so forth, and yet they were opposed to the bill to fix the problems they were complaining about.

Only 11 percent of Democrats voted in her race, and then she only won by 4,000 votes. You know, that is not a representation of not just not the nation, but the Democrat Party itself. But this is the war right now, the civil war, if you will. Who is going to end up representing them?

      "utterance": "That was quite a moment. That was then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh defending himself against explosive sexual assault allegations here on \"The Story\" just days before his contentious confirmation process captivated the nation. Now, there are brand-new details about what was going on behind the scenes at that time from coordinated efforts on the left to derail Kavanaugh's confirmation, including paying protesters, to revelations that the Trump team held back dirt on accuser Christine Blasey Ford with the understanding that \"any criticism of Ford would be treated as a smear and depicted as victim shaming.\" That was not the way they wanted to go. All of this is captured in the very fascinating new book that is out tomorrow, \"Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.\" Here now, co-authors Mollie Hemingway, a Fox News contributor and senior editor of \"The Federalist\" and Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director at the Judicial Crisis Network. Ladies, great to have you here and the book is fascinating. I was digging through it throughout the course of the day today. Mollie, what surprised you the most?"

      "utterance": "Well, there was so much that was interesting. We thought this was a very important story, what the country went through was really difficult. We interviewed more than 100 people, the president, Supreme Court justices, and senators. And what really struck us I think was just these stories of courage, you know, people like Ashley Kavanaugh, who prays that her husband is not going to get the nomination. She'd gone through this before. She knew how brutal it was. Once he gets it, she is right there with him. After she does your show, her hairdresser recommends she comes in for a touch up and while she's there she has to deal with the revelation of some completely scurrilous allegations about serial gang rape and just what it was like to go through that. And women like Leland Keyser, who tried very hard to be able to support her friend. This is a lifelong Democrat who did not want Justice Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court, and she was expected and in fact, pressured to come up with something to support her friend. She was unable to. She remembered that summer extremely well. She did not remember anything that would help out Christine Blasey Ford and she ends up having to tell the FBI that. That took amazing courage given her political views."

      "utterance": "Yes, you know, there are so many exciting new things. I thought, I mean, Mollie and I both were really involved in this process, her as a journalist covering it, me working a group that was really supportive of his nomination. We kind of thought we knew it all and we learned a lot of new things. One of the fun stories I thought was how Justice Kennedy retired and how he was able to do so without anyone finding out. I mean, not only coordinating this. He had a former clerk of his who worked in the DOJ who he met secretly with at one of the Smithsonian sculpture garden to tell him get this news to the White House. Don McGahn has to get this to the president somehow without any -- he wasn't even officially told Kennedy was retiring. So the first person Kennedy told really was the president himself, and what was even more interesting to us is finding out that there were actually -- the other Supreme Court justices were surprised as well when he told them right before he headed over to the White House. They said we didn't even see it coming because he had been -- he had been hiring clerks, he had been talking about the next term as if it was coming. I thought that was really --"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "He must have very much wanted to keep it to himself, his decision, and he succeeded in doing that, which isn't so easy these days. I was of course interested having done the only interview that Brett Kavanaugh did, and as you point out, the only interview that a Supreme Court nominee has ever done. It became obvious to the people that we're working with him on his nomination that he had to go out there and he had to respond to these allegations. In fact, the gang rape allegation came out I think late the night before or early that morning so I asked him about that in the interview. They were -- I thought you captured the feeling in that room perfectly. There must've been 30 people in that room and they were very nervous, and it showed in the way he responded to the question."

It was like -- I say it was like the cork got popped out of him when he walked into that hearing room, Carrie. He was completely -- he was yelling, he was, you know, perhaps may be overboard."

    {
      "speaker": "SEVERINO",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, I think one thing we found in the reporting we did is everyone pretty much agreed that when the moment when he was talking to Senator Klobuchar, yes, he definitely went too far. But I think also a lot of people realized that he had to bring his emotions and that was something interesting that we saw throughout the process he had had that. They had been doing moots and practicing, answering some of these questions and the frustration and the indignation had been there and it was kind of a battle between how do I display this and talk about it. We have the moments where he is deciding as he's getting ready to go out and thinking how do I present this, and I think everyone saw that was a turning point and he was -- he stayed strong and of course, you know, President Trump stayed strong and supported him as well, so it was really - -"

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

In that moment, right, he's got all these people telling him you should be like this, you should be like that, and he's in the worst moment of his life, accused of most heinous possible allegations, which he said that he, you know, did not do. I thought it was very interesting to hear about Ashley and the role that she played and when he came back to the holding room after that moment with Amy Klobuchar, she said you got to fix this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Right, she tells him to ease up a bit, and so he goes right back out and he does that. But getting that kind of inside access was great. \"Justice on Trial\" was not just though about the Kavanaugh confirmation itself, but really about what the entire country went through and how important it is to make sure we all care about due process and rule of law and the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven."

    {
      "speaker": "SEVERINO",
      "utterance": "We certainly hope so. I mean, that's one of the reasons we wrote \"Justice on Trial\" is because it's getting so ugly what's happening with these confirmation hearings and one of the things we saw is that it's the only way to get better is to understand what has happened. So each -- we've learned something from each of these attacks whether it's on Robert Bork or Justice Thomas. And I think if we hadn't learned from those, it would've been harder to understand how to deal with the Kavanaugh confirmation. We need to learn from us if we are to not have -- become even uglier next time."
