Hello, everyone, I'm Trish Regan in this morning for Maria Bartiromo. This is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The Trump administration says it will go back to accepting renewal requests for so-called DREAMers. What does that mean for the immigration battle on Capitol Hill? I'll be talking to Georgia Senator David Perdue who's been in on all those talks with the White House. Also, the Trump Dossier, at least one Republican lawmaker pushing to declassify the Justice Department and FBI files on the matter, what does he want to find? We'll be asking him. Congressman Ron DeSantis of the House Judiciary Committee, he joins me live. Plus Maria sits down with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and she gets his take the current state of the economy as we look ahead right here today on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The Trump administration will resume accepting applications for DACA renewals after a federal judge blocked the president's decision to end the program. But the program still faces a rather uncertain future. Congress is struggling to come up with a permanent solution for DACA as they also try to juggle funding for border security and Mr. Trump's long-promised wall. President Trump's venting his frustration on Twitter just this morning saying \"DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don't really want it. They just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military.\" My next guest took part in immigration talks at the White House just last week. Joining me right now is Senator David Perdue of Georgia.

What we had last week were two meetings at the White House. The President is very engaged in this issue just like he was on tax. I'm hopeful that we have now opposing proposals that will allow us to get symmetry in this negotiation. In my business experience, that's how you get to deal and I still think we have a possibility to do that. Look, 72 percent of Americans want this to happen. They want to end the chain migration. They want immigration limited to the worker, the spouse, and the immediate children in that family. And I think what we're going to do here is see once we get past the funding deadline, which should have nothing to do with DACA, we will move on to hopefully a bipartisan solution to DACA and our immigration system. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So why would you use it if you know it was political opposition research. But I think the flip side is also interesting. If they didn't know it came from the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, then how much due diligence did they really do on this document that did they just take it at face value?

I don't know if it was true or not but I can tell you that to start a major investigation based off some drunk 28-year-old talking about saying the Russians have dirt on Hillary, I mean, I don't know that they would start investigations on something so thin, so in some ways, the dossier even though it was not verified and it's really been discredited at least it's alleging things that could -- that would be serious if true. Papadopoulos is just saying, hey, we hear the Russians have dirt on Hillary, I think that would be very thin to start investigations. So I am definitely interested on how the investigation started.

In addition to that, it costs more money to produce loans and there had been so much litigation around it. There are a lot of lenders have been much more elected to make loans precisely to the lower income, lower FICO, self-employed prior defaults and that could be fixed very quickly. So I'm hoping -- and the other thing, we have so many people involved in the housing policy. I think there's seven regulars who actually set these policies. They've got to get in a room and finish that. If they do that, the cost of mortgage will go down for Americans and you'll make it not only the cost but it will go down for everybody but it will also open a whole segment.

And that alone is you have a 0.2 percent growth a year. And so I think that is one of the first thing that the administration could do that could actually help immediately.

Hello, everyone, I'm Trish Regan in this morning for Maria Bartiromo. This is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The Trump administration says it will go back to accepting renewal requests for so-called DREAMers. What does that mean for the immigration battle on Capitol Hill? I'll be talking to Georgia Senator David Perdue who's been in on all those talks with the White House. Also, the Trump Dossier, at least one Republican lawmaker pushing to declassify the Justice Department and FBI files on the matter, what does he want to find? We'll be asking him. Congressman Ron DeSantis of the House Judiciary Committee, he joins me live. Plus Maria sits down with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and she gets his take the current state of the economy as we look ahead right here today on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The Trump administration will resume accepting applications for DACA renewals after a federal judge blocked the president's decision to end the program. But the program still faces a rather uncertain future. Congress is struggling to come up with a permanent solution for DACA as they also try to juggle funding for border security and Mr. Trump's long-promised wall. President Trump's venting his frustration on Twitter just this morning saying \"DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don't really want it. They just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military.\" My next guest took part in immigration talks at the White House just last week. Joining me right now is Senator David Perdue of Georgia. Good to have you here Senator."

      "speaker": "PERDEU",
      "utterance": "Well the evidence is they've been trying to do this for a number of years without any success. Three times in the last 11 years we've tried to solve this immigration issue. But the President has been very clear that any solution to DACA must include border security including the wall, an end to chain migration and end this diversity of Visa lottery. What we had last week were two meetings at the White House. The President is very engaged in this issue just like he was on tax. I'm hopeful that we have now opposing proposals that will allow us to get symmetry in this negotiation. In my business experience, that's how you get to deal and I still think we have a possibility to do that. Look, 72 percent of Americans want this to happen. They want to end the chain migration. They want immigration limited to the worker, the spouse, and the immediate children in that family. And I think what we're going to do here is see once we get past the funding deadline, which should have nothing to do with DACA, we will move on to hopefully a bipartisan solution to DACA and our immigration system."

      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, but you know, when it comes to a solution, you point out your business experience. I mean, you've got to negotiate right? One side has to offer up something, the other side has to offer up something and the impression we're certainly getting at least out of the left is that they are not willing to allow one single dollar to go to a so-called wall because the wall symbolize everything that they will dislike about our President. So how are going to get that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERDUE",
      "utterance": "Well, this is -- well, this is outrageous actually. It's a gross distraction away from the issue. The issue is this, the Democrats have tried for years and the DREAMer Act in2013 of Schumer and Durbin both talked about ending parts of chain migration so we're doing things that the Democrats have voted for and have supported in the past. Just in the 90s under Bill Clinton, we had a presidential commission actually recommend an end to chain migration and move to a merit-based immigration system, more based on who you are and not where you're from. And so, this is a point where most of the things we're talking about Democrats have actually voiced some support for over time. The problem now is you've got the politics involved in Washington. That's what's so frustrating to all of us out in the real world."

      "speaker": "PERDUE",

I mean, this was the most open and transparent dialogue that we've ever had on immigration. And this President's instinct, I think the media was supposed to be in there for five or 10 minutes, Trish, and they were in there for over 55 minutes. So this President saw a need to be transparent with the American people. He wants to see that both sides, while we differ there's enough common ground that we can get to a solution here if we have a genuine effort to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Well it certainly sounded like that. I mean, watching that meeting again, just as a spectator, it really felt as though there might be some room for negotiation, there might be room for some compromise. And then, you know, fast forward and now suddenly we're back to sound bites in the media where everybody is saying that you know, they're digging in their heels and nothing is going to get done. And I just question really whether anything can get done where we're living in such a polarized political environment. How do you break through?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERDUE",
      "utterance": "It has to get done. Trish, 72 percent of Americans want to get this done. And this is, you know, we've limited the conversation. The President now has been successful just last week in limiting the scope of this. Look, Congress has failed three times in the last 11 years, Trish, because they've been too comprehensive. They tried to solve the illegal problem, the temporary work Visa problem and the illegal immigration problem at the same time. What we're doing now is limiting this debate to just the legal immigration system and I believe we can get to a solution. Look I've been in big deals in the private sector and I can tell you that this is a deal to get done. The natural symmetry is there to get this deal done between a DACA solution and ending this chain migration and at the same time, providing for the security of our country on our borders."
    },

      "speaker": "REGAN",

Now, we're learning it's you know, going to cost a lot of money and the money has to come from somewhere. Ultimately, who will be on the hook for the wall? Is it the American taxpayer?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERDUE",
      "utterance": "Well it's a great question. It's a great question and what we have here is a proposal that came to us last Thursday from Senator Durbin and Senator Graham that would cost us according to Congressional Budget Office over $26 billion. The wall right now, the President is asking for funding of about 18 billion. And right now, when you have the growing economy that we see right now because the President said job one this year, this past year was growing the economy and he focused on three things. He focused on energy, regulations, and tax and we've been successful in moving the ball in all three of those areas and we see the economy moving now. And so we get an economy going, we get trade deals done with Mexico and other countries. We'll find a way to fund that wall. It's a national security issue, Trish. This is not just an immigration issue as we well know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, so you know, there's still some opportunity I would think there via these trade deals that can be renegotiated where we wouldn't be paying for the wall. You mentioned the economy Senator, and I'm glad you brought that up because it looks as though by all accounts the economy is doing pretty great right now. You've got GDP upwards of three percent, you've got record low unemployment, you've got wages going up finally by the way because company after company, Walmart included in that group is coming out and saying that they're going to give back to their employees, that they're raising wages, they're giving out bonuses. But you know, there's still sort of a mentality among the left if you would right now, where they're not willing to praise the economy yet. Is that also in your view entirely motivated by politics?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERDUE",
      "utterance": "Trish, if this were any other president, getting the results that we're getting right now in the economy, we would be crawling about the results. Two million new jobs created last year, 860 regulations pulled back, 500 people bureaucrats fired at the V.A. for non-performance, 300 fired at the Department of Education. Consumer confidence is up at a16- year high. CEO confidence is at 20-year high, 123 companies decided to give year-end bonuses related to this tax deal. Trish, I'll tell you, this economy is beginning to move and what we have to do now is focus on immigration and infrastructure and trade to keep moving the economy forward. Those are the priorities that this President has. Look, this President's agenda is working and most people in America know that. So what you have now is an outcry from the left that oh, my goodness, look at all these distractions. The American people are not going to be fooled by that and I'm very anxious to continue to get the truth out before them."

It heightens the fact that this President by reengaging with the rest of the world, in fact, is making the world safer. Look what he did with NATO. He threatened to back out of NATO as a candidate. Everybody, oh, my goodness you cannot do that, you can't even threaten to do that. Well, guess what, the United -- the NATO nations are actually stepping up now and moving forward and increasing their funding for their military."

He claimed that Christopher Steel went to the FBI because he just had this crisis and confidence of what was going on and felt he had to do it. He didn't mention that one of the top-ranking Justice Department official Bruce Ohr's wife worked for Fusion GPS. It's much more likely that that's reason why the FBI got involved. And then he claimed incredibly that even though he personally met with that Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya the day before the day of--"

If you believe they never discussed that meeting the day before the day of and the day after then I've got Ocean Front property at Arizona I'd like to sell you. So it just wasn't a credible presentation. So I think the reason why I want to declassify this stuff is because there's so -- been so much misinformation and disinformation put out propagated by groups like Fusion but also by the press which has their narrative and they want to further it, and I think the American people could learn the truth by just releasing the document so that we know how all this transpired."

      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "So I have not been able to review the documents yet. We're going to try to get all the House members to have access. I obviously want to have access personally, but credible reports that I trust have said that this dossier was used to get surveillance. And so the question is Trish, one did the FBI know that this was funded by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton and if they did, and they still used it, without really corroborating anything, because remember James Comey even as late as the Spring of 2017 said this thing was unverified. So why would you use it if you know it was political opposition research. But I think the flip side is also interesting. If they didn't know it came from the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, then how much due diligence did they really do on this document that did they just take it at face value? So I think we need to know what all else was going into this. I want to know what the role of Peter Strzok, the famous -- infamous FBI Agent who said we can't afford to take the risk of a Trump presidency and we you need an insurance policy. He was one of the lead agents on both the Hillary case and Trump Russia collusion. I want to know more about the role of Bruce Ohr whose wife worked for Fusion GPS and I want to know more about the relationship between the FBI and Christopher Steel. The answer to all those questions I think will better inform was this an example of the government really working with one campaign against another, if so that's obviously very, very problematic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Yes indeed and I you know, I suppose mission accomplished as far as Russia goes, because if they were feeding disinformation to us via Christopher Steel, then they've succeeded in creating this kind of chaos and lack of trust in the very thing that makes us the great country we are. George Papadopoulos, let me ask you about him because he's now being focused on as one of the reasons why the FBI may have gotten involved in all of this. So that's a little bit of a twist and turn in the narrative. And at first we're hearing it was maybe because of the dossier, and now it's because well George Papadopoulos was effectively saying that there were connections with the Russians that would perhaps reveal Hillary Clinton's e-mails during that campaign and that is what may have prompted them. What do you think of that story?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, to me, that seems like somebody's interested in putting out information to deemphasize the role of the dossier because I think people who may have been involved with this know the dossier is problematic and is not going to make them look good if they were involved in that. So I think that was put out deliberately. I mean, look, here is my thing. I don't know if it was true or not but I can tell you that to start a major investigation based off some drunk 28-year-old talking about saying the Russians have dirt on Hillary, I mean, I don't know that they would start investigations on something so thin, so in some ways, the dossier even though it was not verified and it's really been discredited at least it's alleging things that could -- that would be serious if true. Papadopoulos is just saying, hey, we hear the Russians have dirt on Hillary, I think that would be very thin to start investigations. So I am definitely interested on how the investigation started. I'm more interested what was done with this stuff to spy on Americans. But I think that that's an important question and it doesn't really make sense to me that Papadopoulos would have been the main guy. And remember, even as early as a couple months ago, James Clapper, the head of national intelligence said he had never heard of Papadopoulos before."

So if you have a strong economy, they will raise rates more. But the strong economy will dwarf the effects of higher rates so you got to look -- you got to look at both sides and then selling bonds. I mean, the American economy is worth $100 trillion. They're selling 10 billion a month and that number will eventually go to 50 billion a month. Again if you have a very strong economy, I'm not sure that's really consequential. There might be a point in time when the fed isn't taking a favorable outcome, inflation -- think of 2019, inflation is too high, they got to sell more bonds and they're going to raise rates faster than people think. That's when it gets really tough to be of that and not when you have a real strong economy which gives them a lot of leeway to do various things."

It doesn't have to go in the loan or go to public markets. They can get it from overseas, they can do various things. But you are absolutely right. In the middle market where you would expect to see a little more growth today and you haven't. And again, I think it may just be a little delayed. It may be just a timing issue when we look at it in the short run and you know, small business volume seems OK, real estate is OK, so you know, mortgages is fine. Obviously, it will be affected by rates going up but so far it looks like the economy is healthy. And somehow it may end up (INAUDIBLE) eventually."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DIMON",
      "utterance": "That's a great question. I've been begging our government for years that we because of servicing costs, you know there are 3,000 -- when we send you a bill for a mortgage now in certain states 3,000 requirements to service that mortgage, hugely costly and hugely risky too to the servicer. In addition to that, it costs more money to produce loans and there had been so much litigation around it. There are a lot of lenders have been much more elected to make loans precisely to the lower income, lower FICO, self-employed prior defaults and that could be fixed very quickly. So I'm hoping -- and the other thing, we have so many people involved in the housing policy. I think there's seven regulars who actually set these policies. They've got to get in a room and finish that. If they do that, the cost of mortgage will go down for Americans and you'll make it not only the cost but it will go down for everybody but it will also open a whole segment. In fact, JPMorgan economist estimates that had we done what I would consider the right thing, not going back to subprime, just opening up these requirements a little bit, we might have been doing half a trillion dollars more a year -- a year. And that alone is you have a 0.2 percent growth a year. And so I think that is one of the first thing that the administration could do that could actually help immediately. Make mortgages more accessible and cheaper for everybody. And there's no risk to it, OK? Everything has been written since the great recession has been absolutely pristine."

Now you didn't see any of the BRT & Co's, at least I didn't see them talking about individual, my personal cut. They said we need for America a (INAUDIBLE) competitive taxes and we got that. I think the next things are on the administration agenda, infrastructure reform it's complex. You know, there's bridges and ports and highways, and FAA, and highway taxes and state and local, but it could be done permitting what I mentioned before, inner-city school education, you know, something that I think we could all fix, where we call smart regulation and while we do this we should do things to help the people in America left behind. I think it is true people are left behind. I think we should expand the arrogant tax credit. I think we should do a better job in fiscal education."

You know, companies want to -- most companies want to grow and expand and acquire or build and that's mostly natural state. The natural state isn't to buy back stock and do dividends.

This is a 23-24 years old agreement. The reality of the three-country change during the last 23 years. The fact that there is a reset for this agreement, it's fine. It's something very logical.

In other words, if he doesn't want tariffs happening on the other side, and you look to a country like China for example, where it's a whole lot more expensive to buy an American car in China because of the tariffs they put on as opposed to if you were to buy it, you know, here.

Now the future agreement, if there is any future agreement will have an impact on us so we'll have to be patient, wait and see.

You know, the fear among some CEO's was that the companies would horde the money and we would see a lot of share buybacks and dividend plays and that it wouldn't actually translate into much for the American worker, and yet already, knock-on-wood, it is.

And second, we need also the regulator to accept the fact that on a mass marketing point of view you're going to have plenty of cars without a driver.

But if you think you're going to get it done in today's political climate, we're not. Not if you make it part of the budget process. That has to be done within the next two weeks.

Here we had the economy -- the economy is booming, the stories should be Walmart and the other companies that have given two million people bonuses of a thousand dollars, two million, that you raised a level of pay from $9 to $11 and you hear Nancy Pelosi saying this is crumbs. By the way, if you're making $9 an hour and then it goes to 11 for 40 hours that's $80 a week. For those people, that's big, a thousand dollar bonus, you may say it's crumbs but to those people, it's big. Why do you have to use incendiary language? So the President has set back the process.

I mean, we've been in lots of meetings with members of Congress and you don't negotiate in a Cabinet meeting. You basically go in there and say here's our position, here's what we want. Have some dialogue. You don't bring the media into the show. It was a show. And it was a show with lots of conflicts. And when you say send me any bill, I'll sign it, that's not true. No President is going to sign any bill that comes from a Congress that's split as badly as this one is. And if he does he's a fool, and this President is not a fool.

We're going to be back with the panel as we look ahead here on SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES."

      "utterance": "This is very unbelievable. Much of Hawaii was in a state of panic yesterday after the state's emergency management agency mistakenly sent out an alert warning, alert that warned of an imminent ballistic missile strike. Officials later confirming someone pushed the wrong button. Oh, my goodness, we're back with our panel Ed Rollins and former Senator Al D'Amato. How does that happen? I mean, can you imagine by the way if you were in Hawaii and you got some kind of alert on your phone saying a ballistic missile was heading your way?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROLLINS",
      "utterance": "And the problem is we're far more sensitive to ballistic missiles because of the North Korea situation. So my sense is people were absolutely in panic. That -- we have to go back and have a failsafe system. You know, Al and I grew up in an age where you used to do nuclear tests and roll up in a ball (INAUDIBLE) but we're way beyond that and I think to a certain extent, you have to -- we have this instant communications that everybody is on the phone. You have to make sure it's fail safe"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "I mean, again, I just go back to how does something like that happen? You think about gosh, you know, just to get on to my darn computer at work, I got to put in all these passwords and it's not easy and yet, it had to have been relatively easy it seems as though, you know somebody here pushed the wrong button."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "D'AMATO",
      "utterance": "First of all, if you lived in Hawaii, you had to be frightened out of your mind, if you had relatives or friends there and heard about this. But how is -- if one person could push this button and set this off? Where are the checks and balances on this? And so maybe it's a good thing so that we get on to it because there is a potential, we hope that it's remote but it's there and we had better look at all of the systems throughout the state. And you just can't say it's the state's fault. Well, everybody had better wake up about this and see to it that we have emergency systems, particularly as it relates to missiles coming in that work and there are minimum standards that have to be set."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROLLINS",
      "utterance": "We have to secure North Korea and we have to basically make sure they're not doing these tests and all the rest of the stuff that's created. It's created an environment that this thing going --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, you mention that it has created this environment and you wonder what the national security risk could have been if somebody had thought that that was right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROLLINS",
      "utterance": "We only month what the public did. We don't know what the military did. Obvious I'd assume if something like this went off, the military basically with their submarines (INAUDIBLE) I'm sure went to some degree of alert. It should have."
