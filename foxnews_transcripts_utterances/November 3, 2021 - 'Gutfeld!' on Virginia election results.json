But also the election count, for the latest election count. Let's go to our map. Sorry about that. Let's go to the real map. That's not wrong. It's just incomplete. Here's the actual map. Finally an accurate count. No fraud and that one for sure. Like they say Virginia is for lovers. But what an amazing message sent by American voters by now you've heard the explanations. Parents had enough of destructive racist wokeism, the involuntary indoctrination of their kids, the ideological robotic brainwash forced in all facets of their lives. Not to mention Terry McAuliffe robotic dancing.",

They deny that their obvious bitter loathing for most of America spells their doom, but don't feel bad for these losers. They relied on sex pests kumquats over at the Lincoln Project for commentary, whose despicable hoax and portraying parents is racist blew up in their ugly faces. And now they're the ones in suit covered black face. Fact is the only expertise Lincoln Project has is knowing the best place to watch boys soccer practice. To read up on that. Speaking of perv enablers, where is Rick Wilson or John Weaver or Steve Schmidt? Boy, today goes silent. Somebody better remove their shoelaces. There is done as a bag of microwave popcorn cooked on high for 45 minutes. And they deserve it. After creating that tiki torch hoax, which was meant to destroy Youngkin but instead destroying the lives of a few stupid Democrat operatives. They should be shunned for life. To call them scum is an insult to everything currently living on the rim of a public toilet. No offense, Andrew Cuomo. Now you keep hearing the phrase, Bellwether that this election was a canary in a coal mine but in reality we were the canary for a year. We were chirping to anyone who listened that wokeism was racism and drag. And it would ultimately drag the terrified Democrats into the abyss. But the Dems don't watch this show. If they did, they could have seen this coming. Now there is screwed as a $12.00 hooker leaving Hunter's room at the Motel Six. Why do cheap poker lines always work?

According to a new survey almost 50 percent of Democrats think replacing Joe Biden at the top of the ticket will improve their odds of winning in 2024. Check out this poll. As for Joe's job approval, just 42 percent said he's doing a good one. Despite strong support from Hunter Biden's art customers. And those numbers like Chris Cuomo's female audience are shrinking all the time. Meanwhile, the same poll found half of America, half of Republicans believe Trump is still their best chance to take back the White House of a lot size election results. It's clear that people are sick of the left's identity politics and their kids' education where the three Rs all equal racism. With Biden as the face of the party, it's no surprise the Dems are thinking about getting a new face. It worked for Nancy Pelosi, but I wonder what does Joe think about all this?",

To call them scum is an insult to everything currently living on the rim of a public toilet. No offense, Andrew Cuomo. Now you keep hearing the phrase, Bellwether that this election was a canary in a coal mine but in reality we were the canary for a year. We were chirping to anyone who listened that wokeism was racism and drag. And it would ultimately drag the terrified Democrats into the abyss. But the Dems don't watch this show.

According to a new survey almost 50 percent of Democrats think replacing Joe Biden at the top of the ticket will improve their odds of winning in 2024. Check out this poll. As for Joe's job approval, just 42 percent said he's doing a good one. Despite strong support from Hunter Biden's art customers. And those numbers like Chris Cuomo's female audience are shrinking all the time. Meanwhile, the same poll found half of America, half of Republicans believe Trump is still their best chance to take back the White House of a lot size election results. It's clear that people are sick of the left's identity politics and their kids' education where the three Rs all equal racism. With Biden as the face of the party, it's no surprise the Dems are thinking about getting a new face. It worked for Nancy Pelosi, but I wonder what does Joe think about all this?"
