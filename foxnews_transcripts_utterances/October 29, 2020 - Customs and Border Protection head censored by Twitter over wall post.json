      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. I spent a lot of the day on the phone with UPS trying to figure out what happened to our package that we overnighted on Monday. We got some answers, we are missing others. We'll get to that in just a minute. But first, the big picture we've been reporting on for quite some time. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's been obvious for really decades now that the Biden family has gotten rich from selling influence abroad. Joe Biden held a series of high level jobs in the U.S. government -- Senator, Vice President. Based on that fact, and that fact alone, Biden's son and brother approach foreign governments and companies, sovereign wealth funds, energy conglomerates, third-world oligarchs and dictators, and they offered to exchange favors from Joe Biden for cash. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The polite term for that practice is influence peddling. Sometimes it is legal under American law, sometimes it is not legal. But it has always been the economic engine of the Biden family. They've never done anything else. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Until recently, no one debated this fact. Several liberal news organizations in fact have written detailed stories about the Biden's secret business dealings over the years. Look them up, assuming you still can. It's only since Joe Biden received the Democratic nomination that anyone in the media has claimed otherwise. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This week we introduced you to one of the Biden family's former business partners, a man called Tony Bobulinski. Bobulinski confirmed more conclusively than anyone ever has what the Biden's have been doing. On two separate occasions, Bobulinski met personally with Joe Biden to discuss the family's business deals in China. Biden repeatedly has denied knowing anything about those deals. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joe Biden is lying, Tony Bobulinski proved it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It was a major story and not just because it happened here. We only interviewed Tony Bobulinski in the first place, because nobody else would. There was a complete media blackout on his story, and there still is. In the last three days, and we just checked, the name Tony Bobulinski has not been mentioned a single time on any other television network, not one time. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Finally, today, it fell to an anchor on a small financial news called Cheddar to bring up the story.

In other words, we don't feel like answering a simple fact- based question of relevance to voters in the days before an election, so we're not going to.

At least he asked -- sort of. The rest of them pretend it's not really a story. But it is a story and it's not going away. Tonight, James Rosen of Sinclair confirmed that the F.B.I. opened a criminal investigation into the Biden family, quote, \"Hunter Biden and Associates\" last year, apparently on suspicion of money laundering. That investigation is still underway tonight. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Less than a week before an election, we learn this. What else will we learn? Well, very little if the people in charge have their way. Our professional class has dismissed from day one the revelations about the Biden family as part of a Russian Intel operation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There's no evidence for that no matter how many people repeat it. There never has been evidence there never will be evidence. It is totally untrue. And yet the public is buying it anyway, we are sad to report. Voters have been cut off from the facts which of course is the point of shutting down the free flow of information. When all the news receive is manufactured propaganda, you are apt to believe it and why wouldn't you believe it? You have no alternative. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here are the effects. A new Harris survey out today conducted by longtime democratic pollster Mark Penn found that 51 percent of respondents, the majority believe \"The New York Post\" is disseminating, quote \"Russian disinformation.\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's hard to imagine a scarier or more depressing result than that. You assume the \"Today\" show and \"The View\" and the rest of it is just harmless garbage, but it's not harmless. They are liars and their lies have consequences. How do you maintain a Democratic system when reality itself has been banned? That's something we're going to have to figure out. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Glenn Greenwald has thought a lot about that question. Greenwald is a traditional leftist. He has committed above all to forcing transparency on people who hold power. Years ago, Greenwald co-founded a news site called \"The Intercept.\" Today, he resigned. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In a statement, Greenwald explained why, quote, \"'The Intercepts' editors in violation of my contractual right of editorial freedom, censored an article I wrote this week, refusing to publish it unless I removed all sections critical of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, the candidate vehemently supported by all New York based 'Intercept' editors involved in this effort at suppression.\" And he went on. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Greenwald's full statement is up tonight at an internet platform called Substack, which has not yet censored. No matter who you plan to vote for next week, we recommend that you read it. Glenn Greenwald joins us tonight. Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. The idea of you resigning from a news organization you have found is stunning. Tell us why you did.",

We are going to subject their assertions to critical scrutiny. And I am so embarrassed and angered that the media outlet that I created along with two other excellent journalists to do that, the only article it published about all of these documents that have emerged about Joe Biden other than a column of mine, where I denounced Facebook and Twitter for censoring it was an article that made reference in passing to those documents, very snidely and dismissively to say that no one should pay attention to it, because it was Russian disinformation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And it cited a letter from John Brennan, James Clapper, Mike Hayden, and the rest of the goons from the C.I.A. and the Intelligence Community asserting it and where still that letter said we have no evidence that Russia is involved in any of this. \"The Intercept\" omitted that phrase, simply cited that letter to try and encourage people to ignore this evidence on the grounds that Russia had manufactured it and that the evidence was fabricated, even though there's never been any evidence that that's been true and everything since has just proven it showing Russia was not involved in any of this.

You will not be able to access Twitter.\" End quote. In other words, we banned you on purpose. Truth is not a defense in this country.

After 20 hours, Twitter reversed its decision claiming as Twitter always does, it was a big misunderstanding, quote, \"After reviewing your account, it looks like we made an error.\" But they didn't make an error. They showed us who we know they are. Mark Morgan is the Acting Commissioner, as we said, of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

      "sentences": "Last night, we told you about a pretty weird experience we had this week. On Monday, one of our producers in New York overnighted a package to our executive producer, Justin Wells and to me in Los Angeles where we were there preparing for an interview with the former Biden family business partner called Tony Bobulinski. Somewhere along the way, the contents of that package disappeared. Inside it was a flash drive that contained primary documents pertaining to the Biden family. We should tell you those documents did not come from Tony Bobulinski, and of course, we made a copy of those files before we sent them because we're careful. We get a lot of documents from a lot of different sources all the time, but that's especially true in election years. Before we put them on the air, we have to determine first whether they are real -- these were real -- whether they are newsworthy, and whether it's legal to show them. We wanted to assess what we have and we're still assessing it. But the point is, the package never arrived. Proprietary reporting on the Biden family, documents sent between journalists by supposedly secure overnight mail disappeared. They vanished on the same day we were conducting a heavily publicized interview based in part on documents from the Biden family. So as you can imagine, we wanted to know what happened. Unfortunately, we still don't know what happened. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This morning UPS issued a press release announcing they had found our flash drive and then boasting about their Customer Service, quote, \"UPS will always focus first on our customers and will never stop working to solve issues,\" which is fine. UPS is a reliable company. They rarely lose anything. We agree with that. That's why we use them in the first place. And yet, they lost our Biden documents. How? UPS won't tell us how. We spent a lot of the day talking to executives there. They claimed that the flash drive was found on Monday night by an hourly employee at the UPS building on 43rd Street in Manhattan. They suggested it might have been sitting on the floor there. They couldn't prove that because remarkably, in a room where millions of high value packages are handled, there are no security cameras. That's what they told us. UPS says the employee who found our flash drive simply dropped it on top of a supervisor's desk. Our documents sat there undiscovered for more than 24 hours until we announced on television that they were missing. That's their story. Obviously, we had some questions about it. But UPS executives did not answer our questions, quote, \"There are no more details. Security is returning it. Apologies again that we were unable to deliver it next day at the service level you requested.\" Our exchanges went on like this for hours, and the main question we had never changed. How did our flash drive get separated from the package that we sent it in? That seemed like something worth knowing. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The envelope was securely sealed. We know that. Two witnesses saw our producer seal it and UPS does not dispute that. Was the package torn open accidentally by a machine? That seems unlikely. UPS says that almost never happens. So we're left with the obvious explanation. Someone for some reason, opened our package and removed a flash drive containing documents that were damaging to the Biden family. We'd love to know who would do that and why. It would be helpful to see the envelope itself, but UPS says we can't see it because they threw it away. So here we are. We got our flash drive back today, and that's great. But we'd really like are some answers. And speaking of answers. It occurs as we are reading this that we mentioned, the documents that we get from a lot of people and we've received an awful lot of documents recently about Hunter Biden. We haven't aired all, in fact, many we have not aired. The ones that are pertinent to his business career abroad favors he did on behalf of foreign clients with the help of his father: that seems relevant and it seems like news and we brought it to you and we are not ashamed of that. But there are a lot of documents about Hunter Biden's personal life that we haven't brought to you and we're not going to and we should tell you why. One is the obvious answer. He is not running for President, and so to the extent those documents pertain to his dad, of course. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But Hunter Biden is a fallen man at this point, and I should also say that I knew Hunter Biden fairly well. We lived near each other in Washington for quite some time. I knew his wife who is an absolutely outstanding person, a good person. I never thought Hunter Biden was a bad person. I thought he had demons. But in the time I knew him, he kept them mostly under control. At some point he lost control of those demons and the world knows that now. He is now humiliated and alone. It's probably too strong to say we feel sorry for Hunter Biden. But the point is, pounding on a man, jumping on, piling on, when he is already down is something that we don't want to be involved in.

They took the tweet down, and then they put out a statement saying that the tweet was viewed as partisan and political and they are a nonpartisan and nonpolitical organization. However, here's the kicker, Tucker, they have previously sent out support of Hillary Clinton in 2017, and even prior to that and they put out a tribute to the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg. So as a former Girl Scout, the message is clear to young girls across the country and that message is, you don't count unless you're a liberal. And that's the same message that Hillary Clinton and her campaign sent in 2016 when Madeleine Albright said that there is a special place in hell for women that don't support Clinton. It's the same message that Joe Biden is sending to black voters that you aren't black if you don't support him.

In case you're not a fan, his real name is Dwayne Carter, tweeted about an hour ago this, \"Just had a great meeting with Donald Trump. Besides what he's done so far with Criminal Justice Reform, the Platinum Plan is going to give the community real ownership. We listened to what he had to say today and assured he will and can get it done.\" Well, OK. What does that mean for the rest of us? What is the Platinum Plan that Lil Wayne is excited about? Well, according to the White House, the Platinum Plan would address the issues on every voters' mind: things like making Juneteenth a Federal holiday and prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan, which some say still exists. Lil Wayne couldn't resist a plan like that. If there was ever a bellwether rapper, a one-man sign of how this election is going to go in the rap community, Lil Wayne is the guy. When you've lost Lil Wayne, you've lost Lil America. Amazing. You can't make this year up. It's just too good.

      "sentences": "Well, there are several, but we're going to -- we don't have enough time to get to all of them and be like, totally nerd out with me. But I think one thing to keep in mind overall, Tucker, is that there are very few ticket splitters left. That means that when people go to vote, they're voting straight Republican or straight Democrat. We used to get a little bit more ticket splitting in the past, but those days are kind of behind us. But President Trump in this last week, obviously, he is working very hard to try to close this and that could really help make the difference between a Chuck Schumer or a Mitch McConnell-led senate next year. I would start in Georgia. There are two Senate races in Georgia and Georgia has a system that if you don't get to 50 percent, you have to go to a runoff in January. Well, one of those races is definitely going to a run off. That is the Kelly Loeffler and Doug Collins race. They're not going to get to 50 percent. The other one, though, is incumbent Senator David Perdue against Jon Ossoff. Now, this one is a lot closer. And I think that David Perdue, he has announced that he is not going to do the final debate with Jon Ossoff and instead will join President Trump at a rally on Sunday. That probably makes sense for him. He did not have a great debate the other night. And I also think that it shows that President Trump is not taking Georgia for granted. So Georgia is one that I would look at. I mean, the Republicans are a little nervous on that one. Another one, Tucker, is Arizona. President Trump is going to be there on Tuesday. Trump and Biden both very much want to win Arizona. The senator there that's up for election is Martha McSally. That race is going to be tough, but she has a very good ground game probably better than any of the other Senate candidates. And she is bringing in Mike Lee and Ted Cruz to campaign for her this weekend. However, that race -- however the President does there is probably how she will do there. So that one is one to watch. The last one is North Carolina. Cal Cunningham is the Democrat. He is basically trying to take Thom Tillis out. Cal Cunningham is running on character, Tucker, and about a month ago, it surfaced and he has been having an extramarital affair and he has been trying to hide from the media and not talk about that.

And what was interesting was, they were specifically targeting white journalists as there were other great journalists that were there that were people of color, but they were leaving them alone. And you see the racial divide in this country where, you know, it's not only not safe to be a reporter telling the truth, but also the racial tensions have made things very difficult in this country with the narratives that are being played. I mean, the man had a gun, and I'll say this, I was lucky enough, I owe it to God and I give praise to Jesus for saving my life in that moment, because just right outside a few hundred yards away, or a hundred yards or so, a 15-year-old girl was shot, multiple guns were fired.

In Scotland, an ominously called Hate Crime and Public Order Bill now under consideration would allow the authorities to arrest people for things they say in their own homes at the dinner table. So why is a public order bill focused on what people do in private? That's a good question. And what exactly is hate speech? Since everyone is against it, does hate speech including praising a border wall? Well, according to legislation, it would. Under this legislation, you would not be allowed to, quote, \"Stir up hatred of any kind.\" You could be arrested, if you did. In other words, disagreeing with people would be a crime if those people had power. So how long before we face laws like this in the United States? It is possible. Pedro Gonzalez is an Assistant Editor at \"American Greatness.\" We're happy to have him on tonight. Peter, thanks for coming on.

PEDRO GONZALEZ, ASSISTANT EDITOR, \"AMERICAN GREATNESS\": Hate speech is whatever the people prosecuting you for hate speech, say it is, and that sounds a little bit reductionist, but that's really what it comes down to.

We got some answers, we are missing others. We'll get to that in just a minute. But first, the big picture we've been reporting on for quite some time. It's been obvious for really decades now that the Biden family has gotten rich from selling influence abroad. Joe Biden held a series of high level jobs in the U.S. government -- Senator, Vice President. Based on that fact, and that fact alone, Biden's son and brother approach foreign governments and companies, sovereign wealth funds, energy conglomerates, third-world oligarchs and dictators, and they offered to exchange favors from Joe Biden for cash. The polite term for that practice is influence peddling. Sometimes it is legal under American law, sometimes it is not legal. But it has always been the economic engine of the Biden family. They've never done anything else. Until recently, no one debated this fact. Several liberal news organizations in fact have written detailed stories about the Biden's secret business dealings over the years. Look them up, assuming you still can. It's only since Joe Biden received the Democratic nomination that anyone in the media has claimed otherwise. This week we introduced you to one of the Biden family's former business partners, a man called Tony Bobulinski. Bobulinski confirmed more conclusively than anyone ever has what the Biden's have been doing. On two separate occasions, Bobulinski met personally with Joe Biden to discuss the family's business deals in China. Biden repeatedly has denied knowing anything about those deals. Joe Biden is lying, Tony Bobulinski proved it. It was a major story and not just because it happened here. We only interviewed Tony Bobulinski in the first place, because nobody else would. There was a complete media blackout on his story, and there still is. In the last three days, and we just checked, the name Tony Bobulinski has not been mentioned a single time on any other television network, not one time. Finally, today, it fell to an anchor on a small financial news called Cheddar to bring up the story. Here is his exchange with the Biden campaign spokesman."

      "utterance": "\"We're not going to waste any time on the smear campaigns,\" says the spokesman. In other words, we don't feel like answering a simple fact- based question of relevance to voters in the days before an election, so we're not going to. We're not embarrassed to admit that we're not going to because no one has the courage to make us answer, including you. \"Fair enough,\" says the anchor. There you have it, the state of the American news media in October 2020. Keep in mind, the anchor you just saw, Mr. Fair Enough, is still one of the bravest people in journalism. At least he asked -- sort of. The rest of them pretend it's not really a story. But it is a story and it's not going away. Tonight, James Rosen of Sinclair confirmed that the F.B.I. opened a criminal investigation into the Biden family, quote, \"Hunter Biden and Associates\" last year, apparently on suspicion of money laundering. That investigation is still underway tonight. Less than a week before an election, we learn this. What else will we learn? Well, very little if the people in charge have their way. Our professional class has dismissed from day one the revelations about the Biden family as part of a Russian Intel operation. There's no evidence for that no matter how many people repeat it. There never has been evidence there never will be evidence. It is totally untrue. And yet the public is buying it anyway, we are sad to report. Voters have been cut off from the facts which of course is the point of shutting down the free flow of information. When all the news receive is manufactured propaganda, you are apt to believe it and why wouldn't you believe it? You have no alternative. Here are the effects. A new Harris survey out today conducted by longtime democratic pollster Mark Penn found that 51 percent of respondents, the majority believe \"The New York Post\" is disseminating, quote \"Russian disinformation.\" It's hard to imagine a scarier or more depressing result than that. You assume the \"Today\" show and \"The View\" and the rest of it is just harmless garbage, but it's not harmless. They are liars and their lies have consequences. How do you maintain a Democratic system when reality itself has been banned? That's something we're going to have to figure out. Glenn Greenwald has thought a lot about that question. Greenwald is a traditional leftist. He has committed above all to forcing transparency on people who hold power. Years ago, Greenwald co-founded a news site called \"The Intercept.\" Today, he resigned. In a statement, Greenwald explained why, quote, \"'The Intercepts' editors in violation of my contractual right of editorial freedom, censored an article I wrote this week, refusing to publish it unless I removed all sections critical of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, the candidate vehemently supported by all New York based 'Intercept' editors involved in this effort at suppression.\" And he went on. Greenwald's full statement is up tonight at an internet platform called Substack, which has not yet censored. No matter who you plan to vote for next week, we recommend that you read it. Glenn Greenwald joins us tonight. Glenn, thanks so much for coming on. The idea of you resigning from a news organization you have found is stunning. Tell us why you did."

I left \"The Guardian\" to do it, because I was seeing that there were a lot of constraints imposed on journalism and their ability, our ability to report freely against governments, against power centers, against all kinds of institutions that wield authority. And the premise of the news outlet, the core overarching premise, the reason it was created was to ensure that journalists would always have complete journalistic independence and editorial freedom, never have to pull punches journalistically or pay homage to pieties, because of the preferences, the partisan or ideological preferences of editors, or anybody else. That was the core founding idea and vision. And then that is what makes it so amazing that at the very outlet that I co-created that was built on my reputation, my credibility, my journalistic accomplishments, then tried to intervene to censor me six days before an election, because I wanted to publish reporting and analysis about the evidence that raises serious questions about the conduct of the candidate that all of the editors out that outlet vehemently and enthusiastically support."

    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "So \"The Intercept\" was actually for a while, a unique publication, and I think the vision I just described is one reason, but another was that it was intended above all else to be highly skeptical of the claims of Intelligence Agencies. At the time when we were doing the reporting, the attacks were coming from the N.S.A., the C.I.A., and the Deep State against me and against my source, Edward Snowden and against the reporting. And we knew they were lying constantly and disseminating propaganda in a very powerful way. So we set out to say, we're going to investigate them. We are going to be skeptical of them. We are going to subject their assertions to critical scrutiny. And I am so embarrassed and angered that the media outlet that I created along with two other excellent journalists to do that, the only article it published about all of these documents that have emerged about Joe Biden other than a column of mine, where I denounced Facebook and Twitter for censoring it was an article that made reference in passing to those documents, very snidely and dismissively to say that no one should pay attention to it, because it was Russian disinformation. And it cited a letter from John Brennan, James Clapper, Mike Hayden, and the rest of the goons from the C.I.A. and the Intelligence Community asserting it and where still that letter said we have no evidence that Russia is involved in any of this. \"The Intercept\" omitted that phrase, simply cited that letter to try and encourage people to ignore this evidence on the grounds that Russia had manufactured it and that the evidence was fabricated, even though there's never been any evidence that that's been true and everything since has just proven it showing Russia was not involved in any of this. And nobody, certainly not even Joe Biden disputes that these e-mails and other text messages are completely real and authentic."

And the reason it's disappeared is because the C.I.A. from the very first days of the Trump administration, even before he was inaugurated, devoted themselves to sabotaging the administration because Donald Trump questioned just a few of their pieties, and that can't be done in Washington and whoever does that must be destroyed. And so the C.I.A. and the Deep State operatives became heroes of the liberal left. The people who support the Democratic Party, they are now in a full union with the neocons, the Bush-Cheney operatives, the C.I.A., Silicon Valley, and Wall Street. That is the union of power along with mainstream media outlets that are fully behind the Democratic Party which is likely to at least take over one branch of government, if not all of them in the coming election. And that is a very alarming proposition because they are authoritarian. They believe in censorship, and they believe in suppression of information that exposes them in any kind of a critical light."

They are supposed to spy on foreign adversary governments, but they weren't. They were collecting our phone records. Same with the C.I.A. They are trained disinformation agents, that's what they do. They lie for a living. But they are supposed to do that in other countries where we want to induce some sort of change, overthrow a government, topple a regime, whatever, quote-unquote, \"interference,\" the U.S. government wants to do the way we are all so upset that Russia did in 2016. That's what they are trained to do. The law though, and the obvious foundational prohibition on having a security state -- a national security state after World War II was it was never supposed to be turned domestically. They weren't supposed to be involved in our politics or disseminating propaganda. Go turn on any of those other cable networks or pick up the op-ed page of any of the biggest newspapers and all you'll see are ex-members of the C.I.A., the D.O.J., the F.B.I., the N.S.A., telling Americans what they ought to believe. They have infiltrated the means of communication domestically. They do it through leaks. They do it through clandestine operations and through lies. They propagandize the American people in a way that is incredibly dangerous no matter what your ideology is."

Ask the many other countries around the world that have built walls? Why do they do that? That's true. So maybe there was some mistake. Maybe Twitter did this by accident. So Mark Morgan appealed his ban. And here's what Twitter wrote back to him, quote, \"Our support team has determined that a violation did take place, and therefore we will not overturn our decision. You will not be able to access Twitter.\" End quote. In other words, we banned you on purpose. Truth is not a defense in this country. If we don't like what you're saying or its political effect, we will silence you. So there wasn't inevitably news coverage of this. After 20 hours, Twitter reversed its decision claiming as Twitter always does, it was a big misunderstanding, quote, \"After reviewing your account, it looks like we made an error.\" But they didn't make an error.

Well, today UPS returned the flash drive that disappeared in this new envelope, not in the original envelope. But what they didn't include was an explanation for what happened. What have we learned about that? We've spent all day reporting on it. We will tell you straight ahead."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Last night, we told you about a pretty weird experience we had this week. On Monday, one of our producers in New York overnighted a package to our executive producer, Justin Wells and to me in Los Angeles where we were there preparing for an interview with the former Biden family business partner called Tony Bobulinski. Somewhere along the way, the contents of that package disappeared. Inside it was a flash drive that contained primary documents pertaining to the Biden family. We should tell you those documents did not come from Tony Bobulinski, and of course, we made a copy of those files before we sent them because we're careful. We get a lot of documents from a lot of different sources all the time, but that's especially true in election years. Before we put them on the air, we have to determine first whether they are real -- these were real -- whether they are newsworthy, and whether it's legal to show them. We wanted to assess what we have and we're still assessing it. But the point is, the package never arrived. Proprietary reporting on the Biden family, documents sent between journalists by supposedly secure overnight mail disappeared. They vanished on the same day we were conducting a heavily publicized interview based in part on documents from the Biden family. So as you can imagine, we wanted to know what happened. Unfortunately, we still don't know what happened. This morning UPS issued a press release announcing they had found our flash drive and then boasting about their Customer Service, quote, \"UPS will always focus first on our customers and will never stop working to solve issues,\" which is fine. UPS is a reliable company. They rarely lose anything. We agree with that. That's why we use them in the first place. And yet, they lost our Biden documents. How? UPS won't tell us how. We spent a lot of the day talking to executives there. They claimed that the flash drive was found on Monday night by an hourly employee at the UPS building on 43rd Street in Manhattan. They suggested it might have been sitting on the floor there. They couldn't prove that because remarkably, in a room where millions of high value packages are handled, there are no security cameras. That's what they told us. UPS says the employee who found our flash drive simply dropped it on top of a supervisor's desk. Our documents sat there undiscovered for more than 24 hours until we announced on television that they were missing. That's their story. Obviously, we had some questions about it. But UPS executives did not answer our questions, quote, \"There are no more details. Security is returning it. Apologies again that we were unable to deliver it next day at the service level you requested.\" Our exchanges went on like this for hours, and the main question we had never changed. How did our flash drive get separated from the package that we sent it in? That seemed like something worth knowing. The envelope was securely sealed. We know that. Two witnesses saw our producer seal it and UPS does not dispute that. Was the package torn open accidentally by a machine? That seems unlikely. UPS says that almost never happens. So we're left with the obvious explanation. Someone for some reason, opened our package and removed a flash drive containing documents that were damaging to the Biden family. We'd love to know who would do that and why. It would be helpful to see the envelope itself, but UPS says we can't see it because they threw it away. So here we are. We got our flash drive back today, and that's great. But we'd really like are some answers."

But there are a lot of documents about Hunter Biden's personal life that we haven't brought to you and we're not going to and we should tell you why. One is the obvious answer. He is not running for President, and so to the extent those documents pertain to his dad, of course. But Hunter Biden is a fallen man at this point, and I should also say that I knew Hunter Biden fairly well. We lived near each other in Washington for quite some time. I knew his wife who is an absolutely outstanding person, a good person. I never thought Hunter Biden was a bad person. I thought he had demons. But in the time I knew him, he kept them mostly under control. At some point he lost control of those demons and the world knows that now. He is now humiliated and alone. It's probably too strong to say we feel sorry for Hunter Biden. But the point is, pounding on a man, jumping on, piling on, when he is already down is something that we don't want to be involved in.

They took the tweet down, and then they put out a statement saying that the tweet was viewed as partisan and political and they are a nonpartisan and nonpolitical organization. However, here's the kicker, Tucker, they have previously sent out support of Hillary Clinton in 2017, and even prior to that and they put out a tribute to the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg. So as a former Girl Scout, the message is clear to young girls across the country and that message is, you don't count unless you're a liberal. And that's the same message that Hillary Clinton and her campaign sent in 2016 when Madeleine Albright said that there is a special place in hell for women that don't support Clinton. It's the same message that Joe Biden is sending to black voters that you aren't black if you don't support him.

So that's why we're so divided, because you're essentially shutting out half of America from the equation. And that's the problem.

Kanye West, sort of. He has met with the President many times since he supports some of his policies. Of course, Zuby, probably the best-known rapper in the entire United Kingdom. But this evening, we add another rap artist to the list, the musician, Lil Wayne. In case you're not a fan, his real name is Dwayne Carter, tweeted about an hour ago this, \"Just had a great meeting with Donald Trump. Besides what he's done so far with Criminal Justice Reform, the Platinum Plan is going to give the community real ownership.

You can't make this year up. It's just too good. Well, it's not just the presidency, of course on the line next week, it's the Senate, and so this is a topic we probably haven't spent enough time taking a look at.

      "utterance": "Well, there are several, but we're going to -- we don't have enough time to get to all of them and be like, totally nerd out with me. But I think one thing to keep in mind overall, Tucker, is that there are very few ticket splitters left. That means that when people go to vote, they're voting straight Republican or straight Democrat. We used to get a little bit more ticket splitting in the past, but those days are kind of behind us. But President Trump in this last week, obviously, he is working very hard to try to close this and that could really help make the difference between a Chuck Schumer or a Mitch McConnell-led senate next year. I would start in Georgia. There are two Senate races in Georgia and Georgia has a system that if you don't get to 50 percent, you have to go to a runoff in January. Well, one of those races is definitely going to a run off. That is the Kelly Loeffler and Doug Collins race. They're not going to get to 50 percent. The other one, though, is incumbent Senator David Perdue against Jon Ossoff. Now, this one is a lot closer. And I think that David Perdue, he has announced that he is not going to do the final debate with Jon Ossoff and instead will join President Trump at a rally on Sunday. That probably makes sense for him. He did not have a great debate the other night. And I also think that it shows that President Trump is not taking Georgia for granted. So Georgia is one that I would look at. I mean, the Republicans are a little nervous on that one. Another one, Tucker, is Arizona. President Trump is going to be there on Tuesday. Trump and Biden both very much want to win Arizona. The senator there that's up for election is Martha McSally. That race is going to be tough, but she has a very good ground game probably better than any of the other Senate candidates. And she is bringing in Mike Lee and Ted Cruz to campaign for her this weekend. However, that race -- however the President does there is probably how she will do there. So that one is one to watch. The last one is North Carolina. Cal Cunningham is the Democrat. He is basically trying to take Thom Tillis out. Cal Cunningham is running on character, Tucker, and about a month ago, it surfaced and he has been having an extramarital affair and he has been trying to hide from the media and not talk about that. That now race is probably within one point. So North Carolina is another one to watch."

Gary Peters doesn't have a great -- you know, he just doesn't have a great campaign.

They started attacking me. They immediately punched me in the face. And what was interesting was, they were specifically targeting white journalists as there were other great journalists that were there that were people of color, but they were leaving them alone. And you see the racial divide in this country where, you know, it's not only not safe to be a reporter telling the truth, but also the racial tensions have made things very difficult in this country with the narratives that are being played. I mean, the man had a gun, and I'll say this, I was lucky enough, I owe it to God and I give praise to Jesus for saving my life in that moment, because just right outside a few hundred yards away, or a hundred yards or so, a 15-year-old girl was shot, multiple guns were fired.

You're telling me this is an exaggeration? Well, you know, I'm taking blows for America and you're sitting there in your fancy desk and your nice salary telling us, real reporters, why we're wrong. And that's why I have a whole tell-all, you know, I have a show called \"Slightly Offensive\" that covers all of this. It is a Blaze TV show. And tomorrow on YouTube, I'm going in the step by step because journalism is dead in this country and it's dangerous. And I know why the journalists don't go out there and do this. It's because it actually takes a risk. It requires sacrifice. And that's been lost today in our country, and it breaks my heart to realize that people are not getting truth. They are just getting opinion. And the truth that's being set free out there by many brave and amazing independent and right-wing journalists, and even some independent and left- wing journalists, is being shut down by the corporate media companies, because they refuse to show to America what is really happening, and I think Americans deserve better this election season."

      "utterance": "Now, a more ominous story and it comes from the U.K., from Scotland, where a lot of trends that we wind up living with do begin. In Scotland, an ominously called Hate Crime and Public Order Bill now under consideration would allow the authorities to arrest people for things they say in their own homes at the dinner table. So why is a public order bill focused on what people do in private? That's a good question. And what exactly is hate speech? Since everyone is against it, does hate speech including praising a border wall? Well, according to legislation, it would. Under this legislation, you would not be allowed to, quote, \"Stir up hatred of any kind.\" You could be arrested, if you did. In other words, disagreeing with people would be a crime if those people had power. So how long before we face laws like this in the United States? It is possible. Pedro Gonzalez is an Assistant Editor at \"American Greatness.\" We're happy to have him on tonight. Peter, thanks for coming on. So first, let's just define the terms because I think it's helpful to know what we're talking about, what is hate speech? PEDRO GONZALEZ, ASSISTANT EDITOR, \"AMERICAN GREATNESS\": Hate speech is whatever the people prosecuting you for hate speech, say it is, and that sounds a little bit reductionist, but that's really what it comes down to. It is an entirely subjective standard that these people think society ought to be organized around, and if you disagree, well, you're going to prison."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So if you allow the people in charge to define hate speech unchallenged, and we're allowing that here in this country, then what you're doing is handing them power over your mind, and crushing all dissent. Right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GONZALEZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's exactly right. This is very dystopian. This is right out of Minority Report. It's basically pre-crime. We need to know what you're saying in the privacy of your home, so that those words cannot become actions. And, you know, we have to basically throw you in prison before you can act against some victim group. Now, this stuff only goes one way. Of course, it's only ever directed at victim groups and it seems to always work against white people, whether it's in Europe or the United States. It has the exact opposite effect in my view. It is profoundly divisive because you're creating resentment in society for basically every group that's excluded from the protections of - - because let's say, supposedly, the hate speech ideal is sincere. We want to protect everyone from hate speech."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GONZALEZ",
      "utterance": "It would be still wrong, but at least somewhat understandable. But it's not like that. Only some groups deserve protections from speech, others do not. And I think it inches us closer towards a kind of war of all against all by inculcating this kind of resentment in people if it doesn't just crush them outright."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That is such a smart and subtle point. So what you're saying is, a law purportedly designed to suppress extremism causes it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GONZALEZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. When you tell people that because of their immutable characteristics, being born white, for example, or something like that that you need to be treated as a potential terrorist, and that we need to know what you're saying in the privacy of your home when you're talking to your friends and family. I mean that either that's either going to psychologically break you and make you kind of just a docile little automaton, which is, I think what these people would love on the one hand, or it's going to drive you towards extremism, which I think they would also love. Because every time someone acts out like this, when they've been just driven mad, it feeds their narrative, like, see, here's proof, here's a justification for what we're doing, and now, we're going to ratchet it up a little bit more."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, why not just treat everyone the same and use the same standard for everyone? I mean, isn't that -- I thought that was the goal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GONZALEZ",
      "utterance": "Right, well, that's what good people think, and that would make too much sense and it would be -- I think it would be too easy or we are not as contrived, I should say. I think it's hard for decent people, for good people to look at this and see it for what it really is. Because again, on the surface, it's -- we're doing this to protect certain people -- but that's not really what it's about. It's really about power. I think even calling it a double standard is mistaken. This is about enforcing a kind of hierarchy with the people that are enforcing and creating these laws, ostensibly to protect others, they are the ones obviously at the top of this. They are the ones that we need to give all the power to, so they can keep the rest of us safe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That is a very, very smart and too rarely noted point. And I appreciate it. This causes extremism and it's really about power. That is exactly right. Pedro Gonzalez, thanks for coming on tonight."
