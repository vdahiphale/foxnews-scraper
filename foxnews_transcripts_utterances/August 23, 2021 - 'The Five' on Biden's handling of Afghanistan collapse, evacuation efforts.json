Do you think Americans can just go to the Kabul airport and take up on the next flight? They can't, so they are stranded. So, I don't even know why she is arguing about that word. It reminds me of it's not a crisis at the border, it's a challenge. That's what they are doing. They are worried about messaging, all right? So, at first it was things are going great, and now it's, it was always going to be a mess. Or, we plan for this, and then, no one could a plan for this. Or people are clinging from the wings of airplanes, that was four days ago, now it's my heart breaks for these people. Hey, get to the airport and you will get out as soon as you can. no, no, no. Actually, no, don't go to the airport now, elevated terror threats, or now it's we are going to get out by September 11th, no, no, no, we are going to have to possibly stay past September 11th, and now it's a game of chicken with the Taliban. Taliban has a deal after September 11th, deal is off, so you are going to get into an actual, right, actual hostage crisis with live rounds. We don't know what the Talibans are capable of. We've seen the reports from the airport. Twenty casualties firing bullets into a crowd. Women getting their teeth knocked out. babies getting trampled to death. American passports getting torn up like that. Americans being beaten. So, right now, Talibans are basically the gate agent. We had to go to the Taliban, here is my passport, either they rip it up or they ask for a bride. You don't have any money, AK to the kneecap. Maybe you'll come up with some money tomorrow. That's how it is. You can't have a plan like this where you are at the mercy of a terrorist organization. Biden stranded Americans in a war zone then try to go back on vacation, Dana. Could you imagine any other president that tried to pull that off? Create a humanitarian crisis, arm the enemy then try to go back on vacation. he sold us as he was the gut that was compassionate and confident, he hasn't shown either.",

He also had a hurricane to deal with, so they obviously know it's incredibly serious. The polling it seems like took the biggest dip because of the COVID response, which I know something that we'll talk about later in the show as well, it's a huge crisis on his plate. But the dichotomy between, you know, what you are hearing and the images is something that's really hard to take especially when you see a two-year-old trampled. Right? Those are things that you can't unsee in your life and I think that what we have been noticing, or at least what I've been noticing is the shift to focusing on how are we going to get these people out and that August 31st deadline? Because we are not negotiating with a normal government, we are negotiating with bunch of terrorists who now run a country. And August 31st if they even hold to that is only eight days away. So, it will be interesting to see what comes out of the G7 meeting tomorrow that Boris Johnson is convening if they have a plan, because it seems like the brits have actually been making a good amount of progress --",

But now what we are seeing is the objects of they're not going to say that it is the Taliban that's doing this, but now we are going to hear well, we didn't know that ISIS is going to come back and Al Qaeda has come back. Because the Taliban in itself when they talk to the government, this is not a unified group. They are basically tribes of different little warlords that do different things. They have no control over what their soldiers do on the field to civilians, we're seeing that. And when they are told to go to the airport it's literally now what mob can get through fastest? They are (Inaudible) thing -- they're not even getting a chance to vet people and things like that because they are literally climbing over the walls. Why?

And I asked them what they were most concerned about, their first question, the answer by saying their friends and family, and they didn't know if they would be OK and if they would be targeted by the Taliban. But after that they went back to thinking about university and how the seniors in the group wanted to finish their semester so they could get their degree. And I thought that really got to the core of the real people of Afghanistan. Because the Taliban do not represent the people of Afghanistan. It's a small extremist subgroup, a very moderate population in Kabul. People with shops, people who are students, doctors, lawyers, and then you see this group simply walk into the city and take over ultimately the entire country. And now all of the international community focused on Afghanistan and people are concerned. They may never be able to return home.",

Do you think Americans can just go to the Kabul airport and take up on the next flight? They can't, so they are stranded. So, I don't even know why she is arguing about that word. It reminds me of it's not a crisis at the border, it's a challenge. That's what they are doing. They are worried about messaging, all right? So, at first it was things are going great, and now it's, it was always going to be a mess. Or, we plan for this, and then, no one could a plan for this. Or people are clinging from the wings of airplanes, that was four days ago, now it's my heart breaks for these people. Hey, get to the airport and you will get out as soon as you can. no, no, no. Actually, no, don't go to the airport now, elevated terror threats, or now it's we are going to get out by September 11th, no, no, no, we are going to have to possibly stay past September 11th, and now it's a game of chicken with the Taliban. Taliban has a deal after September 11th, deal is off, so you are going to get into an actual, right, actual hostage crisis with live rounds. We don't know what the Talibans are capable of. We've seen the reports from the airport. Twenty casualties firing bullets into a crowd. Women getting their teeth knocked out. babies getting trampled to death. American passports getting torn up like that. Americans being beaten. So, right now, Talibans are basically the gate agent. We had to go to the Taliban, here is my passport, either they rip it up or they ask for a bride. You don't have any money, AK to the kneecap. Maybe you'll come up with some money tomorrow. That's how it is. You can't have a plan like this where you are at the mercy of a terrorist organization. Biden stranded Americans in a war zone then try to go back on vacation, Dana. Could you imagine any other president that tried to pull that off? Create a humanitarian crisis, arm the enemy then try to go back on vacation. he sold us as he was the gut that was compassionate and confident, he hasn't shown either."

And now we have multiple per day. Jake Sullivan, Ned Price out there. Jen Psaki is back at the podium every day. The president spoke twice over the weekend. He also had a hurricane to deal with, so they obviously know it's incredibly serious. The polling it seems like took the biggest dip because of the COVID response, which I know something that we'll talk about later in the show as well, it's a huge crisis on his plate. But the dichotomy between, you know, what you are hearing and the images is something that's really hard to take especially when you see a two-year-old trampled. Right? Those are things that you can't unsee in your life and I think that what we have been noticing, or at least what I've been noticing is the shift to focusing on how are we going to get these people out and that August 31st deadline? Because we are not negotiating with a normal government, we are negotiating with bunch of terrorists who now run a country. And August 31st if they even hold to that is only eight days away. So, it will be interesting to see what comes out of the G7 meeting tomorrow that Boris Johnson is convening if they have a plan, because it seems like the brits have actually been making a good amount of progress --"

The simplest thing was is that before you pull the troops out, you get the other people out. I mean, neither one of us our military guys and it makes perfect sense to us. But now what we are seeing is the objects of they're not going to say that it is the Taliban that's doing this, but now we are going to hear well, we didn't know that ISIS is going to come back and Al Qaeda has come back. Because the Taliban in itself when they talk to the government, this is not a unified group. They are basically tribes of different little warlords that do different things. They have no control over what their soldiers do on the field to civilians, we're seeing that. And when they are told to go to the airport it's literally now what mob can get through fastest? They are (Inaudible) thing -- they're not even getting a chance to vet people and things like that because they are literally climbing over the walls. Why? Because they are getting shot in the streets. The women are getting beat up. Like there is nothing about what he is talking about matches what we are seeing on the ground.

So, they can have that communication, but the big question remains even if you are talking to the U.S. State Department and the American military, how do you get to them? How do you get to the airport in Kabul? And we keep hearing line repeated over and over by the Biden administration that there is a plan, even today press secretary Jen Psaki telling Fox's Peter Doocy that it wasn't appropriate to call Americans in Afghanistan stranded. There are Afghanistan -- Afghans who are stranded, but there are also Americans who are stranded in Afghanistan. Very clearly, not only in Kabul. You know, we've been talking a lot about Kabul and the capital Afghanistan, but there's other major cities where Americans were living, Herat, Kandahar, the second and third largest cities in the country. Those are going to be major areas of concern for the American people and the Biden administration as they look to try to get Americans out of Afghanistan.

And I do wonder, maybe he has better information about being able to reach the State department. I listen to an interview today where a guy said, and he's trying to get his wife out, but he e-mails -- they say, you know, e- mail the State Department, he e-mails the State Department and it bounce back because the e-mail inbox is full. And so, there's not a surge of people that is able to handle the incoming at the State Department.

A group of five young women and it was so interesting to talk to them, because like young women who are university students anywhere in the world, they were focused on school and on exams. And I asked them what they were most concerned about, their first question, the answer by saying their friends and family, and they didn't know if they would be OK and if they would be targeted by the Taliban. But after that they went back to thinking about university and how the seniors in the group wanted to finish their semester so they could get their degree. And I thought that really got to the core of the real people of Afghanistan. Because the Taliban do not represent the people of Afghanistan. It's a small extremist subgroup, a very moderate population in Kabul. People with shops, people who are students, doctors, lawyers, and then you see this group simply walk into the city and take over ultimately the entire country. And now all of the international community focused on Afghanistan and people are concerned. They may never be able to return home."

Look, competence is a very hard thing to earn, it's very easy to lose and it's nearly impossible to get back. And the fact that this crisis is going on, they can't put a button on it, because the Taliban apparently is calling the shots. And they are the ones deciding when America is going to have to cut off its evacuation procedures. And the fact that you have this disconnect, the president saying one thing, his cabinet and staff saying another, and then the rest of us watching and reporting on this story and seeing yet another thing shows that there is a real daylight between all of these different organizations. And that, remember, that President Biden and his whole campaign was about we will calm things down. There will be order. There will be competence, there will be coherence. And that lasted for a little bit, right? So, they get there. The vaccines are going. They're trying to get that done. COVID numbers -- his approval ratings on COVID was pretty good. And now we have the Delta variant. And maybe they declared victory a little bit too early on July 4th. And Americans usually take August to sort of relax and regroup and reset before school starts. That's not true this August. The parents are paying attention because they are worried about schools being open, and masks in school, or not masks in school, whatever it might be. They are worried about their parents who might end up with a breakthrough infection and they're also worried about the fact that America's credibility in the world is on the line right now.

Like, I lost my son to cancer. I mean, that was -- as someone who just lost their father to cancer, that resonated with me that he understood what's going on there.

And then we saw it again with the mask, backtracking. We didn't like that. That seemed unsteady.

So far, he hasn't put her in charge of Afghanistan. She also said that it could not be a bigger priority for us, number one priority, she said from the tarmac in Singapore or Vietnam, wherever she was. I'm perfectly fine with the vice president going and doing the job that the President asked her to do. If he needs her to go to Vietnam and Singapore to shore up relations there as obviously Southeast Asia is going to be an important region for us going forward, especially with this Afghanistan thing. If I could just talk a little bit about the other optics. Optics is one of those things where you could like, kind of blow it off and say, well, that's not really substantive, right? But there was a heaviness for me over the weekend. There was a heaviness like, from people that I talked to, my mom, my sister, my sister's hairstylist. Everyone is feeling the weight of what was going on in Afghanistan and wanting to know what's going on, what's going on, what's going on. You have people who are e-mailing the State Department and getting out of my inboxes for the type of messages and it just felt kind of bad. One of the great things about America is that our men and women in uniform, they go and fight so that we can enjoy our freedoms.
