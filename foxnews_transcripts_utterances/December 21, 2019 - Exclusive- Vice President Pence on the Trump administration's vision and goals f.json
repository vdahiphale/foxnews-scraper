      "utterance": "Hello, and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. And Merry Christmas. We have a big show on deck tonight to get you in the Christmas spirit with more of my exclusive sit-down with Vice President Mike Pence. He'll tell me how the Pence family celebrates Christmas. Plus, I'll be joined by Corey Lewandowski, Charlie Kirk, and more. And later, I head to the White House to give you a behind-the-scenes look into how they prepare all the amazing sweet treats and desserts during the holiday season. Also, tonight, “Street Justice” is back. You won't want to miss a minute. But let's start with the impeachment mess, as we look ahead to the Senate trial. My next guest continues to fight endlessly for President Trump and the truth amid this endless barrage of nonsense from the Democrats. Member of House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Matt Gaetz joins me now. All right, Congressman, thanks for being with us. So, you know, as all of this has unfolded -- I want to look back before we look forward to the Senate and what's going to happen in the new year. But, clearly, this impeachment -- and Nancy Pelosi answered a press question and said, actually, that she's been working on impeachment for two-and-a-half years. So, I guess she has pretty much admitted that this is not something that just came up because of Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Rep. Matt Gaetz",
      "utterance": "That's right, Judge. The radical left Democrats filled the stockings of their anti-Trump base with rumor, and innuendo, and, ultimately, impeachment. But the rest of America, we just got a lump of coal. We didn't get an infrastructure bill. We didn't get reform to our asylum systems because Nancy Pelosi has been planning this impeachment since the moment she took power. Matter of fact, Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, even campaigned to his fellow Democrats on the notion that he would be the person to bring us to this point. But the real question, Judge, is why Democrats failed to meet the standard they set for themselves. They promised us a bipartisan impeachment. In reality, the only bipartisan vote was a bipartisan vote against impeachment. They promised us that these hearings would animate a lot of public support for impeachment. And we haven't seen that, either. The American people hate this. And if Congress continues it, they may end up hating us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "Well, in the end, I mean, they -- truthfully, I think that Congress moved quickly toward the end of the year simply because they realized that the support for impeachment is almost -- right now, especially among the Independents and those in the middle -- it is just declining day after day. So, I think that they made a decision, \"Well, let's end this soon, because it's starting to look bad for us.\" But let's talk about -- in light of what you've been through, and the fact that the president was not able to present a case, and cross-examine witnesses, and to issue a rebuttal, and all the things that all the other presidents have been entitled to do, in addition to the fact that this was something not brought by an independent counsel, but by one party against this president, do you think that things will change in the Senate? How do you think they're going to handle it over there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt Gaetz",
      "utterance": "I know the president wants a -- an extended trial in the Senate, so he has the opportunity to present a lot of evidence. But, Judge, if this were a case in your court, brought by any party, you would dismiss it on a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "Summary judgment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt Gaetz",
      "utterance": "-- immediately."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "Yep."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt Gaetz",
      "utterance": "And the reason you would do that is because it's not worth judicial labor just for someone to spike the football when the other side hasn't made their case. As we sit here before you now, Democrats failed to produce direct evidence, they failed to get the public on their side. There was no quid pro quo. Matter of fact, the only direct evidence was the president saying he did not want anything other than President Zelensky to do the right thing, to do the work that he had campaigned on. And so, if I were in the Senate, I'd be looking to get this nonsense behind us and get onto the work of the Trump agenda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "But there are people who say, \"Look, the Republicans have been treated like garbage by the House. They've thrown away all the rules, not just in Congress, but of due process. They have denied this president everything that every other president has been given. This is totally partisan. It predicts -- it is a blueprint for any major party throwing out a president of the opposite party and so maybe it's time to pull the -- you know, to pull the -- take away the veil and to identify the whistleblower, to get Joe Biden, Hunter Biden. I'm all in favor of that. Adam Schiff, I want to know when you got this case, I want to know who you told about it, I want to know what your relationship is with the whistleblower, and on and on. I think the American public is entitled to that. And we don't have to go on and on for months, but don't you think honesty and transparency is important?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt Gaetz",
      "utterance": "Those are all reasonable questions. They were reasonable questions when the president asked them specifically about the Bidens and Burisma and the corrupt activities that they were engaged in globally, but we can conduct oversight in the absence of impeachment. Here's how I'd do it if I were Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham. Step one, impeachment is dead, off the table, over. Let the president and his administration continue their great work for the country. Step two, let's hold some Oversight hearings in the Judiciary Committee, in the Foreign Affairs Committee. Let's find out the extent to which we may have had a U.S. administration in the Obama-Biden administration actually cheating, actually participating in a shakedown scheme where we were selling access based on where a member of the Second Family had an unexplained employment agreement. And so, I think that if we were able to do that, we free up the president to go do the great work of the country, and then we can actually get the answers that you -- to the questions that you have very reasonably raised."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "But, you know, if you recall, back a few weeks ago, I mean, they decided in Judiciary not to take the vote at night because they wanted the vote to be in the morning so all America could see it. I mean, isn't that a good argument to at least get it into the Senate? I mean, with all due respect, the Senate dealing with impeachment is going to get a little more attention than Oversight, wouldn't you agree, Congressman?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matt Gaetz",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that if Lindsey Graham brings Hunter Biden before his Judiciary Committee, it won't matter whether it's an impeachment proceeding or an Oversight proceeding. I think we'll all be tuning in. But, you know, where I'm from, they call that all hat and no cattle, and that's certainly what we saw from House Democrats. Everything they did, from the theatrical performance of Adam Schiff of a fake transcript to Jerry Nadler playing all kind of weird games about the timing of the vote, the whole deal was driving for television consumption --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "It's very sad, and honestly, I mean, I think a lot of Americans want to get back to the business of doing America's business, and, you know, I do, too. But, you know, there's also a part of me that said, “You tried to take this man down that we put in office, and shame on you.” But anyway, Congressman Matt Gaetz, Merry Christmas to you. Thank you so much."

Let's keep the conversation going now with two warriors in the fight against the radical left. I'm joined now by former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowsky, as well as Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. My favorite guys here. Thanks for being here. All right, guys, you know, let's look forward to the Senate trial, or not a Senate trial. Corey, I'll start with you. They had the thinnest, weakest, frailest, most partisan impeachment that I've ever seen, and as Congressman Matt Gaetz has just said, I mean, it wouldn't get past a summary judgment motion in a courtroom. But given that, where do you think the Senate should be going in January?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Corey Lewandowski",
      "utterance": "Look, Judge, I think the Senate should move very quickly in this. I agree with what Congressman Gaetz said. I know the president has talked in theory about having a long, drawn-out trial --"

      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "Yes, he has."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Corey Lewandowski",
      "utterance": "-- but he's winning right now. You look at these 31 Democrats sitting in congressional districts that Donald Trump won in 2016, and they have to decide, do they want to continue to be members of Congress? Because they are not going to be successful. Public opinion has turned on this. The president is winning, and when this is in the U.S. Senate, the Democrats who are up for reelection in those difficult states -- they have to explain to their constituents why they were going to vote to remove a duly elected president when no crime was committed. Let's get this done quickly. Let's get a transportation infrastructure spending bill done, let's get health care across state lines, and let's continue to grow the economy, which is what this president has been doing."
    },

      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",

Okay, he says -- when they said, “What's the crime?” he said, “The greatest crime. It's a crime against the Constitution.” What's the crime? Do you know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charlie Kirk",
      "utterance": "No, the crime in their own minds, is the fact he won an election he was not supposed to win, and Corey remembers it vividly, because he was a big part of it."

      "utterance": "That's right."

      "speaker": "Charlie Kirk",

Remember, this is a rebellion presidency in the sense that he's actually representing the wants and the needs of the American people. They want this impeachment to be punitive. They want to make an example out of him, that “if you dare challenge the ruling class and try to close the borders and reestablish American sovereignty and challenge the idea that America was just a nation in decline, then we will go and punish you.” There's no crime here. I mean, they're saying obstruction of Congress. I mean, what does that even mean? I mean, it sounds like a traffic violation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charlie Kirk",
      "utterance": "That's correct. That's exactly right. And one final point with this is that the left always likes to say that they believe in democracy, that they believe in representation of the people, power to the people. Well, the Founding Fathers put impeachment as an emergency declaration if there were high crimes and treason. My goodness, this has now become so politicized that the left values the replacement of this president more than the love of our country and respect for the United States Constitution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "And I assume, Corey, that going forward, if the -- whether, as Matt Gaetz suggested, whether Lindsey Graham holds some hearings in the Senate Judiciary, that that would satisfy to a certain extent the fact that there's so much lying, there's so much partisanship, there's so much that they did to destroy this president that it really does need to come out, does it not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Corey Lewandowski",
      "utterance": "It does, Judge, but we also heard the president in the last couple weeks talking about the fact that at some point in the future, there'll be a Democrat president of the United States, and there will be Republican members of the body in the House that are going to impeach this president for the same thing. Is that what our country has become? We disagree politically with someone, so we're going to use the highest laws against them in an impeachment? This is outrageous. The American people are tired of this. Let the people get back to work for America and continue to grow our economy and continue to renegotiate the bad trade deals. Congress has failed the American people, and they will be accountable at the ballot box in 2020."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "And you know, Charlie, one of the things you said when you talked about the president not being part of the ruling class -- you know, the ruling class actually did believe in making sure that illegal immigration was dealt with, you know, legally, that they -- you know, and Obama certainly sent back a huge number of illegal immigrants, but it's not that. They know they've lost America. That's why they want the illegals to come in."

      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "They want the illegals who now have the ability to vote in -- to get a license in 13 or 14 states -- they can use those licenses as a point of identification to vote. So, it's all about power. It's not even about --"
    },

      "utterance": "Go ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charlie Kirk",
      "utterance": "Yes, and the fact that President Trump is actually succeeding horrifies them. Remember, they were never worried that President Trump was going to fail. They were horrified that he might actually succeed, that someone with no political background that could come down an escalator in a field full of 16 Republican candidates, challenge two ruling-class dynasties at once, the media, the deep state, get spied, overcome the voter fraud, win, and then actually be a successful president. These things are not supposed to happen in the playbook that is designed by the Washington Beltway that quite honestly has contempt for the American people. It's not that they disagree with mainstream Midwest American values; they think less of that part of the country, and they want to go after this president because he dares challenge that status quo."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "And they have contempt also for the law, Corey. I mean, you look at Adam Schiff, who then gets the records of Devin Nunes, the telephone records. He should have been put on notice; the telephone company should have at least put someone on notice. There should have been an awareness. Then Lindsey Graham says in the Senate -- I mean, shifty Schiff -- I can't -- you know, this guy is always lying. But you know, that was -- getting those telephone logs -- what were they going to tell him? They weren't going to tell him a conversation. They weren't the essence. They weren't a wiretap. But you know, now Lindsey Graham says, “No, I'm not going to ask for anybody's records.” I mean, there's a part of America, that middle America that Charlie is talking about, that wants their pound of flesh, too, because they feel like they've been victimized over and over, and we play by the Marquess of Queensberry rules."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Corey Lewandowski",
      "utterance": "Judge, we've said so many times the Republicans are too nice. Can you imagine if the Republicans were releasing phone records of a member of the press, which they've done to John Solomon and their colleagues, that they've done to Devin Nunes? There would be outrage from every other major media outlet in the country, but none when it's a conservative. Look, we still have a criminal referral pending for Andy McCabe and the Justice Department --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Corey Lewandowski",
      "utterance": "-- and we haven't had any -- Judge, this why Middle America is so outraged, because there are two different sets of rules. One, if you're a Trump supporter, they go after you, and won't if you support the left. Andy McCabe continues to have a criminal referral that they've done nothing with. We need accountability. The American people deserve it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "Well, you know what, Corey? I just want to be clear on something. It's not just a criminal referral. The deputy attorney general, in response to these cases, when it's a high-profile person going up, has given the approval for the filing of the charges. So what is taking so long? Who is stopping it? Charlie, you've got to wonder yourself. Now that the inspector general's report came out a couple of weeks ago, what's going on with that FISA judge? Why isn't that FISA court judge, who signed the original warrant and the three subsequent warrant, why isn't he or she flipping their lid, at this point? Why isn't John Roberts --"

      "speaker": "Charlie Kirk",
      "utterance": "I completely and totally agree. And part of that inspector general report, they said there were 17 mistakes, all of which were, again, against President Trump. Those are not mistakes. Those are intentional political biases. A mistake would be a -- some for Trump and some for Hillary. Those are understandable mistakes. You had institutional political bias, not to mention the text messages that we had from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. It is so disappointing. And I -- if you go and you see why there's so much angst, and anxiety, and discontent with the Washington, D.C. congressional ruling class, it's because, as Corey put it, it seems as if there's two standards of justice: one, if you are friends with the right people and you --"

We know we can be stronger than ever before. We know we can be more prosperous than ever before. We know we can reaffirm our commitment to all the timeless values and ideals that have made America great in the past and keep America great in the future.

Unable to spend the holidays with their families, NASA sent the astronauts some Christmas cheer, the group ringing in this holiday season with smoked salmon and fruitcake.

The printing presses have started; the assembly lines are warming up to manufacture more Trump hats, Trump T-shirts, sweatshirts, bumper stickers, even dog leashes with Conan at the helm. The Democrats have just hoisted themselves on their own petard, guaranteeing Donald Trump reelection in 2020. Nancy Pelosi, wrapping herself in God, country, and the American flag, has called for the impeachment of the 45th president of the United States, unleashing her loony leftist partisans in the most blatant political effort to impeach a duly elected president in history, who they have viciously attacked from day one. Mr. Pinocchio himself, Adam Schiff, and his band of puppeteers who know absolutely nothing about the Ukraine phone call, testified first in the star chamber sub-basement of Congress. Now, those who pass rehearsal get to come up and peddle their talking points in Congress, where there was no defined scope of the inquiry, no ability to confront the accuser, no right to call witnesses, no rebuttal, no subpoena power, no right, in fact, to be present. Now, Democrats laugh and pooh-pooh the complaints about lack of process, but what makes America different from dictatorships is that everyone is cloaked in the presumption of innocence. But in the world of Schiff, a lying, scheming, self-important, pathetic lunatic, there are no such constitutional benefits. Their job is simply to nullify the vote of 63 million Americans because they hate Donald Trump. They want power, and they will do anything to get it. Now, when the puppet show moved to Nadler's Judiciary Committee, Schiff's so-called intelligence report peddled lie after lie, and then they say the facts are not contested. I still don't know what the president is charged with. Their accusations move at a whack-a-mole speed from Russia collusion to racism and now Ukraine. Are you stupid, or do you think we are? From day one, the president who shocked you by releasing the transcript, proved there was no crime, quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, or abuse of power. The president said so; President Zelensky said so. The money was released; the Ukrainians got hundreds of millions of dollars for lethal aid and Javelins to actually protect themselves. Consider the transcript and actual video that tells you whether the crime has occurred. Now, a clear reading of it is proof positive a crime did not occur, but, no, we're supposed to listen to people who know nothing about the call, nothing about the facts, and who simply hate Donald Trump to boot."

This isn't about the Constitution, democracy, or our founding fathers. This is about a mob desperately seeking to overthrow the legitimate occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But you're not entitled to that power. We purposely didn't give you that power.

Tell me that you care about the Second Amendment and that you will fight to protect the rights of gun owners. The Fourth Amendment, that it should never be used to illegally wiretap or spy on a presidential candidate. And what the heck have you done for us for the last three years? Nothing. We work our tails off. Many of us two or three jobs as we struggle to pay taxes while you pontificate and impose your will on us. But you work for us. We put you there. You have done nothing for us. Two hundred thousand people would have a job if you would just move the USMCA. But, no. Your job is to prolong your years in Congress and play games with lobbyists, so you can leave with more money than you started with. But you and your caucus are too damn busy hating Donald Trump to work for us. The farmers wait. The military waits. The seniors, who need lower drug prices, wait. We are tired of waiting.
