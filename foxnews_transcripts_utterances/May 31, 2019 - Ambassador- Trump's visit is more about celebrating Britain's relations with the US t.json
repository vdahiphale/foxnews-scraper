Secondly, they say as John Kasich did there, you shouldn't muddle up trade policy with immigration policy. Why not? There's no real reason for that. It's just something they say.

Well, that is just great. Michael Wolff, you may not care to know the facts but I do. So here they are. I wrote my questions on a legal pad the old-fashioned way on my way to D.C. in a car. No one from the White House or for that matter from Fox weighed in on my interview at all, period. This is a news show. We deal in facts.

It's a staggering number, but on average 20 U.S. veterans commit suicide every single day. And that demands our attention. There is a new program from the foundation SoldierStrong which is dedicated to doing everything it can to help the mental health of our nation's heroes, strong mind is what it's called. It uses revolutionary virtual reality equipment to slowly introduce soldiers back to the battlefield mimicking memory to help treat PTSD. It's really a revolutionary idea. My next guest is a veteran who credits this work with virtual reality for saving his life. Chris Merkle joined the Marine Corps when he was 17. He served as an infantry man for 10 years on active duty. He says after multiple deployments he came home proud of his service but angry. He eventually reached out for mental health at the V.A. And he joins me now with his story. Chris, great to have you with us.",

So, I was talking about traffic. I thought my family, everything else that was bothering me on the surface and not getting to the point. So, I was actually recommended to go to try virtual reality. When you are in the virtual reality field it's -- you're in that moment so you're reliving it. So, all of your senses it pulls back that memory and it works on everything that was bothering you, what you felt, what you saw, and you don't just say this is happening 10 years ago I was driving and we're starting to get hit. It's I'm feeling. This I'm getting contact. And I'm doing this. And you're saying everything to the first person. Your memory is right there. And so, you are really restructuring that part of your brain that's like saying this is something scary, this is how you need to react. So, it kind of reduces that trigger and saying it over and over the narrative style. The very first time I did it they are like, walk me through what happened from the beginning of the story to the end. So, I walk through a really bad day in Iraq in Nasiriyah and it was a really long day and I saw a lot of different things and we did a lot of different things but no more or less in any other veteran that's down there. But after I got down a couple of times, I took the virtual headset off and I apologized to the commission like, I'm sorry.

So, here is what happened, exactly three hours after the president announced a five percent initial tariff hike on the country of Mexico, suddenly the Mexicans came to the desk -- to the table, said they wanted to talk. The Mexican government, they sent a letter to the president that said we're on our way, we're coming to Washington right away. And that is where this story begins tonight. Good evening, everybody.

We're told that he will be landing in Washington at some point this evening, presumably going to the embassy. The thing is most of those officials that he would normally meet with, out of town. President Trump's going to meet with Queen Elizabeth in London on Sunday, in just a few days. But Mexican officials are trying to get that meeting as soon as possible to persuade the president to change its thinking. I want to go to a tweet from President Trump just a few hours ago, about six hours ago. \"Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades. Because of the Dems, our immigration laws are bad. Mexico makes a fortune from the U.S. have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done.\" Martha, those tariffs go up from five percent on June 10th to 25 percent by October 1st. Quite a big difference there.

So, as you saw with the Dow at a four- month low, six straight weeks of losses, Martha. That's a longest losing streak in eight years. And people are literally paying governments to hold their money. That's how scared they are and this is something that we haven't seen since 2008. So, there are reverberations and there are signals, by the way, to our trading partners in China as well that even if you sign a deal, you might not adhere to it. So, I'm not sure that that's a great way to try to get this U.S.-China trade deal sign either."

Even the left, Congress which should be fixing that crisis is not doing it. Why? Because the Democrats answer to the crisis is just to let everyone in. And, of course, that's not going to fly. So, my view is this is a creative and entrepreneurial piece of policymaking, and we might as well give it a shot. The arguments you hear against it don't really stack up, there's the argument about this is all going to end on in higher prices. Well, for the last year or so, we've had a lot of tariffs and the -- we have a measure of prices for consumers, it's called inflation. And actually, it's been pretty low. Earnings, especially, for the lower group of American workers arising three times and more faster than prices are. Secondly, they say as John Kasich did there, you shouldn't muddle up trade policy with immigration policy. Why not? There's no real reason for that. It's just something they say. And then the third thing they say is well, this will jeopardize President Trump trying to get through his new NAFTA, the USMCA."

And that's what we have seen. You know this is the first president of the United States that we've ever had whose background is as a businessman. I mean, there are others who have had businesses, you know, Harry Truman comes to mind, who's a haberdasher. However, you know, this is like a real estate magnate, OK? So, he looks at the world differently, he said from the very beginning. And I think this is sort of part of the essential Trump doctrine. I am going to put together economic issues, and security issues, and all of it, because I don't see how you can really separate them, Steve."

Hasn't been working for years. And so, he was elected precisely because he was going to shake things up, be a disrupter, and do things differently. He's just following through on that. And I think we should all give him a chance and see what the results, and judge him on the results. With China, exactly as you said, they're coming to the table now on things like intellectual property theft, precisely because of the tariffs."

If he gets a deal because we're looking at -- in October, that's $900 billion worth of goods from China, from Mexico, that will be tariffed. And you know who eventually pays that tariff. I know the companies do, but they will pass on those costs to the U.S. consumer, which powers two-thirds of the U.S. economy. That might hit hurt the markets and that might hurt the U.S. economy."

Wolff's over-reliance on a single character, factual errors that mar the author's credibility and sourcing that is so opaque that it renders the scoops highly suspicious and unreliable, they write. Here he is suddenly unable to hear an anchors question when he was pressed on the accuracy of his reporting. That's what he calls it last year."

But anyway, he claims that he has ironclad sources and doesn't need to do what all reporters do which is to make a basic phone call, to check the stories because he says he doesn't do that kind of journalism. Here's what he says. I'm talking about those calls where you absolutely know what the response is going to be. They put you in the position in which you are potentially having to negotiate what you know. In some curious way that's what much journalism is about. It's called a negotiated truth, he says. Now, I know that his negotiated truth is actually just a lie in at least one case for sure because it involves a historic interview in which I was directly involved. The New York Times asked Wolff, here's their question. You also write in the book that Fox News provided questions ahead of time for its interview with Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court nomination fight. Did you ask Fox for comment? Wolff, no, but again it's a difference between an institutional reporter and a non-institutional reporter. I don't have to ask the silly questions. New York Times, are they silly if it's a matter of fact in the book? Wolff, yes, because can you imagine a circumstance under the sun in which Fox would come clean on that. New York Times, but Siege went through a fact-checking period. Wolff, of course. And that did not include reaching out? Wolff, I actually don't believe if you know the answer it is necessary to go through the motions of getting an answer that you're absolutely certain of. Really? Well, that is just great. Michael Wolff, you may not care to know the facts but I do. So here they are. I wrote my questions on a legal pad the old-fashioned way on my way to D.C. in a car. No one from the White House or for that matter from Fox weighed in on my interview at all, period. This is a news show. We deal in facts. I have been doing this for 25 years and I have never given anyone my questions prior to an interview. That is THE STORY. That is not negotiated truth. So let's bring in Howie Kurtz. Howie, this is my question for you. How does he get away with this?"

Now, in the case of your interview, look, anybody who was watching could see that you press Brett Kavanaugh aggressively, repeatedly on all the sexual harassment allegations that were public at that time. And also, that interview which was widely praised across the political spectrum, he struggled so much to answer those questions that they completely changed their strategy at the White House and he was much more aggressive of course when he got to the Senate hearings."

To have him ask the questions about the specific allegations, every single one of them even the most salacious in allegations that were made by Michael Avanatti's client which you know pretty much folded like a cheap tent. So I think that was part of what they wanted to do. It was right before the hearing, I don't know because you know that there was no discussion about the nature of our questions when it came to that. You know, but this is -- there's a larger issue here with regard to the Robert Mueller report that he's also getting a lot of pushback on here, Howie."

The biggest news in the forthcoming Wolff's book has already been flatly denied by Bob mowers office that Mueller had drawn up a draft indictment of President Trump which seems even more ludicrous now that we know from Mueller himself that he thought he had no legal authority to indict a sitting president. Now, you know, the last book as you said got raked over the coals. He wrote that he included account some sources that were baldly untrue or contradictory but he published him anyway. And by the way, I don't know what business he thinks he's in. Sometimes I guess he digs up some interesting or salacious things but when I profiled him nearly 20 years ago, people were complaining then that Michael Wolff had misquoted them."

If he had checked with you, with Fox and had been knocked down, then he might not have had to print it or he might have had to at least say that you said it was flatly untrue.

I guess, you know, this notion that the fact checkers didn't get around to checking this fact because he thought it would be silly, I just don't understand that. I've taken so many things out of books and news articles over the years because you got to go to the person whose reputation you are potentially smearing, and at least give them their say and then you can make a journalistic judgment, Martha."

A meeting with business leaders. And then on Wednesday the commemoration down in Portsmouth of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landing. So, you know, it's about much more a celebration of Britain's relations with the U.S. that is about just about the politics. But I'm sure the prime minister gets along well with the president. They've talked a lot during her time in office. That her talks with the president on Tuesday and the working lunch, those will still be valuable and important and forward-looking talks from which there are some agreements will be reached and some forward-looking decisions taken."

One, national security considerations will be paramount in that decision. Second is we don't have Huawei equipment on any sensitive communications network at the moment. Not on government communication networks. Not on military ones. So, we are already in a place where we understand the risks here.

It's a staggering number, but on average 20 U.S. veterans commit suicide every single day. And that demands our attention. There is a new program from the foundation SoldierStrong which is dedicated to doing everything it can to help the mental health of our nation's heroes, strong mind is what it's called. It uses revolutionary virtual reality equipment to slowly introduce soldiers back to the battlefield mimicking memory to help treat PTSD. It's really a revolutionary idea. My next guest is a veteran who credits this work with virtual reality for saving his life. Chris Merkle joined the Marine Corps when he was 17. He served as an infantry man for 10 years on active duty. He says after multiple deployments he came home proud of his service but angry. He eventually reached out for mental health at the V.A. And he joins me now with his story. Chris, great to have you with us."

So, it doesn't really fit with being in school and being around other people and reacting, overreacting to things that really shouldn't bother me."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MERKLE",
      "utterance": "Yes, Martha, I mean, that's exactly on point. It is scary to address our worst fears but that's the biggest thing with PTSD and with our veteran or any community as that stigma mental health, that's an initial block. But once we get there, we do say I do have a problem and saying I have PTSD or I have anger, how do I deal with it? It's hard to just do a psychotherapy and say this is my worst day can we talk about it. So, virtual reality gives you an opportunity to be immersed in that world which sounds horrible. But being in that first person in the moment it actually helps when you talk -- when you walk through your narrative. It's so much smoother and so much more --"

    {
      "speaker": "MERKLE",
      "utterance": "So, one of the biggest things with mental health is resistance. So, first stigma trying to get into mental health and once you start seeking help. Resistance. So, I was talking about traffic. I thought my family, everything else that was bothering me on the surface and not getting to the point. So, I was actually recommended to go to try virtual reality. When you are in the virtual reality field it's -- you're in that moment so you're reliving it. So, all of your senses it pulls back that memory and it works on everything that was bothering you, what you felt, what you saw, and you don't just say this is happening 10 years ago I was driving and we're starting to get hit. It's I'm feeling. This I'm getting contact. And I'm doing this. And you're saying everything to the first person. Your memory is right there. And so, you are really restructuring that part of your brain that's like saying this is something scary, this is how you need to react. So, it kind of reduces that trigger and saying it over and over the narrative style. The very first time I did it they are like, walk me through what happened from the beginning of the story to the end. So, I walk through a really bad day in Iraq in Nasiriyah and it was a really long day and I saw a lot of different things and we did a lot of different things but no more or less in any other veteran that's down there. But after I got down a couple of times, I took the virtual headset off and I apologized to the commission like, I'm sorry. (Inaudible) a couple of times. he's like, you just talked to something you've avoided and never talked about for 10 years."

I feel a little bit better and each time a little weight came off my -- literally my shoulders and I was able to face my family and my friends and be a little bit more productive in society. And that's my long-term goal and hopefully we want for everybody else's families as well."
