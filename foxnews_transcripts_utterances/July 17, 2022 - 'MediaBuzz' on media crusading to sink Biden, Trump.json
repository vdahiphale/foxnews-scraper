      "sentences": "Never seen anything remotely like it, the media are trying to knock President Biden out of the running for a second term. It feels like an orchestrated campaign. In fact, if the media were a political organization, as some of their critics believe, we'd say they're carpet-bombing Joe Biden, trying to damage him to the point where he can't run again. And by the way, the media are also trying to disqualify Donald Trump on grounds of sinking support in his party, far less surprising but still happening. The press does not want a rematch. Remember how everyone thought the media would go easy on Biden because, basically, he's not Trump? That's out the window. Just look at one newspaper, Sunday's \"New York Times,\" Biden's age is a big problem. Polls show many Americans consider Mr. Biden too old, and some Democratic strategists do not think he should run again. Monday's \"New York Times\", most Democrats don't want Biden to run again in 2024. New poll shows that figure, 64 percent. Tuesday, a Times columnist pleads with Biden not to run, and then there's the former president. Tuesday's times, half of GOP voters ready to leave Trump behind, poll finds, and a significant number vowing to abandon him if he wins the nomination. Trump's response, this is good, the failing \"New York Times\" is down 40 percent year to date because they are fake news. Their reporters are dishonest. They hate our country. The \"New York Times\" is truly the enemy of the people. Now, of course the media would be committing malpractice if they didn't report on Biden's awful poll numbers or whether the Hill hearings have hurt Trump. But who exactly annoyed the journalists to try to muscle candidates out of the presidential race and more than two years early, if they're damaged, they think they can't win, maybe they'll decide against running? But too many in the news media are acting like mob bosses and are sacrificing what remains of their credibility. I'm Howard Kurtz, and this is MEDIA BUZZ. Ahead, Ari Fleischer with the details and devastating look at media bias and snobbery. There's been plenty of television coverage of the concerted media campaign against Joe Biden and Donald Trump with numerous segments quoting the \"New York Times\".",

You do not have a strong leader, you do not have someone whose policies are matching the moment, and because of that the media is forced into a position where they can't lie anymore.

Now, it turns out that the is true. And there are questions from that. There are questions about whether Ohio's law actually would require someone in the situation to leave the state. The A.G. in Ohio says no. That's relevant. There's the illegal immigration angle to this. Now, overall, just a horrible story in general. But I think the early skepticism was warranted.

In fact, if the media were a political organization, as some of their critics believe, we'd say they're carpet-bombing Joe Biden, trying to damage him to the point where he can't run again. And by the way, the media are also trying to disqualify Donald Trump on grounds of sinking support in his party, far less surprising but still happening. The press does not want a rematch. Remember how everyone thought the media would go easy on Biden because, basically, he's not Trump? That's out the window. Just look at one newspaper, Sunday's \"New York Times,\" Biden's age is a big problem. Polls show many Americans consider Mr. Biden too old, and some Democratic strategists do not think he should run again. Monday's \"New York Times\", most Democrats don't want Biden to run again in 2024. New poll shows that figure, 64 percent. Tuesday, a Times columnist pleads with Biden not to run, and then there's the former president. Tuesday's times, half of GOP voters ready to leave Trump behind, poll finds, and a significant number vowing to abandon him if he wins the nomination. Trump's response, this is good, the failing \"New York Times\" is down 40 percent year to date because they are fake news. Their reporters are dishonest. They hate our country. The \"New York Times\" is truly the enemy of the people. Now, of course the media would be committing malpractice if they didn't report on Biden's awful poll numbers or whether the Hill hearings have hurt Trump. But who exactly annoyed the journalists to try to muscle candidates out of the presidential race and more than two years early, if they're damaged, they think they can't win, maybe they'll decide against running? But too many in the news media are acting like mob bosses and are sacrificing what remains of their credibility. I'm Howard Kurtz, and this is MEDIA BUZZ. Ahead, Ari Fleischer with the details and devastating look at media bias and snobbery. There's been plenty of television coverage of the concerted media campaign against Joe Biden and Donald Trump with numerous segments quoting the \"New York Times\"."

Look, the fact is we've had people in the office of the presidency who has been flawed leaders before. We've seen it, frankly, in Donald Trump, and in Bill Clinton and others where the popularity of their policies made upper for their own personal flaws. In Biden, you don't have that. You do not have a strong leader, you do not have someone whose policies are matching the moment, and because of that the media is forced into a position where they can't lie anymore. They have to be honest about how unpopular he is, and even this to a degree, I think, is aligning the true depth of his unpopularity."

And if you look at all of the social media, there's -- there were a lot of criticism of CNN and MSBNC and other outlets that are deemed liberal. Maybe they can't be called liberal anymore. As somebody who opines for a living but used to report news when I was a journalist back in the day, the media shouldn't be having a campaign for or against any candidate. They should be reporting the facts, and the facts are, like you said, the numbers in this \"New York Times\" poll are worrisome for those who want Biden or for those who want Trump.

It's become harder and harder to defend the Biden administration if you are someone who just leans a little bit left of center and you had the idea that, you know, finally we were going to get the adults back in charge and then you face the circumstance where this White House really seems incapable of handling anything when it comes to the economy, when it comes to these culture war issues, when it comes to foreign policy and the like.

And I think it would be the same this time around for Joe Biden with Democrats for some Democrats in that poll, and I think the same for Donald Trump if Donald Trump and not DeSantis is at the top of the Republican ticket. I think Republicans would do the same thing. So, you know, we love to jump on, you know, one poll, you know, but it is, again, with one poll. And are there people out there who don't want him to run or fearful they'll lose for both Biden on the left, Trump on the right? That, certainly, is a reality."

Obviously, everybody says (Inaudible). It's hardly shocking. But Trump told New York magazine he's made the decision, and it's just a question of when he announces. You can guess what the decision is. Washington Post citing unnamed advisers saying he'll probably announce in September. Of course, that would change the nature of the midterms.

If you really are the powerful force here, if you really are the T-rex, the king of the jungle, then I think that you can actually wait. You don't need to sort of, come out here early. And the fact is that if he is baited into an early announcement, I actually think that gives people more time to familiarize themselves with the alternatives, more time to come around to the idea that Ron DeSantis may be the man for the moment."

From the top from Jeff Zucker the president on down, correspondents, day time reporters, anchors were all encouraged to let it rip, to give their opinion and make it trash Donald Trump.

I would prefer a media that is objective, straight, neutral down the middle. But when you look at the mainstream media, and here I'm talking about CBS, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, the Washington Post, the \"New York Times\", all the dominant mainstream media which are all in decline are the ones who have become the most opinionated.

I agree with that, but I was going to push back on what you wrote next. You say that the American people want to get their news straight, they want honest reporting based on facts. Some do, but I think -- and you alluded to this -- I think increasingly many people want to see their own views reflected back to them, and that's true for viewers of CNN, MSNBC and Fox."

The daytime shows are supposed to be straight, fair, neutral shows. I will take Fox as straight, fair, neutral daytime shows and its reporters over CNN's any day. CNN went so far into the tank, and I say John Harwood of CNN, I say Jim Acosta, several other reporters who let their opinions rip, and their opinions are always anti-Trump. That's the problem, and that's where I blow the whistle. I think most viewers and readers do want neutral, objective news.

But I think they're so chained to the people that read it, I'm not sure they can write the truth even if they want. Look, we have 50 percent, they have 50 percent. But at the same time, I think, I don't think the New York Times views itself as representing 50 percent of the country."

This is -- this is increasingly a problem for journalists, and they have to appeal to their subscribers. And at The New York Times' subscribers was with the resistance movement. It was not neutral people."

In his interview with you, he referred to CBS Weijia Jiang as crazy, Jim Acosta you mentioned, as a maniac and a loser, CBS' Paula Reid a whack job. You asked if he would have handled the press differently had he won in 2020 if he was president now. He said, I don't think it would matter, they would treat me the same. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "The most fascinating glimpse I had into the way President Trump thinks is he actually thought during the transition in 2016 that the press would be fair. He thought it would be a glorious moment for the country and he thought that would -- that is what would happen because, lo and behold, he pulls off the surprise, he won. He thought campaign coverage would be over, and they'd be fair. I actually think, Howard, if they had been fair, if they had been neutral, if they didn't chase the collusion narrative or the Steele dossier, if Donald Trump would have behaved differently. And I think he probably might have. I think the name calling and all the things he does is a reaction to how far the press has gone against him. He thinks someone has to fight, and that someone is him."

Donald Trump is the biggest a-hole, he is a terrible human being, expletive president, ugly, and nobody would be mad at me except all the people who were already mad at me for existing. So, there's no penalty for trashing Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Right. And this is what I object to, because when I came up in politics, New York magazine, New Yorker magazine, the New York Times magazine, they would not pursue that type of journalism. They had to be fair. There had to be objectivity at least ostensibly. And now she's saying that's all out the window. I can write whatever I want if it's really tough on Trump, and she gets that from her editors. And this is the cultural change that's underway in newsrooms that I think is so destructive to good journalism."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, some people on the left don't like the press either now that Joe Biden is president. Let's talk about double standards. So you have it in the book a photo from the New York Times of Nancy Pelosi and this meeting that melted down with President Trump, pointing her finger. And it was described as an iconic image capturing Washington's most powerful woman standing up to him. Then you roll the tape back to when Barack Obama was president and there's Arizona's Republican governor Jan Brewer in his face on a tarmac pointing at President Obama. CNN's John King saying, well, a lot of people are saying he is the president of the United States whether you disagree or not, perhaps she should have shown him a bit more respect."

      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "The hypocrisy of it all. It's OK if Nancy Pelosi does it to Donald Trump, but it's not OK if a Republican governor does it to Barack Obama. And my book is full of examples of hypercritical examples over the same event. You know, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, the front page of the Washington Post headline was a crusader for rights, basically, was their headline. And then when Anthony Scalia died, it was a conservative jurist dedicated to frustrating the left. What kind of neutrality is that? What kind of fairness is that? One is a crusader; one is lionized and the other is attacked in an obituary headline. I saw time and time again example after example where the possess was easy and soft on the Democrats and brutal on Republicans and I call it out, I put the pictures in there. I name names, and I show who did it."

Guy, I thought this was the least effective of all the hearings, was too much rehash, too many Trumpers guilty speeches by lawmakers, but it did have Pat Cipollone as sort of strain to avoid providing any colorful sound bites. But he said under oath he didn't think there was evidence of fraud sufficient to change the outcome of the election, and he thought Trump should have conceded the election. Big news?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Not really, because the former attorney general had said the exact same thing, Bill Barr, in testimony, in depositions, in his book, on cable television. So, I think that Cipollone was sort of on team Barr. They called themselves team moral, to some extent. We know their view was, that the president should have conceded the election and not done what he did. To get that, I guess, under oath in public is newsworthy but not huge news. I also thought it was kind of interesting to see the former campaign manager for the president basically admitting openly in a text exchange so not publicly with one of his colleagues that President Trump's rhetoric was responsible for the riot at the capitol. That was also interesting. But in terms of new news value, I think this one, to your point correctly, Howie, you said this one wasn't that much of a bombshell compared to some soft to the previous iterations, previous meetings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. You're referring to Brad Parscale who said that he felt guilty helping Trump win after the events of January 6th. You know, Laura, media conservatives pushed back after the more dramatic Cassidy Hutchinson hearing but mostly ignored this one which tells me it didn't break through on the right. For media people who basically talk about or care about processes and it's a very highly partisan committee, it's been packaged that way and the Democrats run it, how do they just brush aside, how do the pundits brush aside, I should say, testimony from Donald Trump's own people? Like Cipollone?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAURA FINK, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I don't know, and I think that Cipollone may have not had the dramatic impact that other witnesses have, but they got him to testify after months of resisting, you know, testifying in front of the committee which is news in and of itself. It also corroborated Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony which the right was questioning. So, it really was objection-handling which may not cause fireworks in the news, but it does provide an airtight story that proceeds so that Cassidy Hutchinson testimony won't be impugned in the future. I think they're continuing to do that with the investigation into the text messages and the Secret Service. I think that continues to sort of shore this up. And then in terms of Brad Pascale, I thought that was dramatic. His text messages saying that Trump's rhetoric was directly responsible for inciting the violence, having that from your own campaign manager is truly damning especially in text messages that were sent during the time in which this was all happening."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But it wasn't bleeped at the hearing. All right. So, Guy, let's talk now about the live witnesses, there were two of them. And one of them was a former Oath Keepers spokesman who broke with the group years ago, hates the group, and so he had nothing whatsoever to say about what happened on January 6th. And the other one, if we can put up a picture, Stephen Ayers, as you mentioned, he was a social media addict who says he came to the rally because of Donald Trump. He walked into the capitol legally but when Trump put out the video saying we love you, go home, he went home. He now thinks it's not true, what Trump said, but he's one guy. And there's no reason to think that Donald Trump, you know, had any contact with him. It was kind of sad and pathetic I thought."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm not exact -- yes, I'm not sure what the value is there. Right? I mean, you can make a case about President Trump and his actions leading up to January 6th, during January 6th and afterwards, right? And I think a lot of us watched in horror as it happened on that day. A lot of this was brought to the fore during his second impeachment trial, there is some new stuff from this committee. But I don't know why this type of witness really advances the ball at all. I don't know who it convinces of anything. So, I mean, I think they need to be judicious about what they actually do, what they spend their time on, what they're telling the American people is important because a lot of people are inclined not to pay attention anyway. And when they weigh, in my opinion, some important air time, if you will, on this type of thing, I think it does diminish the overall impact that they might be looking for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. It certainly, in my view, was not nearly as strong as the other hearings, and I think that's a good point. Laura, the other media bombshell here came in the last minute when Liz Cheney, and they always do a tease for the next hearing, said that Trump had called a witness before his or her testimony, didn't get through the witness and refused to call. The media are saying aha, witness intimidation. CNN and others reporting it's a support staffer at the White House, somebody who wouldn't ordinarily get a call from the president. So, is that a bombshell or just was it an attempt that didn't succeed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FINK",
      "utterance": "Well, I think President Trump, a former president calling support staff for any reason when they are linked to this congressional hearing is a big deal because it follows a pattern of behavior that has been reported on before. So, president Trump attempting to dissuade everyone from state elected officials from doing their jobs right up until this week, it follows this pattern of behavior. He does try to intimidate and persuade and try to -- to try to get people from telling the truth and from doing their duty. And so, I think that it fits into a pattern of behavior,"

I would just say that, you know, this is not the liberal media folks, I don't understand why when people like Barr, and Cipollone and Parscale were on the Trump team, conservatives were perfectly willing to believe them and now that they're testifying under oath, and the testimony is not favorable to Donald Trump, that they're just being dismissed. But that's debate for another time. Still to come, a newspaper came under fire, some critic dismissed the story as fake until Ohio charged an illegal immigrant with raping a 10-year-old girl. That's next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The Indianapolis Star took plenty of flak for reporting on rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl who was said to have gone to Indiana to seek an abortion based on a single name source with few details. Dr. Caitlin Bernard an obstetrician who works at Indiana University's Medical School. President and others seize on the report, but many critics doubted the story calling it suspect or fake. Jim Jordan called it a lie. The Wall Street Journal dubbed it a fanciful tale. Ohio's A.G. galled it a likely fabrication, but as The Columbus Dispatch was first to report, Ohio has charged a man named Gerson Fuentes with this horrifying rape, and he has confessed. The story was true. Guy, this monster -- an illegal immigrant according to a source at ICE -- has been charged with this despicable crime. Now some media conservatives including handful on Fox had called the story questionable, or not true or even fake. Does this, not -- now that we know that this happened, does this vindicate what the Indianapolis Star did?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "I think it's a complicated answer to that question, Howie, because I think conservatives and other people were right to be, let's say, skeptical of this story and to question whether or not it was real. I think asserting that it was false or fake was also premature. But one source who is an advocate with scant details and really no proof, that's not enough, in my view, to go on print or go on air, certainly to get all the way up to the president of the United States stating a story as if it were fact when it had not been established. Now, it turns out that the is true. And there are questions from that. There are questions about whether Ohio's law actually would require someone in the situation to leave the state. The A.G. in Ohio says no. That's relevant. There's the illegal immigration angle to this. Now, overall, just a horrible story in general. But I think the early skepticism was warranted. Now we have more proof and more evidence, which is important, and the discussion, a tough one, will flow from there."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

Some states may decide to adopt one, some states may not. And so, it's not as simple as just some states will make it illegal, some states will keep it legal."

      "utterance": "I think it throws into stark leaf the risks that women face every day and children face every day as a result. And we saw conservative media and pundits play down the repeal of Roe as if nothing to see here, and we can see from this story -- and, frankly, the knee-jerk reaction of conservative pundits, the Wall Street Journal editorial board and even Glenn Kessler at the Post -- to not believe that this was a story and to not even dig in further to try to find out the truth. Instead, they condemned it. That shows they're not prepared for this type of story and this reality, that women and girls are facing across the country today. I think it was media a malpractice, frankly, to go ahead and condemn this story as not being true without facts and then in the retraction to not -- the Wall Street Journal put a one-liner at the top of their editorial instead of pulling it back even though it had been disproven. Fox News hosts didn't address it after all of this except to talk about the predator and if never, never went back on what they said."
