But nevertheless, and this is part of the problem that Trump has got himself into is you don't know what he said to Putin. You can't necessarily trust what he said because he'll say one thing one day and something else the next day. So I don't think this is the end of it. And while I said earlier I think this might hurt him in public opinion in the short term, if you go back and look at all the controversies that he's gone through, Charlottesville, et cetera, and still managed to have the highest standing among Republicans of any Republican president in the last half-century, I think this is not something that's going to last. We'll be on to the next controversy. I'm sure it's right around the corner, and this will be in the rearview mirror pretty quickly."

      "utterance": "Again, here we have a situation where there are very serious concerns about what happened, and Democrats, again, go too far in assessing the situation, and therefore we can't actually have a conversation moving forward about what to do to fix the problem. If you put politics aside, you put the Russian modeling aside, this is about now rebuilding morale inside the intelligence community. I had people texting me who are conservative Republican Trump supporters yesterday saying I cannot believe that he went out there in Helsinki and did this to us. We feel betrayed, we feel like we can no longer defend this. How do we even talk about this now? So if you just put the politics aside, this is about the commander-in-chief now having to clean up the mess not on Capitol Hill, not in the communications shop, but with the people who he is leading inside of his administration."
