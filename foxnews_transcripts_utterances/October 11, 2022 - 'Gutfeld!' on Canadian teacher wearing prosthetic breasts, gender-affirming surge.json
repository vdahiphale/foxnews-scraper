His nipples are so pointy you think one pump diesel and the other unleaded. Hey Canada, throw a well cap on those before someone gets hurt. I'm sorry. We're trying to tackle this topic with some measure of professionalism. And that measure is 68 triple D. But I apologize if we've got you seeing double. So what's happened since our last report? Actually not a lot. There's still no interview with the teacher. I mean, you think she'd want to get this off her chest? Even I hate that one. Granted. News travels slow from a third-world country like Canada. But we still don't know if this is indeed a real thing. A prank or a prank gone wrong. True. It could very well be his Kat predicted a game of chicken. And if it is chicken, Colonel Sanders would marvel at the size of those breasts. I feel dirty. But it could be -- it could be a teacher sick of the woke B.S. decided to see how far he or she could push it. And the school in response said sure we'll play along, buddy. Now the teacher is stuck wearing fake breasts the size of Minneapolis and St. Paul for the rest of his or her life. Yes. I've heard a tit for tat but in this case her cup runneth over. Part of me is dying inside. Can you see it? But there might be a bigger reason why no one's talking and not because they were motorboat it into silence. It's that even mentioning the teacher's clothing is discrimination. So everyone plays it safe, avoiding truth and instead only expressing support for people of all gender identities and expressions, because anything else could get you sued. One expert points out, discrimination may even occur when addressing, just addressing, the matter. The Ontario Human Rights Tribunal, which has broad powers, especially over this broad, can award damages based on injury to dignity, self-respect and even feelings. But nothing about lower back pain. But it's good to see free speech is alive and well in the People's Republic of Trudeau. But all of this feels a little scammy. And if you don't believe me, well, let's follow the money. Well, Planned Parenthood ran a recent video promoting the use of puberty blockers for children who might experience gender confusion.",

Did you look at a sonogram and see a fetus pointing to his penis and shaking his head no? This broad should lose her job. Meanwhile, Vanderbilt University just suspended trans surgeries for kids after the department head boasts of it being a cash cow saying \"these surgeries make a lot of money charging female to male chest reconstruction at 40 grand, while a patient on hormones could rake in thousands.\" She adds, gender reassignment surgeries could support an entire clinic offering up to 100 grand for the hospital. No wonder you find gender reassignment centers sponsoring Halloween parties for children. That should make for a confusing Halloween night. And who are you supposed to be a little boy? Well, this isn't a costume, bitch and these are (BLEEP) real. Now hand over the twigs. So, it's not just about identity, it's about profit. Create the idea that there's a problem then offer the solution and incentivize doctors to find patients. Now of course there are legit trans, but this explosion in gender precariousness suggests something else. Rather than seriously addressing people with dysphoria, it's not just a money making fad with permanent repercussions. And for every healthy organ removed, a doctor gets new earplugs. The kids don't stand a chance, especially when they see the attention they get from this. That's a payoff too. An activist and therapists cultivate the validation. Before you know it, parents are sucked into a consequential crisis. The kids are literally scarred for life. And no parent actually believes their healthy child needs to have their genitals removed. Well, my dad did once when I spilled paint in the garage. But it's such an insane thought that these specialists have to overwhelm them with fear that you're not affirming your child. And so everybody keeps a tight lip and don't talk about the kids. Don't talk about the male inmates and female jails or male athletes winning female sports. And please don't bring up the teacher with giant boobs. But if -- hey, if you can't tell male from female anymore, what else can they get you to believe? I think in the end we're going to remember this moment as a pretty important one. I know I'm definitely going to look back at this. Just a see how I used to look as a male.",

Still, this human bumper sticker thinks she's qualified to go all in for Indigenous People's Day which has replaced Columbus Day in some cities that don't have casinos. And more could be on the way. While the Columbus Day Parade went on as usual in New York on Monday. Two Democrat lawmakers introduced a bill to erase it as a state holiday and replace it with Indigenous People's Day. And now even Halloween fun is toasted Philly, the birthplace of punching. One school district has canceled its annual Halloween parades for not being inclusive enough. That's the problem in Philly. Holy crap. Apparently it was a problem because not everyone celebrates Halloween.

It's the story of the shop class teacher who's wearing super jumbo never existed in reality prosthetic breasts the class. In the unlikely event of a water emergency landing. Your shop teacher can be used as a flotation device."

      "utterance": "Now none of that appeared on Special Report. Here it's because Brett's more of a leg man. So welcome to Canada where you can't spill identity without tittie. His nipples are so pointy you think one pump diesel and the other unleaded. Hey Canada, throw a well cap on those before someone gets hurt. I'm sorry. We're trying to tackle this topic with some measure of professionalism. And that measure is 68 triple D. But I apologize if we've got you seeing double. So what's happened since our last report? Actually not a lot. There's still no interview with the teacher. I mean, you think she'd want to get this off her chest? Even I hate that one. Granted. News travels slow from a third-world country like Canada. But we still don't know if this is indeed a real thing. A prank or a prank gone wrong. True. It could very well be his Kat predicted a game of chicken. And if it is chicken, Colonel Sanders would marvel at the size of those breasts. I feel dirty. But it could be -- it could be a teacher sick of the woke B.S. decided to see how far he or she could push it. And the school in response said sure we'll play along, buddy. Now the teacher is stuck wearing fake breasts the size of Minneapolis and St. Paul for the rest of his or her life. Yes. I've heard a tit for tat but in this case her cup runneth over. Part of me is dying inside. Can you see it? But there might be a bigger reason why no one's talking and not because they were motorboat it into silence. It's that even mentioning the teacher's clothing is discrimination. So everyone plays it safe, avoiding truth and instead only expressing support for people of all gender identities and expressions, because anything else could get you sued. One expert points out, discrimination may even occur when addressing, just addressing, the matter. The Ontario Human Rights Tribunal, which has broad powers, especially over this broad, can award damages based on injury to dignity, self-respect and even feelings. But nothing about lower back pain. But it's good to see free speech is alive and well in the People's Republic of Trudeau. But all of this feels a little scammy. And if you don't believe me, well, let's follow the money. Well, Planned Parenthood ran a recent video promoting the use of puberty blockers for children who might experience gender confusion."

They're called puberty blockers."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "So Planned Parenthood can't get you in the womb, but get you when you get out. But I guess as abortions declined, they had to diversify.

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "Most of the patients that we have in the GeMs clinic actually know their gender usually around the age of puberty, but a good portion of children do know as early as seemingly from the womb and they will usually express their gender identity as very young children, some as soon as they can talk. Kids know very, very early."

      "utterance": "First of all, never trust a doctor who talks like a 15-year-old valley girl. Second, how do you know they know? Did you look at a sonogram and see a fetus pointing to his penis and shaking his head no? This broad should lose her job. Meanwhile, Vanderbilt University just suspended trans surgeries for kids after the department head boasts of it being a cash cow saying \"these surgeries make a lot of money charging female to male chest reconstruction at 40 grand, while a patient on hormones could rake in thousands.\" She adds, gender reassignment surgeries could support an entire clinic offering up to 100 grand for the hospital. No wonder you find gender reassignment centers sponsoring Halloween parties for children. That should make for a confusing Halloween night. And who are you supposed to be a little boy? Well, this isn't a costume, bitch and these are (BLEEP) real. Now hand over the twigs. So, it's not just about identity, it's about profit. Create the idea that there's a problem then offer the solution and incentivize doctors to find patients. Now of course there are legit trans, but this explosion in gender precariousness suggests something else. Rather than seriously addressing people with dysphoria, it's not just a money making fad with permanent repercussions. And for every healthy organ removed, a doctor gets new earplugs. The kids don't stand a chance, especially when they see the attention they get from this. That's a payoff too. An activist and therapists cultivate the validation. Before you know it, parents are sucked into a consequential crisis. The kids are literally scarred for life. And no parent actually believes their healthy child needs to have their genitals removed. Well, my dad did once when I spilled paint in the garage. But it's such an insane thought that these specialists have to overwhelm them with fear that you're not affirming your child. And so everybody keeps a tight lip and don't talk about the kids. Don't talk about the male inmates and female jails or male athletes winning female sports. And please don't bring up the teacher with giant boobs. But if -- hey, if you can't tell male from female anymore, what else can they get you to believe? I think in the end we're going to remember this moment as a pretty important one. I know I'm definitely going to look back at this. Just a see how I used to look as a male."

So I'm going to take drugs to slow me down. No one has ever condone anything like that. So that's what the issue. That's what we're seeing the numbers up because they're trying to create their own little world."

Today and every day the federal government was recommit itself to honoring its promises to native peoples. I haven't seen a tweet that bad since Rachel Dolezal wished us a happy Black History Month. Where is she? Warren of course falsely claimed Native American heritage a few years ago, even though our blood tests came back as mayonnaise. Still, this human bumper sticker thinks she's qualified to go all in for Indigenous People's Day which has replaced Columbus Day in some cities that don't have casinos. And more could be on the way. While the Columbus Day Parade went on as usual in New York on Monday. Two Democrat lawmakers introduced a bill to erase it as a state holiday and replace it with Indigenous People's Day. And now even Halloween fun is toasted Philly, the birthplace of punching. One school district has canceled its annual Halloween parades for not being inclusive enough. That's the problem in Philly. Holy crap. Apparently it was a problem because not everyone celebrates Halloween. And those kids have had to sit in the library during past parades, which is cruel considering they haven't been taught to read. But since it's Philly, the kids are still allowed to wear masks when they robbed convenience stores. So Liz, anything more to add?"
