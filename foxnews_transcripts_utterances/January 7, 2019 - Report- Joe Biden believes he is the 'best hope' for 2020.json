On Sunday morning December 30, Jazmine Barnes was in a car with her mom and three sisters going to get food when a vehicle pulled alongside them and opened fire striking Jazmine in the head. The family told police they remember seeing a red truck with a white driver in his 30s or 40s and that description led to a sketch of a potential suspect. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Shortly thereafter, Texas Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee said \"I believe and having written hate crime legislation, knowing the criteria, I believe that this should be looked at as a hate crime. We don't want to have on the street someone who was willing to kill children and possibly kill them in the name of hate.\" Four days after the shooting New York-based social activist and writer Shaun King got what he says was a tip that a suspect was a 20-year-old black man named Eric Black. He says he immediately reported tip to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzales. Sure enough, Eric Black was arrested on Saturday and reportedly admitted driving the car saying his passenger was the actual shooter. Police have since arrested Larry Woodruffe on drug charges though he is potentially the second suspect. But critics say activist Shaun King and Sheriff Ed Gonzalez continued promoting the white driver of the red truck as a suspect even after getting the credible tip about Eric Black. The sheriff says the man in the red truck was there but only as a witness and Congresswoman Jackson Lee says she does not regret at all calling it hate crime. Watch.",

Elizabeth Warren has been, you know, sort of suggested that she is unlikable by some of -- by some of the things that been written about her and they comparing her to Hillary Clinton.

It seized private property against the owners and it's spent government money to pay those who are on strike or to replace the strikers. So the Supreme Court struck it down for two reasons. Only Congress can seize property when it pays for it and only Congress can authorize the expenditure of money. And President Truman didn't have the authority to do either. The rest of that executive order which encouraged people to go back to work and many did was perfectly valid. The president has valid emergency authorities in a time of a true emergency, but he can't spend money and he can't take property unless the Congress has authorized it.

According to Congressman Hurd, Republican of Texas, through whose district much of the new wall of the President wants the built would have to go, this is mostly private property. Meaning, they'd have to take it by eminent domain, and that can't be done pursuant to the emergent authority and that can't be done overnight, because if you disagree with what the government wants to pay you for your backyard, the government has to prove its case in a trial.

In fact, an attorney for the family of seven-year-old Jazmine Barnes said he believed the murder was racially motivated because \"our nation at this moment is highly racially charged.\" But here are the facts. On Sunday morning December 30, Jazmine Barnes was in a car with her mom and three sisters going to get food when a vehicle pulled alongside them and opened fire striking Jazmine in the head. The family told police they remember seeing a red truck with a white driver in his 30s or 40s and that description led to a sketch of a potential suspect. Shortly thereafter, Texas Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee said \"I believe and having written hate crime legislation, knowing the criteria, I believe that this should be looked at as a hate crime. We don't want to have on the street someone who was willing to kill children and possibly kill them in the name of hate.\" Four days after the shooting New York-based social activist and writer Shaun King got what he says was a tip that a suspect was a 20-year-old black man named Eric Black. He says he immediately reported tip to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzales. Sure enough, Eric Black was arrested on Saturday and reportedly admitted driving the car saying his passenger was the actual shooter. Police have since arrested Larry Woodruffe on drug charges though he is potentially the second suspect. But critics say activist Shaun King and Sheriff Ed Gonzalez continued promoting the white driver of the red truck as a suspect even after getting the credible tip about Eric Black. The sheriff says the man in the red truck was there but only as a witness and Congresswoman Jackson Lee says she does not regret at all calling it hate crime. Watch."

So, I think that he understands that he's got big problems to deal with. And that's another reason I think that actually in the end he's got a lot on his plate in California. I think he sees himself as having a pretty big future in politics beyond California one day. And I think he's going to l want to show that he's a positive problem-solving kind of guy, not just constantly picking fights with the president. He will leave that to the attorney general --"

That is going to be huge incentives for even more immigration because the other component of that promise is that it will be open to all the residents of California whether you are a citizen or not.

If it was in the negatives then it favored women and if it was in the positives then it favored men. And again, these factors were workplace deaths, compulsory military involvement."

It's not just that you don't think they're a great candidate. Elizabeth Warren has been, you know, sort of suggested that she is unlikable by some of -- by some of the things that been written about her and they comparing her to Hillary Clinton. And then today, Karol Markowicz wrote a piece and she said that it is not sexist to call Elizabeth Warren unlikable. She said that in 2020 all women will be likable. They have to be since the charge of unlikable is now, yes, sexist. What do you think about that?"

I knew that if Hillary Clinton was elected anytime any of her policies would be covered -- you know, protested she would claim sexism. She still claims sexism in the election itself. So, that's something we would have to look for. But something else that Karol notes was that you know they only point to women, Nancy Pelosi, and you know, women that are about Hillary's age also white women who have basically the same policies. But when it's other women, such as Kamala Harris, Alexander Ocasio-Cortez who, you know, Republicans may disagree with them on many, many issues, but they are more likable people. They actually have a personality. And so, for Politico or the people that are attacking Warren because Politico accidentally -- actually didn't make this up. It was people attacked -- on Warren's side making this claim, right? So, for them, they're saying they're all there leaving out men. Right? So, Mitt Romney, Al Gore, John Kerry, also unlikable, that's why they didn't win the election and what all of them have in common is they're kind of older, they're very boring.

I'm not going to be a fat lobbyist. I'm not going to be a skinny lobbyist, a plus size one. I'm not lobbying at all. That is a factual matter. All she would have to do, if she really wanted to know, she could have called me. Most of her Senate colleagues have my cell phone number. She could say, hey, what are you going to do? I'm getting ready to criticize you. I need to decide which thing to criticize you for. She just happened to stumble upon the thing that is demonstrably and factually untrue. And it does make me wonder -- I don't mind the criticisms. Actually, being criticized by Elizabeth Warren helps me in South Carolina. What I do mind and what several of my Democrat colleagues correctly pointed out over the weekend, if you are going to criticize the president and other people for being loose with the facts, don't be loose with the facts yourself. She is running for president of the United States and she kicks it off by making demonstrably false allegation against a former colleague. I don't get it."

I think he is looking for a willing negotiating partner. And Martha, when the folks across from the table think that I should be disbanded and the border patrol gases with intent, children in any physical boundary is nativist and racist, that's a tough bargaining position if that's who is across the table. So, I think he is looking for leverage. I was with Lindsey Graham a lot yesterday and one thing I hope my Republican colleagues, former colleagues, the point they'll make is, lots of Democratic senators voted for physical boundary funding in the past. What changed? We know the cartels no longer an issue? Is the drug epidemic over? Is no one showing up at the border? Why did you vote for in the past but now you think it is nativist and xenophobic? And I have yet to hear a Democrat answer that question with conviction."

We're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers. And we are negotiating with people who will give us $1 for the law even though it's immoral and accused all of us who support a wall as part of a border security as racist. As long as the radical left is in charge, we're never going to get anywhere. The president will compromise but he will not capitulate."

And I don't think President Trump and Mulvaney and my Republican former colleagues, I don't think that they are going to capitulate, to use Lindsey's word, and pass an appropriations bill that doesn't have funding for it. So that gives gets me back to if you thought it was a good idea in the past, if you voted to fund it in the past, what has changed? In the court of public opinion, which is where this will be settled, I think my fellow citizens are open to, well, if you liked in the past, why don't you like it now, and what metric is different? I don't think anyone is going to argue that the border is more secure and better off and that we have fewer problems and fewer enemies than we did when the Democrats voted to fund the wall in the past."
