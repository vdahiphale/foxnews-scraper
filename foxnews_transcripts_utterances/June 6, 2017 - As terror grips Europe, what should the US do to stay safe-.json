Terror on the Australia continent, a Somali born man killed one person and took one hostage in an apartment building with three police officers injured during the standoff. The gunman had pledged allegiance to ISIS before he was shot dead by police, and the third jihadist in Saturday's London terror is identified as Moroccan born, Youssef Zaghba. Terror every few days around the globe, no coincidence it's just a few days into Ramadan. Can't imagine what the next 18 days might bring.

And now to follow up on everything developing today, the war on terror must be waged as a real war with a real enemy. The enemy must be named. It's radical Islamic terrorists. It's all hands on deck. See something, say something. Civil libertarians, hold your noses, we can't let this slime creep into the American streets. Surely our lawmakers get this right. They want to fight terror, right?

However, he's acknowledging what Kat said is absolutely right. It's impossible to prevent. These lone wolves though in many cases are known wolves, they're known to intelligence, and that's where we have major problems.

We're not asking them, for instance, are you a believer in Islamic supremacism. That's a sort of basic information we need to know. Now they could lie, but at least we're on record of knowing what they're coming in here for.

In fact, they have a pathway in thanks to these recent court rulings and the lack of any secure vetting system to keep them from coming.

And the whole problem with that confrontation there is we don't know whose side we're on, if they're good guys or bad guys. We pretend to know but we really don't because I don't think many of our leadership understand the nature of the battle there in the Middle East, where you've got one group of terrorists who wants to see us destroyed, battling another group of terrorists who wants to see us destroyed, and we're picking sides.

Let me explain something about Raqqa though. For about five years now, we've known Raqqa was not only the headquarters of ISIS but also their training ground. For five years, we've known this. Why haven't we gone and leveled Raqqa? Here's the pushback, well, there's a lot of innocent people in Raqqa. Well, you give them three months.

      "utterance": "All right. We're going to settle it down a little bit in the break. When we come right back, we're going to \"Circle Back\" with our specialists, Shelby Holliday and Tom Fitton. Don't go away."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Time to \"Circle Back\" with our specialists, Shelby Holliday and Tom Fitton. Tom, I wanted to ask you this question. What did you think of the leaks and the rest and all that happened today?"
    },

      "speaker": "FITTON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "It's a serious issue. Too many people have access to this sensitive information. And this casual approach to leaking classified information just before you hate -- because you hate Trump can be used to justify a lot of lawlessness that can put our national security at risk."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",

      "utterance": "I don't know. Better than we're doing now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "It's an absurd process. They barely can figure out the names and addresses of the people who have security clearances, let alone investigate their social media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "The leaks don't even implicate Trump also. Great job on that one."
    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "OK, I'm going to lighten it up just a little bit here. It's a bit of a heavy day with all our terror news. It's being reported that less American teenagers are working summer jobs. So in the spirit of that, Shelby, what was your first summer job?"
    },

      "utterance": "There you go."
    },

    },

    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Oh, that's a retail shop! I thought it was a burger shop. Look at me. Go figure. Bolling, what was your summer job?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "I had a paper route."

      "utterance": "What was yours?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I had so many. But I sold chicken wings. That's a bit of a buried lead there."
