      "utterance": "What we all want at the end is a good relationship with Russia when it comes to being able to have a stabilized region. But that of course would include that Russia does not move forward with bad behavior."

      "utterance": "The Russian embassy putting out a statement in reaction to these new sanctions, \"Washington has delivered yet another blow on the Russian- U.S. relations. Now, the sanctions cover captains of Russian business who refuse to play to Washington's scenario. The United States has made yet another erroneous step to destroy the freedom of enterprise and competition, to impair integration processes in the global economy.\" That's kind of a wordy statement from the Russian embassy, but the bottom line for all the talk, this administration is pretty tough on Russia now."

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Yes, and it's kind of unfortunate that it's taken this long, but I think a big reason for that is it's so early on this whole issue about Russian meddling in the election became so highly politicized and it turned into a partisan thing where it really probably shouldn't have been nearly as partisan as it is. And quite frankly, I think the lion's share of the blame for that lies at people who have turned this Russia thing any way that they can smear Donald Trump."

      "utterance": "What strikes me about this is the sweeping nature, the tough nature of the condemnation of Russian behavior. They are not specifying that it's because of the poisoning in London or anything like that. It's Russia is generally creating mischief in the world, and that is a big statement, that is a big new orientation in foreign policy. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.
