We have bombshell developments, exclusive interviews, a blockbuster show tonight for you so stay right there. My one on one with Mitch McConnell on a possible McCabe immunity and whether Congress can solve DACA straight ahead. Victor Davis Hanson on the Obama administration desperate for an Iran nuclear deal back then that it lied to the American people or the Senate? And Seen and Unseen with Raymond Arroyo on the simmering war between sports figures and the President. And an all-star lineup of Chaffetz, Bongino, Bolden, Fitton and Wisenberg to discuss the big story of the hour. The unmasking of Jim Comey as an FBI Director apparently gone rogue. The word insubordinate was use to describe Former FBI Director in the upcoming DOJ Inspector General's report, a source telling ABC News. The IG Report reviews the FBI and DOJ's handling of the Hillary Clinton Email Investigation. It will say that Comey defied authority on more than one occasion according to the report. And perhaps most importantly, the IG is said to criticize Comey for failing to consult with then Attorney General Loretta Lynch before making an historic decision back in July 2016. Of course the decision was not to prosecute Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information. Now that is the very reason President Trump cited for firing Comey, remember back in May 2017, usurping the Attorney General's authority. The IG will also reportedly criticize Comey for ignoring objections when he announced the reopening of the Clinton Email investigation in late October, right before the election in 2016. Now the IG's revelations may cause Comey's defenders to reconsider a man they once called a principled defender of the FBI and DOJ against the President. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

And if you were charitable, Laura, you would say they just misread human nature. They would think that if they were going to be magnanimous to the Iranians they would be paid in kind, whereas I think more likely the Iranians looked at that magnanimity as weakness to be exploited rather to be appreciated. If you were less charitable you would say they wanted to do almost anything to get a signature achievement before he went out of office. And if you were really less charitable you would they had some warped view that the Iranians and the Shia Persian aspect and Muslims and Islam deserved a second chance, so there was going to be a new hegemonic power in the Middle East to balance the Sunni Gulf monarchies, and they thought that might be somehow good.

My one on one with Mitch McConnell on a possible McCabe immunity and whether Congress can solve DACA straight ahead. Victor Davis Hanson on the Obama administration desperate for an Iran nuclear deal back then that it lied to the American people or the Senate? And Seen and Unseen with Raymond Arroyo on the simmering war between sports figures and the President. And an all-star lineup of Chaffetz, Bongino, Bolden, Fitton and Wisenberg to discuss the big story of the hour. The unmasking of Jim Comey as an FBI Director apparently gone rogue. The word insubordinate was use to describe Former FBI Director in the upcoming DOJ Inspector General's report, a source telling ABC News. The IG Report reviews the FBI and DOJ's handling of the Hillary Clinton Email Investigation. It will say that Comey defied authority on more than one occasion according to the report. And perhaps most importantly, the IG is said to criticize Comey for failing to consult with then Attorney General Loretta Lynch before making an historic decision back in July 2016. Of course the decision was not to prosecute Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information. Now that is the very reason President Trump cited for firing Comey, remember back in May 2017, usurping the Attorney General's authority. The IG will also reportedly criticize Comey for ignoring objections when he announced the reopening of the Clinton Email investigation in late October, right before the election in 2016. Now the IG's revelations may cause Comey's defenders to reconsider a man they once called a principled defender of the FBI and DOJ against the President."

He thought that the investigation in some sense as corrupt for four of five reason that's he mentions and he says, \"I didn't want the FBI to be tainted or corrupted by that. I wanted people to know that the FBI had done an investigation and made its own decision about that, it was a horrendous thing for him to do, it violated every protocol on the face of the earth, it wasn't his job but that's why he did it. He said President Obama's comments about Hillary Clinton's guilt or innocence were highly inappropriate. He said that Loretta Lynch, it was inappropriate for her to direct him to call it a matter and not an investigation. He thought it was inappropriate that the department of justice attorneys were not insisting on getting the emails from Clinton's attorneys and he actually had to go to Sally Yates and say, \"I'm going to call for the appointment of the special counsel if my agents don't get these emails\", and they them a day or two later.

When you are conspiring, working together, remember not only are they lovers, but they both work for the FBI and they're discussing how they're going to withhold documents from Congress, a battle that we're still fighting this day and I think if a judge or jury saw that, it'd be very crystal clear that the only reason they are holding them back is because they didn't like Jason Chaffetz and Trey Gowdy and other people asking them hard questions."

If they had the documents that long, if there were copies, that's a pretty efficient review, and I got to tell you, diligence and other mechanisms, you can go through some documents pretty quick to see whether they are copies or not. We do it with litigation all the time. I'm not so sure he had to announce that publicly to protect himself or the FBI. He could have gone through that, and remember, we're talking about a month before the election, which DOJ guidelines say, \"you are not supposed to do anything that can influence an election\".

McCabe, the former deputy FBI director has asked for Congressional immunity for any further Congressional testimony. According to ABC News, the DOJ, Inspector General's report finds that's Comey was insubordinate and criticizes his handling of the email investigation. The report also casts serious doubt on the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch's role in that same investigation, particularly her tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton. Let's discuss these amazing new falls from grace with former secret service agent, Dan Bongino of NRATV, and President of Judicial Watch Tom Fitton and Jeff Beatty who served in the FBI and CIA. Let's start with you Tom, it is quite something to hear that litany of sound bites with the grand exaggeration, with the bombing of London in 1941. Come on what we've seen in the Inspector General's Report just the dribs and drabs that we've seen so far, is an FBI that was mishandling this investigation, not consulting with superiors, and apparently just defying internal protocol and how they handle these matters."

Not so much the sham investigation itself but the fact is that it was a sham investigation rather than confront directly, he attacked Hillary Clinton to distract from the fact that he was protecting her.

And just so everybody's clear on this, there is a protocol for quarterly briefings to Congress about sensitive investigations. Comey even acknowledges that in a hearing up on the Hill. And they ask him quarterly, every three months, this isn't difficult for anybody to understand. He hides it for eight months. They ask him, Representative Elise Stefanik, \"Mr. Comey why did you hide this investigation from Congress for eight months?\" You're never going to believe this, you know what he says? Because it's sensitive. After acknowledging that they brief Congress every three months because of sensitive investigations. Of course I'm talking about the investigation of Donald Trump.

But one of the underlying thing people are asking that I talk to is, where are the whistle blowers? Where are the rank and file whistle blowers here? And one of the reasons why there are not rank and file whistle blowers coming forward is there is a pay system in the FBI. You alluded to the fact that they don't get the best base pay but there is system that rewards them with an additional 25% of their base pay, that used to be called administratively uncontrollable overtime, and it became LEAP, Law Enforcement Availability Pay. And what it boils down to is FBI agents have to certify and supervisors have to certify that additional time has been worked, basically 50 hour weeks or more. Sometimes these corners are cut, a great book is out there called `Fraud Fighters\" written by a guy named Wells who was a former FBI agent. He talks about actual fraud that was conducted and then supervisors certified that yeah this time was worked. And that puts people in positions--"

We've had to file cloture to speed the process up 101 times during President Trump's administration to try to speed up the confirmation of his appointments. That's happened only 24 times in the first two years over the last six presidents. So they've been slow walking his effort to not only staff up his administration, but they made it more difficult to confirm judges as well.

Obama lost the House and almost lost the Senate. Yes, I think it's going to be a knockdown, drag out fight all the way to the finish. But we are optimistic we can hold the Senate, still have a majority, and still confirm the president's appointments. It's important to remember, the Senate is in the personnel business, the House is not. If we lose the Senate the president will be kneecapped for the last two years of his term, on judicial appointments, on appointments to the cabinet boards and commissions and all of that. I think the American people need to understand the consequences for this administration if we were to lose the Senate."

The draft of a Senate report obtain by FOX News shows that Obama officials let Iran gain access to the U.S. financial system despite testifying to Congress that that would not ever happen. For analysis we're joined by Victor Davis Hanson of Stanford's Hoover Institution. All right, VDH, you wrote a whole column about the prevarication of this administration. Before we get to the Iran deal specifics I want to read something for our viewers who might have missed it. You wrote \"We are slowly appreciating over the last year that lying under oath was an Obama administration requisite for a high position in the Intel community. FBI Director Comey lied about the sequence of the investigation in the Clinton emails, lied by omission to the president when he failed to include that fact in the Steele dossier.\" And then you said \"Director of National Intel Jim Clapper, CIA director John Brennan may prove to be the two most prevaricating officials in the history of any modern administration. The Obama administration institutionalized deception as a tool of government.\" Wow. I love that column, number one. Number two, the Iran deal fits perfectly into your analysis, does it not, what we learned today?"

One is they felt that their exalted ends, tat so moral and noble that any means necessary would be justified them to achieve them. But more importantly, Ben Rhodes explained it to us when he said they had created an echo chamber of compliant, obsequious and toady journalists. So there was no independent audit on them. And if you were charitable, Laura, you would say they just misread human nature. They would think that if they were going to be magnanimous to the Iranians they would be paid in kind, whereas I think more likely the Iranians looked at that magnanimity as weakness to be exploited rather to be appreciated. If you were less charitable you would say they wanted to do almost anything to get a signature achievement before he went out of office. And if you were really less charitable you would they had some warped view that the Iranians and the Shia Persian aspect and Muslims and Islam deserved a second chance, so there was going to be a new hegemonic power in the Middle East to balance the Sunni Gulf monarchies, and they thought that might be somehow good. Pull away from Israel, Hezbollah, Hamas, Assad, Iran, that might be something we should if not promote at least tolerate. We saw the wages with that with Hezbollah and missile in Yemen. It's an utter mess."

As if the left hand of the American government was at odds with the right hand. It made no sense. But, again, that was a deal that should have gone through the U.S. Senate to be ratified as a treaty, but there was no support public support and there was no support even among Democratic senators, at least enough to get it ratified. There was only about 40 percent of the American people thought it was a sane thing to do, and yet they pushed it, pushed it, pushed it. And I guess historians are going to argue why they would have done such a silly thing. Once again it shows you that Trump's animal cunning or his instinctual suspicions that this was not a good deal are sort of ratified or --"
