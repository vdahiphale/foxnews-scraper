But let me step back and tell you that I think it's a little too early to say that because there are nine debates and 31 weeks to go before the first votes are cast in Iowa. So we have a long way to go? The other thing is, I thought it was very interesting reading about a polling -- a live poll that was taken in Iowa with undecided Democrats and they had a group of African-Americans, a group of non-educated and college educated and married and I meant that at all of these different groups. What was interesting is those people are not on Twitter, okay? They're just watching, and they're telling you they're dialing it up or dialing it down whether they like it, or they don't like it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Very interesting to me is that when Kamala Harris tore into Joe Biden, the numbers for Kamala Harris went way up. But then when Biden responded, his numbers went way up, too with African-Americans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So I think it's too early to say what will ultimately happen to him. And I do think that somebody like a Michelle Goldberg at \"The New York Times\" who has -- she very much wants a Democrat to win, believe me, she does. But she has always felt that Biden is just not going to be there for them at the end, because he is not going to be able to have the new energy. And I remember President Bush talking about elections, and that, especially the Democrats, they like to look forward. They like new and what Biden did today, when he tried to clean up his debate is he went right back to looking at Obama and Biden and hanging on to that, and not looking forward. So that probably will hurt him in the long run.",

And when from first -- kindergarten to third grade, I walked three blocks to school. But when I went into the fourth grade, I had to be bused. It took about an hour to get to the school. I was one of only five white children there. Nobody was prepared to handle just the dynamics. All that happened, it was a really, really tough two years.

Went out and bought beds for children, not controversial. Well, apparently not for AOC, who had celebrated this Wayfair protest by some of their employees -- not the company in general -- about selling beds to the government to put kids in bed.

Harris herself was not a Civil Rights hero, her father was literally a Stanford Economics Professor. She went to high school in Montreal, Canada. She was a child of privilege, if there ever was one. As for forced busing, it's amazing that anybody, particularly any Democrat would defend it. Busing didn't work. It was an abject failure. Guess who hated it? Black families. It took black kids out of their neighborhoods, and it patronized them. It didn't raise anybody's scores in the end, busing didn't work. Honest people on the left admit that. Brookings admitted that. The only people who like busing then and now are rich liberals, the ones totally insulated from the effects of their failed and stupid social policy. Everyone else in this country, 90 percent of Americans, according to Gallup, polling at the height of busing, and that's 90 percent of both black and white Americans thought busing was awful. So good call Democrats. Run on that. More busing. Joe Biden is a racist. Here's our nominee Kamala Harris, listen to her explain why she is a very good person, and you're morally flawed. Good call. That'll definitely work, just like it did with Hillary Clinton last time. Morons. Lisa Boothe is a senior fellow At Independent Women's Voice and she joins us tonight.

So you know, a little bit interesting strategy there, and clearly this was calculated, right? So she had a tweet that she put up with a picture of her as a little girl saying that little girl was me. They're selling t- shirts now as well. So clearly, this was a thought out calculation by the campaign. But I do think Vice President Biden is vulnerable. And here's the thing, there's been this air of inevitability with him. He has been ahead in the polls because of name ID. Also this perceived electability somewhat like Hillary Clinton, right? There's this air of inevitability with her in the Democratic establishment, and I think that's dangerous. Because anyone who watched are dangerous for Democrats, because anyone who watched last night's debate cannot objectively say that Vice President Biden is a strong candidate. He did not have a good night. He was not prepared for these attacks. He was not sharp. And quite frankly, he even gave up in the middle of trying to respond to Senator Harris's attacks."

I mean, if you're vehemently defending your record, you don't just say, you know what, whatever, it's -- you know, we're running out of time, I'm tired, you know, whatever. That's basically what happened. And he had a tough time getting his words out. He just didn't look sharp. And I actually think the most potent line of attack was from Eric Swalwell, which I hate to give him any credit at all. But his line of attack on the generational one, right, because I think the biggest challenge for Vice President Biden is we've seen these big change elections with the previous elections, right? So Americans have been asking for change. And Vice President Biden by the product of him being part of the previous administration, he is going to have to continue to look back and explain his record; continue to look back, and it's going to be difficult for him to look forward. And so I think that is a vulnerability for Vice President Biden when he is on the debate stage, particularly with some of these younger candidates who are making the case for the future. So I think that's a vulnerability for Vice President Biden, in addition to -- I just think being a terrible candidate personally."

I'm rarely right in my predictions, but I did call Joe Biden. It was very obvious to me that the Democratic Party could never nominate an elderly white man as its nominee. I mean, they -- how could you do that? Do you think Biden is over after last night?"

But let me step back and tell you that I think it's a little too early to say that because there are nine debates and 31 weeks to go before the first votes are cast in Iowa. So we have a long way to go? The other thing is, I thought it was very interesting reading about a polling -- a live poll that was taken in Iowa with undecided Democrats and they had a group of African-Americans, a group of non-educated and college educated and married and I meant that at all of these different groups. What was interesting is those people are not on Twitter, okay? They're just watching, and they're telling you they're dialing it up or dialing it down whether they like it, or they don't like it. Very interesting to me is that when Kamala Harris tore into Joe Biden, the numbers for Kamala Harris went way up. But then when Biden responded, his numbers went way up, too with African-Americans. So I think it's too early to say what will ultimately happen to him. And I do think that somebody like a Michelle Goldberg at \"The New York Times\" who has -- she very much wants a Democrat to win, believe me, she does. But she has always felt that Biden is just not going to be there for them at the end, because he is not going to be able to have the new energy. And I remember President Bush talking about elections, and that, especially the Democrats, they like to look forward. They like new and what Biden did today, when he tried to clean up his debate is he went right back to looking at Obama and Biden and hanging on to that, and not looking forward. So that probably will hurt him in the long run."

It didn't serve anybody. Nobody liked it. Was there -- have you ever seen a poll that showed majority support for forced busing among African-Americans? We're going to take your kids and bring them across town so they can go to school with white kids and you should feel grateful for that. Well, there's no poll that shows that, is there?"

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, that -- no, there's not. And you know, I don't really talk about this too much, though, I did write about it in my book. Denver, Colorado was one of the first cities in the country to try to integrate the schools through busing. That's where I lived. And when from first -- kindergarten to third grade, I walked three blocks to school. But when I went into the fourth grade, I had to be bused. It took about an hour to get to the school. I was one of only five white children there. Nobody was prepared to handle just the dynamics. All that happened, it was a really, really tough two years. And my parents reluctantly left the city, they were very much for integration of the schools. But the way that that was handled did not serve -- it didn't serve me well. Now, somebody like Robert Smith, who is the billionaire who just paid off all the student loans in Morehouse College. He said in his speech that day, that busing really benefited him. And that's great. But we are still today talking about integration of schools. That is actually the debate that the Democrats are now going to have because the question is going to be, \"Do you now think busing is a good idea?\" And maybe we need to have that discussion. But it was kind of strange to look back on that. But look, here's the other thing --"

If President Obama sets up a concentration camp in the forest and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is too busy waiting tables to hear about it, did the concentration camp exist? And the answer, of course is, \"No, it didn't.\" Because nothing is actually bad until one of our political opponents does it. That's the rule. Well, President Trump is in Japan for the G20 Summit. After I interview with him, he will be traveling to South Korea. Now, the President says he is willing to go to the DMZ, the demilitarized zone for an impromptu Summit with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The President just tweeted this and we're quoting, \"After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I'll be leaving Japan for South Korea with President Moon. While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea agrees to this, I would meet him at the border at the DMZ just to shake his hand and say hello.\" End quote. According to \"The New York Times\" the President says he thought up the idea of a DMZ meeting literally this morning. The President's last Summit with Kim Jong-un in Vietnam in February was a failure, but this meeting could restart the administration's efforts to reach some kind of nuclear deal with the dictatorship on the Korean Peninsula. We're here in Japan, we will continue to follow the developments of course, right across the water in real-time. Kamala Harris was the most successful at pandering to identity politics last night, it was nauseating, but maybe it was effective. Predictively, the press loved it. We will tell you how much they loved it after the break. But first, we crammed a lot into our final day in Japan, which is a cool country by the way.

In fact, there's a monsoon brewing right now, it should be here within hours. It's in the East China Sea right now near Okinawa.

He is everything that was embodied by Hillary Clinton, which Lisa Boothe pointed out before -- kinder, gentler. He doesn't do tough interviews. Risk adverse, white, boring. That doesn't do a lot for ratings and clicks. Kamala Harris on the other hand could be a historic figure. She could be the female Barack Obama, the first female President and a top prosecutor who is a street fighter like Trump, so she's going to give you the big sound bites like Trump will. So yes, as far as what media is rooting for, I thought it might have been Buttie for a while, but he's almost too cerebral for our current media climate.

So you do have to address the cost on some end, because you're going to pay for it one way or the other.

I think that, you know, I'm an economic nationalist, I think if we want to see certain images in films, we have to start making our own films. Hollywood is made up of followers. They follow trends.

Plus Marianne Williamson was the breakout star of the Democratic debate last night. You couldn't turn away, could you? Who is she and what reality does she live in? We will try to figure it out after the break. We will be sad to leave Japan this weekend, but we won't be leaving empty handed. Japan is a country of superb craftsmen. We visited one of the best today. Watch."

By the way, I saw your trip, it was great. The boats, the trains. It was fantastic. I couldn't take my eyes off it. I did feel bad for you, it looks like you got a little wet there. All right. Enough small talk for me. Let's get right to it. Story number three, AOC and one of the more bizarre moves I've ever seen is joining a protest against beds for migrant children. Listen, Tucker, regardless of your position on immigration, no one wants to see kids sleeping on the floor, so the government did what? It went out trying to fix an obvious problem, right? Went out and bought beds for children, not controversial. Well, apparently not for AOC, who had celebrated this Wayfair protest by some of their employees -- not the company in general -- about selling beds to the government to put kids in bed. This is a head scratcher. I really don't get it even for liberals it seems like a very bizarre new low. But you know, whatever. I'm done trying to explain liberals, so --"

Listen, they have been trying to evaporate the border for a long time and Julian Castro, you know, listen, I don't agree with the guy, but at least Tucker, he was honest for once. He came out in the Democratic debate number one, and basically said, let's just decriminalize it. Let's decriminalize the whole crossing the border illegal thing. Who needs it? What's the point? And you know, for guys like me, and you who do this for a living and have to deal with Democrats who constantly change their principles after licking their fingers and checking the wind, at least you finally have a guy on stage, right, saying, \"Hey, here's what we're all about. Forget the border. It's just this suggestion.\" Like I said, it's one of those four way stop signs nobody ever stops for. Just come on in. So Julian Castro in a rare moment of honesty from a liberal, terrible idea, but at least he was honest. All right. What did you think of that one? Liked that one? I didn't hear you. You've got to give me some feedback. What? All right, come on."

      "utterance": "Will you support a Medicare- for-All plan that essentially cancels private insurance for millions of Americans? Tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of Americans, and some of them raised their hands. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders -- Tucker, listen, I don't know who got in there idea what kind of focus group, maybe it was like some focus group that was in one of those states that legalized weed beforehand, but the focus group that told them that this is some kind of an electoral winner, telling Americans they are going to cancel their private health insurance -- lay off the psychedelic mushrooms. It is not good for you. This was the worst focus group ever. Don't do it. Terrible idea. Bad call by the Democrats. What are you laughing at? I liked that."

And I think we could all work together and maybe we can get a man on the moon. And I will tell her, \"Girlfriend, you are so on. Because the United States of America is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up.\" I'm going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field. And sir, love will win."

      "utterance": "Wow, well, that's kind of intense. Who is this Marianne Williamson? We found a couple of her tweets that we hope will put her in context. Here are a few of them quote, \"God is big. Swine flu is small. See every cell of your body filled with divine light. Pour God's love on our immune system. Truth protects another.\" Another quote, \"Imagine within you a pool of light filled with love, greatness, creativity and joy. Now, see yourself stepping into it. Now stay there.\" I kind of liked that actually. I've got to be honest. I kind of like that. Here's another one. \"Just beneath the surface. This isn't politics. It's black magic, entirely a psychic battle. Use your shield of virtue and your sort of truth.\" I am not exactly sure what that means. She seems harmless at least. I'd like to meet her. Anyway, that's it for us tonight. Before we leave Japan, we had a great week from here and it would not have been possible without the people we brought. Really the best crew in all of television. Benjamin West, Kyle Rothenberg, who I'm looking at right behind the cameras are the best at bringing a show any place in the world and they have done that. Our producers Kelly McNally, Charlie Cougar, Emily Lynn are favorites and of course our executive producer, the diabolical genius behind the curtain, Justin Wells. A sincere thanks to all of them and the team back in New York and Washington. They make this possible. You'll see our interview with the President on Monday, until then, have the best weekend with the ones you love. We will be back 8:00 p.m., the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Good night from Kyoto, Japan. Sean Hannity is next.
