One of the main things they were saying was that if Donald Trump lost the election, he would not accept the results and this would be a deep challenge to our democracy. Well it turns out, like a lot of what they tell you, this was pure projection because ever since that November, more than two years ago, they've been working not just to ignore the results but also to destroy anybody associated with those results. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Exhibit A is fallen National Security Adviser, Mike Flynn.

And those documents appear to confirm some of Flynn's claims.

Here's what Flynn did. He gave an untrue statement to the FBI about an entirely legal phone call he'd had with the Russian Ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. And that's it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Mike Flynn did not collude with our enemies. He did not leak national security secrets. He didn't even lie under oath. He simply claimed not to remember talking about a certain subject and the FBI didn't believe him. The government threatened to prosecute Flynn's son, so he pled (ph) guilty. That's what happened. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } \"Oh, but,\" say the news anchors, \"Flynn lied. He's a liar, unlike us. We never lie. We're good people.\" But Mike Flynn is not a good person. He's a liar and a criminal. That's what they're telling you. And it's partly true. Flynn did give inaccurate statements to FBI agents. He's admitted that. Even though he wasn't under oath that is a crime. OK. But what's interesting about all of this is that the FBI also lied to Mike Flynn. And yet, somehow, that's not a crime. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, to restate, and you should definitely remember this, get a pen, it is OK for the government to lie to you. They do it all the time. Constantly, in fact. But if the government ever catches you in a factual contradiction, you are shafted. They can send you to prison, bankrupt you, threaten your children. That's the system that we have. America's news anchors think it's great. The system has served them well. They're on the government side on this one, in fact, on most matters. Whatever the ruling class is for, they're fully onboard. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here, for example, is behavior that the news anchors consider totally fine. That would be in stark contrast to Mike Flynn's dastardly lying. So, here's what we know. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We know that notes taken by Andy McCabe, he was in the Deputy Director of the FBI, show that the Bureau deliberately planned to trick Flynn and take advantage of his friendliness and his stated desire to help their investigation. We know this because Andy McCabe took notes. And in his notes, he explained that he told Mike Flynn he wanted to interview him, \"As quickly, quietly, and discreetly as possible.\" McCabe suggested that having a lawyer, one of those pesky attorneys present, would be unnecessary and time-consuming, a hassle. \"Don't worry about it man.\" Well Flynn, and a close associate who we talked to this afternoon, describes him as trusting by nature, agreed to those terms. Obviously, a mistake. He clearly thought he was helping the FBI, but he wasn't. He was walking into a trap. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } One of the agents he met was Peter Strzok. Remember the name? He's a political activist who famously promised his mistress he'd help to stop Trump, whatever that means. Well, we're getting a sense of what it means, actually. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } According to the FBI's own documents, Andy McCabe, Peter Strzok and the rest decided that FBI agents should not warn Flynn that making a misleading statement to the FBI would be a crime. Now, the analysis suggests that somehow Flynn knew this and he must have been a moron for not bringing a law - a lawyer, and that since he ran an intelligence agency he must have known that any calls with Kislyak would be taped and transcribed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But that is, in fact, an argument for his innocence. Of course, he knew that the FBI would be able to check everything he said against information they themselves had gathered. So, knowing that, why would he lie? Maybe because he didn't think he was lying. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As Law Professor Jonathan Turley put it yesterday, Flynn's downfall appears to have been engineered from day one. The feds chose their man and then picked the crime to pin on him. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

So, why did the FBI approach him? They knew what he said. They knew it was legal. The answer is they wanted to frame him, and they succeeded. And he did not tell them false information. Some of it may have been paused. It may have been nuanced. He did not lie. And indeed, the agents who actual 302s are available said he didn't lie.

Now, the individual mandate, you'll remember, was previously upheld by the Supreme Court. But on the grounds that it was a tax, the fine for not following the mandate was eliminated last year. So, O'Connor says this makes that ruling invalid (ph) because it's no longer a tax. The ruling is certain to be appealed - appealed, obviously. Obamacare, by the way, was passed on March 21st, 2010. It was signed three days later. Wow! Didn't see that coming. We'll continue to follow it, obviously. That's it for tonight and for the week. Man, it went fast like all good things.

One of the main things they were saying was that if Donald Trump lost the election, he would not accept the results and this would be a deep challenge to our democracy. Well it turns out, like a lot of what they tell you, this was pure projection because ever since that November, more than two years ago, they've been working not just to ignore the results but also to destroy anybody associated with those results. Exhibit A is fallen National Security Adviser, Mike Flynn. He really has become the archetype for all of this. Newly filed court documents confirm it. Documents from the Mueller investigation showed just how far the FBI went to destroy Flynn's life. Trace Gallagher joins us with details on that, Trace?"

And those documents appear to confirm some of Flynn's claims. For example, two FBI agents, including former anti-Trump agent, Peter Strzok, \"both had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying,\" and that warning Michael Flynn \"might adversely affect the rapport.\" And former FBI Director James Comey acknowledged that during the George W.

He was a Russian spy, a secret agent serving a hostile foreign power. He and Carter Page were seen reloading on The Grassy Knoll in Dallas that kind of thing. The details might be hazy. But everybody you asked would know for certain that General Mike Flynn, after 33 years in uniform, betrayed this country. How did they know that? Because the media told them so."

      "utterance": "It's funny because it's treason. We know the answer was some precision it turns out because the details are publicly available. Here's what Flynn did. He gave an untrue statement to the FBI about an entirely legal phone call he'd had with the Russian Ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. And that's it. Mike Flynn did not collude with our enemies. He did not leak national security secrets. He didn't even lie under oath. He simply claimed not to remember talking about a certain subject and the FBI didn't believe him. The government threatened to prosecute Flynn's son, so he pled (ph) guilty. That's what happened. \"Oh, but,\" say the news anchors, \"Flynn lied. He's a liar, unlike us. We never lie. We're good people.\" But Mike Flynn is not a good person. He's a liar and a criminal. That's what they're telling you. And it's partly true. Flynn did give inaccurate statements to FBI agents. He's admitted that. Even though he wasn't under oath that is a crime. OK. But what's interesting about all of this is that the FBI also lied to Mike Flynn. And yet, somehow, that's not a crime. So, to restate, and you should definitely remember this, get a pen, it is OK for the government to lie to you. They do it all the time. Constantly, in fact. But if the government ever catches you in a factual contradiction, you are shafted. They can send you to prison, bankrupt you, threaten your children. That's the system that we have. America's news anchors think it's great. The system has served them well. They're on the government side on this one, in fact, on most matters. Whatever the ruling class is for, they're fully onboard. Here, for example, is behavior that the news anchors consider totally fine. That would be in stark contrast to Mike Flynn's dastardly lying. So, here's what we know. We know that notes taken by Andy McCabe, he was in the Deputy Director of the FBI, show that the Bureau deliberately planned to trick Flynn and take advantage of his friendliness and his stated desire to help their investigation. We know this because Andy McCabe took notes. And in his notes, he explained that he told Mike Flynn he wanted to interview him, \"As quickly, quietly, and discreetly as possible.\" McCabe suggested that having a lawyer, one of those pesky attorneys present, would be unnecessary and time-consuming, a hassle. \"Don't worry about it man.\" Well Flynn, and a close associate who we talked to this afternoon, describes him as trusting by nature, agreed to those terms. Obviously, a mistake. He clearly thought he was helping the FBI, but he wasn't. He was walking into a trap. One of the agents he met was Peter Strzok. Remember the name? He's a political activist who famously promised his mistress he'd help to stop Trump, whatever that means. Well, we're getting a sense of what it means, actually. According to the FBI's own documents, Andy McCabe, Peter Strzok and the rest decided that FBI agents should not warn Flynn that making a misleading statement to the FBI would be a crime. Now, the analysis suggests that somehow Flynn knew this and he must have been a moron for not bringing a law - a lawyer, and that since he ran an intelligence agency he must have known that any calls with Kislyak would be taped and transcribed. But that is, in fact, an argument for his innocence. Of course, he knew that the FBI would be able to check everything he said against information they themselves had gathered. So, knowing that, why would he lie? Maybe because he didn't think he was lying. As Law Professor Jonathan Turley put it yesterday, Flynn's downfall appears to have been engineered from day one. The feds chose their man and then picked the crime to pin on him."

Joe diGenova is a former U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and he joins us now. I just want to state at the outset, Joe, he lied, say the news anchors, he lied, and he deserves whatever's coming to him. Assess that claim, if you would."

      "speaker": "JOSEPH DIGENOVA, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA",
      "utterance": "He did not lie. And, in fact, the FBI knew it. Let's remember what this is about. This was a pre-textual crime created by the FBI and by Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General. Remember, after the election, Hillary Clinton needed a reason why she lost. Enter Russian collusion. Part of that was to find somebody in the Administration to frame for talking to the Russians. They found General Flynn. But, in fact, all of General Flynn's conversations with the Russian Ambassador and everybody else were legal. So, why did the FBI approach him? They knew what he said. They knew it was legal. The answer is they wanted to frame him, and they succeeded. And he did not tell them false information. Some of it may have been paused. It may have been nuanced. He did not lie. And indeed, the agents who actual 302s are available said he didn't lie. And it's interesting that Mueller did not turn over the original 302s to Judge Sullivan today. He turned over an interview of Agent Strzok, which was done months later by Mueller's people. The answer is Michael Flynn was framed in order to get at Donald Trump. Sally Yates, James Comey, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, all planned it. What you are watching play out in an American courtroom is one of the most disgraceful events in American criminal justice, and everybody on Mueller's team should be ashamed of themselves, and none of them should ever be allowed to go back into the Department of Justice."

And then they got vindictive by using the criminal justice system, weaponizing it. And John Brennan at the CIA and James Clapper followed through on their promise threat to figure out a way to get the people that they didn't want elected in order to make up for the fact that she, Hillary Clinton, had lost. This has become one that - one of the greatest scandals in the history of our country, and the media is ignoring it. And it is - it is - it is truly important that what you are doing by focusing on these stories continue to be done until there's a new Attorney General and there can be a grand jury to find out who was it that leaked the conversation of Michael Flynn with the Russian Ambassador.

So, it's just kind of - it's almost I'm taken aback by that, you know, that people are actually interested in - in talking to me about it. And I'm like \"Wow, I never saw this day coming.\" So, it's surreal."

Judge Reed O'Connor says the individual mandate, the part of the law that requires you to participate, is unconstitutional, and because it cannot be separated from the let - rest of the law, which it cannot be, the entire law is invalid. Now, the individual mandate, you'll remember, was previously upheld by the Supreme Court. But on the grounds that it was a tax, the fine for not following the mandate was eliminated last year. So, O'Connor says this makes that ruling invalid (ph) because it's no longer a tax. The ruling is certain to be appealed - appealed, obviously. Obamacare, by the way, was passed on March 21st, 2010. It was signed three days later. Wow! Didn't see that coming. We'll continue to follow it, obviously. That's it for tonight and for the week. Man, it went fast like all good things. We'll be back Monday at 8:00, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. DVR it if you can figure out how to do that. Tell us if you can. Mr. Chaffetz, in for Sean, right now. Have a great weekend. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.
