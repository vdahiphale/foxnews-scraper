Thomas Lane was released from jail this afternoon after being locked up for about a week. Lane had been held in lieu of a $750,000 cash bail. Let's bring in the panel, talk about police reform, what's happening, what's not, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., now currently the chairman of RX Saver, and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" Charlie, the president says he's coming out with some reforms, a list of reforms. The testimony today really dealt with a lot of different factors. Is there some bipartisan solution to this? CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": I think that there certainly are. Obviously, the devil is in the details. But that testimony from Mr. Floyd's brother I thought was remarkable, it was very powerful. And it was a reminder that the things that he talked about are things that I think just about everybody, certainly every politician that has talked about any of this stuff in America today would agree with. And when he talked about the things that needed to be done, such as better training for police officers, and teaching -- and reinforcing the fact that deadly force must be rare and only when life is at stake, that's a far cry from some of the crazier things we are hearing some people talk about, about defunding police departments and things like that that. I wish that the peaceful protesters and the Democrat Party, everybody would just turn to Mr. Floyd's brother and listen to him, because what he's talking about right there has support from 99 percent of Americans and is probably a very wise way to go forward from here.",

It's my understanding that some senior members of the president's staff, including his son-in-law, was on the Hill meeting with Senator Scott, and President Trump was at the same time touting that he is opposed to banning chokeholds and lifting the limited liability protection that policemen, or cops enjoy. He should follow Mr. Floyd's brother's recommendation I think we could find an easy and quick and powerfully effective answer to the challenges that a lot of Americans are facing. With regard to that polling and listening to what the president said in that meeting with some African-American leaders, it what's interesting, COVID unmasked and showed the fragility that a lot of black American households face, particularly working black households face, and the kinds of things we need to be thinking about, the kinds of investments we need to be thinking about as a nation. So as much as the president is proud of the things he's done, and he should be, COVID-19 has revealed to us as a nation the kinds of things that particularly African-Americans and brown and black communities are facing, including the fact that black and brown households face a much, much harsher reality from COVID than other households. And in the poll numbers, I agree with you, Bret, they are real, at least at the moment. The president could easily come back.

He tweets, it has been suggested that we should rename as many as 10 of our legendary military bases such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Benning in Georgia, etcetera. These monumental and very powerful bases have become part of a great American heritage, and a history of winning, victory, and freedom. The United States of America trained and deployed our heroes on these hallowed grounds, and won two World Wars. Therefore, my administration will not even consider the renaming of these magnificent and fabled military institutions -- installations, I should say. Our history as the greatest nation in the world will not be tampered with. Respect our military. Meantime, NASCAR just announced that it is moving in the opposite direction. The stock car racing organization is banning the confederate flag from all of its races and properties. NASCAR saying in a statement, the presence of the confederate flag at NASCAR events runs contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry.

John Gleeson, himself a former Bill Clinton appointed judge was asked to review the Justice Department's efforts to dismiss the criminal charges against the former national security advisor. Gleeson said the government's arguments were not credible and that it quote, has engaged in highly irregular conduct to benefit a political ally of the president. The facts of this case overcome the presumption of regularity. Flynn pleaded guilty twice to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the former Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the 2016 presidential transition. He later tried to withdraw the plea, saying the FBI acted in bad faith. The attorney general last month asked Judge Emmet Sullivan to drop the case saying federal agents had no good reason to question Flynn in the first place.

Chris is also the author of a new book Countdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days that Change the World. Chris, good evening. I can't wait to read the book. I want to talk about it in just a minute but I want to get your thoughts about where this race stands right now considering we're through two major crises in the middle of them really, the pandemic and the race situation after the George Floyd killing."

I still think though that this story is going to be written over the next few months and especially as we get to September and October. I do think the president has had a couple of tough weeks though because you look at the polls and when there people are asked, how the president has handled the protests, handled the whole George Floyd situation, by about a two to one margin, people disapprove of the way he's handled it. And I'm not so sure it's the specifics of where he is on police or this specific proposal. I think there is just a feeling of that there's a lot of division in this country, a lot of polarization. And oftentimes we see presidents try to bind the wounds and bring the nation together and I think that there's a -- seems to be a feeling in this country that the -- this president is not doing that right now."

We ended up gaining 2.5 million. Thought we're going to go up 20 percent, we went down to 13 percent. That was a big boost for the president. And you know, if -- I think -- you know, it's funny because you and I have talked about this before and I thought that the election would be a referendum on how this president was handling COVID and the economic fallout and I still think it may well be that. Not where it is now but where it will be in September and October. But now there is this question whether it's specifically about policing and George Floyd and racism or whether it's just about the question of unity in the country and who can heal the wounds. I think it could be a referendum on all those issues. You know, at this point, the president is kind of out there by himself. Joe Biden is largely, not entirely anymore, but largely been sticking to his basement of his home in Delaware. But at some point, he's going to have to get out on the campaign trail too. We've seen that that isn't always a smooth path for Joe Biden. So, I think this race is up for grabs. Biden is ahead but either one of these men could win it."

You know, it's -- I'm delighted that somebody my favorite review was in the post with that you said. I know what happened in 1945 but it reads like a thriller. And the 116 days, Countdown 1945, the story of the 116 days that changed the world, it begins on April 12th, 1945, exactly 75 years ago when Harry Truman has been vice president for less than three months is summoned to the White House. He thinks he's going to meet with President Roosevelt. When he gets there, he's told that Roosevelt is dead and now he's president. And that evening after he's sworn in, the Secretary of War takes him aside and says that we've got the Manhattan project and the bomb. He didn't know anything about that and there's one surprise after another. Whether it's Truman, whether it's the scientists at Los Alamos, the flight crew on Tinian Island who were worried that the bomb was going to -- when it landed at Hiroshima was going to blow their B-29 apart. So it's quite a thriller and I hope quite a page turner."

      "utterance": "That's testimony on Capitol Hill today. Meantime, we have some breaking news tonight. FOX News has just confirmed one of four fired Minneapolis police officers charged in the death of George Floyd has posted bail. Thomas Lane was released from jail this afternoon after being locked up for about a week. Lane had been held in lieu of a $750,000 cash bail. Let's bring in the panel, talk about police reform, what's happening, what's not, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., now currently the chairman of RX Saver, and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" Charlie, the president says he's coming out with some reforms, a list of reforms. The testimony today really dealt with a lot of different factors. Is there some bipartisan solution to this? CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": I think that there certainly are. Obviously, the devil is in the details. But that testimony from Mr. Floyd's brother I thought was remarkable, it was very powerful. And it was a reminder that the things that he talked about are things that I think just about everybody, certainly every politician that has talked about any of this stuff in America today would agree with. And when he talked about the things that needed to be done, such as better training for police officers, and teaching -- and reinforcing the fact that deadly force must be rare and only when life is at stake, that's a far cry from some of the crazier things we are hearing some people talk about, about defunding police departments and things like that that. I wish that the peaceful protesters and the Democrat Party, everybody would just turn to Mr. Floyd's brother and listen to him, because what he's talking about right there has support from 99 percent of Americans and is probably a very wise way to go forward from here."

But you look at all of the things we've done, we've now worked on prison reform, so important, and so many of the things. But when you look at the economics, when you look at how well the black community has been doing under this administration, nobody's done anything like we've done."

      "utterance": "There's a lot of questions about polls nowadays and which ones are good and which ones are bad. The Gallup poll has been cited by this president numerous times when his approval was high. This Gallup poll just out, he takes a 10-point hit from the beginning of May, and disapproval is up. And then on party identification, down seven among Republicans, independents down seven, Democrats down nine, but he's already down at the bottom of the barrel there. Harold, where you see this now as far as this president and what he does or doesn't have to do to change his situation?"

      "speaker": "HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE",
      "utterance": "Charlie laid out very well what the country, particularly Democrats should do with Mr. Floyd's brothers testimony, which I agree with Charlie was all the things he said plus raw and compelling, all very consistent with the Floyd family's eulogy of their brother and uncle and father. I would hope the president would listen as well. It's my understanding that some senior members of the president's staff, including his son-in-law, was on the Hill meeting with Senator Scott, and President Trump was at the same time touting that he is opposed to banning chokeholds and lifting the limited liability protection that policemen, or cops enjoy. He should follow Mr. Floyd's brother's recommendation I think we could find an easy and quick and powerfully effective answer to the challenges that a lot of Americans are facing. With regard to that polling and listening to what the president said in that meeting with some African-American leaders, it what's interesting, COVID unmasked and showed the fragility that a lot of black American households face, particularly working black households face, and the kinds of things we need to be thinking about, the kinds of investments we need to be thinking about as a nation. So as much as the president is proud of the things he's done, and he should be, COVID-19 has revealed to us as a nation the kinds of things that particularly African-Americans and brown and black communities are facing, including the fact that black and brown households face a much, much harsher reality from COVID than other households. And in the poll numbers, I agree with you, Bret, they are real, at least at the moment. The president could easily come back. But the most disturbing thing I saw on your show tonight was that family in New Jersey, the brothers that decided to reenact some episode that they believed happened in Minneapolis which we all saw on tape, as if that was some way to say to the country this is the right way to go. And although the president is not responsible for what they did, he does have some responsibility to denounce it since they all were wearing Trump t-shirts and Trump banners as they reenacted --"

      "utterance": "Matt, let me get you to weigh in here. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": Look, Bret, I think the president is facing three interlocking crises. The crisis of the pandemic, the crisis of the economy, and now the crisis of the social unrest in the wake of the George Floyd killing. The public has turned against him on two of those three, the pandemic and the Floyd killing. And so it's very important for him, I think, to recover the lost ground by encouraging the bipartisan efforts of Senator Scott to work out some type of police reform bill."

And the fact -- the idea that you have an entire political party appearing to run off with this notion that police department should be burnt down or shut down or defunded or whatever, that's crazy. And if Donald Trump between now and the election is running against that, he's going to have a very, very strong hand."

The amicus brief was filed today by another judge that Sullivan brought in which he said it is a gross abuse of prosecutorial power and the government has engaged in highly irregular conduct to benefit a political ally, the president of the United States. We're back with our panel. Matthew, your thoughts on the case. It's a scathing amicus brief filed with the court, but the DOJ is going to the appellate court, saying forget this, Judge, we're going elsewhere."

I have had the shock of recognition reading this amicus brief because Judge Gleeson had basically written exactly the same thing for \"The Washington Post\" last month. And Judge Sullivan's selection of him to write this amicus was one of many unusual moves he's made in the course of this, as I say, judicial train wreck. I hope it's resolved, and with the weight of the precedent which lies with the DOJ's ability to terminate prosecution if it so chooses."

I'm still confused by what I'm hearing. The Justice Department got General Flynn to admit to a crime. He pled guilty. He then was sentenced. And now the Justice Department has come back to say we want to vacate this. They should have to defend that, and if they make a good case, they should win. If not, he should face his sentencing and probably be pardoned by the president. But the whole thing is curious to me."

It doesn't matter how much they want to. Their job is to be impartial. For a judge to say I'm not going to grant the government's motion to dismiss an indictment, who's going to prosecute it, Judge? Are you going to take off your black robe and give up your afternoons at the golf course and go become a prosecutor? Everyone has their own lane. Prosecutors don't sentence."

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Yes, but let's remember the reason that he pleaded guilty was because the Department of Justice was threatening his son with prosecution after the FBI had already determined that they didn't have a case against General Flynn. So the idea that they are going to turn around and take his guilty plea, which they forced them into, and use that as perjury, accuse him of perjury because he is now trying to withdraw his guilty plea, is insane. It is perfectly nuts. And John Gleeson wants to talk about corrupt and politically motivated, he may as well have been talking about the original prosecution of Michael Flynn in the first place. This is just crazy. Somewhere Franz Kafka is smacking his palm to his forehead and saying why didn't I think of this? And it would be funny if it weren't so terrifying."
