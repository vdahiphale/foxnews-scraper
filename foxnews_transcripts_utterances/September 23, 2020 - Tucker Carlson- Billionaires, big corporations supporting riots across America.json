      "sentences": "You're watching live pictures on your screen right now of Louisville, Kentucky. Another American city caught up in the chaos of 2020. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In Louisville tonight, the grand jury has issued its decision in the Breonna Taylor case, rioters assembled immediately. They were already there waiting for it. We'll be watching the situation as it unfolds in Louisville all evening long. We will have a live report for you from that city in just a moment. But first tonight, good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The chaos you were watching the promise of potential violence tonight. All began with a tragedy that took place six months ago. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In March, three Louisville police officers served a search warrant at the apartment of a woman called Breonna Taylor. They knocked outside, they announced they were from the police department and then they entered the apartment. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Once they did, a man called Kenneth Walker opened fire on them. Walker was Breonna Taylor's boyfriend. He was also supposedly a drug dealer. That's one of the reasons the police were there. Walker admits that he fired first and that he shot a police officer. In response, the cops fired back. By the time Kenneth Walker surrendered, Breonna Taylor, who was in another room in the apartment had been fatally wounded. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Those are the facts of the case. It's a very sad story. Nobody disputes that. Awful things sometimes happen, despite the best efforts of everyone involved to prevent them from happening. That's the truth. But the truth was not enough for BLM. BLM seeks political power, it's a political organization. In order to get that power they need to keep America angry and divided. Americans divided against each other. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So BLM lied about how Breonna Taylor died. BLM activists claim that Louisville police broke into Taylor's apartment without warning. They claimed cops used a so-called no knock warrant to surprise Taylor while she was sleeping and then they shot her. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } They described her killing as a murder. Yet, another horrifying example of systemic racist violence against African-Americans by the police. That's what they said. It was a lie. But because BLM said it, virtually no one challenged their version of it and many responded to that version. This summer, Louisville City Council unanimously passed something called Breonna's Law. It bans no-knock raids. In Washington, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul introduced the so-called Justice for Breonna Taylor Act that would ban Federal no-knock warrants. All of those responses were based on a story that at its most basic level was not true. This summer a tenant in Breonna Taylor's apartment complex told \"The New York Times\" he heard police officers shout \"police\" and then knocked three times before they entered her apartment. That was all but ignored. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Today, the Attorney General of Kentucky Daniel Cameron confirmed that it's true. There is, he said, uncontested evidence from an independent citizen witness that despite would BLM has claimed for half a year, police were not in fact executing a no-knock warrant on Breonna Taylor's apartment.

      "sentences": "So there you have it. The facts of the case -- and we've seen this before -- are not what we were told they were because real life is always more complicated than political propaganda. There is no evidence of any kind that Breonna Taylor was murdered because she was black. That is a lie. It's a lie designed to divide the country and make the people telling it more powerful. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Instead, it seems clear that Taylor was shot accidentally because her boyfriend opened fire on the police in a dark apartment and he may have done that accidentally. Yet, in the end, the facts of the case didn't matter. BLM's version had marinated unchallenged for six months. The mob had assembled in Louisville abetted by a reckless media and paid by someone. As the grand jury prepared its decision, Louisville girded for what they knew what was coming, so authorities declared a state of emergency. Police blocked roads. Businesses nailed plywood over their windows. Even the local Children's Hospital boarded up its entrance. The doctors and nurses inside knew they were not safe from the mob. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Today, the grand jury finally announced his decision. Here it is: one officer, a man called Brett Hankison has been indicted; indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment. Hankison was not charged with shooting and killing Breonna Taylor. Instead, the grand jury found that by firing 10 rounds, Hankison may have acted recklessly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Keep in mind, Hankison only fired his gun after one of his partners had been shot by Kenneth Walker. So should Hankison not have returned fire? How many rounds is a cop allowed to discharge once someone starts shooting at him? No one answered those questions. And in fact, it's hard to believe we'd be having conversations this absurd, much less discussing Officer Hankison's indictment if Biden voters weren't in the streets, making threats and demanding it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In other words, the mob is now in charge of our justice system. They're clearly having an influence on it in Louisville and other cities. We've given you examples before. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } What kind of country is that?

The most privileged people in our society are funding our society's destruction. Just this afternoon, as the riots raged, the blow dried revolutionaries at \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine in New York \"Cosmo,\" tweeted instructions on how to help the rioters, quote: \"The Louisville Community Bail Fund is using donations to bail out protesters and provide post release support to get them from jail fed into a situation of safety. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Donate now.\" Donate now. That's the command from the Hearst Corporation. That's the company that owns \"Cosmopolitan.\" Hearst is not a small player in publishing, Hearst made more than $11 billion last year. So billionaires are pushing riots. Okay. We've seen a lot of that recently. Why are they doing this? Well, the same reason, Kamala Harris solicited donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which has paid bail for attempted cop killers and convicted rapists.

Because they want to destabilize the country and by doing that, create a diversion. The more people are angry at each other, the more enraged they are at cops making 50 grand a year who effectively have no power. The less focused the country is on the misdeeds of Silicon Valley and Wall Street, so that's why they're paying for it. And the media? Well, they bow to their corporate masters and they play along as they always do. Just this afternoon, the Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said he opposes mob violence.

They gave fair warnings over and over again, and now that is what's happening here. Over to my left, there are hundreds of officers in SWAT gear.

Justice should not be a luxury. #BreonnaTaylor.\" Meanwhile, a woman called Linda Sarsour, kind of left-wing gadfly who most recently spoke at the Democratic Party's Convention in August tweeted this today, quote: \"Rise up. All across this country. Everywhere. Rise up for Breonna Taylor.\" This is all in the open. They're calling for violence openly. How can this happen? And what are the consequences? Matt Walsh has been following it every day of it. He's the host of \"The Matt Walsh Show\" and we're always happy to have him here. Matt, thanks for coming on.

MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\":  Yes, they're not pretending anymore and that's why I think we have to we have to just keep emphasizing although I guess the truth doesn't matter anymore to -- it certainly doesn't matter to the rioters, but we should emphasize as you did that, you know, everything we've heard about the Breonna Taylor case is a lie. It was not a no-knock warrant. They did knock. They did announce themselves. They only fired because the boyfriend shot at the police first and also, they weren't there randomly. The police had -- Breonna Taylor was on the warrant. They had reason to believe that she was involved in her ex- boyfriend, her convicted drug dealer ex-boyfriend's drug trade, and, you know, jailhouse conversations that the ex-boyfriend had recorded seems to confirm that fact, or at least early strongly indicated. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, you know, all of that is false.

You look at all the cases this summer, Ricardo Munoz, Deon Kay, Jacob Blake, George Floyd, all of the narratives there are false, it doesn't matter, because we know that police brutality is just a pretense that's used. I mean, they had the riot shields and the signs there regardless. They were going to use them no matter what the grand jury said. It's all just a pretense for this radical left-wing insurrection, this well-funded, coordinated insurrection. I think that's what this is, and it's a pretense for that.

We learned that Seattle began paying $12,500.00 a month to a pimp -- a pimp called Andre Taylor. Pimp Taylor boasts that he can communicate with quote, \"gang members, pimps and prostitutes\" who won't sit down with anyone else. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, probably the worst mayor ever. I don't know, she and de Blasio are in the running for it. She says she is proud of the deal. She says the pimp's lived experience is invaluable. You know, pimps, the ones who beat hookers with coat hangers? It's valuable. It is valuable experience. In 2016, for example, the pimp vowed to quote \"go to war\" with Seattle after police shot and killed his brother. So are pimps the solution the rest of us have been searching for, but couldn't quite articulate until the geniuses in Seattle came up with it? It's possible.

Screaming they're shooting at cops. Clearly, someone was shooting a cops because as we just told you, one of them was just hit. We don't know his condition. Unfortunately, we don't have those details. But we will have them. They'll be ignored by the other channels. But the macro question is this and it's the one that all of us should meditate on. Why is this happening? It's happening because a grand jury, representative citizens who represent our justice system, the fairest in the world, and one of the oldest in the world. A system that has served us very well for almost 250 years, a group of angry violent dumb people didn't like it. And they were abetted, they were funded by some of those privileged people in our society. What does that tell you? If you don't like a court decision, you get to shoot cops? You get to set businesses on fire? You get to destroy cities? That's a precedent that we have set and that we have confirmed again and again and again since Memorial Day weekend. That's not a precedent we can live with. Things will fall apart unless someone takes control and makes it really clear that just because you don't like a decision that our system produces, you don't have the right to hurt people. Period. A lot is at stake. Our coverage of this continues with Sean Hannity who takes over in about 10 seconds. We'll be back tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. Here is Sean.

      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "You're watching live pictures on your screen right now of Louisville, Kentucky. Another American city caught up in the chaos of 2020. In Louisville tonight, the grand jury has issued its decision in the Breonna Taylor case, rioters assembled immediately. They were already there waiting for it. We'll be watching the situation as it unfolds in Louisville all evening long. We will have a live report for you from that city in just a moment. But first tonight, good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The chaos you were watching the promise of potential violence tonight. All began with a tragedy that took place six months ago. In March, three Louisville police officers served a search warrant at the apartment of a woman called Breonna Taylor. They knocked outside, they announced they were from the police department and then they entered the apartment. Once they did, a man called Kenneth Walker opened fire on them. Walker was Breonna Taylor's boyfriend. He was also supposedly a drug dealer. That's one of the reasons the police were there. Walker admits that he fired first and that he shot a police officer. In response, the cops fired back. By the time Kenneth Walker surrendered, Breonna Taylor, who was in another room in the apartment had been fatally wounded. Those are the facts of the case. It's a very sad story. Nobody disputes that. Awful things sometimes happen, despite the best efforts of everyone involved to prevent them from happening. That's the truth. But the truth was not enough for BLM. BLM seeks political power, it's a political organization. In order to get that power they need to keep America angry and divided. Americans divided against each other. So BLM lied about how Breonna Taylor died. BLM activists claim that Louisville police broke into Taylor's apartment without warning. They claimed cops used a so-called no knock warrant to surprise Taylor while she was sleeping and then they shot her. They described her killing as a murder. Yet, another horrifying example of systemic racist violence against African-Americans by the police. That's what they said. It was a lie. But because BLM said it, virtually no one challenged their version of it and many responded to that version. This summer, Louisville City Council unanimously passed something called Breonna's Law. It bans no-knock raids. In Washington, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul introduced the so-called Justice for Breonna Taylor Act that would ban Federal no-knock warrants. All of those responses were based on a story that at its most basic level was not true. This summer a tenant in Breonna Taylor's apartment complex told \"The New York Times\" he heard police officers shout \"police\" and then knocked three times before they entered her apartment. That was all but ignored. Today, the Attorney General of Kentucky Daniel Cameron confirmed that it's true. There is, he said, uncontested evidence from an independent citizen witness that despite would BLM has claimed for half a year, police were not in fact executing a no-knock warrant on Breonna Taylor's apartment. Watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANIEL CAMERON, KENTUCKY STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Evidence shows that officers both knocked and announced their presence at the apartment. The officers' statements about their announcement are corroborated by an independent witness who was near in a proximity to Apartment 4. In other words, the warrant was not served as a no-knock warrant."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So there you have it. The facts of the case -- and we've seen this before -- are not what we were told they were because real life is always more complicated than political propaganda. There is no evidence of any kind that Breonna Taylor was murdered because she was black. That is a lie. It's a lie designed to divide the country and make the people telling it more powerful. Instead, it seems clear that Taylor was shot accidentally because her boyfriend opened fire on the police in a dark apartment and he may have done that accidentally. Yet, in the end, the facts of the case didn't matter. BLM's version had marinated unchallenged for six months. The mob had assembled in Louisville abetted by a reckless media and paid by someone. As the grand jury prepared its decision, Louisville girded for what they knew what was coming, so authorities declared a state of emergency. Police blocked roads. Businesses nailed plywood over their windows. Even the local Children's Hospital boarded up its entrance. The doctors and nurses inside knew they were not safe from the mob."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Today, the grand jury finally announced his decision. Here it is",
      "utterance": "one officer, a man called Brett Hankison has been indicted; indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment. Hankison was not charged with shooting and killing Breonna Taylor. Instead, the grand jury found that by firing 10 rounds, Hankison may have acted recklessly. Keep in mind, Hankison only fired his gun after one of his partners had been shot by Kenneth Walker. So should Hankison not have returned fire? How many rounds is a cop allowed to discharge once someone starts shooting at him? No one answered those questions. And in fact, it's hard to believe we'd be having conversations this absurd, much less discussing Officer Hankison's indictment if Biden voters weren't in the streets, making threats and demanding it. In other words, the mob is now in charge of our justice system. They're clearly having an influence on it in Louisville and other cities. We've given you examples before. What kind of country is that? But the mob wants more. One indictment and yet another fake hate crime isn't enough. They want blood. Watch."

      "utterance": "So this is how America works now. You don't like a grand jury decision, so you break things and you hurt people and you steal what isn't yours. That's how we function now. But no country can function for long under that standard, things will fall apart. And that, of course is the point of the riots. They have got nothing to do with Breonna Taylor, most of these thugs are nothing about her. Quiz them. The point, by contrast is to break America, to overthrow our system, to replace it with something else with other people in charge. That's what this is about. It's a coordinated effort and it's a well-funded effort. Watch the mob unload a U-Haul, full of sign shields and other riot supplies today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So the obvious question is, who is paying for all of this? Who is organizing it? Is organized and it's expensive. And someone is doing that? We have some leads tonight into who rented the U-Haul truck you just saw, and as we find more, we'll bring it to you of course. But the broad outlines are already clear and have been for a while. The most privileged people in our society are funding our society's destruction. Just this afternoon, as the riots raged, the blow dried revolutionaries at \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine in New York \"Cosmo,\" tweeted instructions on how to help the rioters, quote: \"The Louisville Community Bail Fund is using donations to bail out protesters and provide post release support to get them from jail fed into a situation of safety. Donate now.\" Donate now. That's the command from the Hearst Corporation. That's the company that owns \"Cosmopolitan.\" Hearst is not a small player in publishing, Hearst made more than $11 billion last year. So billionaires are pushing riots. Okay. We've seen a lot of that recently. Why are they doing this? Well, the same reason, Kamala Harris solicited donations to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which has paid bail for attempted cop killers and convicted rapists. The same reason several Joe Biden for President staffers did the same thing. The same reason George Soros funds radical DAs who encourage more crime and allow people to get murdered. Why are they doing this? Because they want to destabilize the country and by doing that, create a diversion. The more people are angry at each other, the more enraged they are at cops making 50 grand a year who effectively have no power. The less focused the country is on the misdeeds of Silicon Valley and Wall Street, so that's why they're paying for it. And the media? Well, they bow to their corporate masters and they play along as they always do. Just this afternoon, the Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said he opposes mob violence. You would expect of course, an Attorney General to oppose mob violence. The whole point of law enforcement is to oppose mob violence. So to the people who care about America, it wasn't a controversial statement. Here's what he said."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "\"Mob justice is not justice.\" That used to be the most obvious possible observation, particularly coming from someone in the south, which for a long time had a problem with mob justice. You probably thought we all agreed that was bad. You probably heard the Attorney General of Kentucky say that and think, \"That sounds sensible to me.\" But over at CNN, they were enraged. CNN knows that mob justice isn't just worth having. In fact, it's the substance of the Democratic platform in 2020. So they attacked him for saying it. Watch this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "I question the judgment of the Kentucky Attorney General saying quote, \"Mob justice is not justice.\" He said it becomes revenge. That were the mob, and the President having said that, if Joe Biden wins, the mob wins. That's what he says. We know this is very politically loaded language."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's all such a lie. It's a lie. It's a demonstrable lie. The statistics don't back it up. The experience of your life no matter what color you are doesn't back it up, and the fact that hundreds of thousands of people every year move here who are black -- to the United States is living refutation of what they just said. Nothing about that is true, and they know it's not true. The guy who said it had a PhD. You can't go anywhere if you're black. Yes. He says from a TV studio. But that's the unified message of the American media. Again, they know it's not true. They know that Taylor didn't die in a no-knock police raid. Her death is sad. It's a tragedy. But it wasn't an act of racism. There's no evidence for that. And if there was we would admit it, but they don't care. All they care about is getting enough people to believe that this dystopia that they describe is real. Why? It's an election year. If enough property burns, if enough public streets are impassable. In the end, people may decide I'll vote for Joe Biden to make it stop. But what then? If Joe Biden wins on November 3rd, billion dollar corporations like Hearst will be fine. The billionaires paying for all this, stocking the U-Haul with riot supplies will be fine. But where will you be? You'll be on your own. In a moment, we're going to talk to Bob Woodson about all of this, he always has a wise overview. But first we're going to go to our Matt Finn.

This park for quite some time now has been Ground Zero for demonstrations and protests. Several fires were lit here tonight. In fact, there's some small fires that are still burning. A short while ago we watched protesters light fire to the Justice Center and throw bottles at police. Now, police they have declared an unlawful assembly over a very loud, loud speaker and they warned people that if they did not clear this area and their unlawful assembly that there would be chemical agents or arrests being made. They gave fair warnings over and over again, and now that is what's happening here. Over to my left, there are hundreds of officers in SWAT gear. They're basically just trying to reclaim this area that a lot of people were gathering in that unlawful assembly. For right now, much more calm than it was just a short while ago when people were hurling objects at police and lighting small fires outside of the Criminal Justice Center -- Tucker."

It means that if police are downtown, policing riot, it means they're not in the neighborhoods protecting them."

      "utterance": "If some of these extremists demand that police be withdrawn and defunded, it means that this a death sentence for young people in these neighborhoods because there's a direct correlation between reduction in police presence and increase in violence and murder. More blacks, Tucker, are killed in one year by other blacks than was killed in 50 years of the lynchings done by the Klan. We have a 9/11 every six months. In Chicago, last week, a community group was appealing to buy bulletproof backpacks and bulletproof baseball caps and they had little children trying to warn, showing people how to use them and they are saying because the city has neglected us, and so bulletproof backpacks and they're not buying these to protect themselves from the police as Kamala Harris and the celebrities are saying. There continue to propagate this lie that the biggest threat to black young men is coming from the police, and that is just a lie intended to keep black America inflamed and agitated, so they can be controlled. We are supporting a group of black mothers call Mama's Rescue and they are a group of mothers who lost children to urban violence, and they're saying nobody is listening to us. I spent the whole day with them Saturday, and they want to say -- and they are saying they are solidly behind the police. But no one really listens to the people in those communities suffering the problem because they have -- they deserve to be heard from -- but they are the ones who are losing. We lost 20 children in Chicago in the last year, 700 blacks that were killed. But bulletproof backpacks? They have resorted to that. And the answers can be found where the problem is, and that is supporting grassroots leaders like the Alliance of Concerned Men in Washington, D.C. that had created a zone of peace for the last three months. But no one comes there to talk about investing in groups in those communities that in fact, have begun to redirect the children away from self-destructive behavior. But instead we're saying it is related to institutional racism."

And what are the consequences? Matt Walsh has been following it every day of it. He's the host of \"The Matt Walsh Show\" and we're always happy to have him here. Matt, thanks for coming on. So if people are not even pretending anymore, they're just rise up. What does that mean? What could it mean, other than what it obviously means? MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\":  Yes, they're not pretending anymore and that's why I think we have to we have to just keep emphasizing although I guess the truth doesn't matter anymore to -- it certainly doesn't matter to the rioters, but we should emphasize as you did that, you know, everything we've heard about the Breonna Taylor case is a lie. It was not a no-knock warrant. They did knock. They did announce themselves. They only fired because the boyfriend shot at the police first and also, they weren't there randomly. The police had -- Breonna Taylor was on the warrant. They had reason to believe that she was involved in her ex- boyfriend, her convicted drug dealer ex-boyfriend's drug trade, and, you know, jailhouse conversations that the ex-boyfriend had recorded seems to confirm that fact, or at least early strongly indicated. So, you know, all of that is false. But we know that the BLM narrative is false every single time. You look at all the cases this summer, Ricardo Munoz, Deon Kay, Jacob Blake, George Floyd, all of the narratives there are false, it doesn't matter, because we know that police brutality is just a pretense that's used. I mean, they had the riot shields and the signs there regardless. They were going to use them no matter what the grand jury said. It's all just a pretense for this radical left-wing insurrection, this well-funded, coordinated insurrection. I think that's what this is, and it's a pretense for that. And I think the Feds need to be hunting down the people coordinating this and charging them with sedition because that's what we're looking at."

And so if you speak up against it, then you're racist, or if someone -- even if it's a famous celebrity, LeBron James, you know, is a multimillionaire, superstar celebrity always going around talking about how he was terrified to be a black man in America, somehow I doubt it. But you -- people are afraid to say anything about it, because they think that they will be sort of disregarding the anger and angst of these rioters. But it's all a farce. I mean, Black Lives Matter, their website, just in the last few days, they scrubbed some parts of their website. Their \"What We Believe\" section used to say things like, we want to dismantle the nuclear family. Well, at some point in the last few days, they took all that stuff off. And I think the reason is that they realized that more Americans are waking up to the fact that this is all just a pretense for a far left radical agenda that has nothing to do with racial justice, and so now, they're trying to cover their tracks a little bit."

If you want a business in Louisville and the authorities said, well, there's going to be a riot because the rioters don't like a grand jury decision. Why wouldn't you just put a beach chair right in front of your business and say, I'm defending my business, my property, my life, I have a right to defend it, and I'm going to. I'm not going to board it up. This is America. We don't take orders from rioters. Like what is this? Why is no one doing that?"

I think we may have lost transmission from Danny Coulson and we're sorry about that. Okay. We're going to go back to him when we get that line back up and running. But the question is, at this point, once Democrats defund the police, who will the rest of us turn to and who will Democrats turn to? But one city has an answer to that question. They're going to turn to pimps. We'll explain, next."

We will have an update from the ground coming up in just a minute. So the question is when all the police are gone -- and that is the goal, that's stated goal of BLM -- where will the rest of us be? And who will replace them exactly? Well, the City of Seattle has thought about this maybe more than anyone else, and this week, delivered an answer. We learned that Seattle began paying $12,500.00 a month to a pimp -- a pimp called Andre Taylor. Pimp Taylor boasts that he can communicate with quote, \"gang members, pimps and prostitutes\" who won't sit down with anyone else. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, probably the worst mayor ever. I don't know, she and de Blasio are in the running for it. She says she is proud of the deal. She says the pimp's lived experience is invaluable. You know, pimps, the ones who beat hookers with coat hangers? It's valuable. It is valuable experience. In 2016, for example, the pimp vowed to quote \"go to war\" with Seattle after police shot and killed his brother. So are pimps the solution the rest of us have been searching for, but couldn't quite articulate until the geniuses in Seattle came up with it? It's possible. Jason Rantz hosts a radio show in Seattle, and he joins us tonight. Jason, thanks for coming on. So pimps are the answer to Seattle's future."

      "speaker": "JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, clearly, that's not your go-to solution when dealing with civil unrest and crime, oh, no, because you're not a crazy person. And yet in Seattle, we decided to give this kind of power to someone -- and this is directly from the actual contract. He is supposed to offer expertise and support services in de-escalation and alternatives to policing. This is someone who at the time of CHOP was out there trying to communicate and come up with deals for people to give up on CHOP so they can get up to one or $2 million dollars going into sort of nebulously defined community service groups that can help address some of the problems. He said he was going to be the go-between. That failed, but it sounds like he has actually been rewarded with this $150,000.00 contract. So where you screw up in Seattle, you get a little bit of a leg up while all these rap lyrics talk about how hard it is to be a pimp. It turns out, all you have to do is come to Seattle."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RANTZ",
      "utterance": "So it's not that big of a change. Now, he's an ex-pimp. So I guess you have to go to ex-pimps for this kind of issues, even though we have a prolific offender problem. But there was a controversy just a few months ago, in which the SPD had come out and said, we're actually going to start making arrests of prostitutes, and then their pimps, and the Council went insane because you're not supposed to go after sex workers. It's like a protected class. So in Seattle, like so many other progressive cities, they take a very evolved look in their view at this trade. It is really, really bizarre."

If you were seriously interested in any of the issues that have been roiling America for the last six months, you would not be appointing a pimp as a street czar for 150 grand. That's just the usual attitude striking nonsense, which is why certain jurisdictions in this country are in permanent decline. One reason China is now the number one power in the world is because it doesn't actually have to pay ex-pimps to become diversity-kratz on handsome six figure salaries that we all know are non-jobs, and aren't going to do anything for the alleged issues roiling the country."

And I think there's something to be said, if I was a taxpayer in Seattle, if you look at other cities in America, where your businesses are ruined, your businesses are trashed. You can't even board up your shattered ruined business in Minneapolis, because you have to pay your taxes a year up front, before they'll let you put some plywood in the window. So I think there would be something to be said for a conscientious objector movement, at least against municipal and state taxes until they get serious about this thing. But as I said, we all know these jobs are jokes. Sometimes they are harmless jokes. Michelle Obama was getting 350 grand to be a diversity-krat because her husband was considered useful to the people paying her and then when she went to Washington to become First Lady, her job was so critical to Chicago, of a 350 grand job, nobody even replaced her. These jobs are a joke. They're part of the reason we are a civilization in decline, and as long as you're talking about streets czars and 150 grand, you're not serious and you've got no contribution to make to the conversation."

But then that can lead all kinds of problems. So we need the police. We don't have to hire much more pimps. That's not going to solve the problem. Police are here for a reason. The first duty of a society is protect its citizens. That's when we get together at the dawn of time to do that and to demonize police. First of all, it's a lie. They're not racist.

They started throwing objects at police and police declared it an unlawful assembly and they warned everyone to clear this area. Right now, it is much calmer than it was just a short while ago. We have officers in their SWAT gear. We have BearCats, and they are kind of going back and forth between an ongoing standoff with some protesters who are coming up and screaming and yelling at them. But this is a much calmer and less dangerous situation than a short while ago. Earlier in the day today, there was a large crowd here, people chanting profanities against police.

Screaming they're shooting at cops. Clearly, someone was shooting a cops because as we just told you, one of them was just hit. We don't know his condition. Unfortunately, we don't have those details. But we will have them. They'll be ignored by the other channels. But the macro question is this and it's the one that all of us should meditate on. Why is this happening? It's happening because a grand jury, representative citizens who represent our justice system, the fairest in the world, and one of the oldest in the world. A system that has served us very well for almost 250 years, a group of angry violent dumb people didn't like it. And they were abetted, they were funded by some of those privileged people in our society. What does that tell you? If you don't like a court decision, you get to shoot cops? You get to set businesses on fire? You get to destroy cities? That's a precedent that we have set and that we have confirmed again and again and again since Memorial Day weekend. That's not a precedent we can live with. Things will fall apart unless someone takes control and makes it really clear that just because you don't like a decision that our system produces, you don't have the right to hurt people. Period. A lot is at stake. Our coverage of this continues with Sean Hannity who takes over in about 10 seconds. We'll be back tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. Here is Sean.
