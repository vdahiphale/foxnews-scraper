I don't think that it rises necessarily to the level of recusal. But I did hear, in fairness -- and I agree with it -- that he's speaking to the ethics experts at DOJ, and he's going to follow their advice. So everybody should not necessarily prejudge it and calm down. It's the politicization of the situation. I also think the president may -- I don't have a crystal ball -- may very likely make an appointment six, eight weeks from now, just guessing, to obviate this idea that this is a seven-month thing. But, frankly -- not to overstate this -- I have been very surprised the last couple days honestly, to watch people saying, this is illegal.

The Freedom Caucus, of course, has had -- had its share of run-ins in the first two years under President Trump. But it feels like the election outcome, the voice of the people have sort of spoken.

You look at Jeff Denham, who's in a close race, maybe can find a way to close the gap there in his district, he broke from party. And I think that's the thing. If we're going to work our way back to the majority, we have to be the conference that you can come here, stay on the principles that you campaigned for, and in some cases, you got to represent your district and not just come here to follow orders."

That's been a bipartisan effort to get us $21 trillion in debt. And, frankly, as I have talked to people, whether the Republicans or Democrats, I don't know anyone who ran for Congress because they felt like things were going so great in Congress. And so you look, whether it's Republican or Democrat, we're looking at people that have been in leadership for a long time, the status quo isn't working for a lot of America. And the reality is, if you do what you did, you're going to get what you got. And I think we have to really listen. And I have been encouraged when I talked to Kevin McCarthy.

And the Freedom Caucus held on board to get tax reform. We had continuing resolution after continuing resolution. And what we were promised is, we were at least going to make the Senate vote. And when it came time, the Senate made their first public counteroffer, and we folded. It was a complete surrender on spending. We did the march on the bus. We didn't even get 24 hours to read the bill. And I want to know that whoever is leading our party is actually going to be able to do what we said we were going to do. We're going to fight for the principles that we said.  And where possible, by all means, let's work together. But let's not surrender."

And just the amount of energy, and I think that we need that. We need that on our party. We need to make sure that Jim is a key part of our team. My hope is, he's the minority leader.

Palm Beach County has said it's outdated equipment would unlikely meet the Thursday 3:00 p.m. deadline. And the superintendent there, Bucher, she thinks this ruling may not actually be implemented, because it will undoubtedly now be challenged in federal courts. Meanwhile, here in Broward County, a major milestone this afternoon. An official inside says they are now ahead of schedule. They have completed the machine recount of all early votes cast in Broward County. That's about 300,000 votes. Now they still need to sort all the day-of votes and then recount and tabulate all of the day-of votes and the mail-in ballots. Broward does feel confident they can make that Thursday 3:00 p.m. deadline. As for the superintendent of Broward County's Elections Department, Brenda Snipes, very much criticized all last week. In fact, for months and months, she has been criticized. She has been called to resign or to actually be suspended by the governor. Former Governor Jeb Bush tweeted just that yesterday.

State court judges are more likely to want to enforce state law as it is written, and federal judges are more likely to follow a looser constitutional standard of it. If there's a way to get a person to vote, and if they made all the effort to vote, then their vote should be counted. So the person that Jonathan Serrie ran in that clip is quite correct..."

If I signed it Andrew Napolitano, instead of Andrew P., and the official record shows Andrew P., are they going to deny me the right to vote? That's what's going on hundreds and hundreds of times. A rigid interpretation of state law would say, you signed your signature different than the way you did when you registered to vote, we're not taking your vote. A more reasonable approach would be, well, you're obviously the same person. With the passage of time, you sign your name a little differently, so we're going to count your vote.

And we're just seeing very extreme fire conditions. And, unfortunately, when you put all three elements together - - and that's that's high temperatures, low humidity and the winds -- you cannot control these fires.

All of those are good things. But -- and it's a big but -- denuclearization involves a complete inventory of the weapon sites and the ballistic missile sites. We don't have it. It also involves a program to destroy, disarm and dismantle all of that on the inventory. We don't have it. And there has not in a single nuclear weapon that has been disarmed or destroyed, and the same thing for ballistic missile.

We are now in what you call a bear market. That is to say, if we put the graphic up, a 20 percent decline since the most recent peak, which was around $76 a barrel. We're now at $55. Why is all this happening? Well, we're in an oversupply situation. We thought, you know, with sanctions against Iran, we thought with perhaps cuts in OPEC production, that we would actually have problems and oil prices would be going up. Well, just the opposite has happened. The president has been jawboning, what we used to call jawboning the market down. Today, in this day and age, it's actually tweeting the market down, saying that he doesn't want higher oil prices and consequently higher gas prices. Take a look at the gas prices. They have been going just the other way. A month ago, we were at $2.90 for an average gallon of regular. A week ago, we were at $2.75. Today, we were at $2.68.

That is so laughable, Charles. People will live in Manhattan that make a lot of money and they will commute to their jobs in Queens. It doesn't mean all the people that work and live in Queens are going to lose their homes. That's crazy town."

But she brings up -- brings up some valid points. This does put a drain on the local municipalities. Let me explain why. These tax cuts are enshrined for sometimes 15 to 20 years. And they present a huge impact to the local infrastructure. That's specifically what she's talking about. You have seen large-scale developments of subdivisions and big boxes, where they just absolutely destroy the roads, and they often don't pay for those with environmental impact fees and develop -- development impact fees. And yet they're getting tax breaks. So she's right to criticize it. But when you look at it from a cost-benefit analysis, in the long term, it does pay off, but I get where she's coming from, Charles."

So people feel like they do get pushed out eventually. And we know in The Journal today saying that there was almost a 300 percent explosion of inquiries for condos in that Queens area. So, ultimately, if people start to -- who make 150 grand start to buy homes there, could that do something with respect to income inequality? Could it push out people who have lived there? And, by the way, $1.5 billion, that's a lot of money, and it could -- it could haunt someone politically at some point."

Mayor de Blasio is for this. Governor Cuomo is for this. And they're all Democrats and they're for it. And I'm telling you, it's good for New York. I hear what you're saying about -- about people -- sometimes, there will be people that come in and - - but the property values might rise a little bit. But it's never going to be so much that the negatives overweigh the positives. It is good for New York. It is huge for New York City. I'm telling you, I live here.

I think they have an uphill battle. I think it's a tough case, because I think this appointment is legal. Now I will explain why. The argument is, to answer your question, they say, you can't appoint an attorney general without Senate confirmation.  You have heard that. There's only one problem with that. He's not being appointed attorney general. I'm not being cute. He's being pointed acting attorney general, which is an interim post with a 210-day time limit on it."

And it says the president can appoint either the deputy A.G., who's next in line, someone else in the department who's been confirmed, like the solicitor general, or -- and this is what the president relied on, on the advice of sophisticated lawyers -- or somebody who's in the department for 90 days who's at a pay grade of G-15 or higher. And Mr. Whitaker meets that. So everybody's all up in arms saying it's unconstitutional. What they're really arguing is the statute, the VRA, to the extent it allows the president to make that appointment of somebody, is unconstitutional."

I mean, yes, they just tap-dance out of the straight legal realities of it, which is, here's the statute, it allows for this. And then they're like, well, wait a minute, he should recuse himself. And what they say is, he had given opinions in the past -- obviously, I have seen everybody covering it over and over -- where he disparages the Mueller probe. I don't think that it rises necessarily to the level of recusal. But I did hear, in fairness -- and I agree with it -- that he's speaking to the ethics experts at DOJ, and he's going to follow their advice. So everybody should not necessarily prejudge it and calm down. It's the politicization of the situation. I also think the president may -- I don't have a crystal ball -- may very likely make an appointment six, eight weeks from now, just guessing, to obviate this idea that this is a seven-month thing. But, frankly -- not to overstate this -- I have been very surprised the last couple days honestly, to watch people saying, this is illegal. There was a very strong op-ed in The New York Times by a law professor out of Texas, where he argued calmly why it is actually legal, not illegal."
