I think he was on a committee. But I never met him.  But they went after these people viciously, all because they wanted to hurt the president of the United States. They figure they'll either hurt him, or they'll take him out. That would be the ideal. Comey is a corrupt person, but let me tell you, Brennan bad. They're all bad, everyone. Clapper is a not-smart guy, in charge of intelligence.  But here's the thing. It was impossible for it to happen without the man that sits right in that chair in the Oval Office. He knew everything.  BARTIROMO: Do you believe President Obama directed the U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on you?  TRUMP: Yes, he probably directed them. But if he didn't direct them, he knew everything.  And you will see that.  BARTIROMO: Once they couldn't find collusion evidence...  TRUMP: By the way -- excuse me. You're going to see that when the papers come out.  Remember the Lisa Page text to her lover saying, POTUS wants to see everything? POTUS. They're not talking about me. I wasn't president. They're talking about POTUS wants to see everything.  BARTIROMO: Well, there was a meeting on January 5 in the Oval Office. President Obama was there. Vice President Biden was there, Clapper, Brennan. And that's when the Logan Act came up.  So, should we believe that they were looking for collusion evidence? They couldn't find the collusion evidence. There was none. So, they said, let's just use the Logan Act to take you down?  TRUMP: First of all, they snuck around White House counsel. They went to see a very unsuspecting General Flynn. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } You know, he's a general. He's not a lawyer. They said, you don't need a lawyer. And they started asking him questions. And they probably brought up the Logan Act. And they probably scared the hell out of him.  But let me tell you a little secret. They go knock, knocking. Ask K.T. McFarland the way they knocked on the door, and many other people with Mueller. That whole thing turned out to be a total fraud. The whole Mueller investigation is a fraud. It was all part of the same deal.  But they -- what they did to General Flynn and others -- you know, we know about General Flynn. You'll find out about others too. What they did to these people is an international disgrace. And all over the world, they talk about it, because this is not America.  And, hopefully, the people involved are going to pay a big price, because it should never be allowed to happen again.  BARTIROMO: Trey Gowdy on my show this weekend said that leaking classified information is a 10-year felony.  TRUMP: Yes.  BARTIROMO: We know that some of those people did that.  TRUMP: Well, Comey did, and other people did too.  BARTIROMO: How involved was John Brennan?  TRUMP: Totally involved. He was totally involved. John Brennan was one of the architects, in my opinion.  You look at Brennan, you look at Clapper, you look at them all. But, ultimately, the president knew everything. The president knew everything. President Obama and Vice President Biden, they knew everything.  BARTIROMO: So, what can you do about it?  TRUMP: And, again, if...  BARTIROMO: What can you do about it, that...  TRUMP: Let me just tell you, if I were in that position, it'd be a whole different thing. If this happened to Obama, instead of to a Republican president, that's popular, 96 percent in the Republican Party, but it's a whole different thing.  If this happened to Obama, instead of to me, you know what? Everybody would be in jail for years already, for years. It's a disgraceful thing.  But it's -- it's -- we caught them in the act, Maria. It's a beautiful thing. And, every day, we're seeing more and more information come out. We caught them. And their guys are gone. They were guarding the fort. Comey and all these guys, they were guarding the fort.  And once they left, it got easier and easier. And now it's like an avalanche of really bad -- call it treason, call it whatever you want, but they tried to take down a duly elected president of the United States.  BARTIROMO: They didn't care that 53 million voted for you and wanted you in the office.  TRUMP: More than 63 million. Just so you understand that they got caught in the act. They never thought that was going to happen.  And they got sloppy, where Lisa Page would text and send messages through service. You know one of the other things that is missing? The DNC server. Where is it? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Why is it that the FBI didn't take it? They arrested all of these people, but they didn't arrest -- they went in to see the people at DNC, right? They go in to see, you know, her wonderful campaign manager. You know all about that, right?  They went into see those people, whose brother, by the way, was supposed to be arrested. And the brother never got arrested, right?  BARTIROMO: Well, the same people who were working on...  TRUMP: But why didn't -- why...  BARTIROMO: ... the investigation into the Trump campaign, they were also working on the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails.  TRUMP: Yes, oh, yes, except slightly different level of intensity, OK? How about where they walk...  BARTIROMO: But they wanted that over by the middle of the year. They called it the mid-year review.  TRUMP: How about they walk into see Hillary Clinton's people, five people, I think, and they said, you all have immunity, you all have -- no problem, you all have immunity?  And, with our people, they wanted to try to put them in jail.

This was before.  BARTIROMO: He had Hong Kong protesters on the street, two million.  TRUMP: And they weren't well -- and even beyond that -- and we were really doing well. And that is a theory.  But here's what I know for sure. They didn't allow -- this whole thing, they didn't allow people to go into China, but they did allow them to go out to the world, including the United States.  That's why Europe is a mess.

This is the problem that we're seeing right now, is that people are now waking up to the real fact that there was an attempt to take out a candidate and then a president before he could get going. And the American people ought to be appalled. They ought to be demanding that why every news outlet is not covering this, the way you have for the last few years and the way many of us have been screaming at the top of our lungs that there was a -- basically a coup attempt at the highest levels. And now we have it placed right into the Oval Office.",

      "utterance": "Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Joining me straight ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" just one week after bombshell revelations in the General Michael Flynn case, a new list emerges of more than a dozen top Obama officials allegedly involved in unmasking the three-star general during the 2017 presidential transition. James Comey, John Brennan, and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden all named. I had an exclusive sit-down with President Trump on Wednesday, just moments after that news broke. His reaction straight ahead, as well as why he says he is no longer interested in negotiating with communist China. Plus, House Democrats passing the largest bill in the history of Congress just before midnight Friday night, without a single committee hearing. Senator John Kennedy and Congressman Doug Collins are here telling us why the $3 trillion stimulus will be dead on arrival in the Senate and how they intend to hold China accountable for getting us here. Also here this morning, Mayor Bill de Blasio on what it takes to reopen New York City and his response to the president's comments on stimulus. Plus, NASCAR is back today live. FOX NASCAR analyst and four-time NASCAR Cup champion Jeff Gordon on what it means for the economy and the country. All that and a lot more right here, right now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And first this morning, breaking news out of the intelligence community this morning. Acting DNI Richard Grenell announcing on Friday that his office will strip the FBI of its duties briefing the 2020 presidential candidates. That follows accusations of political bias in the 2016 election. Former FBI Director James Comey infamously briefed president-elect Donald Trump on January 6, 2017, just one day after he met with President Obama and other top officials in the Oval Office. I sat down with President Trump himself to discuss what happened in the weeks leading up to his inauguration."

You're going to see that when the papers come out.  Remember the Lisa Page text to her lover saying, POTUS wants to see everything? POTUS. They're not talking about me. I wasn't president. They're talking about POTUS wants to see everything.  BARTIROMO: Well, there was a meeting on January 5 in the Oval Office. President Obama was there. Vice President Biden was there, Clapper, Brennan. And that's when the Logan Act came up.  So, should we believe that they were looking for collusion evidence? They couldn't find the collusion evidence. There was none. So, they said, let's just use the Logan Act to take you down?  TRUMP: First of all, they snuck around White House counsel. They went to see a very unsuspecting General Flynn."

That whole thing turned out to be a total fraud. The whole Mueller investigation is a fraud. It was all part of the same deal.  But they -- what they did to General Flynn and others -- you know, we know about General Flynn. You'll find out about others too. What they did to these people is an international disgrace.

He was totally involved. John Brennan was one of the architects, in my opinion.  You look at Brennan, you look at Clapper, you look at them all. But, ultimately, the president knew everything. The president knew everything. President Obama and Vice President Biden, they knew everything.  BARTIROMO: So, what can you do about it?  TRUMP: And, again, if...  BARTIROMO: What can you do about it, that...  TRUMP: Let me just tell you, if I were in that position, it'd be a whole different thing. If this happened to Obama, instead of to a Republican president, that's popular, 96 percent in the Republican Party, but it's a whole different thing.  If this happened to Obama, instead of to me, you know what? Everybody would be in jail for years already, for years. It's a disgraceful thing.  But it's -- it's -- we caught them in the act, Maria. It's a beautiful thing. And, every day, we're seeing more and more information come out. We caught them. And their guys are gone. They were guarding the fort. Comey and all these guys, they were guarding the fort.  And once they left, it got easier and easier. And now it's like an avalanche of really bad -- call it treason, call it whatever you want, but they tried to take down a duly elected president of the United States.  BARTIROMO: They didn't care that 53 million voted for you and wanted you in the office.  TRUMP: More than 63 million. Just so you understand that they got caught in the act. They never thought that was going to happen.  And they got sloppy, where Lisa Page would text and send messages through service. You know one of the other things that is missing? The DNC server. Where is it? Why is it that the FBI didn't take it? They arrested all of these people, but they didn't arrest -- they went in to see the people at DNC, right? They go in to see, you know, her wonderful campaign manager. You know all about that, right?  They went into see those people, whose brother, by the way, was supposed to be arrested. And the brother never got arrested, right?  BARTIROMO: Well, the same people who were working on...  TRUMP: But why didn't -- why...  BARTIROMO: ... the investigation into the Trump campaign, they were also working on the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails.  TRUMP: Yes, oh, yes, except slightly different level of intensity, OK? How about where they walk...  BARTIROMO: But they wanted that over by the middle of the year. They called it the mid-year review.  TRUMP: How about they walk into see Hillary Clinton's people, five people, I think, and they said, you all have immunity, you all have -- no problem, you all have immunity?  And, with our people, they wanted to try to put them in jail.

Breaking news this morning on a story that we have been following. A professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland has been arrested over his alleged financial ties to China, this just days after the FBI sounded the alarm on China's attempt to steal coronavirus research. A professor at the University of Arkansas was arrested on similar charges last week. And then, in January, Harvard's chemistry chief was charged with failing to disclose that he too was being paid by the Chinese Communist Party. Two weeks ago, Senator Tom Cotton told us that the CCP was trying in many ways to steal medical data from the United States to try and come up with a vaccine for COVID-19 before the United States. My sit-down with President Trump included this. We discussed I.P. theft and the pandemic's impact on his relationship with China and President Xi Jinping."

But we have a lot of information, and it's not good. But you know the worst of all, whether it came from the lab or came from the bats, OK? It all came from China. And they should have stopped it.  They could have stopped it at that source. I call it the source right there. Should have been stopped.  BARTIROMO: They made a decision to allow it to escape its borders?  TRUMP: I don't know if they made the decision, but it got out of control. I think, more likely, it got out of control, but, you know...  BARTIROMO: Senator Cotton said that they didn't want the Chinese economy to contract 20 percent and the rest of the world to contract 2 percent.  TRUMP: So, we were beating them very badly before this. We were beating them, between the tariffs and other things we were doing, and we were going up. And they were having a very bad year. They were having the worst year they've had in 56 years. This was before.  BARTIROMO: He had Hong Kong protesters on the street, two million.  TRUMP: And they weren't well -- and even beyond that -- and we were really doing well. And that is a theory.  But here's what I know for sure. They didn't allow -- this whole thing, they didn't allow people to go into China, but they did allow them to go out to the world, including the United States.  That's why Europe is a mess. That's why -- look at -- look at these countries. Russia's having a hard time. Everybody's having a hard time.  BARTIROMO: So, will it get worse for those countries, do you think?  TRUMP: For some of them. Some have just started the process. We're getting toward the end of the process.  BARTIROMO: You know, so they downplayed the disease. They downplayed the virus.

Look, at what point does it -- and I said this for years. I said it with other countries also.

We're looking at that very strongly.  BARTIROMO: Because Chinese companies, like an Alibaba, any Chinese company, they're listed on the New York Stock Exchange. They don't have to report their earnings, the way an American company does?  TRUMP: It's pretty amazing. But here's the problem with that. You know, look, I hate to say it, but let's say we do that, right? So, what are they going to do? They're going to move their listing to London or someplace else. You see?  Let's say you want to get tough, and you're going to do -- you know, everyone is -- everyone wants to be a tough guy. Look. I'm the toughest guy. But what happens is, so we say, you're going to do this, and you're going to follow the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. What do they do?

If you list your stock on an American exchange, you have to have audits periodically, and the SEC gets to review those audits. China has many of its companies, some state-owned, listed on our exchanges, but they refuse to let the SEC look at their audits. Senator Chris Van Hollen and I have a bill to kick them off.

My next guest says that, with that historically huge stimulus bill, Democrats are exploiting this crisis for political advantage. He's introduced his own legislation to hold China accountable. That is Congressman Doug Collins live next. Stay with us. The Trump administration is blocking shipments of semiconductors to Chinese tech giant Huawei, this as the Chinese Communist Party threatens to sanction several U.S. lawmakers, including Senator Tom Cotton, who has appeared on this program to call out China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, among other bad behavior. Georgia Congressman Doug Collins just introduced his own legislation on China. He joins me now. Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us. Let's get right to it. Your bill basically sanctions and freezes assets of the Chinese leadership. Tell us about it."

      "speaker": "REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA)",
      "utterance": "Exactly. It's time China decides, if they want to be a world economic power, they also have to be a responsible world economic power. They can't treat the world like they treat their citizens, which is to keep them under oppression and make them believe every bit of communist doctrine that they what to believe. And what we're going to do is say, if you actually want to be a part of the world, you need to be out there and give us full accounting, an international accounting, of what you did and what you did not do. It has become very apparent that they were much more willing to control it internally, but yet spread it across the world. China has a problem. And the problem is, they can't be honest with themselves, and they can't be honest with the international community. So, we're going to put it -- in fact, to give the president a way to sanction. We're going to let -- not tie his hands, but give him every tool in the toolbox to get them to compete in a way that is fair in the international market. And if they don't, then, fine, they will suffer the consequences for it."

And I'm tired of watching intellectual property. I'm tired of them trying to steal pharmaceutical secrets. I'm tired of them letting their own country be locked down, while they send people out of the country. And then they lie to it about the -- to the world. The Communist Party must realize that they may be able to try and keep their own people down, but that regime is bound and destined to fail. We need to make sure that, if you're going to have an economic partner in the world, they have to be able to compete, like everybody else does, and tell the truth. It seems like they can't do that even to their own people. So why would we expect it from the rest of the world?"

And now it just feels like that what we have been talking about and the corrupt cabal with Strzok and McCabe and Comey and all of them, and now Yates and the rest. But it now found something different. We now find it in the Oval Office, not the Oval Office of President Trump, but the Oval Office of President Obama, who was asking about Flynn, who had had his own chief of staff unmask him the day that there was a meeting. And, oh, by the way, Joe Biden, were you asleep in this meeting as well, when you actually were there, and you told just this past week that you knew nothing about unmasking, and you actually made a request for unmasking? This is the problem that we're seeing right now, is that people are now waking up to the real fact that there was an attempt to take out a candidate and then a president before he could get going. And the American people ought to be appalled. They ought to be demanding that why every news outlet is not covering this, the way you have for the last few years and the way many of us have been screaming at the top of our lungs that there was a -- basically a coup attempt at the highest levels. And now we have it placed right into the Oval Office."

How did -- that information had to get out from one of these that had unmasked or someone that they gave it to. It's amazing to look at how the mainstream media treats this president. They treat him as if he was different. They will believe anything, if he was accused of collusion or accused of doing anything else with the Russians. But yet, when it comes to the ones that they think are the greatest in the world, the superheroes that they thought of, were really nothing but a corrupt bunch of thugs going around, it looks like now, because they tried to use it -- they believe everything they say. But this goes back way past this, from the Clinton e-mail scandal into the re -- discussion of Russia. And so what I want to see happen here is, let's hold people accountable. Somehow, this information got out. We now know who unmasked. Let's start having the investigation."

How are you going to decide who gets what?  TRUMP: So, you've had a lot of states and cities that have been very badly run for a long time. A lot of them are trying to use the COVID problem -- you know that -- for making up what -- what's happened over 25 years of bad management, like your governor of Illinois. He wants money.

You have seen what has happened in the city in recent years right before this pandemic, the highest level of employment in our history, booming economy, lowest crime since the 1950s, more and more kids graduating on time in our public schools than ever in our history. You name it, this city was moving forward. And, as an American, Maria, I want to say, as an American, we're all in this together. So, when New York City does well, when New York state does well, it helps the whole country. When California does well, one of the other great engines of the national economy, it helps everyone. I don't think we should be talking about red states and blue states. We should be talking about American states and American cities, how to put America back on its feet."

And there's no way I'm going to get it back. In fact, Maria, I'm probably going to see more and more revenue gone, because our economy won't come back without a stimulus. So, I'm simply saying what it's going to take get us back on our feet."

I mean, even before the coronavirus, you had streams of people, individuals and businesses, fleeing the city because of the taxes, fleeing the city because of the homelessness, and fleeing the city because of the inmates that you are letting out. New York City shootings spiked nearly 200 percent this week, compared to the same time a year ago. Crime is up. All the bad stats are up. You know that."

We have times when things go up, and the NYPD fights them back. NYPD, every single time there's even the smallest spike in crime, fights it back. In terms of the city, some people left, and a lot of people came, including we have built more homegrown millionaires in recent years and more millionaires have moved here than any who left. So, no, in fact, highest employment in our history, Maria, before this pandemic. This city has been booming. And I want to be clear. It's a city for everyone."

He drives rich people out of the city with the reg -- the amount of regulation and the tax increases, that you're driving businesses and individuals out. Let's not even go into the issue of the bail reform law, where you had to let all of these inmates out, and crime did spike. And we see that continuing, so much so that you had to get them back and put them back in jail, because, as soon as you let them out, they went and they committed more crimes."

And the U.S. Supreme Court said in 2012 that the federal government does not have -- in a federal system that respects states and localities, does not have the ability, because of its own policy preferences, to penalize cities that are trying to provide security and safety. You know the funding that President Trump originally threatened for the city? It was for the NYPD for our anti-terrorism efforts. That makes no sense at all. So, we are going to stick to our policies, which the Constitution protects. And we're going to serve our people and create a place that's safe for everyone. And you know what? The NYPD does not ask documentation status, because, decades ago -- Mayor Bloomberg knew this, Mayor Giuliani knew this -- to keep a city safe that happens to have hundreds of thousands of undocumented folks, we're not going to ask documentation status. We want to fix immigration in this country, let's have a comprehensive immigration reform, with a path to citizenship for all those who are here now, 12 million people. Let's stop ignoring, Maria, and denying it, and actually dealing with it as a country. That's something that Republicans and Democrats might actually get together on, because, if we don't, everyone is going to suffer, our economy is going to suffer. Let's deal with the reality."

Parks Department will be out there. If people are smart about it and listen to the rules, great. If not, we actually might have to put up fencing to keep people off the beach. I don't want to do it, but if I have to, I will. We are so far from being out of the woods here in New York City. We're still the epicenter. Until we're safe, no beaches open."

Since these guys have been away from this for now, what, 10 weeks, I think it's been a reminder to them, to all the competitors and to everybody that loves racing, that is passionate about it, just how much it means to them, and maybe that they took that for granted because of the repetitiveness and just how long this season is, but not anymore. Today, that passion is back, the excitement is there, and everybody is just thrilled that we're going to get to see the first major sport to be able to happen.
