I understand why my other colleagues were concerned about the constitutional issue. I am as well. I have the benefit of being chairman of the committee of jurisdiction. And we will take up a fix to the National Emergency Act to return that authority to Congress that was taken away by the Supreme Court and later codified by Congress. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, yes, we will bring that up.

We have got a chart here of apprehensions at the southwest, the southern border, and we had a huge spike in the month of February. So the yellow color is unaccompanied minors between ports of entry. The blue color is in family unites between ports of entry. Then we have got red, unaccompanied minors claiming asylum at ports of entry, and in family units claiming asylum at ports of entry.

The problem has completely changed. Now we're dealing with unaccompanied children and people coming in this country illegally as family units, claiming asylum. And our laws are such that, once they get into America, they basically stay. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We only return probably less than 3 percent of unaccompanied children. And so it is a huge incentive for more people from Central America coming up here either as unaccompanied child or more now as family units, because it's really rewarded. So what we saw in 2014 is, President Obama declared that a humanitarian crisis, when 120,000 children and people coming as family units across the border illegally and were apprehended. Last year, that number was 145,000. In the first five months of this year, 175,000 unaccompanied children, but now mainly people coming in as family units across the border illegally or presenting themselves at ports of entry claiming asylum. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All we can do, Maria, is, we can apprehend, we can process, and then we disperse. And these people, by and large, are staying in this country long term. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But that's not the only thing that we have to do. We have to amend these laws that provide the incentives. We have to maintain our asylum standards. And we have to make sure that we can apprehend and detain individuals. And those who don't have valid asylum claims, we have to quickly remove them to their home country, because that's, right now, what we don't have the capability.

And it really is an amendment under the human trafficking law in 2008 that created a disparity in terms of how we treat unaccompanied children from Central America vs. Canada or Mexico. That's increased the incentive, and then a court decision. When President Obama began detaining families and their children, so they could do expedited removal, somebody challenged that in court. And the Flores agreement was reinterpreted to include children that were also accompanied. That began the full catch and release. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And that's what we're in right now, because President Obama -- or President Trump tried to enforce the law. But that required separation, because we can't keep children more than 72 hours in CBP custody or more than 20 days in general. And so we have to disperse them.

What about the big-ticket items, like the I.P. theft, the forced transfer of technology, the espionage that we now know exists, given Huawei's performance? Will we be able to put enforcement in place to ensure that the Chinese keep their promises when it comes to these things?",

So I'm afraid the cyber-theft and the espionage will probably have to be enforced through criminal justice, through potential cases with WTO. But in terms of forced technology, the intellectual property transfers, that can be handled through an agreement. And it can be enforced through those agreements as well. But we need to absolutely demand reciprocal treatment. And that's what this administration is completely dedicated to achieving. And it's unfortunate you have to take it to this level, you have to provide this kind of brinksmanship, but I think China and our other trading partners have taken advantage of the situation far too long. And they're having to be shocked to the reality that this administration is not going to stand for it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Hopefully, they will come to that conclusion and we can conclude these trade deals, because the president has done a great job, as you were talking earlier on \"FOX & Friends,\" about relieving the regulatory burden, or at least having a pause.",

They began to import what's called intent, which is not part of the law. So really from the -- early on, from April/May -- and we know from May, when Mr. Comey started writing -- the group together came together and they were going to look at gross negligence, but then began to write an exoneration of Mrs. Clinton long before they ever even interviewed her.

Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson is here on what happens now, plus his reaction to North Korea's threat to walk away from nuclear talks. Congressman Doug Collins is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. He just released transcripts of closed-door testimony from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. What else might he have in store to shed light on what was going on at the Justice Department and the FBI leading up and through the 2016 election? He is here, exclusive. Democratic Congressman Harley Rouda weighs in on the Democratic oversight of the Trump administration, as well as Mitch McConnell's plan to hold a procedural vote on the Green New Deal. All that and a lot more right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And we begin this morning with President Trump issuing his first ever veto in response to a congressional resolution that would have blocked his national emergency on the southern border. The move tees up an override vote in the House scheduled for March 26. That is not expected to pass. Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, Republican Senator from Wisconsin Ron Johnson.

But, from my standpoint, as soon as the House voted with a total that was well below a veto-proof majority, this vote, from my standpoint, turned into a purely political vote, the whole issue of whether or not you support the border or whether you support the president in trying to secure it, secure our homeland. And, so for me, it was a pretty simple vote. I understand why my other colleagues were concerned about the constitutional issue. I am as well. I have the benefit of being chairman of the committee of jurisdiction. And we will take up a fix to the National Emergency Act to return that authority to Congress that was taken away by the Supreme Court and later codified by Congress. So, yes, we will bring that up. Hopefully, Democrats will support us. Hopefully, they will express the same concern about any executive having that kind of broad emergency powers, which this president had, and he exercised."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

But, before I do that, we know that the president, as soon as he got the bill, he vetoed it. And now they're trying to override it on March 26. Tell us what happens now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",

And, so, again, what I will do is, using my committee's jurisdiction, will actually bring up that National Emergency Act and amend it to return the authority that, again, the Supreme Court took away and Congress codified. So we will just flip this on the head. We will allow the president to declare an emergency for 30 days. And if a majority of both chambers agree to have that emergency extended, that should pass constitutional muster. So we will return that constitutional authority, which I think is appropriate. Past Congresses have given way too much of their constitutional authority away to the executive branch. And we should claw it back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, characterize the emergency as you see it today. We have got a chart here of apprehensions at the southwest, the southern border, and we had a huge spike in the month of February. So the yellow color is unaccompanied minors between ports of entry. The blue color is in family unites between ports of entry. Then we have got red, unaccompanied minors claiming asylum at ports of entry, and in family units claiming asylum at ports of entry. Tell us what this chart says."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Sure. Well, first of all, you have to understand that the record apprehensions back in 1986 and the year 2000 were really Mexican economic migrants coming back here, apprehended sometimes multiple times in the same day. The problem has completely changed. Now we're dealing with unaccompanied children and people coming in this country illegally as family units, claiming asylum. And our laws are such that, once they get into America, they basically stay. We only return probably less than 3 percent of unaccompanied children. And so it is a huge incentive for more people from Central America coming up here either as unaccompanied child or more now as family units, because it's really rewarded. So what we saw in 2014 is, President Obama declared that a humanitarian crisis, when 120,000 children and people coming as family units across the border illegally and were apprehended. Last year, that number was 145,000. In the first five months of this year, 175,000 unaccompanied children, but now mainly people coming in as family units across the border illegally or presenting themselves at ports of entry claiming asylum. All we can do, Maria, is, we can apprehend, we can process, and then we disperse. And these people, by and large, are staying in this country long term."

      "utterance": "No, where we have installed four sections of better barriers, we have cut illegal immigration by about 95 percent. That is a huge benefit to barrier structures. But that's not the only thing that we have to do. We have to amend these laws that provide the incentives. We have to maintain our asylum standards. And we have to make sure that we can apprehend and detain individuals. And those who don't have valid asylum claims, we have to quickly remove them to their home country, because that's, right now, what we don't have the capability. And is what is the huge draw coming particularly from Central America."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't understand. Why hasn't this been dealt with before? When we have your colleagues on the left on, they continue to say that they are for border security, and yet they don't -- they didn't vote for Kate's Law, they didn't vote for an end to sanctuary cities, they didn't vote for the wall. So, obviously, their votes do not correspond with what they're saying. But I'm just under -- I'm just trying -- I'm having a hard time understanding why, if this is such an incredible emergency, as these numbers bear out, why nothing has been done about this before."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, here is a news flash. Democrats are being hypocrites on this issue. They pay lip service to try and secure the border, but then they will do nothing to help us change the laws that would help us do just that. And it really is an amendment under the human trafficking law in 2008 that created a disparity in terms of how we treat unaccompanied children from Central America vs. Canada or Mexico. That's increased the incentive, and then a court decision. When President Obama began detaining families and their children, so they could do expedited removal, somebody challenged that in court. And the Flores agreement was reinterpreted to include children that were also accompanied. That began the full catch and release. And that's what we're in right now, because President Obama -- or President Trump tried to enforce the law. But that required separation, because we can't keep children more than 72 hours in CBP custody or more than 20 days in general. And so we have to disperse them. So we're back into full catch and release."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, we know that they did vote for a wall in the past, but now that President Trump has said it, this is in step with their resist movement, resist everything the president tries to do. Let me ask you about North Korea and get your take on this from a foreign affairs standpoint. North Korea threatened on Friday to walk away, suspend negotiations altogether with the Trump administration over its nuclear arms program. And they are saying that Kim Jong-un is going to decide soon whether to resume nuclear and missile tests. What's happening here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "A number of members of the Foreign Relations Committee met with Secretary Pompeo last week for an early morning breakfast, and very interesting to listen to him talk. First and foremost, Chairman Kim simply hasn't made that decision to disarm and integrate his economy, improve his economy. That's the first thing he has to do, but it also sounded like he was given some pretty bad advice by his advisers that what he offered would be accepted by President Trump. They offered that right up front. President Trump, Secretary Pompeo utterly rejected it. I don't know what Kim thought -- or Chairman Kim thought had changed in terms of the president accepting this, but President Trump was absolutely right in walking away from those negotiations. But, apparently, it shocked Chairman Kim, because his advisers said that it would be accepted. It's unacceptable. So the bottom line is, President Trump continues to try and offer that deal, but it's got to be a big deal. Chairman Kim has to accept the fact that he's going to give up his nuclear capability, his missile capabilities, in exchange for what would really be good for North Korea and his people and his regime, integration with the modern economies of the world."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

Was there anything that China has taken away from that, given the fact that we are still waiting on a meeting between the president of China and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which we thought was going to happen at the end of March, but now Secretary Mnuchin says probably not until April?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, what China and, quite honestly, all of our trading partners need to realize about President Trump is, he won't be snookered into a bad deal. He's going to make sure that, for example, in trade, we're going to have fair and reciprocal treatment. But, as it relates to North Korea, we're going to continue to impose sanctions. From my standpoint, I would say even ratchet up those sanctions, make sure that China maintains these U.N. resolutions that impose sanctions, that Russia does, start returning some of these guest workers that are providing an awful lot of hard foreign currency into North Korea and keeping that regime afloat."

Let's not make the same mistakes as we made in Iran, where sanctions brought to the table, but then we relieved those and we didn't actually force Iran into negotiating in good faith. Right now, Chairman Kim is not negotiating in good faith. He has to come to different conclusions."

I want to get your take on that, Senator. So, Senator Ron Johnson joins us once again when we come right back. Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures, on Instagram as well @SundayFutures and @MariaBartiromo.

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

And, Senator, let me ask you what a deal with China should look like, because I know the Chinese are willing to buy more soybean from the U.S. and they're willing to open up their markets a little, at least to financial services companies, among other industries. What about the big-ticket items, like the I.P. theft, the forced transfer of technology, the espionage that we now know exists, given Huawei's performance? Will we be able to put enforcement in place to ensure that the Chinese keep their promises when it comes to these things?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, enforcement is going to be the key. Now, part of the problem is, how do you enforce an agreement, things that the Chinese deny, for example, the cyber-theft, the espionage? So I'm afraid the cyber-theft and the espionage will probably have to be enforced through criminal justice, through potential cases with WTO. But in terms of forced technology, the intellectual property transfers, that can be handled through an agreement. And it can be enforced through those agreements as well. But we need to absolutely demand reciprocal treatment. And that's what this administration is completely dedicated to achieving. And it's unfortunate you have to take it to this level, you have to provide this kind of brinksmanship, but I think China and our other trading partners have taken advantage of the situation far too long. And they're having to be shocked to the reality that this administration is not going to stand for it. Hopefully, they will come to that conclusion and we can conclude these trade deals, because the president has done a great job, as you were talking earlier on \"FOX & Friends,\" about relieving the regulatory burden, or at least having a pause."

In America, it's obviously a little different. You have got some of the leading technology companies in the world -- take a Google, for example -- saying, we're not going to work with the Pentagon. We don't want to work with this U.S. government. We're pulling out of this contract to work with the Pentagon. And then you look at China, and they actually are working in China.

I know a number of Google employees were concerned about that as well, about the human rights abuses in China. But I thought it was rather shocking. It certainly got my attention when General Dunford talked about directly helping China's military. I will certainly be looking into that. I will be asking for a briefing from the Joint Chiefs. And we will also be asking Google to find out exactly what they are doing. They're an American company. They have to be loyal to America and to our values. I think the general was absolutely correct in the way he laid that out."

Recently released House Judiciary Committee transcripts are shedding more light into FBI investigations into then candidate Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's e-mails during the 2016 presidential election. The third and most recent transcript comes from former FBI agent Peter Strzok's closed-door testimony before Congress from June of last year. It follows transcripts of testimony from former FBI attorney Lisa Page and Justice Department official Bruce Ohr. Joining me right now is the top Republican on that committee who made those transcripts public, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins. Congressman, it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks very much for joining us."

And they know, from the beginning, that there was no collusion, and that these transcripts show an incredible amount of bias. Let's talk about some of the transcripts that you released, Peter Strzok's -- Peter Strzok's hatred of Donald Trump influenced the investigation and evidence against Donald Trump."

      "speaker": "This was John Ratcliffe interviewing Peter Strzok. And this was after the text that said -- Lisa Page says to him",

    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "I think what we got to do is look at this as you're going to know, because you can look at the proof. And that's why we're laying out the transcripts as we have. Peter Strzok was a man who thought he was untouchable. He became a hero in his mind's eye in thinking that he was going to be able to control and sometimes maybe showing off for his mistress at the time, Lisa Page. Let's never forget that. But also in his own role to grow up in the department. Peter Strzok was central, going back to the e-mail investigation, into the Russia investigation, into what became the Mueller investigation. So what we're seeing here is, yes, we see the bias. The transcripts reveal the bias. And when we see that Mr. Mueller actually got rid of him based on, you know, his actions and those texts, so I think when we look at this together, we get a picture of someone who was brought up or allowed to grow, if you would, under the Department of Justice under President Obama, in which politics became the first, foremost word, not justice."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "This is there what -- there were two things that really came out of this. And I think one of the things was, we just spoke about, and that would seem to be of that corrupt triumvirate of Page, McCabe and Strzok. Strzok seemed to stand out as his very aggressive nature on what he thought about the president and his political bent. The second thing that really came out from this Lisa Page was, let's -- as I said -- and I put out another tweet the other day that says, Loretta Lynch has some explaining to do, because what we have seen now is that, beforehand, she was giving -- she not only told Mr. Comey that this wasn't an investigation, to consider it a matter, which is an interesting way of putting it, but also now we're seeing from Lisa Page's own testimony that the Department of Justice, which she headed, was saying gross negligence is not the standard that's going to be used here. They began to import what's called intent, which is not part of the law. So really from the -- early on, from April/May -- and we know from May, when Mr. Comey started writing -- the group together came together and they were going to look at gross negligence, but then began to write an exoneration of Mrs. Clinton long before they ever even interviewed her. So we know this was coming from the top. So we now have a pattern here. Look at the pattern. You have Department of Justice and FBI on their own agenda with a political bent hoping for Mrs. Clinton to become president. That's sort of the takeaway over these first three transcripts."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "Oh, very much so, Maria. We -- look at this. That was even -- that was closer to the time when she said, I won't be a part of the prosecutorial decision, which all of a sudden in many ways has become evident now gave James Comey what he believed was his Superman cape to go do whatever he wanted to do. But she was already -- this was already in the works. Lisa Page's transcripts confirm this. This is why we released these in the way we're releasing them, so that people can begin to see what's happening here. We were making -- we were in this investigation. Democrats and others were saying, why are you going back, why are you doing this? You know, they made fun of the investigation the whole time. Well, now they have got a problem. I believe Mr. Mueller's report is going to come back and show that there was no collusion, which, by the way, is not a crime. But there's no collusion, nothing with the Trump administration that they're going to find and the president himself. But what they are going to have to deal with now is the reality of influence and collusion among DOJ and FBI employees in an e-mail investigation which was handled badly, that moved into a Russia investigation that was handled even worse, and then into a Mueller investigation. So these are the kind of things that the American people deserve to see, and that's why we're putting them out."

Now, are you going to be releasing that transcript soon?"

And, yes, there's been some leaked information that Mr. Baker actually had that, exactly what you talked about. This is why this is important, Maria. And I don't want any of your -- the folks watching today to forget this. This is a pattern. This is not something that randomly happened. I'm tired of really the mainstream media saying the FBI was investigating Ms. Clinton. No, there was a group that was investigating and told that they couldn't do their job. Remember, she wasn't even interviewed until late, after they had already started this discussion with the DOJ officials, probably including the attorney general -- she headed it -- saying that we can't charge gross negligence. So they already knew the outcome, but went through the process. And Lisa Page's transcripts also revealed the fact that this was, you know, sort of unusual. We also saw that with Strzok. We have heard it with many of these. Why would they interview a key witness, Ms. Clinton at the time, with key witnesses or fact witnesses in the room who have been granted immunity?"

This is the sad part we're at right now, Maria. They have no agenda. They have nothing that they can actually put on the floor. So they wasted an entire week of the American taxpayers' dollar to actually put a report on the floor that said nothing, basically except the same thing the regulations say that Mr. Barr needs to do.

That's basically like giving it to The New York Times, right? If somebody is not charged with something, the police don't say, hey, we're not charging them, but guess what, there's all this other stuff that we were looking at, maybe there's this fraud, maybe there's that fraud.

We have it all here. Yet he never shows it. In fact, he actually has to back up. When we released the Bruce Ohr transcript, it showed his own explanation of when some of this actually was dropped was wrong. It wasn't August. It wasn't after the election. Adam Schiff is just one, you know, again process away from spinning his own yarn. Jerry Nadler has subpoena power. He sent out 81 letters recently asking for information ranging on wide topics. You almost know that they are concerned about Mueller not having what they want, because only 30 of these letters actually had anything to do with Russia. When we come to this part, it's going to be very obvious that Mr. Nadler and others are responding to their base. They're responding to the pressures of their base, who want to impeach the president and have wanted to since November of 2016. You're seeing a politically motivated agenda to impeach the president, to make the president look bad for the 2020 elections. And we're going to be fighting against this.

      "utterance": "Right."

    {
      "speaker": "ROUDA",
      "utterance": "And so let's quit focusing on areas where we have clear disagreement and focus on the task at hand. And I wish Mitch McConnell would say, yes, climate change is real. Mr. President, you're wrong. Let's get together and figure out how to solve this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, what about -- is there a big pressure? Do you feel pressure within your party to go along with some of these pie-in-the-sky ideas? I mean, you have got the Green New Deal. You have got Medicare for all, which wipes out the private insurance industry. You have got a tax on wealth idea from Elizabeth Warren, which is unconstitutional. And you have got a tax -- 70 percent tax that AOC wants. How much pressure are you feeling to go along with some of your freshman colleagues like AOC, even though many of the moderates don't believe that any of these things would actually materialize?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROUDA",
      "utterance": "I don't feel any pressure at all. And I will tell you why. The citizens of Orange County who elected me here recognize that I have moderate views. I come from a business background. I have built companies up to 10,000 people. I believe in capitalism, and I believe in good government, and I believe they can work together. So, whether the outlandish idea is on the left or right, I'm not going to support it. I'm going to work with my Republicans and Democrats who believe that most Americans are between the 20-yard lines and get good legislation accomplished."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "We will see you soon, sir. Lindsey Graham blocked a Senate vote on a House resolution that would require the Justice Department to publicly release the full findings of the Mueller report. He wants a second special counsel to look at how the DOJ handled the Clinton e-mail investigation and the FISA warrants. Former Clinton adviser Mark Penn is with me next to discuss that, when we continue. Stay with us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Lindsey Graham blocked a Senate vote on the House measure that called for special counsel Robert Mueller's final report to be made public. Let's bring in Mark Penn. He's a former Clinton adviser and pollster. He's also managing partner at The Stagwell Group. Mark, your reaction to Lindsey Graham blocking this most recent procedural vote? What's going on in Congress these days?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK PENN, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, not much is going on in Congress these days. There's a lot more show votes than there are real votes on the matters that people want done. But I think senator Graham here was really saying, yes, I want the Mueller report to be transparent, but I also want a second independent counsel to be appointed to investigate what was going on with the FBI and the DOJ during all of these investigations. And I think that's the point he's making. There's obviously going to be and have to be significant transparency about what Mueller did. But, likely, there already is significant transparency, since Mueller has brought the cases that he's going to bring."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Right. And we have talked about this for a year-and-a-half, Mark. You have written about this a lot. We're not expecting collusion in the Mueller report. The Mueller report should be out in the next two weeks. What are you expecting? And what is your reaction to what you heard from Congressman Doug Collins earlier and Congressman Rouda?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, look, what am I expecting? I'm expecting a report that dwells significantly on what the president did relative to the obstruction of justice. I don't see obstruction of justice here, but I think the report could dwell on that. And then, on collusion, I think, ultimately, the report has brought not a single case related to that in any clear manner. So how could the report itself actually focus on that or find it? It can't. Nothing was brought. So I think we know the conclusion. And we know also, increasingly, as these transcripts come out, that the underlying foundation for this investigation never really existed, that the Steele dossier was never verified, and never should have been the basis for this. And the firing of Comey that triggered the independent counsel also had no basis in fact or law to create an independent counsel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, so the special counsel should never have been there in the first place. And we know how they handled the Hillary Clinton investigation. Jim Baker apparently testified that he wanted to charge her with gross negligence, but the DOJ said no. Your reaction to these directives coming from Loretta Lynch and Barack Obama's DOJ?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, the Lisa Page transcript really is quite stunning, because what Lisa Page is saying is that the Justice Department, before the investigation was really done, said that they were not going to prosecute. Therefore, the fact that Comey then says no one knows the conclusion, right, is a lie. It's a laughing matter, because of course he knew the conclusion. The conclusion had been dictated before the investigation began."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "This is really significant testimony from Lisa Page. I don't understand why the inspector general didn't understand this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Without accountability, nobody is going to trust the DOJ and the FBI for a long time. Mark, good to see you, sir. Thanks very much, Mark Penn.
