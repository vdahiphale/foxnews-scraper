How many of those can McConnell really continue to hold up?"

      "utterance": "The president does have a way, as Jeff Flake was saying, of dangling things, or another way of looking at it is expressing things in a way which poke the hornets' nest. By just suggesting he is not going to take it off the table, it suggests to the Democrats who have been saying he wants to pardon Manafort that that is what he is going to do. But it works in the Democrats' favor to try and pass this resolution to protect Mueller, because even if the president has no intention of doing this, and as the majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is saying this is a solution in search of a problem, it allows them to keep stoking the idea that the president is going to try and do this. I think they would have a tough time proving obstruction of justice if the president exercises his constitutional powers and actually does the pardon."

      "utterance": "Welcome to the next two years of Washington, and in particular in Congress. The good news for the president, though, is that because of the elections, the GOP, the Republican caucus is going to be a little bit more Trumpier. People like Bob Corker and Jeff Flake won't be there sniping from the Republican side. It will mostly be Democrats that are playing these games. But in terms of the issue of pardoning, once again, it's a situation where you have Trump saying something -- it's that he dangles something. It's that he actually enunciates it. Everybody knows that this is the sort of thing that pardons have been used for forever, and we can say whatever we want to about Paul Manafort, and it's great that he has been found guilty of crimes that he committed, but of course he committed them a long time ago. And the only difference between why federal prosecutors didn't go after it back then, that remains to be answered. But the only difference between that and what ended up happening is the fact that he got involved in politics and specifically -- and that by definition is a political prosecution."

Yesterday there was a \"Guardian\" report that said that Paul Manafort met with Assange in London and talked about the WikiLeaks emails. This is the \"Washington Times.\" Paul Manafort's passports don't show that he entered London in all the years claimed by the Guardian newspaper when it said he met secretly with WikiLeaks Julian Assange. \"The Guardian\" said he met with Assange in London in 2013, 2015, 2016. A review of Manafort's two passports show he entered Heathrow airport since 2008 on two occasions, 2012 and on another time where the customs stamp years was blurred. It appears to say 2010 or 2016.\" The point is, that is in court records from his trials, and it kind of falls apart. And it took up a lot of airwaves yesterday."

But here's the thing, why would -- to your point about the prosecution is all political -- why would Mueller be cutting a deal with Paul Manafort if he didn't have anything to give him? He would have just prosecuted, this would be over. So there is clearly more that they wanted to get from him that --it's not over."

      "speaker": "GURDON",
      "utterance": "It certainly does. These are as categorical denials as one could possibly get. The falling to pieces of the deal that Paul Manafort had with the prosecutor is another sign that this has come to -- I think that Manafort does look like he is looking for a pardon. I think it does raise questions of why the president would want to give him a pardon. All of that, the question of a pardon, the question of a prosecutions, it's all coming to a head, as you say.
