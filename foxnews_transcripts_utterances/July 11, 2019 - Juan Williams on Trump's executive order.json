But meanwhile, according to the New York Times, which is like saying according to ugly fat pants, families are hiring screen time coaches to help pry smartphones away from their kids. These screen-free parenting coaches offer advice that boils down to go outside and kick a ball. That advice cost hundred of dollars, so it's no wonder it's a trend among rich parents who still read the Times, because only Times readers would actually pay for advice that a Fox host would give you for free. Not to say this isn't a problem, but it's a joke for parents to discipline kids if they can't discipline themselves. You know mom has her own Facebook page and God knows what dad searches for when she's out of town. Bottomline, it's a new world, humans have grown a new permanent electronic appendage, the phone. The key five things that beat staring at a screen, a pet, a hobby, a day at the firing range. The problem is they'll just Instagram everything. So I say accept it, but lay down some ground rules and screw the consultants. A, if you share a picture of any body part, the phone is gone for a year, and so is the body part. B, if you share any family information, you go back to the orphanage. C, if I catch you texting while driving, the phone stays in the car and the car goes in the lake. That's all. So it's not that hard. And consider what we did before smartphones, doorbell ditching, crank calls, moaning traffic, lawn darts. A kids life was dangerous, full of stitches, scabs, and little league coaches and stank of rye. At least with smartphones, you'll live longer, even if it's hardly living at all. All right, to the parents around here, I guess I'll start with you, Jesse, any advice for limiting screen time? Do you need a consultant?",

      "sentences": "Are you a citizen of the United States of America. Oh! Gee, I'm sorry I just can't answer that question. And that's after spending billions and billions of dollars. There used to be a time when you could answer questions like that very easily. They used to be a time when you could proudly declare, I am a citizen of the United States. Now they're trying to erase the very existence of a very important word and a very important thing, citizenship. They're even coming after the Pledge of Allegiance in Minnesota. I'm proud to be a citizen. You're proud to be a citizen. The only people who are not proud to be citizens are the ones who are fighting us all the way about the word, citizen. Today, I'm here to say, we are not backing down on our effort to determine the citizenship status of the United States population. I stand before you to outline new steps, my administration has taken to ensure that citizenship is counted so that we know how many citizens we have in the United States. Makes sense? We will defend the right of the American people to know the full facts about the population, size of citizens and non-citizens in America. It is essential that we have a clear breakdown of the number of citizens and non- citizens that make up the U.S. populations comparative. Knowing this information is vital to formulating, sound public policy. Whether the issue is health care, education, civil rights or immigration, we must have a reliable count of how many citizens, non-citizens and illegal aliens are in our country. The Department of Commerce sensibly decided to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census as has been done many, many times throughout the history of the United States. Unfortunately, this effort was delayed by meritless litigation. As shocking as it may be, Far Left Democrats in our country are determined to conceal the number of illegal aliens in our midst. They probably know the number is far greater, much higher than anyone would have ever believed before. Maybe that's why they fight so hard. This is part of a broader Left-wing effort to erode the rights of the American citizen and is very unfair to our country. The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed our right to ask the citizenship question and very strongly it was affirmed. But the Supreme Court also ruled that we must provide further explanation that would have produced even more litigation and considerable time delays. The case is already in three federal district courts that have been to be totally honest extremely unfriendly to us. These delays would have prevented us from completing the census on time. It's deeply regrettable, but it will not stop us from collecting the needed information and I think even in greater detail and more accurately. Therefore, we are pursuing a new option to ensure a complete and timely count of the non-citizen population. Today, I will be issuing an executive order to put this very plan into effect immediately. I am hereby ordering every department and agency and the federal government to provide the Department of Commerce with all requested records regarding the number of citizens and non-citizens in our country. They must furnish all legally accessible records in their possession immediately. We will utilize these vast federal databases to gain a full, complete and accurate count of the non-citizen population, including databases maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. We have great knowledge in many of our agencies. We will leave no stone unturned. The Census Bureau projected that using previously available records, it could determine citizenship for 90 percent of our population or more. With today's executive order, which eliminates longstanding obstacles to data sharing, we're aiming to count everyone. Ultimately, this will allow us to have an even more complete count of citizens than through asking the single question alone. It will be - we think far more accurate. The Census Bureau can use this information along with information collected through the questionnaire to create the official census. In other words, as a result of today's executive order, we will be able to ensure the 2020 census generates an accurate count of how many citizens, non-citizens and illegal aliens are in the United States of America. Not too much to ask. This will greatly inform a wide array of public policy decisions. This information is also relevant to administering our elections. Some states may want to draw state and local legislative districts based upon the voter eligible population. Indeed, the same day, the Supreme Court handed down the census decision. It also said, it would not review certain types of distracting decisions which could encourage states to make such decisions based on voter eligibility. With today's order, we will collect all of the information we need to conduct an accurate census and to make responsible decisions about public policy, voting rights and representation in Congress. In everything we do, we will faithfully represent the people of the United States of America. I would like now to introduce Attorney General Bill Barr to the podium. Thank you. Thank you, Bill.",

      "sentences": "Good evening. Thank you, Mr. President and congratulations on today's executive order, which will ensure that we finally have an accurate understanding of how many citizens and non- citizens live in our country. As the Supreme Court recognized, it would be perfectly lawful for the federal government to ask on the census whether individuals are citizens of the United States. And it's entirely reasonable to want to know how many citizens and non-citizens there are in the United States. In fact, the federal government has routinely asked questions relating to citizenship ever since the 1820's. But while the Supreme Court correctly recognized that it would be entirely appropriate to include citizenship questions on the census, it nevertheless held that the Commerce Department did not adequately explain its decisions for doing so on the 2020 census. Because as the Supreme Court recognized, the defect in the Commerce Department's decision was curable with a better record. The President asked me to work with Secretary Ross to determine whether there remained a viable path for including a citizenship question on the census. I did so. In my view, the government has ample justification to inquire about citizenship status on the census and could plainly provide rationales for doing so that would satisfy the Supreme Court. And therefore, there is no question that a new decision to add the question would ultimately survive legal review. The problem is that any new decision would be subject to immediate challenge as a new claim in the three ongoing district court cases. In addition, there are injunctions currently in place that forbid adding the question. There is simply no way to litigate these issues and obtain relief from the current injunctions in time to implement any new decision without jeopardizing our ability to carry out the census, which we're not going to do. We're not going to jeopardize our ability to carry out the census. So, as a practical matter, the Supreme Court's decision closed all paths to adding the question to the 2020 census. Put simply, the impediment was not - was a logistical impediment, not a legal one. We simply cannot complete the litigation in time to carry out the census. One other point on this. Some in the media have been suggesting in the hysterical mode of the day that the administration has been planning to add the citizenship question to the census by executive fiat without regard to contrary court orders or what the Supreme Court might say. This has been based on rank speculation and nothing more. As should be obvious there has never been under - this has never been under consideration. We have always accepted that any new decision to add a citizenship question to the census would be subject to judicial review. Turning to today, I applaud the President for recognizing in his executive order that including a question on the census is not the only way to obtain this vital information. The course the President has chosen today will bring unprecedented resources to bear on determining how many citizens and non-citizens are in our country and will yield the best data the government has had on citizenship in many decades. That information will be used for countless purposes as the President explained in his remarks today. For example, there is a current dispute over whether illegal aliens can be included for apportionment purposes. Depending on the resolution of that dispute, this data may be relevant to those considerations. We will be studying this issue. Congratulations again, Mr. President on taking this effective action. Thank you.",

This is America's decision about our borders and our citizenship, not the rest of the world. If you ignore that question, you're going to end up with Brexit, because Brexit happened when millions of British citizens saw Germany's decision impact their future immigration, right. And that caused the fracture caused them to leave the EU, because they said, Germany is going to let all these refugees in, they're going to end up in England. So, if government ceases to enforce their borders, America will end up like the EU and states will have to create their own long-term solutions right to impact security.

I think they've been fighting the president pretty damn hard the last two years. But I also strongly disagree with Greg. I want to see the Democratic Party destroy itself. I want to see eat itself alive. They've uncorked this bottle -- this virus, this identity politics virus, and now it's eating them. And now they're upset about it. Oh, really? You guys are upset because the last five years, anytime you criticize Barack Obama, racist. You criticize Omar, oh, Islamophobic. You criticize the captain of the U.S. soccer team, sexist and homophobic. So, you know what? The chickens have come home to roost, to quote the pastor of Barack Obama. And it's sad because the only time you play the race card and the gender card is because you don't have any cards left to play. And that's what you said right here when you cited this Democratic lawmaker. She sounds like a Republican. She -- William Lacy Clay, excuse me, male Democrat from Missouri. What a weak argument talking about AOC because you can't get your way. And because you're getting pushed back you resort to using the race card? That's unbelievable to me. So that's what Republicans have been saying for so long that it's a weak response when you can't persuade to make an argument. And I will say lastly, they haven't been singled out. They singled themselves out. They were the only four people to vote, while 240 others voted the other way. And they've all been lightning rods since they got in. They're always getting all the attention. Nancy hasn't singled themselves, they've done it to themselves."

To respond to your specific question, however, in L.A. the homelessness has increased 75 percent in the last six years, since Eric Garcetti assumed the mayor role in 2013, and since there was a super Democratic majority on the county board. So it's 100 percent data backed that it is a Democratic problem. Newsom is throwing $2.5 billion added in the state budget towards homelessness, and yet his care not cash didn't work when he was San Francisco's mayor. Garcetti is throwing almost 450 million added, most of it long term debt in L.A. He calls these spikes and stuff -- he called that the short term solution. It's the worst band aid approach ever.

These screen-free parenting coaches offer advice that boils down to go outside and kick a ball. That advice cost hundred of dollars, so it's no wonder it's a trend among rich parents who still read the Times, because only Times readers would actually pay for advice that a Fox host would give you for free. Not to say this isn't a problem, but it's a joke for parents to discipline kids if they can't discipline themselves. You know mom has her own Facebook page and God knows what dad searches for when she's out of town. Bottomline, it's a new world, humans have grown a new permanent electronic appendage, the phone. The key five things that beat staring at a screen, a pet, a hobby, a day at the firing range. The problem is they'll just Instagram everything. So I say accept it, but lay down some ground rules and screw the consultants. A, if you share a picture of any body part, the phone is gone for a year, and so is the body part. B, if you share any family information, you go back to the orphanage. C, if I catch you texting while driving, the phone stays in the car and the car goes in the lake. That's all. So it's not that hard. And consider what we did before smartphones, doorbell ditching, crank calls, moaning traffic, lawn darts. A kids life was dangerous, full of stitches, scabs, and little league coaches and stank of rye. At least with smartphones, you'll live longer, even if it's hardly living at all.

Let's listen to the President."

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "Are you a citizen of the United States of America. Oh! Gee, I'm sorry I just can't answer that question. And that's after spending billions and billions of dollars. There used to be a time when you could answer questions like that very easily. They used to be a time when you could proudly declare, I am a citizen of the United States. Now they're trying to erase the very existence of a very important word and a very important thing, citizenship. They're even coming after the Pledge of Allegiance in Minnesota. I'm proud to be a citizen. You're proud to be a citizen. The only people who are not proud to be citizens are the ones who are fighting us all the way about the word, citizen. Today, I'm here to say, we are not backing down on our effort to determine the citizenship status of the United States population. I stand before you to outline new steps, my administration has taken to ensure that citizenship is counted so that we know how many citizens we have in the United States. Makes sense? We will defend the right of the American people to know the full facts about the population, size of citizens and non-citizens in America. It is essential that we have a clear breakdown of the number of citizens and non- citizens that make up the U.S. populations comparative. Knowing this information is vital to formulating, sound public policy. Whether the issue is health care, education, civil rights or immigration, we must have a reliable count of how many citizens, non-citizens and illegal aliens are in our country. The Department of Commerce sensibly decided to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census as has been done many, many times throughout the history of the United States. Unfortunately, this effort was delayed by meritless litigation. As shocking as it may be, Far Left Democrats in our country are determined to conceal the number of illegal aliens in our midst. They probably know the number is far greater, much higher than anyone would have ever believed before. Maybe that's why they fight so hard. This is part of a broader Left-wing effort to erode the rights of the American citizen and is very unfair to our country. The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed our right to ask the citizenship question and very strongly it was affirmed. But the Supreme Court also ruled that we must provide further explanation that would have produced even more litigation and considerable time delays. The case is already in three federal district courts that have been to be totally honest extremely unfriendly to us. These delays would have prevented us from completing the census on time. It's deeply regrettable, but it will not stop us from collecting the needed information and I think even in greater detail and more accurately. Therefore, we are pursuing a new option to ensure a complete and timely count of the non-citizen population. Today, I will be issuing an executive order to put this very plan into effect immediately. I am hereby ordering every department and agency and the federal government to provide the Department of Commerce with all requested records regarding the number of citizens and non-citizens in our country. They must furnish all legally accessible records in their possession immediately. We will utilize these vast federal databases to gain a full, complete and accurate count of the non-citizen population, including databases maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. We have great knowledge in many of our agencies. We will leave no stone unturned. The Census Bureau projected that using previously available records, it could determine citizenship for 90 percent of our population or more. With today's executive order, which eliminates longstanding obstacles to data sharing, we're aiming to count everyone. Ultimately, this will allow us to have an even more complete count of citizens than through asking the single question alone. It will be - we think far more accurate. The Census Bureau can use this information along with information collected through the questionnaire to create the official census. In other words, as a result of today's executive order, we will be able to ensure the 2020 census generates an accurate count of how many citizens, non-citizens and illegal aliens are in the United States of America. Not too much to ask. This will greatly inform a wide array of public policy decisions. This information is also relevant to administering our elections. Some states may want to draw state and local legislative districts based upon the voter eligible population. Indeed, the same day, the Supreme Court handed down the census decision. It also said, it would not review certain types of distracting decisions which could encourage states to make such decisions based on voter eligibility. With today's order, we will collect all of the information we need to conduct an accurate census and to make responsible decisions about public policy, voting rights and representation in Congress. In everything we do, we will faithfully represent the people of the United States of America. I would like now to introduce Attorney General Bill Barr to the podium. Thank you. Thank you, Bill."

      "speaker": "WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Good evening. Thank you, Mr. President and congratulations on today's executive order, which will ensure that we finally have an accurate understanding of how many citizens and non- citizens live in our country. As the Supreme Court recognized, it would be perfectly lawful for the federal government to ask on the census whether individuals are citizens of the United States. And it's entirely reasonable to want to know how many citizens and non-citizens there are in the United States. In fact, the federal government has routinely asked questions relating to citizenship ever since the 1820's. But while the Supreme Court correctly recognized that it would be entirely appropriate to include citizenship questions on the census, it nevertheless held that the Commerce Department did not adequately explain its decisions for doing so on the 2020 census. Because as the Supreme Court recognized, the defect in the Commerce Department's decision was curable with a better record. The President asked me to work with Secretary Ross to determine whether there remained a viable path for including a citizenship question on the census. I did so. In my view, the government has ample justification to inquire about citizenship status on the census and could plainly provide rationales for doing so that would satisfy the Supreme Court. And therefore, there is no question that a new decision to add the question would ultimately survive legal review. The problem is that any new decision would be subject to immediate challenge as a new claim in the three ongoing district court cases. In addition, there are injunctions currently in place that forbid adding the question. There is simply no way to litigate these issues and obtain relief from the current injunctions in time to implement any new decision without jeopardizing our ability to carry out the census, which we're not going to do. We're not going to jeopardize our ability to carry out the census. So, as a practical matter, the Supreme Court's decision closed all paths to adding the question to the 2020 census. Put simply, the impediment was not - was a logistical impediment, not a legal one. We simply cannot complete the litigation in time to carry out the census. One other point on this. Some in the media have been suggesting in the hysterical mode of the day that the administration has been planning to add the citizenship question to the census by executive fiat without regard to contrary court orders or what the Supreme Court might say. This has been based on rank speculation and nothing more. As should be obvious there has never been under - this has never been under consideration. We have always accepted that any new decision to add a citizenship question to the census would be subject to judicial review. Turning to today, I applaud the President for recognizing in his executive order that including a question on the census is not the only way to obtain this vital information. The course the President has chosen today will bring unprecedented resources to bear on determining how many citizens and non-citizens are in our country and will yield the best data the government has had on citizenship in many decades. That information will be used for countless purposes as the President explained in his remarks today. For example, there is a current dispute over whether illegal aliens can be included for apportionment purposes. Depending on the resolution of that dispute, this data may be relevant to those considerations. We will be studying this issue. Congratulations again, Mr. President on taking this effective action. Thank you."

And this could come from anywhere, the Health and Human Services Department, USDA, Social Security Treasury, it all goes to the Commerce Department, Greg, which runs the census. And now they'll have a more accurate reading of who is in the country legally as a citizen and who is not."

It's almost exactly what Scott Adams said yesterday that he was going to do. I have to say that. So anyway, here's the thing, this goes to the bigger question, is - and I think the Democrats have to understand this. This is America's decision about our borders and our citizenship, not the rest of the world. If you ignore that question, you're going to end up with Brexit, because Brexit happened when millions of British citizens saw Germany's decision impact their future immigration, right. And that caused the fracture caused them to leave the EU, because they said, Germany is going to let all these refugees in, they're going to end up in England. So, if government ceases to enforce their borders, America will end up like the EU and states will have to create their own long-term solutions right to impact security.

I think it's telling that A, Justice Thomas's comment said, in his separate opinion. He basically said, look, this is the court that's doubting the sincerity of what is otherwise an adequate rationale. Since when do we invalidate agency decisions based on that. Secondly, don't forget that Speaker Pelosi is calling for a vote to hold AG Barr and the Secretary of Commerce in criminal contempt for failing to answer questions about their internal discussions. So, when you say that they're going around it, I think that's a utilization of resources available to them that for some reason I don't agree that we should remain these inflexible boxes that the Left keeps trying to shove the administration into.
