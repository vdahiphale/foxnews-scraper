President Trump has revoked former CIA Chief John Brennan's security clearance and the media is in a complete freak out mode. Congressman Ron DeSantis joins us with a reaction. We also have an exclusive with Senator Lindsey Graham on his very provocative and somewhat -- you know, I think it's controversial idea on how to clean up the FBI.

Marjorie Pritchard of \"The Boston Globe\" told CNN, \"We have some big newspapers, but the majority are from smaller markets, all enthusiastic about standing up to Trump's assault on journalism.\" What we are witnessing is the full on politicization of the media. As Steve Bannon once said, the media have become the opposition party and that is a pity. I think it is ever since their disastrous misreading of the electorate in 2016, they have obsessively worked to prove themselves right. In other words, on just about every issue, they paint the most insidious portrait possible of the president in order that later on they can say, see, we told you so, we were right. I think it is also utterly predictable. The better the economy gets, the more confident the American people are about their future, that more frantic than ever Trump press becomes. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It's a perverse, inverse relationship. And I've noticed something else. The more popular Trump becomes among African-Americans -- his numbers are as high as 36 percent according to Rasmussen -- the more desperate the scribblers are to tar him as racist. And of course they throw in xenophobic and misogynist for good measure. But rather than cover how American lives are being transformed due to a booming economy and record-breaking employment figures, the media focus on self-created controversies like fabricated dossier claims. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

But still the media happily gives Omarosa hours and hours and hours of air time. I think in their warped thinking, the woman America considers to be the ultimate mean girl helps advance the narrative for the media that Trump's a racist. But once again, I think the media are misreading the American people. Here's the latest data. According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist Poll -- that's a mouthful -- 71 percent of Americans have not very much or no confidence at all in the media compared to just 25 percent who have a great deal of confidence or quite a lot. But the amazing thing is the media don't seem to care about what the consumers of news are shouting at them. Both the ratings and readership are down, whatever. We have a mission, that is to get Trump. Most had completely abandoned the idea of objectivity and are now essentially operating as full-time members of the resistance. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, now that we've established all that, what lessons can the White House take from all of this? I realized it's tempting to swing at every pitch. But let's be real here, as Trump proved in the election, the media just aren't that influential anymore. So the president need not feel like he has to respond to their every utterance regardless of how vicious it is. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Combine the media's winning irrelevance with the Democrats' invisible agenda, and the president I think has a pretty sweet opportunity to actually expand his base before November. Now I know a lot of people are shaking their head, how can that be? Now I know he will be on the stump and critical races before November, but I think he should also take the time to visit places that Republicans have often ignored. Mr. President, your agenda is working, so sell it everywhere. And listen to the people who are being fed a load of malarkey about what is in your heart and mind and show them what is really in your heart and mind. And yes, that means doing events exclusively for African-Americans and Latinos including in distressed communities, places like Chicago, where Democratic leaders have failed abysmally. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Show them a better alternative and celebrate the gains you have already won for them and all Americans. Too many Republicans never understand that you often win respect for just showing up. But of course, I don't expect the editorial writers to give you any credit for any outreach like that. But in a way, who cares? No one is reading them anyway. And that's \"The Angle\".\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Joining me now for reaction is Dave Bossi, a Fox News contributor who served as deputy manager of Trump's campaign and Richard Goodstein, a former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton.

President Trump has revoked former CIA Chief John Brennan's security clearance and the media is in a complete freak out mode. Congressman Ron DeSantis joins us with a reaction. We also have an exclusive with Senator Lindsey Graham on his very provocative and somewhat -- you know, I think it's controversial idea on how to clean up the FBI. And Raymond Arroyo will be here with a Hollywood example of false Me Too allegations and some all too credible ones out of Pennsylvania. But first, the media versus Trump, that is the focus of tonight's \"Angle\".\" Remember when it was bad for local media to convey coordinated messages over the airwaves? You know, like when Sinclair Media asked local anchors at their stations to read the same promo scripts to describe their newscasts. They were derided by legacy media as Orwellian, Soviet-style propaganda, so it created local Stepford Wives. Oh, the outrage."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So, it was an abuse of the media for Sinclair to air these homogenized promos and local markets. But when a legacy media coordinate messages across local markets, it is apparently no problem at all. Tomorrow, over 350 papers organized by \"The Boston Globe\" will print coordinated editorials to denounce the president for his fake news comments and media trash talk. Sounds like one of the great political messaging machines in the entire world, if you ask me. Marjorie Pritchard of \"The Boston Globe\" told CNN, \"We have some big newspapers, but the majority are from smaller markets, all enthusiastic about standing up to Trump's assault on journalism.\" What we are witnessing is the full on politicization of the media. As Steve Bannon once said, the media have become the opposition party and that is a pity. I think it is ever since their disastrous misreading of the electorate in 2016, they have obsessively worked to prove themselves right. In other words, on just about every issue, they paint the most insidious portrait possible of the president in order that later on they can say, see, we told you so, we were right. I think it is also utterly predictable. The better the economy gets, the more confident the American people are about their future, that more frantic than ever Trump press becomes. It's a perverse, inverse relationship. And I've noticed something else. The more popular Trump becomes among African-Americans -- his numbers are as high as 36 percent according to Rasmussen -- the more desperate the scribblers are to tar him as racist. And of course they throw in xenophobic and misogynist for good measure. But rather than cover how American lives are being transformed due to a booming economy and record-breaking employment figures, the media focus on self-created controversies like fabricated dossier claims."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "A couple of things look like they might be true. Omarosa's string of charges have been refuted by nearly every party she quotes in her book, Frank Luntz, Katrina Pierson, and Lynne Patton who was her closest confidant at the White House who was on our show last night. They all dispute her claims. And the president says the producer of \"The Apprentice,\" Mark Burnett, also denies that there is any tape. But still the media happily gives Omarosa hours and hours and hours of air time. I think in their warped thinking, the woman America considers to be the ultimate mean girl helps advance the narrative for the media that Trump's a racist. But once again, I think the media are misreading the American people. Here's the latest data. According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist Poll -- that's a mouthful -- 71 percent of Americans have not very much or no confidence at all in the media compared to just 25 percent who have a great deal of confidence or quite a lot. But the amazing thing is the media don't seem to care about what the consumers of news are shouting at them. Both the ratings and readership are down, whatever. We have a mission, that is to get Trump. Most had completely abandoned the idea of objectivity and are now essentially operating as full-time members of the resistance. So, now that we've established all that, what lessons can the White House take from all of this? I realized it's tempting to swing at every pitch. But let's be real here, as Trump proved in the election, the media just aren't that influential anymore. So the president need not feel like he has to respond to their every utterance regardless of how vicious it is. Combine the media's winning irrelevance with the Democrats' invisible agenda, and the president I think has a pretty sweet opportunity to actually expand his base before November. Now I know a lot of people are shaking their head, how can that be? Now I know he will be on the stump and critical races before November, but I think he should also take the time to visit places that Republicans have often ignored. Mr. President, your agenda is working, so sell it everywhere. And listen to the people who are being fed a load of malarkey about what is in your heart and mind and show them what is really in your heart and mind. And yes, that means doing events exclusively for African-Americans and Latinos including in distressed communities, places like Chicago, where Democratic leaders have failed abysmally. Show them a better alternative and celebrate the gains you have already won for them and all Americans. Too many Republicans never understand that you often win respect for just showing up. But of course, I don't expect the editorial writers to give you any credit for any outreach like that. But in a way, who cares? No one is reading them anyway. And that's \"The Angle\".\" Joining me now for reaction is Dave Bossi, a Fox News contributor who served as deputy manager of Trump's campaign and Richard Goodstein, a former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton.

You would like to think, Trump said, I'm going to hire the best people, these people would be experienced, have great ideas, really work hard, and work for the American people. Instead, what he revealed was, the people that he keeps on are people who say good things about him who he later refers to as dogs and lowlifes. And the problem with that is what does that say to foreign leaders? You know, he doesn't just talk in a vacuum. People actually are kind of watching what he is saying and it just kind of -- and that Michael Cohen, Omarosa, god knows who else, are taping conversations with Trump. What does that say about the kind of relationships that even his closest advisors have towards him and what trust they have in him? That's the problem. It's not what's on the tapes.

Joining me now, someone who has been very critical of Brennan, Congressman Ron DeSantis, the Republican nominee in Florida's gubernatorial election. Congressman, is it fair to revoke a security clearance? I mean, John Brennan, the list of jobs, Congressman, he's had for the government, and he is just trying to protect the United States, don't you see, from perpetual Russian interference, from the puppet known as our current president.

First of all, he shouldn't have a security clearance even if he did do a good job and even if he had been apolitical, but his conduct I think has been a joke. I think it's damaged the intelligence community. And his tenure as both the National Terrorism chief but then also at CIA was very unproductive and disastrous. He did not do a good job identifying ISIS as a rising threat, and of course, was somebody helping to facilitate the disastrous deal with Iran. So his performance wasn't good. So I don't think he would be a guy you would even want to get advice from, even if he wasn't such a partisan hack.

And he mentions him but then Frederick Douglass is the same person who frequently played \"The Star- Spangled Banner\" on his violin for his family. So he frequently played it on his violin for his grandchildren in the years after the war. He said in an 1871 speech at Arlington Cemetery, if \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" floats only over free American citizens in every corner of the land, and our country has before it a long and glorious career of justice, liberty, and civilization, we are indebted to the unselfish devotion of the noble army.

      "utterance": "Tomorrow night's show, we have an unbelievable lineup. We're going to talk to Rand Paul, special Thursday edition of \"Friday Follies.\" Did you know that you can get macaroni straws to save the whales? Not kidding.

Glad we spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and the Iraq War. Guys that's all the time we have tonight, but we love hearing from you. Tweet me @IngrahamAngle.
