When you look at it from a legal perspective and you look at the cases out there, for example Bluman versus the FEC, it really does restrict what foreign nationals can do, which is spending money or spending number on candidates or express advocacy.

It's Donald Trump Jr., and these emails. This doesn't require interpretation. This isn't coming through the filter of \"The New York Times.\" The emails say what they say. This is one of those moments where we have to stop and think, are we really having a debate in this country in Washington about the propriety of the son of a presidential candidate, a leading presidential candidate, meeting with representatives who he thought were of a hostile foreign power for the purposes of winning an election, and we have to have a debate about whether that's proper or not?

There is some question talking to some lawyers today about whether he would be in legal jeopardy or not, probably not. But that seems to me to be a different debate and it almost misses the point of what we learned over the past three days. Remember, just three or four days ago story from the Trump campaign was no contacts. Then the story was a harmless meeting about adoptions. Then the story was a meeting to get information about Clinton. Then the story after that was a supposed representative of the Russian government coming to provide this information so Trump could win an election. That's an incredible moment.",

MERCEDES SCHLAPP, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": There are several problems, that being one of them, in terms of them saying that they don't recall having these meetings with Russians and this happens. So it brings up a second question which I'm hearing out the legal community, which is, is there a chance that there's more of these meetings? Are there more contacts out there that they, the campaign, had with the Russians? My question is, where was the campaign lawyer during this process? In terms of when you're in a campaign, your campaign lawyer is critical in helping to vet a lot of these meetings, for example. I think the mere fact that it was such a decentralized campaign with the family members running it to a certain extent it creates a bit of a disservice because of the fact that they are not understanding that there could be a legal ramifications for the actions they've taken."

      "utterance": "Understood that, but if Paul Manafort goes to that meeting, as campaign manager, he has decades of experience in politics, Jared Kushner is a different story as far as political experience. But they are in that meeting, they have to know something before they get in the meeting, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "That's what it appears at this point, but I do believe that they didn't know what they didn't know. They thought that this -- they believed that this was going to be a meeting to figure out if there was information on Clinton. When you look at it from a legal perspective and you look at the cases out there, for example Bluman versus the FEC, it really does restrict what foreign nationals can do, which is spending money or spending number on candidates or express advocacy. So I think from a legal perspective Donald Trump Jr., is probably in a better spot. But the question becomes that the Democrats are now pushing this narrative of treason where I think they are overplaying their hand, Bret. I don't think that's where they should be going because, at the end, I just feel that Donald Trump Jr., and the team didn't necessarily know that this could create a problem."

      "utterance": "Steve? STEVE HAYES, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"THE WEEKLY STANDARD\": The story here is not President Obama, it's not the deep state, it's not the media, it's not the Democrats. It's Donald Trump Jr., and these emails. This doesn't require interpretation. This isn't coming through the filter of \"The New York Times.\" The emails say what they say. This is one of those moments where we have to stop and think, are we really having a debate in this country in Washington about the propriety of the son of a presidential candidate, a leading presidential candidate, meeting with representatives who he thought were of a hostile foreign power for the purposes of winning an election, and we have to have a debate about whether that's proper or not? That's an incredible moment in our history that we are having this debate. I think you are right on the legal question, Democrats are overplaying their hand. There is some question talking to some lawyers today about whether he would be in legal jeopardy or not, probably not. But that seems to me to be a different debate and it almost misses the point of what we learned over the past three days. Remember, just three or four days ago story from the Trump campaign was no contacts. Then the story was a harmless meeting about adoptions. Then the story was a meeting to get information about Clinton. Then the story after that was a supposed representative of the Russian government coming to provide this information so Trump could win an election. That's an incredible moment."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Trump supporters push back and they say, how do they know she was in the Russian government? The email says if you believe Goldstone and the setting up of the meeting that she is representing or somehow representing the Russian government in its efforts to help the Trump campaign. She goes on to tell NBC that she was not working for the Russian government at the time."

    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Even worse she was working for Fusion GPS, a private contractor, it's the group that released the dossier. And then you have to ask yourself a question, how did she get a visa? There's all these other questions that I think need to be asked, and actually Fusion GPS is stonewalling the congressional investigation right now. So I think those are a second set of questions that need to be asked."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "You were going to finish her point, sorry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "The Fusion GPS, there are questions there. We should get answers to questions I think through the investigations, either the congressional investigations or Bob Mueller's. We will get answers to those. But the fact of the matter is she represented herself, Mr. Blackstone represented her as a Republican Party of the Russian government -- Goldstone -- of the Russian government, and Donald Trump Jr., took the meeting with the intention of colluding. I think that is the problem here. That's the big takeaway, whatever all of the rest of this is."

      "speaker": "SWAN",
      "utterance": "I think talking to people one of the biggest problems is the credibility gap that opens up now because their line has been, as Steve pointed out very recently, this whole thing is phony. There's nothing to it. In fact it's not only fully, it's ridiculous that you would even suggest that we knew any Russians or dealt with any Russians. And then we have this amazing timeline now where you have the email dated June whatever it was where he heard that this was the Russian government, and then a month later you have Don Jr. on television with Jake Tapper on CNN saying this whole thing is ridiculous.
