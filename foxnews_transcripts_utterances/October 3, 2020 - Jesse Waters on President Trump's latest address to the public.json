We're working hard to get me all the way back, I have to be back because we still have to make America great again. We've done an awfully good job of that, but we still have steps to go and we have to finish that job. And I'll be back -- I think I'll be back soon, and I look forward to finishing up the campaign the way it was started and the way we've been doing, the kind of numbers that we've been doing. We've been so proud of it. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But this was something that happened and it's happened to millions of people all over the world, and I'm fighting for them, not just in the U.S., I'm fighting for them all over the world. We're going to beat this coronavirus, or whatever you want to call it and we're going to beat it soundly. So many things have happened. If you look at the therapeutics, which I'm taking right now, some of them and others are coming out soon that are looking like, frankly, they are miracles, if you want to know the truth, they are miracles. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } People criticize me when I say that, but we have things happening that look like they are miracles coming down from God. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So I just want to tell you that I'm starting to feel good. You don't know over the next period of a few days, I guess that's the real test. So we'll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days. I just want to be so thankful for all of the support I've seen, whether it's on television or reading about it. I most of all, appreciate what's been said by the American people, by almost a bipartisan consensus of American people. It's a beautiful thing to see and I very much appreciate it and I won't forget it, I promise you that. I also want to thank the leaders of the world for their condolences and their -- they know what we're going through. They know what, as your leader what I have to go through.

Don't ever leave. Don't even go to the Oval Office, just stay upstairs and enjoy it. Don't see people don't talk to people and just be done with it. And I can't do that. I had to be out front, and this is America. This is the United States. This is the greatest country in the world. This is the most powerful country in the world. I can't be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe and just say, hey, whatever happens, happens. I can't do that.

Melania is really handling it very nicely. As you've probably read, she's slightly younger than me, just a little tiny bit, and therefore just we know the disease. We know the situation with age versus younger people. And Melania is handling it statistically like it's supposed to be handled, and that makes me very happy and it makes the country very happy. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But I'm also doing well, and I think we're going to have a very good result. Again, over the next few days, we're going to probably know for sure. So I just want to thank everybody out there. Everybody all over the world, specifically the United States, the outpouring of love has been incredible. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I will never forget.

That video that President Trump recorded inside Walter Reed that was posted about an hour ago was certainly welcome news for every American because it showed that he at least sounded healthy and it was really important because it came at the end of a very confusing day. It started with the President's doctors coming out delivering that press conference and saying that he was doing very well, but then right after that press conference was over, a senior administration official who the AP later reported to be the White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. He said that, you know, there were some very troubling signs yesterday when President Trump was first brought here to Walter Reed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } He made it sound like it was very touch and go and said that the next 48 hours were going to be critical. He said that we are still not on a clear path to a full recovery. So that sparked a lot of concern, and so then, they have this video from President Trump that certainly was a very reassuring sign to Americans, our allies and our adversaries around the world. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But Jesse, I do want to point out, I mean, President Trump was very frank in that video. He said, look, I wasn't feeling great yesterday. I'm feeling better today. But we're going to have to wait and see what happens over the next few days. He called that the real test. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so President Trump himself signaling that he is fighting with all he has to get through the coronavirus and get back out on the campaign trail. We're just 31 days before Election Day, even though this campaign trail has come to him.

And what I'm looking at, the issue of the fact that this virus can cause inflammation in the lungs and right now, that doesn't seem to be occurring. We can't tell for sure. You'd have to have a CAT scan to know that for sure. I wouldn't even know whether they would be getting one, but I know this: if his oxygen saturation is that good and he is speaking comfortably, it is a good time that he doesn't have major lung inflammation going on right now. The oxygen may have been given at the White House because he was feeling uncomfortable, and that would be normal.",

I came here, I wasn't feeling so well, I feel much better now. We're working hard to get me all the way back, I have to be back because we still have to make America great again. We've done an awfully good job of that, but we still have steps to go and we have to finish that job. And I'll be back -- I think I'll be back soon, and I look forward to finishing up the campaign the way it was started and the way we've been doing, the kind of numbers that we've been doing. We've been so proud of it. But this was something that happened and it's happened to millions of people all over the world, and I'm fighting for them, not just in the U.S., I'm fighting for them all over the world. We're going to beat this coronavirus, or whatever you want to call it and we're going to beat it soundly. So many things have happened. If you look at the therapeutics, which I'm taking right now, some of them and others are coming out soon that are looking like, frankly, they are miracles, if you want to know the truth, they are miracles. People criticize me when I say that, but we have things happening that look like they are miracles coming down from God. So I just want to tell you that I'm starting to feel good. You don't know over the next period of a few days, I guess that's the real test. So we'll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days. I just want to be so thankful for all of the support I've seen, whether it's on television or reading about it. I most of all, appreciate what's been said by the American people, by almost a bipartisan consensus of American people. It's a beautiful thing to see and I very much appreciate it and I won't forget it, I promise you that. I also want to thank the leaders of the world for their condolences and their -- they know what we're going through. They know what, as your leader what I have to go through. But I had no choice because I just didn't want to stay in the White House, I was given that alternative. Stay in the White House, lock yourself in. Don't ever leave. Don't even go to the Oval Office, just stay upstairs and enjoy it. Don't see people don't talk to people and just be done with it. And I can't do that. I had to be out front, and this is America. This is the United States. This is the greatest country in the world. This is the most powerful country in the world. I can't be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe and just say, hey, whatever happens, happens. I can't do that. We have to confront problems. As a leader, you have to confront problems. There's never been a great leader that would have done that. So, that's where it is. I'm doing well. I want to thank everybody. Our First Lady is doing very well, and Melania asked me to say something as to the respect that she has for our country, the love that she has for our country, and we are both doing well. Melania is really handling it very nicely. As you've probably read, she's slightly younger than me, just a little tiny bit, and therefore just we know the disease. We know the situation with age versus younger people. And Melania is handling it statistically like it's supposed to be handled, and that makes me very happy and it makes the country very happy. But I'm also doing well, and I think we're going to have a very good result. Again, over the next few days, we're going to probably know for sure. So I just want to thank everybody out there.

There are dozens and dozens of his supporters lining the street right outside Walter Reed where the President has been for about 24 hours now, a little over 24 hours now. They are waving flags, honking horns, trying to disrupt the presses. They delivered their reports just a little bit, and their message is clear. They're trying to give President Trump the support that he needs to fight through the coronavirus. Now, I'll tell you what. That video that President Trump recorded inside Walter Reed that was posted about an hour ago was certainly welcome news for every American because it showed that he at least sounded healthy and it was really important because it came at the end of a very confusing day. It started with the President's doctors coming out delivering that press conference and saying that he was doing very well, but then right after that press conference was over, a senior administration official who the AP later reported to be the White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. He said that, you know, there were some very troubling signs yesterday when President Trump was first brought here to Walter Reed. He made it sound like it was very touch and go and said that the next 48 hours were going to be critical. He said that we are still not on a clear path to a full recovery. So that sparked a lot of concern, and so then, they have this video from President Trump that certainly was a very reassuring sign to Americans, our allies and our adversaries around the world. But Jesse, I do want to point out, I mean, President Trump was very frank in that video. He said, look, I wasn't feeling great yesterday. I'm feeling better today. But we're going to have to wait and see what happens over the next few days. He called that the real test. And so President Trump himself signaling that he is fighting with all he has to get through the coronavirus and get back out on the campaign trail. We're just 31 days before Election Day, even though this campaign trail has come to him. But even President Trump acknowledging tonight that the real test for him is still ahead -- Jesse."

Let's get right to retired Navy Rear Admiral and former physician for Presidents Obama and Trump, Dr. Ronny Jackson. All right, Doctor. We all saw that video yesterday, and then we just saw the video the President just released, a lot different. So I think that gives Americans a lot of hope. When his physician said this afternoon that there's this seven to 10-day period. At that time, you're really going to know where this COVID is going to go. Is it going to get better or is it going to get worse? Is that your sense of things? We're going to know more then officially."

You know, one of the things we found out about treating this virus over the last few months is that if you interact really early and inject yourself really early in the treatment of this and be aggressive up front, that you can really shorten the course of this. And I think that they've been really aggressive with the President. I think they did the right thing. They took him to Walter Reed where they have all the resources available and they can give him these AVI medications that are given him and they really got all over this just right off the bat. And you know, the reason they do that is because you this infection runs through phases, and it starts off, you get infected and the viral load builds in your body, and then your immune response kicks in, and then a lot of the damage or the issues that you have with the virus down the road are related to the inflammatory response of your body. But if you can use these drugs, like the monoclonal antibody cocktail and the remdesivir, you can reduce the viral load and you can reduce the inflammatory response, which really shortens everything and actually, hopefully can completely prevent the inflammatory part of the illness. So yes, I think that -- you know -- yes."

We've used them in Medicine for many years now. So these particular monoclonal antibodies that they've identified that are really effective against the coronavirus are new, but we've used monoclonal antibodies for a really long time for a variety of issues in Medicine. So the risk associated with that was known to be very low, even though it was technically an experimental drug. So I don't think there was a big risk to the President for doing this.

And the other thing I think we've all got to remember is that Donald Trump has taught the Republicans how to fight. For the first time, Republicans actually are fighting back and we're not fighting back just to get power. We are fighting for our country. We're fighting to make sure this country does not go the way of socialism does not go the way that the leftist wanted to go, where we have mobs running things, burning cities, threatening people who just want to be left alone and live their lives in peace. We are the party of the Emancipation Proclamation, not the emasculation proclamation, and I think a lot of us are doggone proud that Donald Trump has taken the leadership of the party and the country because this country needs strong leadership to fight China, to fight crazy government that's out of control that would actually spy on a presidential candidate.

And look at what this President has done to put our country on the right path moving forward. Now it's our chance over the next few days to fight for him, and let me tell you where the campaign is, in the states of Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, states that we all narrowly lost last time in 2016, we're going to be victorious because of the promises he has made and the promises he has kept. And the people of these states are better because Donald Trump is our President. So right now, we're asking everyone to stand in the breach and fight for President Trump as he has done for us unwavering and 24 hours a day, seven days a week through everything that has been thrown at him, to his administration, we're now going to give us the chance to show the President how grateful we are for the sacrifice he and his family have made to us, and we're going to fight for him for the next 30 days, Jesse.

And we heard this morning from Dr. Conley, that he is not on oxygen currently, and that he has a saturation of 96 percent, which is normal. All of those are good signs.

And what I'm looking at, the issue of the fact that this virus can cause inflammation in the lungs and right now, that doesn't seem to be occurring. We can't tell for sure. You'd have to have a CAT scan to know that for sure. I wouldn't even know whether they would be getting one, but I know this: if his oxygen saturation is that good and he is speaking comfortably, it is a good time that he doesn't have major lung inflammation going on right now.

It's really not going to happen, and then I'll be damned, he does it. That's what's incredible to me is that this that -- that he actually did it. And so, you know, the Chinese Communist Party talking points and their media actually sounds a lot like 90 percent of the media in this country. And I just want to be clear, Jesse, I've been in the White House several times over during this coronavirus pandemic, and it just -- it's so silly, the media, that talks about how they've been loose or lax with the rules. It's hardly that. It's almost impossible to get into the White House, I will tell you that. You have to take a test, you have to sit outside. You're not allowed in until then. So all of this talk, whether it's the Democrats and their mainstream media propaganda arm here in the U.S. or their satellite propaganda arm over in China, one thing is for sure, I can tell you, this President has taken this virus extremely seriously and let's hope for an early and quick recovery."

Joining me now FOX News contributor Marc Thiessen. All right, Marc, in a way this has done something that no one thought possible, and that was humanize President Trump. People are now sympathizing with him. If he can show empathy to his family, to his colleagues, if he can go through something that that millions of Americans have suffered through and do it honestly and come out of it and recover. And it's almost like the symbol of America recovering, the presidential patient, if he can do that and come back strong, I think this can really, really show everybody what he is made of, what the country is made of and we're really hoping for that."

      "utterance": "Agreed a hundred percent, and look, the video he put out today was terrific. He looks more vigorous and clearheaded with COVID than Joe Biden does on a normal day. So you know, that was -- it was a great, great state."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "And Joe Biden says he has not been tested today. He is going to be tested tomorrow. And he said he took down a lot of his negative ads. And I think the Super PAC is still running some negative ads. That was a classy move so far. But you know, I don't think the President has stopped campaigning. You heard at the top, he is already dialing in some strategy. So where do you see things now 30 days out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Well, look, this is a -- I think you're right about the sympathy for the President. I think this humanizes him as you say, and it's also an opportunity for a reset on COVID. Because this is a chance for the White House to really counter one of the Biden campaign's main talking points, which is that the President has not been fully honest or transparent with the American people when it comes to the virus. Whatever you think of that argument, there's a perception out there that that is the case with a lot of Americans. So this is a chance to be a model of transparency and a model of openness about his COVID diagnosis and how this happened. And you know, the President was great in the video today. But as you pointed out, there was a controversy today over whether and when he had oxygen, right? Why is there a controversy about when he had oxygen? You know, the doctor, when he gave his briefing, they kept asking, has he ever been on oxygen? And he said, he is not on it today, like twice. But these are layups. This is not hard. There's nothing wrong with being on oxygen when you've got COVID. So you know, and then you had like the White House Chief of Staff on background, basically saying that things were more serious and what the doctor said."

      "utterance": "Yes, but the more the media puts Trump six feet under, you know, he can come back from this and look like the strongest guy alive and really create a comeback narrative that no one could have ever scripted before. We hope that's the case. We hope he recovers. Really, the fate of his presidency is how he handles the next week or week and a half and we hope he does the best job he can. I'm sure he's got the best doctors in the world making sure you can do that safely. All right, Marc, thank you very much for your insight. We appreciate it."

Here's a former Obama administration official wishing Trump was dead, and comedian Kate Willett wishing the same. Joining me now to discuss, media reporter for \"The Hill,\" Joe concha. I don't even know where to begin. These people are Grim Reapers. I think it's -- I think it's a sign of brain damage if you tweet you hope your own President dies. Disgusting.

It breaks their terms of service and their rules. Of course, it's not going to come down. But what we're seeing, Jesse, is jumping ahead to the worst possible scenarios and conspiracy theories. The type that the people have said that the moon landing was staged looks sane. Let me give you another one from CNN, their national security analyst, quote, \"It is very likely that Russian Intelligence agencies through signal and human Intel sources at Walter Reed have more information about the President's true condition than we do, though. I think we all know how the President is doing. Doctors lie, too,\" she accuses Dr. Sean Conley, the President's doctor for lying. And that means by the way, Jesse, that you're also saying that Doctors, Dooley, Garibaldi, Blaylock, Campbell, Hodgson, Klein, Nasworthy, Lavopa, Carter, Meehan and Shea, now, the 11 doctors that are treating the President are in on this conspiracy, too. Then you had CNN's Jim Acosta just yesterday --"

The conspiracies, these people are crawling out from under rocks saying the most disgusting things imaginable. And you know what? To be honest with you, there are a lot of CNN anchors that were infected by COVID-19. We don't blame people for being infected. This is an invisible enemy that gets people sick. We don't know how the President contracted it. We don't know when. We don't know where. So let's just wait until the information comes out before we start just napalming this guy who's in the hospital in a touch and goes situation. All right, Joe, thank you very much and I'm sorry we had to report that, but we just wanted to just be honest with you about how disgusting some of the President's opponents are. Up next, Last Call."
