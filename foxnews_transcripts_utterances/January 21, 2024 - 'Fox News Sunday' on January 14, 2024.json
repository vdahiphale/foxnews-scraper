Every one of the candidates is saying they're not going to touch it. If you say you're not going to touch it, that means you're going to leave office and everybody is going to have at least a 23 percent benefits cut. The accountant in me is saying, don't wait for that to happen. Get in front of it. So, what we should is America should keep our promises. People should not live in fear. We will go to those like my kids in their 20s and say we're going to raise the retirement age, to reflect life expectancy for you. Instead of cost of living increases, let's do increases based on inflation. So, it's more accurate. Limit benefits on the mega wealthy. They don't want the checks anyway. And let's expand Medicare Advantage plans. Seniors love the competition and it's good for them. When we do that, we'll see what we are dealing with.

Yet they say states can't enforce it and be faithful to the law because the federal government doesn't want to enforce the law. It makes no sense. We're going to have all hands on deck. I've worked with border sheriffs just as governor of Florida in places like Arizona and Texas. Their communities are getting overrun, the State of Texas. So all states and localities will be empowered to enforce federal immigration law. That includes at the border, but it also includes in the interior of our country. If you have criminal aliens, state and local need to be working with federal so that we can deport the people. We need to work to make sure we're deporting illegal aliens, particularly the 8 million that have come in under Biden. So we're going to be working together.

Trump is dominating in Iowa. It looks to me like he -- he is a -- he is the story. Now, he is somewhat below 50 at 49. And I think a good night for Trump is he has to be more than 50. And I think he wants DeSantis in second. A bad night for Trump, less than 50. Nikki Haley in second. And that goes to your point that because if she is there as a challenger going into New Hampshire, where again, the governor has endorsed her, it's a different body in terms of the electorate. I think she has more of a chance. Now, we have not seen Chris Christie endorse her, but I don't see that his voters would go to Trump. I think they would go to her.",

I don't think that he's going to actually pull the trigger on that. But it is being talked about. Warren Davidson said that electing Johnson was the worst decision, worst vote he's ever taken in his, I think, four years of being in Congress. So, the question now is, are they going to attach something to the CR, perhaps some sort of a fiscal cut or something like that might make Johnson look a little bit better. But, here we are again.

First, take care of us, modernize, make sure that we're focused not on the old wars like the generals are now, land, air and sea, but about artificial intelligence, cyber, space, hypersonic missile, submarines. Those are the things we need to focus on going forward. Once we take care of us, our goal is to make sure that they get what they need, not just from us, but from the alliance, in making sure all of our partners that love democracy and freedom, that they're all pulling their weight. This doesn't have to be U.S. only. This has to be a team effort and there are a lot of democracies that want to see Taiwan continue to be free."

It said, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley says the United States absolutely supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and anyone who thinks it doesn't is in error.

What we need to know is Israel as a bright spot in a hot neighborhood. We need to make sure they have whatever they need, whenever they need. We need to make sure we eliminate Hamas and we need to do whatever it takes to bring the hostages home. In order to do that, we need to let Israel do what they need to do to be safe. This is a problem I have with Biden. He goes and says he supports something, but then he wants to control it. That's not what you do. You have to be a friend and that means allow them to make the decisions they want to make. What Israel needs to know is they're not going to have terrorists on their border. What Israel needs to know is they will no longer be a threat coming out of Gaza. That's what they're trying to do. We need to support, not control what's happening in Israel."

They want to eliminate Israel and they don't want Israel to exist. You've got to look at this in reality. It's not in political scenarios. This is a fact that the Palestinians don't want Israel to exist. Israel has come to the table more times than they need to.

Every one of the candidates is saying they're not going to touch it. If you say you're not going to touch it, that means you're going to leave office and everybody is going to have at least a 23 percent benefits cut. The accountant in me is saying, don't wait for that to happen. Get in front of it. So, what we should is America should keep our promises. People should not live in fear. We will go to those like my kids in their 20s and say we're going to raise the retirement age, to reflect life expectancy for you. Instead of cost of living increases, let's do increases based on inflation. So, it's more accurate. Limit benefits on the mega wealthy. They don't want the checks anyway. And let's expand Medicare Advantage plans. Seniors love the competition and it's good for them. When we do that, we'll see what we are dealing with.

We've got a new poll out this morning from \"The Des Moines Register\" that has you in third place. Where do you need to finish on Monday? What's your internal assessment of what you need to have going into New Hampshire to consider this a success, to keep you viable for voters, donors, those who you want, to support you moving forward?"

We've got large numbers of Iowans that have committed to caucus force that are going to show up. You know, they just kind of roll their eyes at these polls, because the idea that you're going to be able to pull a caucus much less a caucus in negative 20. Good luck doing that. And so we've worked very hard over the last six months to go to all 99 counties to build the organization, to get people at their doors committed. And so we're looking forward to it. We've done it the right way. And historically, when you have the energy on the ground, which we do, when you've gone to all 99 counties, when you have the organization, you know, that's what you need to do, to do well in a caucus, but particularly in these conditions, because there's going to be every excuse in the world for someone to say, you know what, maybe I'm not going. Our folks are motivated. They're going. They're on a mission. We've got people, Shannon, from all over the country that have come to in the middle of a blizzard to Iowa, just to make phone calls for us, to knock on doors and tell Iowans why they want to see me be the Republican candidate, the next president. And so what's on the ground is special for us. And we're going to bring it all the way in for Monday. It's going to be good. Tuesday, we're going to be in both South Carolina and New Hampshire. And then, of course, the balance of the week in New Hampshire. We have a debate scheduled on Thursday. I don't know if anyone else has accepted the debate, but I've accepted it."

South Carolina is a big deal. Nevada has a caucus. I'm participating. Donald Trump's participating. Nikki Haley is not even participating in that show. She'll win zero delegates in Nevada.

It's something you've been involved with, obviously, as the governor of Florida, and it's something that you would have to immediately start addressing as president of the United States. In Texas, the governor there has now got national guardsmen blocking U.S. Border Patrol agents from stretches of the Rio Grande. Texas Governor Abbott has said this, \"Texas has the legal authority to control ingress and egress into any geographic location in the state.\" Overnight, there was word that three people reportedly drowned there, and the federal authorities say they were blocked from state officials from helping. Texas authorities say it happened on the Mexican side of the river. 'They did go out to look and assist. They didn't see anybody in trouble. But it exacerbates and highlights tensions there at the border. Would you, as president, would you have governor 'have put national guardsmen and women now in this place where they're at odds with federal Border Patrol agents?"

But here's the great thing about -- about this with me being president, Shannon. It's not going to be an issue because I am going to empower states and localities to enforce federal immigration law. We have this crazy thing where somehow the federal government says it's their sole province to enforce immigration law under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. Yet they say states can't enforce it and be faithful to the law because the federal government doesn't want to enforce the law. It makes no sense. We're going to have all hands on deck. I've worked with border sheriffs just as governor of Florida in places like Arizona and Texas. Their communities are getting overrun, the State of Texas. So all states and localities will be empowered to enforce federal immigration law. That includes at the border, but it also includes in the interior of our country. If you have criminal aliens, state and local need to be working with federal so that we can deport the people. We need to work to make sure we're deporting illegal aliens, particularly the 8 million that have come in under Biden. So we're going to be working together. We're going to hold sanctuary states and sanctuary cities accountable. We're not going to let them thumb their nose in immigration law. But all Texas is trying to do is to be faithful to the law while Joe Biden is not enforcing the law."

In the meantime on the border issue, you were critical yesterday, you said you're sick of Republicans, you see what they're doing right now in Washington with the senators doing some border agreement which is basically caving on everything to the Democrats. We've talked to the negotiators Senator Lankford and others about what's going on. They don't have text yet, so we don't have the contours of this. What's your criticism of what we do know about what's coming together and how in the world, with you as president put together something that could pass this Senate and also the House which has a very different vision and a very small GOP majority for getting something done on the border?"

And I think it would also be a different posture because the federal government, we wouldn't be suing a state. We would be supporting the state. Now on this, you know, I got the details. I think it was on a Fox report where they're going to give work permits for illegal aliens. They're greenlighting more an increase in immigration under some of these things. And it's like, wait a minute, we've had eight million people come illegally. I've been traveling around to these early states, Shannon. I've done town halls. I've taken questions day after day. I've not had one voter, Republican voter, tell me that that is the type of thing that they want to see. They want to see the border taken care of. And yes, there's certain things that you want to work with Congress on. A lot of what can be done, can be done through the executive branch with somebody that wants to be faithful to executing on the border. But to do a quasi-amnesty to essentially green light, pretty much large numbers of people coming in as if that's going to be something we're just going to accept, putting more money into processing illegal aliens, that is not the way you're going to stop this border crisis."

So we've been working hard. We've been doing a great job. I think Monday is going to be the pivot point where now that people start to actually vote, I think it's going to really help change the landscape in terms of some of the narratives that have been there. But there's not been a candidate that's worked harder. There's not been a candidate that's put in more work. And I think particularly here in Iowa, Iowans notice that. Iowans care about it.

Also, we have a lot of snow out on those roads. So we're going to be talking about some really dangerous conditions on the roads. And this is why. Anywhere you see that purple, that is over a foot of snow that's on the ground. We had two storms that went through the State of Iowa this week, Shannon, and dropped a lot of snow. The second one behind it ushered in all of that really cold air. And that's where the problems are with us now. Snow obviously not going anywhere. And with that cold air, we're going to be watching very dangerous conditions on the roads. This is what it feels like right now in the State of Iowa. 48 might below zero is what it feels like right there in Storm Lake. You get the idea that cold is in. I will say, I'll give you one, maybe bright side, Shannon. Today is worse than tomorrow. So tomorrow we see a little bit of an improvement. So right now we've got temperatures in the minus 30s, minus 40s. Go throughout the night tonight, another cool one. But get towards tomorrow morning, we're minus 27 as it feels like temperature in Des Moines. And by tomorrow night, we're talking about temperatures that feel again, maybe in the minus 20s. But I know it sounds awful. Maybe it's a little bit better. It would have been worse had it been today. You get the idea, Shannon, it is still going to be cold and sweet, dangerous. And for those who are going out to caucus, give yourself extra time and pack some extra blankets in the car with you just in case anything were to happen in accident or anything in your car.

That would not give him much going into the next State in New Hampshire where he's not strong to begin with. So that could be the big development coming out of here. And that's what's -- that's what's keeping on. He has a good organization. Everybody believes that. That's always been what it takes.

The question is, now that the Super PAC has been sideline, are they going to be able to execute? The polling shows he's in third.

Trump is dominating in Iowa. It looks to me like he -- he is a -- he is the story. Now, he is somewhat below 50 at 49. And I think a good night for Trump is he has to be more than 50. And I think he wants DeSantis in second. A bad night for Trump, less than 50. Nikki Haley in second. And that goes to your point that because if she is there as a challenger going into New Hampshire, where again, the governor has endorsed her, it's a different body in terms of the electorate.

I think every camp is probably worried. And you started to see over the weekend, former President Trump started to tweet some attacks against Vivek Ramaswamy and the possible MAGA votes that he might be taking away from the former president. He's obviously been trying to tell everybody don't look at the polls, get out there. Make sure that you don't get too cocky and don't get too confident with this because I need you.

Obviously, this was this thing that pushed over the Biden impeachment inquiry. They didn't really have the votes. And then he came out the first time on Capitol Hill and did his speech, and it really united Republicans to pass the impeachment. So it's just -- I think it's going to go through and then it goes to the DOJ, and then it puts even more scrutiny on the DOJ as to what they do next."

And that was Oliver North, who was a Reagan -- top Reagan aide. And he was summoned to testify before the Iran-Contra Committee in 1987. And he stalled and stalled, and eventually they had to take him without a deposition, which is what Hunter Biden is demanding. But that committee had an expiration date, so he stalled long enough so they didn't have time to do both. That worked. That's not true of this committee. And, you know, someone -- I've read a lot of stuff about the legal strategy involved in what he's trying to do. I can't figure it out. It makes -- it seems to me that it's crazy."

When you have over 40% of the electorals in that state that are registered as no party affiliation, it's kind of hard to get an idea of where they're going and the controls. So that was the best place for me to have a conversation and find out what they're thinking and what they're looking for. They feel homeless and helpless. They don't believe that the Democratic or Republican Party as of today that have gone to the extremes really represents who they are and are looking for that. So we had a good dialogue. Americans together is what we're proposing. And my daughter Heather and I have been working on that. She's been the force of this and trying to give a voice to the voiceless.

I've been working with them for many, many years and they are -- they gave a venue for disgruntled Democrats and Republicans that felt that they weren't being heard and they wanted to work together and that's been what I've been a part of. This is not \"No Labels.\" This is Americans together trying to give a voice for those people and how they are able to participate better whether it be on a primary, changing the primary process to a majority, so more people have an opportunity to participate. And also breaking down this horrific gerrymandering situation that we have when you have about 380 or 390 districts in America a congressional district out of 435 that are already cooked.

This is the most dangerous situation we have. It's a crisis at the border. Anybody that tells you different is wrong. They're misleading you. I've been there. It is a crisis. It's dangerous for our country. It must be stopped and shut down. But we have a tremendous amount of people who have already been turned loose in this country. Don't you think? If we can shut it down and stop what's going on in the border, so forget about trying to attract more here, they're not going to get in. I think the parole system - -"

Stop that. And then what you have here, we have to adjudicate the people that have already been turned loose. Let's start around, you know, gathering that up and adjudicating to find out if they qualify for the asylum that they claimed. But they should be able to work and pay for themselves while they're here, until we make a decision whether they're supposed to be here legally or not or be exported back out, deported back out.

We are back now with our panel. I mean, Juan, you've been in Washington for a long time. You've covered like - a cabinet secretary in ICU, and the commander in chief doesn't know for days.

Everyone in the administration has said he's made a mistake. He's now being reviewed, on internal review by the Defense Department, for having made a mistake. But I will say this, and I think the men in your audience, the older men in your audience might relate, that the secretary's a very private person and he has had prostate cancer and he thought he could handle this quietly over the holidays. Didn't happen. Got an infection. Had to be taken back to the hospital and remains in the hospital. So, the mistake was that he thought he could deal with this quickly and quietly. Not happening. The White House is now sending a message saying that he was able to order one of the attacks on the Houthis from the hospital. So, they're - they're signaling their supporting for him. But, Shannon, in all honesty, I think we'll see where his health stands in a few weeks and that may determine whether he remains."

And your number two, who's in charge of the Defense Department, is vacationing on a beach in - in Puerto Rico. This is a disaster. I'm with David French, columnist for \"The New York Times.\" The guy who is in charge of the chain of command of the U.S. Department of Defense violated the rules of the chain of command. He did not tell his commander in chief what was going on. And he held a vital job. It's time for him to go."

I've had the kind of infection that Lloyd Austin had. And most cases, you know, you get a round of antibiotics and you're done with it. Obviously, this was much more serious in his particular case. But we're speculating about that because we still haven't had any kind of a briefing about, you know, what was wrong, what the prognosis is or any of the rest of it. So -- other than knowing that he had prostate cancer and got an infection, that's about all we know. And he's still in the hospital."

But also in Washington we got news over the last 48 hours or so that it looks like, Aishah, a continuing resolution deal is coming together. So, once again, we're kicking the can now into March. We're going to be halfway through the fiscal year before they ever, we hope, get around to actually passing appropriations bills."

So, we could be talking about this again here soon. Leader Schumer says there's going to be bill text coming out later today. Look, there is widespread discontent among House Republicans. And that is a big problem for the speaker. I caught up with Chip Roy here in Iowa while he was stumping for Ron DeSantis, and he said he would not take motion to vacate the speaker off the table. I don't think that he's going to actually pull the trigger on that. But it is being talked about. Warren Davidson said that electing Johnson was the worst decision, worst vote he's ever taken in his, I think, four years of being in Congress. So, the question now is, are they going to attach something to the CR, perhaps some sort of a fiscal cut or something like that might make Johnson look a little bit better. But, here we are again. We're just kicking the can again. And - and this is not what they were elected for. I mean this is not what they won the majority. This was not the mandate. So, yes."
