The people like Mayor Bowser or Gavin Newsom in California as the governor, they've never been afraid of this in the way that they are pushing it on everybody else and acting like everybody needs to be terrified about it. And I think the question is, why not? Because if it's as serious as they are saying where they are trying to regulate every aspect of their lives, you would think that they would also be taking it seriously, but they have not been taking it seriously. Over the weekend, it was more important for her to go and hang out with Dave Chappelle and to be at this wedding. And then they go after the reporter who was there and say that she wasn't invited and how dare she report the news. So, when there are big decisions being made by the CDC director, by the White House talking about mandates when you had one of the White House's top COVID advisors today who is from the University of Minnesota saying that the masks that we're wearing, the non-N95 masks aren't working to slow the spread. Well, when they put this government mandates in place and they encourage small businesses or corporations to do the same, you are affecting people's lives, you're affecting their livelihood, you're affecting kids' ability to go back to school and have social interaction with each other. And so, I think it's a bigger question of, why are they acting like everybody needs to panic and possibly locked down again and do all these things when they are not doing them and they're implementing rules that none of them are affected by it? They're not affected -- you know, the people going to Barack Obama's birthday party aren't affected by these rules. They can fly on their private jet. They can have things delivered. All the people who are mandating these issues skirt the rules or they aren't affecting by them, and it affects real people.",

And so this money should be used more effectively and states need to figure out who these folks are and get to them. We know -- the Census Bureau seems to be able to find these people because according to the Census Bureau, there are about 3.6 million folks that will be impacted when this moratorium goes away. So, this is about government working for the people. And I think the government needs to do a better job both state, federal and local government working for people.

So, when there is a surge in crime, the instinct is to go after the criminal if your common sense, but instead, they talk about creating more laws for gun crime, for basically laws that would be followed by the law- abiding.

      "utterance": "Yes, they are meeting those goals but I think when you look at the way that people's lives are being controlled and these big questions about kids going back to school and the teachers unions demanding that kids be massed, the panic pushers on COVID are not afraid of COVID come apparently. The people like Mayor Bowser or Gavin Newsom in California as the governor, they've never been afraid of this in the way that they are pushing it on everybody else and acting like everybody needs to be terrified about it. And I think the question is, why not? Because if it's as serious as they are saying where they are trying to regulate every aspect of their lives, you would think that they would also be taking it seriously, but they have not been taking it seriously. Over the weekend, it was more important for her to go and hang out with Dave Chappelle and to be at this wedding. And then they go after the reporter who was there and say that she wasn't invited and how dare she report the news. So, when there are big decisions being made by the CDC director, by the White House talking about mandates when you had one of the White House's top COVID advisors today who is from the University of Minnesota saying that the masks that we're wearing, the non-N95 masks aren't working to slow the spread. Well, when they put this government mandates in place and they encourage small businesses or corporations to do the same, you are affecting people's lives, you're affecting their livelihood, you're affecting kids' ability to go back to school and have social interaction with each other. And so, I think it's a bigger question of, why are they acting like everybody needs to panic and possibly locked down again and do all these things when they are not doing them and they're implementing rules that none of them are affected by it? They're not affected -- you know, the people going to Barack Obama's birthday party aren't affected by these rules. They can fly on their private jet. They can have things delivered. All the people who are mandating these issues skirt the rules or they aren't affecting by them, and it affects real people."

If we can just get them into some kind of routine of physical fitness or perhaps something like -- it's not like I would call the activist Olympics and just let them -- I think it would be beautiful. Now your point is, you know, we have athletes making political points. This is a political show. I should be able to make comments about athletes.

Now in this case the federal taxpayer gives $49.6 billion to the states and they can't figure out how to get this money out, they sat on it. In New York $2.7 billion and then the Democrats turned around and said actually the landlords are to blame. The landlords you're the one should apply for this money. I think this is absolute incompetence at the federal level. I think that they actually, I think Nancy Pelosi knows that this moratorium needs to end. But hear me out just one less thing. If they pass the moratorium for another four to five months, where does that put you? Christmas. Do you think anybody is going to want eviction notices going out at Christmas?

      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a balanced approach here. Because I think Dana points out of good point. In the American rescue plan there is about $50 billion of money that is set aside to deal with the fact that there are both the landlords who behind in their mortgages because there's renters they can't find jobs or renters who can't work for various reasons because kids aren't on the school, what have you. And so this money should be used more effectively and states need to figure out who these folks are and get to them. We know -- the Census Bureau seems to be able to find these people because according to the Census Bureau, there are about 3.6 million folks that will be impacted when this moratorium goes away. So, this is about government working for the people. And I think the government needs to do a better job both state, federal and local government working for people. And I appreciate Cory Bush for sleeping on the steps of the Capitol just because we are having a conversation about this issue. And now we're saying, but wait a minute, where did the $50 billion go? and how can the $50 billion get to get to the -- get to the right people, which is what the White House was trying to say? Where is this money and why hasn't it got to the people when we've already allocated it, Congress has passed it? So, how are we not getting this money to landlords and renters so they could begin to pay this money so they can stay in their homes and not be evicted because we don't need more homeless people on the streets?"

I mean, you defund the police in dangerous situations, you don't put criminals in jail, people want to protect themselves and their families, and therefore eight million new people went out last year to purchase firearms. And unfortunately, for the gun control left, it's not the people they want it to be. It's minorities and women who are buying guns to defend themselves in places all over the country. So, if there's a shortage because we have eight million new people who are buying -- say you buy just 200 rounds for one day at the range, which is not a lot, that's hundreds of billions of rounds of ammo.

The second was, they missed trust law enforcement to serve them well, so they decided to put the protection in their own hands.

That creates a legitimate explanation and reason for citizens to arm up and they're solving their problem. And gun control, and I -- this is the fourth time I've said this, is dead. Because if leaders can't get illegal guns off the street, you aren't going to get the legal ones off because you aren't getting -- I mean, in this -- in this climate, it's not happening. Again, horrible crimes are being committed, and the reflex is not to react to the criminal, but to direct action against the law-abiding. You're seeing this now every time.
