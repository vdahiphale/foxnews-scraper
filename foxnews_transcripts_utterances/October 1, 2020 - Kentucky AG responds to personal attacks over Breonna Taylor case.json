If you been watching the news, you know that many of America's most prominent journalists spent the day on the hunt for white supremacists in our midst. They seem highly agitated about that. Why are they so worried? Oh, come on, you know. White supremacist mobs burned our country down. They spent the summer torching buildings and shooting people in Minneapolis, Kenosha, Portland, Seattle, and many other places across the land. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } It was worst domestic terrorism in this country in more than 50 years and white supremacists did it.

Think hard. Why do people lie? Why do you lie? You lie when you're caught doing something you don't want to admit you've done. \"I didn't eat the Oreos, Bobby did.\" You say as you wipe the crumbs from your face.

Most bars have been closed since March and some restaurants managed to survive, thanks to carry-out and delivery orders and the city allowed indoor dining to resume yesterday, but only at 25 percent normal seating capacity. So the Comptroller, Thomas Dinapoli says, \"The industry is challenging under the best of circumstances and many eateries operate on tight margins. Now, they face an unprecedented upheaval that may cause many establishments to close forever.\" How many? The report predicts one-third to one-half of the city's bars and eateries, thousands of businesses could shut down forever costing as many as 150, 000 jobs most held by minorities. This equals potential losses of billions in wages and more than 10 billion in taxable sales. The city has approved extended outdoor dining year-round, but Tucker, how many people are going to want to sit outside in New York City in the dead of winter?",

Well, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention receives billions every year from you. We send the money for a very specific purpose. We believe they do a good job, but you know what the purpose is. The C.D.C. is the federal agency we fund to handle public health emergencies, like the one we're living through, the coronavirus pandemic. So how are they doing? Tonight, we have some details on how they are doing. According to a senior and highly knowledgeable source that we spoke to, many senior C.D.C. scientists and analysts are refusing to go to work. They've been ordered to go to the office, they won't. It doesn't seem like anyone has reported on this, but it is happening. So, what are they doing from home? Well some have decided to become political activists, spinning media outlets for political effect. On Monday for example, \"The New York Times\" published a piece setting government official complaining about the White House oversight of the C.D.C. The White House, of course does oversee the C.D.C. It is part of the administration it always has been. Apparently, the White House asked the C.D.C. to release data on the mental health cost of the coronavirus lockdowns. That's a completely fair question. Those costs obviously have been profound. The White House also asked the C.D.C. to incorporate data on coronavirus deaths among people under the age of 18. Again, a totally fair question that the public has a right to know the answer to. The C.D.C. apparently thought this was an outrageous request. Releasing scientific data to the public, no way. That could hurt the Biden campaign. They wanted instead to hide data showing that children are not actually dying from this virus because the more afraid you are ahead of the election, the better. What happened on Monday was not unusual. Back in May, the C.D.C. produced draft guidance on restrictions of religious services. That guidance was rejected by officials in Washington including the director of the C.D.C., Robert Redfield. Officials agreed on a new version that was less restrictive of religious services in part because, oh yes, the First Amendment. But someone at the C.D.C. just went ahead and published the original unapproved document online anyway. When this was discovered, the employee said, well, it was entirely within bounds to publish incorrect guidance. That person wasn't punished. No one was punished. We're told something similar happened last week when the C.D.C. posted and then retracted an alert on coronavirus transmission. These weren't mistakes, although that's how the media reported them. They were deliberate attempts to sabotage the oversight of elected officials of the C.D.C. for political effect, for the benefit of one political party. The people responsible for this shouldn't be working from home, they shouldn't be working anywhere in the Federal government. Period. There's a pandemic going on and this is what you're doing? We'll continue to monitor the story. Up next, we'll speak to someone who has just written a highly detailed book about what's actually happening inside Google, Facebook and Twitter, the most powerful companies in the world. They're working to change the election results. We'll show you how they're doing it, next.",

If you been watching the news, you know that many of America's most prominent journalists spent the day on the hunt for white supremacists in our midst. They seem highly agitated about that. Why are they so worried? Oh, come on, you know. White supremacist mobs burned our country down. They spent the summer torching buildings and shooting people in Minneapolis, Kenosha, Portland, Seattle, and many other places across the land. It was worst domestic terrorism in this country in more than 50 years and white supremacists did it. We better find them. Check under the bed. Just kidding. That was a joke, obviously. Though not every reporter in Washington got it. Some of them actually believe their own propaganda. They are too dumb to operate an easy pass, but they are telling you the news. It's a problem. Let's hope that when this revolution finally does end, someone fixes our newsrooms. In the meantime though, take a comment to consider why their bosses are demanding they tell you something that is so obviously dishonest. Think hard. Why do people lie? Why do you lie? You lie when you're caught doing something you don't want to admit you've done. \"I didn't eat the Oreos, Bobby did.\" You say as you wipe the crumbs from your face. You lie to divert attention from your own crimes. That's what's happening, here. This summer, a political organization aligned very closely with the Democratic Party wrecked our cities.

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's reparations. Cleaning out the Nike store. So no matter what they tell you, and they are telling you a lot of things, BLM is not a mainstream organization. Just five years ago, the Democratic Party acknowledged that. In the fall 2015, in an internal memo to House candidates, a senior Democratic Party official described the BLM as a quote, \"a radical movement.\" And for a reason. That July, dozens of BLM activists stormed the stage at a Bernie Sanders event. They chanted, slogans like, \"If I die in police custody, burn everything down.\" The next month, another BLM group stormed another Sanders rally. They seized his microphone and denounced the attendees as racists and white supremacists. You may remember it. It seemed scary at the time, including to Democrats. They asked why Sanders didn't have Secret Service protection. These people were so extreme, they regarded Bernie Sanders of Vermont as a Nazi. So the Democrats understood there was no reasoning with them. There wasn't a point. Now, the Democratic Party embraces BLM. Democrats incorporated BLM talking points directly into their party platform this summer. You didn't hear much about that in news coverages of the convention, just like you probably didn't hear anything about Kamala Harris's speech at the NAACP this Friday. The media just didn't have time to tell you about it. There were too many of those rioting white supremacists to hunt down, and that's a shame because should know a lot more about Kamala Harris. A lot more. Kamala Harris 22 years younger than Joe Biden is. So if Joe Biden wins next month, at some point, possibly sooner than we expect, Kamala Harris will control the White House, the Federal government. And that is a concern because very few people in the Democratic Party, certainly at her level, have pushed BLM's message more aggressively than Kamala Harris has. Here she was on Friday."

      "utterance": "Particularly, when they have to -- they are vilifying the police and as a consequence, the people who are suffering most in this struggle are the people who they claim to represent and seeking justice. Low income blacks in these communities are the ones. If I were the Vice President, what I would do instead is first of all, stop the money going to Black Lives Matter. Have these corporations investing in rioting, investing in murder and looting because the more they do it, and what they also should stop doing is vilifying the police, because the more the police are vilified about patrolling aggressively in these black neighborhoods, the higher the murder rate goes up. Also, if police resources are drained off by hailing rioters downtown, that's very dangerous for people in those communities. And also, what we've got to stop doing is black children are dying in record numbers on our streets and in the classrooms, they are dying intellectually by admitting these negative messages about hating their country, that they live in a country that hates them. So what we are doing at the Woodson Center is that we are reaching out to communities and identifying people like the Alliance of Concerned Men and these are black men who are in those same zip codes who have the trust and confidence of the people, and they are creating islands of peace. Also, another group that needs to be in power is the hundreds and hundreds of mothers -- black mothers who are suffering these losses, and they are coming to us and saying, we want a voice. We are utterly opposed to elimination or reducing police. We want the police to cooperate with us in the protection of them. So Tucker, what we've gotten to do is we really have got to shift the paradigm and recognize that people should be agents of their own uplift. Instead, we are investing in people who are destroying our cities. And there is no such thing as institutional racism. The people who use that as an excuse and presents that as a problem, they need to be challenged to answer, tell me what institutional racism looks like. What is your remedy? And how would that remedy save lives in these communities, some of those black mothers, I know one who has lost all four of her sons before the age of 30. There's a study that says 30 percent of these black mothers even die within three years because of the grief that they suffered. But they are silent sufferers, and we need to put them at the center of our solution, and listen and support to them, and learn from these neighborhood healing agents what should be done, and stop the hustle."

Yes or no? Do you believe that we should give statehood to Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico? Again, these are all schemes to basically lead to one-party rule, of course Democrats thinking it would be them. I would ask her, too, do you really believe we should decriminalize all illegal border crossings? Which is de facto open border. And do you really think that it is a good idea to give healthcare to illegal immigrants? And I would also try to pin her down on, do you believe in the Green New Deal in its entirety? Because we know it is coercive socialism. Green New Deal is coercive socialism. It will only be implemented in its entirety through coercion. There is another term for coercive socialism, it's called communism. So I would start there, but I've got a few more ideas that he just needs to keep pounding to again illustrate, you know, again, she was bailing out the rioters and the looters up in Minneapolis this summer. Actually, actively raising money to bail them out of jail, and then I would conclude, at least, will you renounce Antifa and to the Marxist BLM in all of its destructive ways? Put her on the mark, and do not let her off of it. Completely pin her down and get her to either deny or accept all of those points and then move on."

So if you're going up against someone in a political race, you look at the polling and you say, well, these people has positions that are very unpopular with the public, why not let them know this person has these positions? Instead, day after day, I see these idiotic messages from the Trump campaign attacking Joe Biden because he voted for the Crime Bill that actually most people like. So why don't they ever mention that these people want to add Puerto Rico and D.C. to the union and pack the Supreme Court. This is like obvious stuff."

Anytime you have a 70 percent issue, that's a winning issue, and it really does highlight how radical she is. Again, I think I'm stating the obvious.

But Tucker, you and I both know, the Constitution for them is kind of a series of suggestions that they can choose to either accept or reject as they so choose. This is all in the pursuit of power, political power to implement their far left agenda. You get two more liberal senators from D.C., two more liberal senators from Puerto Rico, all of a sudden, and then you remove the legislative filibuster -- that's another thing that Pence should push her on. Do you think it's a good idea to remove the legislative filibuster from the U.S. Senate, which would again destroy any minority rights in that body? That is shameful that they are even talking about that."

The indictment accused him of endangering others for returning fire. A police officer had been shot when he did that. After that verdict came down, a BLM sympathizer apparently shot two police officers in Louisville. One of those officers, Major Aubrey Gregory called for calm on Wednesday saying quote, \"Hate and violence progresses nothing.\" That's demonstrably true, but BLM's leaders and the news media apparently disagree with that message. They've decided to claim that the Attorney General of Kentucky, Daniel Cameron has somehow betrayed the black community. Kind of a shocking accusation, but they said it.

It is repugnant. It is so disappointing, but it's par for the course. Anytime someone stands for the truth and when that truth is different from a narrative that has been pushed by others, this is how they respond and if you look at my social media, you'll see countless folks who have made similar statements and comments. But I'm here tonight to say that enough is enough and that black Republicans, folks that believe in the truth, that we're going to stand up and that's what I did in presenting all of the information to the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor investigation.

Look, I've taken to calling this a conspiracy theory. In order to believe this narrative that's being promoted by a defense attorney in Louisville, Kentucky, you have to believe one to defy Physics and disregard the trajectory analysis, but you have to believe that the officer that was standing outside of the apartment shooting into the apartment that he had a magic bullet and that that bullet went through the apartment unit and then made a sharp turn left without any obstruction or any impediment to match it up with the entry point of the wound that Sergeant Mattingly suffered. It is a silly notion. It's one of the biggest myths that has been promoted here in the last few weeks. Before three weeks ago and before this defense attorney uttered this statement, it was a foregone conclusion that what happened that evening was that Kenny Walker, Breonna Taylor's boyfriend fired a shot at the officers. The officers responded and returned fire, justified in doing so because they had been fired upon and the tragedy -- And again, I've said this from the very beginning. The tragedy here is that Breonna Taylor was in that hallway as well and was hit."

They made conclusions first and then want to cherry pick the facts to meet those conclusions. I don't have that luxury as the Attorney General here in the Commonwealth. My responsibility is to the truth and to the information and then that is ultimately what leads to the conclusion. We presented all of the information to the grand jury. Ultimately, we presented to them as well the fact that the officers, Mattingly and Cosgrove were fired upon and they were justified in returning their fire. We obviously have a prosecution into a third officer that was there that night. I can't get into the specifics because that is an ongoing prosecution.

Most bars have been closed since March and some restaurants managed to survive, thanks to carry-out and delivery orders and the city allowed indoor dining to resume yesterday, but only at 25 percent normal seating capacity. So the Comptroller, Thomas Dinapoli says, \"The industry is challenging under the best of circumstances and many eateries operate on tight margins. Now, they face an unprecedented upheaval that may cause many establishments to close forever.\" How many? The report predicts one-third to one-half of the city's bars and eateries, thousands of businesses could shut down forever costing as many as 150, 000 jobs most held by minorities. This equals potential losses of billions in wages and more than 10 billion in taxable sales.

Now we can spread out and look, my business is lucky enough that we have a great landlord and we have a great sidewalk. We just put in a new beautiful sidewalk garden.

Well, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention receives billions every year from you. We send the money for a very specific purpose. We believe they do a good job, but you know what the purpose is. The C.D.C. is the federal agency we fund to handle public health emergencies, like the one we're living through, the coronavirus pandemic. So how are they doing? Tonight, we have some details on how they are doing. According to a senior and highly knowledgeable source that we spoke to, many senior C.D.C. scientists and analysts are refusing to go to work. They've been ordered to go to the office, they won't. It doesn't seem like anyone has reported on this, but it is happening. So, what are they doing from home? Well some have decided to become political activists, spinning media outlets for political effect. On Monday for example, \"The New York Times\" published a piece setting government official complaining about the White House oversight of the C.D.C. The White House, of course does oversee the C.D.C. It is part of the administration it always has been. Apparently, the White House asked the C.D.C. to release data on the mental health cost of the coronavirus lockdowns. That's a completely fair question. Those costs obviously have been profound. The White House also asked the C.D.C. to incorporate data on coronavirus deaths among people under the age of 18. Again, a totally fair question that the public has a right to know the answer to. The C.D.C. apparently thought this was an outrageous request. Releasing scientific data to the public, no way. That could hurt the Biden campaign. They wanted instead to hide data showing that children are not actually dying from this virus because the more afraid you are ahead of the election, the better. What happened on Monday was not unusual. Back in May, the C.D.C. produced draft guidance on restrictions of religious services. That guidance was rejected by officials in Washington including the director of the C.D.C., Robert Redfield. Officials agreed on a new version that was less restrictive of religious services in part because, oh yes, the First Amendment. But someone at the C.D.C. just went ahead and published the original unapproved document online anyway. When this was discovered, the employee said, well, it was entirely within bounds to publish incorrect guidance. That person wasn't punished. No one was punished. We're told something similar happened last week when the C.D.C. posted and then retracted an alert on coronavirus transmission. These weren't mistakes, although that's how the media reported them. They were deliberate attempts to sabotage the oversight of elected officials of the C.D.C. for political effect, for the benefit of one political party. The people responsible for this shouldn't be working from home, they shouldn't be working anywhere in the Federal government. Period. There's a pandemic going on and this is what you're doing? We'll continue to monitor the story. Up next, we'll speak to someone who has just written a highly detailed book about what's actually happening inside Google, Facebook and Twitter, the most powerful companies in the world. They're working to change the election results. We'll show you how they're doing it, next."

      "utterance": "\"It's a free country,\" if you're over 40, remember when people used to say that? No one says that anymore. Silicon Valley is a big part of the reason. Tech oligarchs do whatever they can to censor and humiliate anyone who challenges the approved position on all kinds of topics, the coronavirus, and coronavirus lockdowns, mail-in balloting, George Soros, you can't criticize him. You've seen all of that. But what are you not seeing? What are these companies doing internally to affect the way we think and the way we vote? Allum Bokhari has thought a lot about this. He has written a new book on it called, \"Deleted: Big Tech's Battle to Erase the Trump Movement and Steal the Election.\" We're glad to have him on tonight. Thanks for joining us. Congrats on the book. ALLUM BOKHARI, AUTHOR, \"DELETED\": Thanks, Tucker and you know I've been following the activities of these Silicon Valley tech giants for nearly five years now and I have no other way to put it. We're in an era of digital totalitarianism. We've somehow allowed a handful of unaccountable corporations to seize control of political discourse and in the process, seize control of democracy. But you know, you don't have to take this from me, take it from my sources, the people who worked for Google, the people who worked for Twitter and Facebook. These are the people I've interviewed for this book and let me tell you, they are so alarmed by what they have seen inside these Silicon Valley companies that they put their own careers on the line to come forward and warn the American public about what's going on. This is not just about people getting banned. We all know people get banned on social media. That is just the tip of the iceberg. The really terrifying stuff is what's going on behind the scenes and that's what these sources have told me about. I know we're short on time, so I'll focus on just one example that more people need to know about. It's called Machine Learning Fairness."

      "utterance": "I'll tell you what it is briefly. This is Big Tech's attempt to merge the fields of Computer Science on the one hand and Critical Race Theory on the other. Critical Race Theory, Tucker, the same racist ideology that's being rightly purged from the Federal government by President Trump is running rampant in Silicon Valley where it couldn't be more dangerous because these people control the algorithms that are going to control almost every aspect of our lives. You know, they control whose messages are allowed to be seen, whose political movements are allowed to go viral and gain momentum, even whose businesses are going to be successful if you're on the 10th page of Google search and no one will ever find you, and the people who have this awesome power, which by the way affects not just America, but so many other countries around the world, the people who have this power are the same people who think that Ibram Kendi and Robin DiAngelo are the leading intellectual figures of our time. These people are crazy, and they are racists and they're running the technologies that are running our world. That's where we are. That's digital totalitarianism. That's what this book is about."

Normally, it's a chance for candidates to poke fun at each other in person, coronavirus changed all of that. So what happened this evening? We'll tell you straight ahead."

They were together yesterday in Washington and in Minneapolis. No evidence tonight that the President is sick or positive with the coronavirus. Hope Hicks, we are happy to say is fine so far. One of the most decent and kind people in politics. We are of course rooting for her fervently. We will bring you more as we learn it. Well, tonight, as we told you, the President and Joe Biden spoke at the Annual Al Smith dinner. They spoke virtually. Here is part of what happened."

I consider myself to be a Happy Warrior, but it's not so easy at these times.
