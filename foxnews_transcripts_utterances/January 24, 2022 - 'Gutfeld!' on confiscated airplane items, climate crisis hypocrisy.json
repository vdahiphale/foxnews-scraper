Apparently Arnold was involved in a serious four-car pileup this weekend. As you can tell, he was fine. Apparently his pecs acted as his own built-in airbags. But also he was driving the largest vehicle you can find without a caboose, a GMC Yukon. That kind of gets two-wheel revolutions to the gallon. The Yukon is the only truck larger than the place it's named after. If we're any more of a tank Biden would have left it for the Taliban. Now the car that crumbled underneath his Yukon like a housemaid under Arnie is a Prius. The kind of car greenies like Arnold would love you to be driving while he tools around in Battlestar Galactica. But the fact is, if you're in that Yukon, you probably aren't going to go to the hospital, unless it's for a paternity test. But if you're in the Prius, hit by the Yukon, well just hope you're wearing clean underwear. You might even be headed for the morgue, or worse, a roll in jingle all the way to. It's an unfair matchup. I'm trying to think of ones that are worse. That's just unfair. But anyway, it wasn't captured on video. But here's that recreation.",

Just ask any CNN producer. It's also got plenty of room for out of wedlock child seats. But this is Arnold who has been a withering critic of those who don't abide by the climate agenda. He's pushing for a world as natural as his body building career wasn't. And if we don't do something now, we're all complicit. I wonder if he mentioned that to the fellows down to the car dealership, but you gotta hand it to him. He was a quick learner. He was a Republican who's still the Democrats gameplan that as long as you talk to a good game, you could get away with anything. It's on us to talk about climate. You can still fly in private jets. You can still sail on $100 million yachts. You can fill your hot tub with Panda tears and tulle around Brentwood and a vehicle that could house Mitt Romney's entire family. Yes. But they could fit all of them in a Yukon, including the dog on the roof. There's a call back. Now I hope who've ever got injured fully recovers. It's not their fault. They bought a car as sturdy as a big wheel. But the story provides a lesson. Elites like to make rules for other people so they don't have to abide by them. It's why people get into politics. The first thing you do after introducing a law is violate it. We get the Prius and they get the Yukon. Whether you're Gavin Newsom at the French Laundry, or a police defund or hiding behind armed security. The whole point of power is creating a world of a exemptions for yourself. You can see this specially in Liberal bastions, they're the ones that love restrictions most because they figured out how to live above and beyond them either by working in politics or in the media. So in New York, in L.A., in D.C., crime spirals out of control, cops all over the country being shot and killed as innocent women are being randomly murdered by deranged lunatics.

This is a narrative that's both anti-Biden, it's also anti-Democrats who run urban areas. And it goes on and on every hour. I just wanted to give a sampling, Biden administration's a clown car driving off a cliff.

We never accused him of waffling unless it's topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Yes. It's another fat joke. Here's why. Because it's crude and stupid as fat jokes are no insult, is worse than their bad ideas. They joked about violent crime, they actually laughed at the suffering of victims. So you can fix fat, but you can't fix that. Now Stelter is lying, of course, when Trump was President, we were screaming about crime in Portland, Seattle, in New York and elsewhere on every single show. Meanwhile, what was CNN doing?",

Major cities like Philly and New Orleans -- Philly, really -- saw hundreds of them last year and Chicago had more than 1800. It's now the main cause of traffic on Lakeshore Drive. If you're in New York, maybe you're thinking it's safer to take the subway instead of driving, that's only true for homicidal maniacs. NYPD reported more subway assaults in 2021, than any year since 1997. When I was but a teen, modeling, as a matter of fact. And it's no better in Maryland, where homicide is the top cause of unintended death of Baltimore kids. I'm sure their state's attorney will get right on those cases once she's done with her own indictment for spending COVID relief funds on a vacation home. And if in case that home is not located at Baltimore, you win a free bulletproof vest. And let's not forget a point that Tyrus brought up before, intentional killings of cops are at a 20-year high. And even if you exclude the 911 attacks, it would go back even further. So, what are our leaders doing about it? Well, like Michael Loftus, adding another layer of clothing, they're just making it worse. The President is pushing executive orders to restrain cops via police reform bill, he says, will honor the memory of George Floyd.

You can rob somebody with a gun, as long as it's not loaded. You guys know that the victims are going to be able to determine that when you pull the gun on them, because even if you say, oh, that guns not loaded, then they beat you with it. And then well, you know, but it wasn't loaded. So, you took away all the consequences. And you're in instead of being any type of decent, intelligent human being. You blame it on an inanimate object that can't defend itself and you can't prove it or unproven. You won't say there's bad people. And now, literally you can get busted for carjacking, get arrested, get released and carjack right outside the police station to drive home you can literally get and then get arrested again. And they will have to let them go. So yes, it's not guns. It's, it's honestly, these politicians who are unaffected, and it won't be until she has a unarmed gun pointed at her and she will be like, Wow, I really couldn't tell the difference.

An upcoming virtual event, my favorite kind, at Washington University in St. Louis, from the same people who named Kansas City, Missouri -- that's a great joke you have to admit it -- is asking students whether professionalism is a racist construct. But like Nancy Pelosi is face, sometimes I'm positive none of this is real. According to the events description, \"The term professionalism has at times been used to silence and marginalized people of color when attributes of appearance, language or interactions that have nothing to do with the job knowledge or construct, constructive collegial relationships are labeled as unprofessional.\" Jeez, these people should attend an event for run on sentences. That so much word salad it counts as an entree. The Web site also states that professionalism upholds white supremacy, of course, and institutional racist policies and excluding practices.

Now, I get why those things had to go but some other stuff on the list like a wine holder shaped like a gun and a container of bear spray made lets less sense. Funny story, I once mixed up my gun and my wine holder. That's why I'm putting my Sommelier kids through college. All right, peace Sommelier. The officers who took the bear spray are really lucky however that there was a grizzly attack on the plane or else they feel exceptionally bad. Bear spray is like a plunger.

Apparently Arnold was involved in a serious four-car pileup this weekend. As you can tell, he was fine. Apparently his pecs acted as his own built-in airbags. But also he was driving the largest vehicle you can find without a caboose, a GMC Yukon. That kind of gets two-wheel revolutions to the gallon. The Yukon is the only truck larger than the place it's named after. If we're any more of a tank Biden would have left it for the Taliban. Now the car that crumbled underneath his Yukon like a housemaid under Arnie is a Prius. The kind of car greenies like Arnold would love you to be driving while he tools around in Battlestar Galactica. But the fact is, if you're in that Yukon, you probably aren't going to go to the hospital, unless it's for a paternity test. But if you're in the Prius, hit by the Yukon, well just hope you're wearing clean underwear. You might even be headed for the morgue, or worse, a roll in jingle all the way to. It's an unfair matchup. I'm trying to think of ones that are worse. That's just unfair. But anyway, it wasn't captured on video. But here's that recreation."

Just ask any CNN producer. It's also got plenty of room for out of wedlock child seats. But this is Arnold who has been a withering critic of those who don't abide by the climate agenda. He's pushing for a world as natural as his body building career wasn't. And if we don't do something now, we're all complicit. I wonder if he mentioned that to the fellows down to the car dealership, but you gotta hand it to him. He was a quick learner. He was a Republican who's still the Democrats gameplan that as long as you talk to a good game, you could get away with anything. It's on us to talk about climate. You can still fly in private jets. You can still sail on $100 million yachts. You can fill your hot tub with Panda tears and tulle around Brentwood and a vehicle that could house Mitt Romney's entire family. Yes. But they could fit all of them in a Yukon, including the dog on the roof. There's a call back. Now I hope who've ever got injured fully recovers. It's not their fault. They bought a car as sturdy as a big wheel. But the story provides a lesson. Elites like to make rules for other people so they don't have to abide by them. It's why people get into politics. The first thing you do after introducing a law is violate it. We get the Prius and they get the Yukon. Whether you're Gavin Newsom at the French Laundry, or a police defund or hiding behind armed security. The whole point of power is creating a world of a exemptions for yourself. You can see this specially in Liberal bastions, they're the ones that love restrictions most because they figured out how to live above and beyond them either by working in politics or in the media. So in New York, in L.A., in D.C., crime spirals out of control, cops all over the country being shot and killed as innocent women are being randomly murdered by deranged lunatics.

This is a narrative that's both anti-Biden, it's also anti-Democrats who run urban areas. And it goes on and on every hour. I just wanted to give a sampling, Biden administration's a clown car driving off a cliff. It's a great example of the kind of incendiary rhetoric that you would have never seen from another channel, let's say during the Trump years or now during the Biden years."

We never accused him of waffling unless it's topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Yes. It's another fat joke. Here's why. Because it's crude and stupid as fat jokes are no insult, is worse than their bad ideas. They joked about violent crime, they actually laughed at the suffering of victims. So you can fix fat, but you can't fix that. Now Stelter is lying, of course, when Trump was President, we were screaming about crime in Portland, Seattle, in New York and elsewhere on every single show. Meanwhile, what was CNN doing?"

Yes, carjackings are way up since the pandemic hit. That's because the biggest punishment car thieves face is scorn for using fossil fuels. Major cities like Philly and New Orleans -- Philly, really -- saw hundreds of them last year and Chicago had more than 1800. It's now the main cause of traffic on Lakeshore Drive. If you're in New York, maybe you're thinking it's safer to take the subway instead of driving, that's only true for homicidal maniacs. NYPD reported more subway assaults in 2021, than any year since 1997. When I was but a teen, modeling, as a matter of fact. And it's no better in Maryland, where homicide is the top cause of unintended death of Baltimore kids. I'm sure their state's attorney will get right on those cases once she's done with her own indictment for spending COVID relief funds on a vacation home. And if in case that home is not located at Baltimore, you win a free bulletproof vest. And let's not forget a point that Tyrus brought up before, intentional killings of cops are at a 20-year high. And even if you exclude the 911 attacks, it would go back even further. So, what are our leaders doing about it? Well, like Michael Loftus, adding another layer of clothing, they're just making it worse. The President is pushing executive orders to restrain cops via police reform bill, he says, will honor the memory of George Floyd. And the Governor of New York's new illegal gun task force will meet for the first time, the first time, just days after a rookie cop was killed by a stolen firearm. Here's the Governor herself.

You can rob somebody with a gun, as long as it's not loaded. You guys know that the victims are going to be able to determine that when you pull the gun on them, because even if you say, oh, that guns not loaded, then they beat you with it. And then well, you know, but it wasn't loaded. So, you took away all the consequences. And you're in instead of being any type of decent, intelligent human being. You blame it on an inanimate object that can't defend itself and you can't prove it or unproven. You won't say there's bad people. And now, literally you can get busted for carjacking, get arrested, get released and carjack right outside the police station to drive home you can literally get and then get arrested again.

An upcoming virtual event, my favorite kind, at Washington University in St. Louis, from the same people who named Kansas City, Missouri -- that's a great joke you have to admit it -- is asking students whether professionalism is a racist construct. But like Nancy Pelosi is face, sometimes I'm positive none of this is real. According to the events description, \"The term professionalism has at times been used to silence and marginalized people of color when attributes of appearance, language or interactions that have nothing to do with the job knowledge or construct, constructive collegial relationships are labeled as unprofessional.\" Jeez, these people should attend an event for run on sentences.

TSA released a list of items they took from travelers in 2021 including a chainsaw, fireworks, machete and a burrito filled with meth. Finally, a burrito that helps you lose weight. Now, I get why those things had to go but some other stuff on the list like a wine holder shaped like a gun and a container of bear spray made lets less sense. Funny story, I once mixed up my gun and my wine holder. That's why I'm putting my Sommelier kids through college. All right, peace Sommelier. The officers who took the bear spray are really lucky however that there was a grizzly attack on the plane or else they feel exceptionally bad. Bear spray is like a plunger. Don't be without one when you need one. Anyway, airports don't seem to be getting any less crazy in 2022. Just check out what this guy tried to board a plane with over the weekend."
