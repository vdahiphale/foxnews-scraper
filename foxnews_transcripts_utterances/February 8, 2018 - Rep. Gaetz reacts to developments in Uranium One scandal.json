      "sentences": "All right. So, we're going to go slow. What we have been reporting on night after night for over a year now is turning into a scandal bigger than Watergate. And here is why this is all so alarming. All the information we have been telling you about so far is only a sample of what's to come. It's the tip of the iceberg. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, these facts, this evidence will rock the foundation of Washington, D.C. It will make you question how is it possible this could ever happen in the United States of America. It's that serious. And it's why we have been pushing so hard on this program for answers. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, meanwhile, you have the liberal mainstream media, they are supposed to be all about truth, all about transparency, they have been missing in action. They have turned their backs, they are ignoring the biggest story in their lifetimes. Their sole focus has been on delegitimizing and destroying President Trump at every single turn. Now, that's why for over a year, they have been peddling hour after hour fake news conspiracy theories about so-called Trump-Russia collusion. They have nothing to base it on, no evidence whatsoever. And here is what they don't want you to know about the key officials that are involved in this scandal. Let's start with player number one. That, of course, would be Hillary Clinton. Now, remember Donna Brazile in her book, she talked about Hillary rigging the primary against Bernie Sanders. Imagine if that was Donald Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then Clinton tried to build on that idea. She was teaming up with the DNC, they worked through a law firm, they paid over $12 million for that salacious dossier that was filled with Russian lies, Russian propaganda, why? Because they wanted to influence the general election through lies. Clinton also tried to keep this a secret. She went through a law firm, Perkins Coie, which then hired Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS and they paid former British spy, Russian expert Christopher Steele. Now, according to Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, who has been doing a deep dive into all of this, two crimes may have been committed in this instance: 52 U.S. Code 30121, which says it is illegal to make a payment, donation or trade anything of value with the foreign national in connection with any kind of election in America. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, remember, Steele is a former British spy. He was only hired by Fusion GPS once Hillary Clinton started picking up the tab for the Trump opposition research, not before. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Gregg also points out: 52 USC 30101. It makes it a crime to file a false or misleading campaign report. Now, watchdog group, the Campaign Legal Center, they've actually filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing the Clinton campaign and the DNC of violating campaign finance laws and for failing to disclose payments they made for this dossier. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } All right. Next up is disgraced former FBI Director James Comey. Now, he, along with corrupt FBI agent, remember, Peter Strzok, and other top deputies, not rank-and-file, they put the fix in to save Hillary Clinton from prosecution when we know she committed multiple felonies as it relates to the email server scandal. Now, Comey and his lackeys, they ignored incontrovertible evidence about Clinton breaking the law, having secret top-secret special access programming, classified information stored in a mom-and-pop shop bathroom closet, remember, on the server. They also failed to act after Clinton's team deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, then they acid washed, using bleach a bit on the hard drives, and then any devices they had left over, they busted those up with a hammer. And, by the way, the mobile devices, they eventually turned over to the FBI? They were useless. They had no SIM cards in them. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, despite all of this, Comey, Strzok, and others, they crafted an exoneration statement months before ever interviewing Hillary Clinton and 17 other key witnesses in the case. By the way, that's not how law enforcement works. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And then exoneration statement, when describing Clinton's mishandling of classified information, Comey changed the words, the legal standard, gross negligence, which is the legal standard, to extreme carelessness. And they also altered a section that said it was reasonably likely that hostile foreign actors and adversaries of the United States had hacked the server. And they completely removed information about Hillary Clinton emailing President Obama, which means that Obama knew Hillary was breaking the law, or should have known. Now, all of this allowed Hillary Clinton to stay in the presidential race, which obviously they wanted. Then she used the Russian propaganda dossier, why? To lie to the American people. Nobody had verified what was in my dossier, not even Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, again, going back to Gregg Jarrett, according to him, if Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton for political purposes, well, that means he obstructed justice. He should have been seeking the truth. That is only the start of Comey's involvement in this scandal. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And according to the House Intel Committee and their memo, Comey signed off personally on three FISA applications to spy on the Trump campaign, and his FBI lied to the FISA court about the dossier being bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton in the DNC. Oh, excused me, they did have a footnote, it may have some political origins, but they knew Hillary and the DNC paid for it. And Comey's FBI, then they also used that Yahoo News article written by Michael Isikoff about Carter Page. They were corroborating the dossier. Well, here's the problem. They knew the source for the Yahoo story was Christopher Steele, and FBI never independently verify the information, nor did Fusion GPS because Steele was their only source. And by the way, from there, it only gets worse. According to the Grassley-Graham memo, the bulk -- let me repeat -- the bulk of their applications to the FISA court, the FBI put before a judge, consisted -- the bulk of it -- the phony dossier, the Hillary Clinton phony dossier. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In March of 2017, Comey told Congress that he didn't bother collaborating or corroborating the dossier because the FBI felt Christopher Steele was credible. Really? You don't have to corroborate these things? And Comey also testified under oath that the same dossier that he use to get the FISA warrant was, quote, salacious and unverified. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And Comey also told the president-elect the same thing in January 2016 but it was just a couple of months earlier the dossier was used to get a warrant. Did he tell the FISA judge that it's unverified? Did he tell the FISA judge any of this information? No, he did not. OK, that is guilt by omission, purposely omitting information that likely would have had a big impact on that judge. All right. Player number three tonight, former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Now, the GOP House memo, that details how McCabe testified without the dossier, the FISA warrant to surveil would never have been approved. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, McCabe is also tied to the Clinton email cover up. Remember the recent reports? Andrew McCabe was forced to resign over revelations in the soon to be released DOJ inspector general report, and we are told, all about the Clinton email investigation. And The Wall Street Journal is reporting that McCabe and other top FBI officials, remember, they also knew about Huma Abedin's emails that were found on Anthony Weiner's laptop. They knew about them in September of 2016. Important information. But they waited at least a month before they told Congress? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And we can't forget McCabe's wife. She got $700,000 on astronomical amount of money for a failed Senate run in the Commonwealth of Virginia from a group tied to Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe and from the Virginia Democratic Party. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, McCabe eventually had to recuse himself from the Clinton email investigation. Was it because he got caught or because he thought it was the right thing to do? You got two key allies of Andrew McCabe. Now, they are corrupt. They are the Trump bashing FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. They are players number four and five. Page actually served as the legal counsel to McCabe. As for Strzok, like we have been telling you, he is at the epicenter of the scandal, every scandal, every issue that we have been talking about the last year and a half. Now, Strzok is a former top FBI counterintelligence official. He is the one that signed the documents that kickoff think this phony Russia probe. He also oversaw the interviews of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. He is the guy who interviewed Hillary Clinton and her top aides. We have already told you how Strzok played a key role in changing the Clinton exoneration statement. Remember they were changing gross negligence to extreme carelessness. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then there is Strzok and Page's extreme hatred of Donald Trump. Remember in text messages, they called him an idiot, a menace, loathsome human being. They said if Trump and Clinton wanted to win 100 million to zero. And Strzok and Page also talked with who we think is Andrew McCabe about that insurance policy? Oh, God forbid Donald Trump wins the election? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And yesterday, we got a new batch of text messages that show their inherent anti-Trump bias in the lead up, of course, to the election. Lisa Page was fearful, \"Oh my gosh, Donald Trump is going to win.\" On Election Day, Strzok writes back, \"Oh my god. This is (blanking) terrifying.\" And the following day, he says, \"Oh my God, I'm so depressed.\" And a couple of days later, Lisa Page writes: \"Well, I bought 'All the President's Men,' figure I need to brush up on Watergate,\" the insurance people. Then later, Page sends a message that reads: \"God, being here makes me angry. Lots of highfalutin' national security talk\". And, \"Meanwhile, we have our task ahead of us.\" I wonder if that's tied to the insurance policy? What does Page mean by task? When you put all of this together, with the insurance policy text, it raises serious, serious red flags. Now, these love birds also messaged back and forth about special counsel Robert Mueller. Remember, they had five months of missing texts? Well, right after Robert Mueller was appointed on May 19, two days after the appointment, Strzok was debating about joining the investigation. Strzok asked his lover Page, \"An investigation leading to impeachment?\" if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, even before Mueller's probe, even before it got started, Strzok and Page were talking about impeaching President Obama. Now, this part is very important. During the same back and forth, Strzok texts, \"Well you and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely, I would be there no question\" -- meaning with Mueller, \"I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern there's no big there there.\" Pretty stunning admission. Now, Strzok helped start the Russia investigation but he thought there was no there there. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Also, directly wrapped up in all of this is the demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie. They are players six and seven in this game if you want to call it a game of corruption. Bruce Ohr, he was reprimanded at the DOJ after it was discovered he was meeting with Fusion GPS both before and after the election. Ohr's office, remember, just four doors down from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. His wife Nellie Ohr, she worked at Fusion GPS. And, by the way, her job: focusing in on the anti-Trump dossier. And according to the Nunes memo, Bruce Ohr told investigators that he had a close relationship with the dossier author Christopher Steele. And Bruce Ohr said that Steele said he was \"desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.\" Pretty amazing. You couldn't write this in a novel. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now we turn our attention to the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. She's player number eight in all of this. And according to testimony from former Director James Comey, Lynch instructed the FBI to refer to their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton as a matter. Don't call it an investigation, don't call it what it really is. And then it got worse. In June of 2016, while the FBI so-called independent investigation is ongoing, Bill Clinton is meeting with Loretta Lynch in Phoenix on a tarmac for 40 minutes. Lynch said the meeting was about grandchildren and golf. But this is on July 1. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, the former AG announced that she was stepping away from the investigation after this and she just accepts the FBI's conclusion. Now, keep in mind, this all took place before Hillary Clinton was interviewed on the Fourth of July weekend by the FBI and exonerated the next business day. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And after Lynch announced that she was taking a backseat to the Clinton investigation, Strzok literally texts Page and says, \"Timing looks like hell,\" Page replies, \"Yes, awful timing,\" and then adds, oh, \"It's a real profile in courage,\" talking about Lynch since she knows no charges will be brought. Now, four days later, Comey holds his press conference where he infamously announces the FBI is not recommending charges against Clinton after thirteen and a half minutes of laying out a pretty damning case against Hillary. The Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he is also a player in all of this, this ongoing FISA scandal. We'll call him player number nine tonight. Now, first and foremost, Rosenstein, he oversees the entire Russia investigation. He was the official responsible for appointing Robert Mueller as a special counsel. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We'll have more on Mueller in a minute. But, first, we know that it was Rosenstein who signed off on one of the applications to extend the FISA warrant against the Trump campaign. And then you have President Obama, oh, yes, what about him? We will call him player number 10 tonight. If Russia interfering in our election was so troubling, why didn't the Obama administration say something prior to the election? We now have an NBC News report, the Obama White House wasn't too worried about it because, quote: \"they thought that Hillary was going to win.\" Well, what does that tell you, if Hillary wins it's OK? And then the cherry on top is Robert Mueller. We'll call him player number 11 tonight. Now, the special counsel heading up the Russia investigation, we know that Mueller hired an extremely -- I mean extremely -- partisan team filled with individuals who had given over 50 grand but only to Democrats. No money to Donald Trump. We know who they gave money to. Let's see, Obama, Clinton and the DNC. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We also know Mueller is best friends, BFF with James Comey. We know that he interviewed with Trump to be the next FBI director. And the day before he was appointed special counsel is when that interview took place. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, it's all very suspicious. And those are just the main key players in all of this. It gets complicated, but I want to make sure everybody is understanding this because as we move forward, I would guarantee almost at this point there is going to be massive investigations and I would not at all be surprised people will be going to jail, people will be indicted. Joining us now, author, attorney, David Limbaugh, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, former chairman of the House Oversight, FOX News contributor, Jason Chaffetz. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Thank you, A, Gregg for all your help in all of this with the law.

Meanwhile, you mentioned Mark Warner, he has been leading one the probes of President Trump's ties to Russia.

Warner texted he would, quote, rather not have a paper trail in case he could not seal an agreement with the former British spy. Steele has not agreed with an interview with the panel. He began texting this panelist, Warner did, Adam Waldman, February 2017 about getting testimony from Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who had his visa rebuked by the State Department in 2006 because of charges he has ties to organized crime in Russia. Warner wanted to connect directly with Steele though without anyone else being in the loop, at least initially. Quote, we have so much to discuss. You need to be careful, Warner texted, but we can help our country. Waldman texted back early last year: I'm in. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Waldman, we should note, runs a firm here in Washington which has ties to Hillary Clinton. Waldman noted that Steele was concerned about media leak. So, Warren texted back, quote, we want to do this right, private in London. Don't want to send letter yet because if we can't get agreement would rather not have paper trail. That's from Mark Warner. Now, the Intelligence Committee got these texts from Waldman last September I'm told and Warner aide acknowledged Warner and Richard Burr, the Republican chairman, revealed these texts to their colleagues back then in October because, quote: they realized out of context, it doesn't look great. But Warner and Burr gave me an official statement bushing back on this and they say, quote: From the beginning of our investigation, we have taken each step in a bipartisan way and we intend to continue to do so. Leaks of incomplete information out of context by anyone, inside or outside our committee, are unacceptable. They add, the full committee has had access to the material and been briefed on its content and committee investigators have pursued all relevant investigative leads related to this material. Waldman, by the way, did not return calls seeking comment. He signed a $40,000 monthly retainer in ‘09 and 2010 on behalf of that Russian billionaire. There are reports that Deripaska who sued Paul Manafort over a failed business deal has information to share. But so far, he has not gotten legal immunity so he hasn't talked to the Senate Intel Committee.

And APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from uranium one to the U.S.-Russian civilian nuclear cooperation agreement. We did reach out to APCO for comment. They told us, in part, the allegations are false and unfounded.

      "utterance": "tonight, an investigation into what is quickly becoming the biggest scandal in American history. It is now unmatched in the history of this country. There are a lot of key players, a lot of moving parts. So tonight, we are going to name names, we will identify the key players who will fully explain what has happened and expose the 2016 election saboteurs. Now, this is something the mainstream media will never do. And also tonight, breaking this hour, Ed Henry exclusively reporting that text messages now show that Senator Mark Warner was in communication with a lobbyist working for a Russian oligarch, all in an effort to set up a meeting with fake news dossier author Christopher Steele. First tonight our very important breaking news opening monologue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. So, we're going to go slow. What we have been reporting on night after night for over a year now is turning into a scandal bigger than Watergate. And here is why this is all so alarming. All the information we have been telling you about so far is only a sample of what's to come. It's the tip of the iceberg. Now, these facts, this evidence will rock the foundation of Washington, D.C. It will make you question how is it possible this could ever happen in the United States of America. It's that serious. And it's why we have been pushing so hard on this program for answers. Now, meanwhile, you have the liberal mainstream media, they are supposed to be all about truth, all about transparency, they have been missing in action. They have turned their backs, they are ignoring the biggest story in their lifetimes. Their sole focus has been on delegitimizing and destroying President Trump at every single turn. Now, that's why for over a year, they have been peddling hour after hour fake news conspiracy theories about so-called Trump-Russia collusion. They have nothing to base it on, no evidence whatsoever. And here is what they don't want you to know about the key officials that are involved in this scandal. Let's start with player number one. That, of course, would be Hillary Clinton. Now, remember Donna Brazile in her book, she talked about Hillary rigging the primary against Bernie Sanders. Imagine if that was Donald Trump. Then Clinton tried to build on that idea. She was teaming up with the DNC, they worked through a law firm, they paid over $12 million for that salacious dossier that was filled with Russian lies, Russian propaganda, why? Because they wanted to influence the general election through lies. Clinton also tried to keep this a secret. She went through a law firm, Perkins Coie, which then hired Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS and they paid former British spy, Russian expert Christopher Steele."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Now, according to Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, who has been doing a deep dive into all of this, two crimes may have been committed in this instance",
      "utterance": "52 U.S. Code 30121, which says it is illegal to make a payment, donation or trade anything of value with the foreign national in connection with any kind of election in America. Now, remember, Steele is a former British spy. He was only hired by Fusion GPS once Hillary Clinton started picking up the tab for the Trump opposition research, not before."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gregg also points out",
      "utterance": "52 USC 30101. It makes it a crime to file a false or misleading campaign report. Now, watchdog group, the Campaign Legal Center, they've actually filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing the Clinton campaign and the DNC of violating campaign finance laws and for failing to disclose payments they made for this dossier. All right. Next up is disgraced former FBI Director James Comey. Now, he, along with corrupt FBI agent, remember, Peter Strzok, and other top deputies, not rank-and-file, they put the fix in to save Hillary Clinton from prosecution when we know she committed multiple felonies as it relates to the email server scandal. Now, Comey and his lackeys, they ignored incontrovertible evidence about Clinton breaking the law, having secret top-secret special access programming, classified information stored in a mom-and-pop shop bathroom closet, remember, on the server. They also failed to act after Clinton's team deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, then they acid washed, using bleach a bit on the hard drives, and then any devices they had left over, they busted those up with a hammer. And, by the way, the mobile devices, they eventually turned over to the FBI? They were useless. They had no SIM cards in them. Now, despite all of this, Comey, Strzok, and others, they crafted an exoneration statement months before ever interviewing Hillary Clinton and 17 other key witnesses in the case. By the way, that's not how law enforcement works. And then exoneration statement, when describing Clinton's mishandling of classified information, Comey changed the words, the legal standard, gross negligence, which is the legal standard, to extreme carelessness. And they also altered a section that said it was reasonably likely that hostile foreign actors and adversaries of the United States had hacked the server. And they completely removed information about Hillary Clinton emailing President Obama, which means that Obama knew Hillary was breaking the law, or should have known. Now, all of this allowed Hillary Clinton to stay in the presidential race, which obviously they wanted. Then she used the Russian propaganda dossier, why? To lie to the American people. Nobody had verified what was in my dossier, not even Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS. Now, again, going back to Gregg Jarrett, according to him, if Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton for political purposes, well, that means he obstructed justice. He should have been seeking the truth. That is only the start of Comey's involvement in this scandal. And according to the House Intel Committee and their memo, Comey signed off personally on three FISA applications to spy on the Trump campaign, and his FBI lied to the FISA court about the dossier being bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton in the DNC. Oh, excused me, they did have a footnote, it may have some political origins, but they knew Hillary and the DNC paid for it. And Comey's FBI, then they also used that Yahoo News article written by Michael Isikoff about Carter Page. They were corroborating the dossier. Well, here's the problem. They knew the source for the Yahoo story was Christopher Steele, and FBI never independently verify the information, nor did Fusion GPS because Steele was their only source. And by the way, from there, it only gets worse. According to the Grassley-Graham memo, the bulk -- let me repeat -- the bulk of their applications to the FISA court, the FBI put before a judge, consisted -- the bulk of it -- the phony dossier, the Hillary Clinton phony dossier. In March of 2017, Comey told Congress that he didn't bother collaborating or corroborating the dossier because the FBI felt Christopher Steele was credible. Really? You don't have to corroborate these things? And Comey also testified under oath that the same dossier that he use to get the FISA warrant was, quote, salacious and unverified. And Comey also told the president-elect the same thing in January 2016 but it was just a couple of months earlier the dossier was used to get a warrant. Did he tell the FISA judge that it's unverified? Did he tell the FISA judge any of this information? No, he did not. OK, that is guilt by omission, purposely omitting information that likely would have had a big impact on that judge. All right. Player number three tonight, former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Now, the GOP House memo, that details how McCabe testified without the dossier, the FISA warrant to surveil would never have been approved. Now, McCabe is also tied to the Clinton email cover up. Remember the recent reports? Andrew McCabe was forced to resign over revelations in the soon to be released DOJ inspector general report, and we are told, all about the Clinton email investigation. And The Wall Street Journal is reporting that McCabe and other top FBI officials, remember, they also knew about Huma Abedin's emails that were found on Anthony Weiner's laptop. They knew about them in September of 2016. Important information. But they waited at least a month before they told Congress? And we can't forget McCabe's wife. She got $700,000 on astronomical amount of money for a failed Senate run in the Commonwealth of Virginia from a group tied to Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe and from the Virginia Democratic Party. Now, McCabe eventually had to recuse himself from the Clinton email investigation. Was it because he got caught or because he thought it was the right thing to do? You got two key allies of Andrew McCabe. Now, they are corrupt. They are the Trump bashing FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. They are players number four and five. Page actually served as the legal counsel to McCabe. As for Strzok, like we have been telling you, he is at the epicenter of the scandal, every scandal, every issue that we have been talking about the last year and a half. Now, Strzok is a former top FBI counterintelligence official. He is the one that signed the documents that kickoff think this phony Russia probe. He also oversaw the interviews of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. He is the guy who interviewed Hillary Clinton and her top aides. We have already told you how Strzok played a key role in changing the Clinton exoneration statement. Remember they were changing gross negligence to extreme carelessness. Then there is Strzok and Page's extreme hatred of Donald Trump. Remember in text messages, they called him an idiot, a menace, loathsome human being. They said if Trump and Clinton wanted to win 100 million to zero. And Strzok and Page also talked with who we think is Andrew McCabe about that insurance policy? Oh, God forbid Donald Trump wins the election? And yesterday, we got a new batch of text messages that show their inherent anti-Trump bias in the lead up, of course, to the election. Lisa Page was fearful, \"Oh my gosh, Donald Trump is going to win.\" On Election Day, Strzok writes back, \"Oh my god. This is (blanking) terrifying.\" And the following day, he says, \"Oh my God, I'm so depressed.\" And a couple of days later, Lisa Page writes: \"Well, I bought 'All the President's Men,' figure I need to brush up on Watergate,\" the insurance people. Then later, Page sends a message that reads: \"God, being here makes me angry. Lots of highfalutin' national security talk\". And, \"Meanwhile, we have our task ahead of us.\" I wonder if that's tied to the insurance policy? What does Page mean by task? When you put all of this together, with the insurance policy text, it raises serious, serious red flags. Now, these love birds also messaged back and forth about special counsel Robert Mueller. Remember, they had five months of missing texts? Well, right after Robert Mueller was appointed on May 19, two days after the appointment, Strzok was debating about joining the investigation. Strzok asked his lover Page, \"An investigation leading to impeachment?\" So, even before Mueller's probe, even before it got started, Strzok and Page were talking about impeaching President Obama. Now, this part is very important. During the same back and forth, Strzok texts, \"Well you and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely, I would be there no question\" -- meaning with Mueller, \"I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern there's no big there there.\" Pretty stunning admission. Now, Strzok helped start the Russia investigation but he thought there was no there there."

      "speaker": "Also, directly wrapped up in all of this is the demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie. They are players six and seven in this game if you want to call it a game of corruption. Bruce Ohr, he was reprimanded at the DOJ after it was discovered he was meeting with Fusion GPS both before and after the election. Ohr's office, remember, just four doors down from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. His wife Nellie Ohr, she worked at Fusion GPS. And, by the way, her job",
      "utterance": "focusing in on the anti-Trump dossier. And according to the Nunes memo, Bruce Ohr told investigators that he had a close relationship with the dossier author Christopher Steele. And Bruce Ohr said that Steele said he was \"desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.\" Pretty amazing. You couldn't write this in a novel. Now we turn our attention to the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. She's player number eight in all of this. And according to testimony from former Director James Comey, Lynch instructed the FBI to refer to their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton as a matter. Don't call it an investigation, don't call it what it really is. And then it got worse. In June of 2016, while the FBI so-called independent investigation is ongoing, Bill Clinton is meeting with Loretta Lynch in Phoenix on a tarmac for 40 minutes. Lynch said the meeting was about grandchildren and golf. But this is on July 1. Now, the former AG announced that she was stepping away from the investigation after this and she just accepts the FBI's conclusion. Now, keep in mind, this all took place before Hillary Clinton was interviewed on the Fourth of July weekend by the FBI and exonerated the next business day. And after Lynch announced that she was taking a backseat to the Clinton investigation, Strzok literally texts Page and says, \"Timing looks like hell,\" Page replies, \"Yes, awful timing,\" and then adds, oh, \"It's a real profile in courage,\" talking about Lynch since she knows no charges will be brought. Now, four days later, Comey holds his press conference where he infamously announces the FBI is not recommending charges against Clinton after thirteen and a half minutes of laying out a pretty damning case against Hillary. The Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he is also a player in all of this, this ongoing FISA scandal. We'll call him player number nine tonight. Now, first and foremost, Rosenstein, he oversees the entire Russia investigation. He was the official responsible for appointing Robert Mueller as a special counsel. We'll have more on Mueller in a minute. But, first, we know that it was Rosenstein who signed off on one of the applications to extend the FISA warrant against the Trump campaign. And then you have President Obama, oh, yes, what about him? We will call him player number 10 tonight. If Russia interfering in our election was so troubling, why didn't the Obama administration say something prior to the election? We now have an NBC News report, the Obama White House wasn't too worried about it because, quote: \"they thought that Hillary was going to win.\" Well, what does that tell you, if Hillary wins it's OK? And then the cherry on top is Robert Mueller. We'll call him player number 11 tonight. Now, the special counsel heading up the Russia investigation, we know that Mueller hired an extremely -- I mean extremely -- partisan team filled with individuals who had given over 50 grand but only to Democrats. No money to Donald Trump. We know who they gave money to. Let's see, Obama, Clinton and the DNC. We also know Mueller is best friends, BFF with James Comey. We know that he interviewed with Trump to be the next FBI director. And the day before he was appointed special counsel is when that interview took place. So, it's all very suspicious. And those are just the main key players in all of this. It gets complicated, but I want to make sure everybody is understanding this because as we move forward, I would guarantee almost at this point there is going to be massive investigations and I would not at all be surprised people will be going to jail, people will be indicted. Joining us now, author, attorney, David Limbaugh, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, former chairman of the House Oversight, FOX News contributor, Jason Chaffetz. Thank you, A, Gregg for all your help in all of this with the law. Let's go through these players and what we're talking about here."

Obama was virtually immune from everything he did. He had no accountability. And we had him politicizing literally every agency that he thought was important. The IRS, we know what he did with the IRS, turning it on his political opponents, Lois Lerner, whatever, they are all doing Obama's bidding. And what they did with the FBI and the DOJ, we know since the time of Clinton, they have been staffing these agencies, the DOJ, the FBI, with political operatives who care more about advancing the liberal agenda than they do the rule of law.

Quickly on the Kelly story, he just put out a letter I'm told to White House employees saying, look, the HR department will deal with any counseling issues. This was horrific incident went Rob Porter leaving as press secretary after allegations of domestic abuse. That story is still breaking. Meanwhile, you mentioned Mark Warner, he has been leading one the probes of President Trump's ties to Russia. Turns out he had extensive contact himself with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch who offered him access, yes to Christopher Steele. Warner texted he would, quote, rather not have a paper trail in case he could not seal an agreement with the former British spy. Steele has not agreed with an interview with the panel. He began texting this panelist, Warner did, Adam Waldman, February 2017 about getting testimony from Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who had his visa rebuked by the State Department in 2006 because of charges he has ties to organized crime in Russia."

Leaks of incomplete information out of context by anyone, inside or outside our committee, are unacceptable. They add, the full committee has had access to the material and been briefed on its content and committee investigators have pursued all relevant investigative leads related to this material. Waldman, by the way, did not return calls seeking comment. He signed a $40,000 monthly retainer in ‘09 and 2010 on behalf of that Russian billionaire. There are reports that Deripaska who sued Paul Manafort over a failed business deal has information to share. But so far, he has not gotten legal immunity so he hasn't talked to the Senate Intel Committee.

And APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from uranium one to the U.S.-Russian civilian nuclear cooperation agreement. We did reach out to APCO for comment. They told us, in part, the allegations are false and unfounded. APCO also told us that its volunteer work for the Clinton global initiative and its engagement with the Russian firm Tennex are absolutely not connected.

We now know before the Obama administration made the following decisions restarted the U.S. nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia, approved the uranium one deal and then gave clearance so that many utilities in the United States could buy Russian uranium, they knew the following things, at least through the FBI. They knew this. One, that Russia was assisting Iran and their illicit nuclear program. Two, that the APCO, the lobbying firm. At least the Russians were claiming they were paying money to them in an effort to help Hillary Clinton. Three, the very Russian arm, in the United States that was sent here to build this uranium business was engaged in bribery, kickbacks, racketeering and extortion. If you have all of that information, it does raise a great public policy question why did the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton state department, the other departments, why did they approve these deals?"

And I stress again, he spent nearly 3 decades working with U.S. Intelligence agencies that includes the FBI on many issues. A number of issues. I want to go back to one point. In April of 2010, is when he informed the FBI of what he found out regarding Russia and Iran, they were aiding Iran with their fabricated assemblies for their nuclear reactors with consultation and with fuel. So the Obama administration actually knew that this was going on. There was documented proof. There were recordings. But, yet, in October of 2010, they still went through with the deal. The CFIUS approved the deal for the sale of the Canadian firm uranium one which had 20 percent of our uranium mining assets in the United States. In Wyoming in particular. So we have to ask ourselves these questions. And say if there is an investigation going to be those investigators at the department of justice to look at the money trail."

The idea that FBI Director at the time Mueller knew, because we had the informant about bribery, extortion, kickbacks, money laundering and this is nearly 18 months before CFIUS signs off on the uranium one deal, knowing Vladimir Putin wanted a foot hold -- foot hold in our industry?

That is why I filed legislation with countless other conservative colleagues like Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan and Todd Rokita calling for a second special counsel to look into the Clinton Foundation in Uranium One. We can't have Mueller investigate he should have raised an objection. We'll can't have Rosenstein investigate, because we have seen how he is tied up. Jeff Sessions has recused himself. The only way this doesn't become the next Benghazi where we stir up a bunch of facts but let the Clintons off the hook is appoint a special counsel and we need our Attorney General."
