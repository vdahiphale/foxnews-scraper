I believe it is a bluff. And this is where I'm going to say something completely different that people may get angry about. But there is room for sympathy for North Korea, and here's why. The Korean War ended in a divorce. South Korea got the greatest parent ever, the United States. We love them, we protected them, we cared for them. To the consequences, the result is a massively successful economy, South Korea had a great parent. What parent did North Korea get? Tommy's, China and the USSR. They could not afford to take care of them, they didn't want to take care of them, they didn't clothe them, they did not feed them, they were terrible parents. And the reason why they were terrible parents, is there were scared of North Korea becoming successful, so they treated them like crap. So, what you have now is you have a child, North Korea is essentially a child that is been scared. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And what is a child do? It's rational way of thinking, it's survivalism. And a scared child survives through bluffing. It acts tough. Because it knows that if it doesn't act tough, it's going get ruined. So, the solution if you think about this, how do you help this child that has been screwed by a terrible parents for 40 years? A child that smartly realizes that it must bluff its way to survival.

I don't know. So, I think there is a way to negotiate with these guys.

As we wipe out ISIS in terror hotbeds, they're now fanning out. All it takes is one free agent, a dirty bomb and 9/11 will look like a bonfire. This latest plot shows that these fiends are indeed still plotting. So, as ISIS handbooks teach this stuff to recruits, what is our move? The arrested plotters are siblings recruited by another brother and ISIS, meaning terrorism is an intimate bunch, and we should look at them all. It's life or death. I said it before, radical Islam marries terror to new technology. They now have refined wares and they learn fast. Even though they failed here -- we don't know why -- they will adjust and keep at it. We must do the same. We always knew plastic explosives were coming. We better make sure we can detect them even in air cargo. So, I am thinking on September 10, 2001, you could probably find a ton of stories on North Korea, but few on bin Laden. A lot has changed since then. Sixteen years ago, it was a jet and a box cutter. But now we've got drones, biotech, plastics. So, if you are sleepless tonight over North Korea, you are doing it wrong. This should keep you up instead. After all, we can find North Korea on a map. Dana, you are a political person in 2000, the election, how much was al Qaeda mentioned?",

I don't think he's never going to give up the advantage as it relates to the United States and our positioning. And that's why I think he is doubling down on this.

We are dealing with an incredibly unpredictable volatile person who now has nukes. It is tricky. And I'm not sure that doubling down and tripling down is the way to turn the corner."

      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "I think it is a great name for a ban. Let me, you know what? I think Donald Trump, it is refreshing rhetoric. I think it's important. I disagree with Mo, I think it is important to speak their language. Because what you are seeing is negotiation and you're seeing bleathing. You wonder why he chose Guam, because it is a bluff. I believe it is a bluff. And this is where I'm going to say something completely different that people may get angry about. But there is room for sympathy for North Korea, and here's why. The Korean War ended in a divorce. South Korea got the greatest parent ever, the United States. We love them, we protected them, we cared for them. To the consequences, the result is a massively successful economy, South Korea had a great parent. What parent did North Korea get? Tommy's, China and the USSR. They could not afford to take care of them, they didn't want to take care of them, they didn't clothe them, they did not feed them, they were terrible parents. And the reason why they were terrible parents, is there were scared of North Korea becoming successful, so they treated them like crap. So, what you have now is you have a child, North Korea is essentially a child that is been scared. And what is a child do? It's rational way of thinking, it's survivalism. And a scared child survives through bluffing. It acts tough. Because it knows that if it doesn't act tough, it's going get ruined. So, the solution if you think about this, how do you help this child that has been screwed by a terrible parents for 40 years? A child that smartly realizes that it must bluff its way to survival. A child that feels that it needs nuclear power or nuclear weapons to survive and who are we to say \"no.\" And I'm beginning to think that who are we to say no if you have been treated like crap for so long. I don't know. So, I think there is a way to negotiate with these guys. If you understand that for the past four decades everybody has gotten great stuff, but they have been stagnant in a permanent mass forever, essentially a mold that hasn't ever gone malignant but has promised to go malignant."

Week one, maybe even day one of this new administration. And in a private phone call of McConnell yesterday, the President was even harsher sure, not just going after him about his performance as majority leader but very upset about the speech McConnell gave earlier this week in Kentucky at a rotary club where McConnell basically said that because of the President's lack of political experience, he is suffering from excessive expectations about exactly what Congress can do with his agenda. Yesterday and today the President has also fired off a series of tweets going after McConnell directly including one this afternoon in which he said, quote, \"Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal and Replace, Tax Reform and Cuts and a great infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing. You can do it.\" A couple of hours later reporters press the President on comments by Sean Hannity and other conservatives that if McConnell cannot get the job done, maybe he should simply step aside and resign as leader."

This latest plot shows that these fiends are indeed still plotting. So, as ISIS handbooks teach this stuff to recruits, what is our move? The arrested plotters are siblings recruited by another brother and ISIS, meaning terrorism is an intimate bunch, and we should look at them all. It's life or death. I said it before, radical Islam marries terror to new technology. They now have refined wares and they learn fast. Even though they failed here -- we don't know why -- they will adjust and keep at it. We must do the same. We always knew plastic explosives were coming. We better make sure we can detect them even in air cargo. So, I am thinking on September 10, 2001, you could probably find a ton of stories on North Korea, but few on bin Laden. A lot has changed since then. Sixteen years ago, it was a jet and a box cutter. But now we've got drones, biotech, plastics. So, if you are sleepless tonight over North Korea, you are doing it wrong. This should keep you up instead. After all, we can find North Korea on a map. Dana, you are a political person in 2000, the election, how much was al Qaeda mentioned?"

So when you hear stories like this, you know it make sense. They are trying to outthink, if I was amongst the first, you know the Jihadist, ISIS, and they are trying to use some of this encrypted messaging system like Signal, WhatsApp and Telegraph to be able to avoid detection, that is why our intelligence as Dana points out has to be even more strong and commendable and aggressive in terms of being able to get the information to anticipate and also to find out the connections, the relationships and the terror web."

That can only work for a certain amount of time. You have to think creatively and anticipate what they are going to do next. President Trump did that with the travel ban. President Obama used tools like drones, focused on rhetoric. President Trump is very creative. He got block sites, he had got mauled, and he had forced interrogation. So right now we need to be thinking one step ahead, because you are right. You are not going to win by putting bullets in heads, although Trump is doing that pretty effectively in Syria right now. That is why they are dissipating and scrambling and coming up with these other crazy ideas. But you're going to have to like the President said in Saudi Arabia, drive them out. Not just physically, but the ideology. The ideology, radical Islam is motivated by death. When you take that motivation away, you can crush it.

It's an interview with Manny Dworman, he is a great guy, he owns The Comedy Cellar, a legendary comedy club, and we talked about politics, conservatives in comedy and the era of Trump. It is really good. Only like 25 minutes. You will not miss it. Greg's wishes do come true! 40 years later. So I'm standing out, you know, where I live. And this happens. Take a look at this. There is the guy with a hand truck and the box falls off on his hand truck filled with pop rocks and popcorn. If I was ten years old, this would have been like a dream come true. Like that scene and animal house where the woman flies through the window and the kid says, thank you, god. It was insane. But I am 52. So anyways, I'm yelling at the dude with the truck, but everybody has ear buds in, so he just walks. He walks with the truck, left this giant box. I ran out into the street, and I grabbed it and took it back. And I held on and I was going, look at all of these pop rocks. It is the strangest story ever. I look at the address. And it belongs to a restaurant of a guy that I am meeting in 10 minutes. It is the most insane story ever. It was an ice cream place called odd fellows, and I am meeting him about a boiler."
