We're not banking on criminal cartels. When you said it's OK to enter illegally and claim asylum, these people left the port of entry - as you see from the videos last few days, they are entering country illegally with bankrolled criminal organizations, the same organizations that have killed border patrol agents. They bankroll the cartels who control that Northern section of the border and they put these people in harm's way. 31% of every woman that comes up through Central America to the Mexican border enters this country illegally, one in three is sexually assaulted.

But this is now turning out to be based on what happened in New York and what was missed by one vote in Virginia, the Left's new approach to abortion. How bad do you think it's going to get and I'll start with you Ann. ANN MCELHINNEY, \"GOSNELL\" CO-AUTHOR, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Well, you know what's actually very interesting here is that, these two - the Representative Tran and then the Governor of Virginia. What they're really stating actually is what's been going on, anyway. What has been legal in this country for many, many years and in many, many parts of the country, in at least seven or eight states, including and Washington D.C., you can have an abortion up to nine months. And I - one of the things that, I think, is actually good and it's kind of going to sound really odd. But one of the things that's quite good about the Virginia Governor and Representative Tran stating their cases so clearly this week, has been the fact that - luckily, eventually people will find out what the law is in America. And the law in America can only come be compared to places like Pakistan, North Korea, China, this is who the club that America is in. And it's one of the things - and it's the main reason, by the way, that we made this movie. There was testimony, as you've just seen from that clip, the testimony from the good legal abortionist, describing what a good legal abortion looks like. And I can tell you, that having spoken to the jury members this is what we shocked them. That what was legal in America, what goes on legally in America, and has gone on for many, many years is, what a lot of people don't know. And when people do know, they don't like it. So there's something very valuable in what has just happened. And I know people are very, very shocked. It's very shocking that people are shocked, in the sense that they didn't know that this was going on, and I think, finally, people are going to find out.",

This behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in military, in medicine, and in public service. But the condemnation is coming fast and furious. The Virginia Republican Party is calling for Northam to resign and so are 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, Julian Castro and Kamala Harris. Just this week, Northam got more heat from Republicans for supporting failed measure that would have permitted full-term abortions, something that critics called infanticide. And Virginia Democrats might be less resistant to fight any potential resignation of Northam because the Virginia's Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax is an African-American Democrat. Breaking news comes in on this, judge. We'll break in."

Today, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker threw his helmet into the ring and already he is facing backlash over his constant grandstanding, including the now infamous \"Spartacus\" moment where he referred to self as heroic gladiator in his political war against Justice Kavanaugh.

The truth doesn't even really matter. I hope you will go back and watch the Kavanaugh hearings, it was one of my prouder moments sticking for people. And when I was threatened to be thrown out of the Senate, I told the senator that did that, bring it, another senator stood up and said, if you're going to throw Cory Booker out, throw me into the pit, as well. And that senator, I looked at him and I said, wow, that is like an \"I am Spartacus\" moment. He stepped forward and said, if anything happens to Cory happens to me."

Just this week, Warren was forced to apologize to the Cherokee nation for taking a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry. Joining us now with more on the Democrats very shaky start is former Obama economic advisor Austan Goolsbee and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. Good evening, gentlemen. Austan, I'm going to start with you."

He said that he was going to release information that would jeopardize his status in the Senate and the information was supposed to show that Kavanaugh supported racial profiling during the Bush administration. A position so awful that Booker just had to break the rules to expose it. In truth, it turned out to have nothing to do with racial profiling and the most on point is Kavanaugh's analysis post-9/11 security in which he warned against racial profiling. So this guy, I mean, he's quite a grandstander wouldn't you say, Austan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "Well, all presidential campaigns if they succeed are marathon trials and everybody who starts as a candidate has to get their sea legs. You saw all the leading candidates that came out and had at least one significant bump at the beginning. At the same time, I disagree a bit with your characterization that they are moving radically left in a radical direction. I think if you support policies that have the support of two thirds or more of the American people, you can't really describe those as radical policies. So, the Medicare option for everyone, that's supported by more than 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans. So, I don't think you can call that socialist craziness."

      "speaker": "REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.",
      "utterance": "I think that the Democratic Party is going to suffer from a desire to have the most theatrical candidate. We have two forces converging, Judge. One is reducing attention span when it comes to American people paying attention to politics and second, a growing number of people who wants to be president. And so, the result is that the people who be the most theatrical tend to rise to the top in a crowd of field. Look at the Republican field in 2016, Donald Trump was the most interesting, and he won. Ted Cruz was the second most interesting, and he was the runner-up. On the Democratic field now, I think you're going to see a lot of fireworks from Cory Booker. Even Democrats acknowledge he is a show horse, not a work horse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know, and, Austan, I'll go back to you. You know, Elizabeth Warren and this whole thing about, you know, or she now has apologized to the Cherokee nation. I thought it was interesting that the Senator Warren, the head of the Cherokee Nation or a spokesperson has reached out to us. But we want to be clear that being a Cherokee nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws, not through DNA tests. So even the Cherokee Nation is saying, do you know what? You can say you are 1/100 or 1/500 of a particular Indian nation or Native American nation I should say, but the truth is you're not. You don't have the culture. You are not a part of the laws. You don't know anything about us. She is not hot water with them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "She acknowledged that. I agree with that. That was a bump that she hit this week. I mean, I think that what motivated her to do that were the kind of racially charged accusations that came from President Trump and a bunch of Republicans that, oh, yes, well, if you have any Native American in your blood, why don't take a DNA test and she did and, of course, that's not how you determine who is in a tribe. It was just a bad situation for her. I think the congressman's insight I think is actually kind of a deep insight that as you look at presidential primaries, a lot of the attention is attracted to the most theatrical candidate. So, I wonder how that is going to play out. And for sure, if people cannot overcome these bumps in the road that happen at the beginning of campaigns and throughout campaigns, if they can't overcome them, they are going to drop out soon because the campaign goes for years. You know, it's a long ways until the election. It could be a lot of problems."

And I think that as like as these moments of moral outrage occur, you're going to see the entire Democratic field jumping over one another to take the most extreme position. I think the next big test on that will be the filing of the Mueller report. They will be clawing each other's eyes out on the b left to be the first to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump. I think the average American, the forgotten Americans who just want to see rising wages, safe streets, a good economy, I think they're going to come home to President Trump, particularly in the Rust Belt, and that is the strategy for a winning 2020 election."

    {
      "speaker": "REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.",

And so, listen, part of the smart technology is certainly part of the solution. But I can tell you the bigger problem right now is that we have a bicameral bipartisan conference supposedly been meeting and they've only met one time in the last week. They are not even here in Washington, D.C. and they are supposedly coming up with solutions. They are not serious about negotiating."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Yes. They've only met one time. They met Wednesday. They don't have any scheduled meetings to meet again until possibly at the earliest next Wednesday. So, it's not really serious about coming up to a solution, and I can tell you when the Democrats rolled out their first offer, it had zero money for border wall. And I mean, you know, at this point, you have to wonder if they ever had an intention of negotiating in the first place."

You meet once, when you've got three weeks to resolve one of the most important issues in our country right now, you plan on meeting once next week. That's an outrage. Now, I will go to Gregg Jarrett. All right, Gregg. The president says there is a good chance and based on what we heard from Congressman Mark Meadows, if they don't come up with something. Congress has not wanted to come up with something since 1986, they don't come up with anything, the president has the right to declare an emergency, correct?"

They can whine all they want but they're the ones who gave him that power. Once he invokes it, he then turns to another law that Congress passed six years after that in 1982 which says, specifically, he is authorized to undertake military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by Congress. So they gave him another tool that he can utilize. They can complain all they want. They can sue. In the end, they have no legal basis to prevail."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And, you know, Congressman Meadows, I believe it was just today or yesterday, one of the biggest catches of fentanyl coming across the border. Enough fentanyl, I don't know if people realize, our viewers realize this, but if you inhale that stuff, it can take out a state. I mean, just the mere presence of it. You don't have to be a drug user. You don't have to have a needle -- nothing. The presence of this stuff can kill off millions of people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",

Even our law enforcement officers many times have to wear gloves when they are doing a search because if they happen to have it and get even a small dose of this, and I'm not talking about taking it, I'm just saying getting on their skin or inhaling it in some way, you know, they can have just unbelievable and fatal outcomes of that. So, you know, it's not just about the drugs though and Gregg is exactly right. The president has some executive tools in his toolbox. Members of Congress, we always want to restrain those, but President Barack Obama used it over and over and over again. I can tell you, he sent $1.8 billion to the Iranians. I didn't appropriate that. So if he can do that, certainly the president can find a couple of billion dollars to support the efforts at the border."

It's probably going to be someone else. But Gregg is right, there is no doubt. They will file a lawsuit. If they can they will file it in the ninth circuit. Here's what we have to understand. One party is for securing our borders and keeping our community safe. Another party, the Democrat Party, is for open borders, and saying, whoever wants to come in can come in.

Joining me now with reaction is Fox News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy, and SiriusXM Patriot Radio host, \"Daily Caller's\" Kerry Picket. All right. Rachel, I'm going to start with you. What we're hearing is that as they go farther -- I should say further and further left, there seems to be an agenda that is not so much or I should say not only socialist but is focused on other countries outside of the United States. Sometimes I wonder if they realize they were elected to represent Americans and not Palestinians and not other people. Am I getting it wrong?"

They believe that they can confiscate people's wealth in order to achieve income equality and other goods, things they think are good for society. The Republican Party wants to expand opportunity. And everywhere that the ideas that they have, have been tried, has not only ended in destructive economic outcomes, they have also ended in terrible political repression. And I think it's important that we really and I actually think it's a good moment for us, Judge, we are seeing the Democrats for who they are. And we, as conservatives, need to absolutely speak out. We need to educate our children. I think that's the most important thing we can do as parents and grandparents because they are getting all this information and all these ideas not just from these women but they are being indoctrinated at our schools from the elementary level all the way to the collegiate level."

That goes back to the 1940s and 1950s. Well, keep in mind, one of the things they don't mention is even during that era, there was a lot of loopholes in the tax code that the ultra- wealthy could actually use like saying that their income was for long term capital tax gains."

He walked it back. They are not locking this back anymore.

We expect them to hit the California and Texas border probably Tuesday, just in time for the President's State of the Union Address. Chances are they will be a topic. Now the caravans get all the publicity, but really there is a constant flow of Central Americans through Mexico, while Democrats prefer that any new border security money go into technology and ports of entry to stop drug smuggling, like that fentanyl bust in Nogales.

Joining us now is Former ICE Director, Tom Homan and the author of \" Slave Stealers: True Accounts of Slave Rescues-Then and Now\", Former DHS Special Agent, Tim Ballard. Tom, I want to start with you. This whole idea of holding people in Mexico, and one of the gentlemen on the on the video said, \"If they didn't want me to be back, they would have sent me to Honduras\", that's kind of an arrogant attempt or an arrogant interpretation of what's going on at the border, is it not?"

President tried to address this when he said, \"If you enter the country illegally, we're not going to let you claim asylum\". And of course ACLU sued him and some Judge in Ninth Circuit agreed. And let me tell you what the ACLU did. They put these aliens back in danger, because if they were required to go to the port of entry, where they're surrounded by special agents, the women aren't going to be raped, children won't be molested. We're not banking on criminal cartels. When you said it's OK to enter illegally and claim asylum, these people left the port of entry - as you see from the videos last few days, they are entering country illegally with bankrolled criminal organizations, the same organizations that have killed border patrol agents. They bankroll the cartels who control that Northern section of the border and they put these people in harm's way. 31% of every woman that comes up through Central America to the Mexican border enters this country illegally, one in three is sexually assaulted. That's not a DHS number, that's a doctors along on borders number."

The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated, if that's what the mother and the family desired.

I guess, in light of what's going on, you must both feel a certain amount of, certainly, validation, not that you needed it in terms of what Dr. Gosnell did. But this is now turning out to be based on what happened in New York and what was missed by one vote in Virginia, the Left's new approach to abortion. How bad do you think it's going to get and I'll start with you Ann. ANN MCELHINNEY, \"GOSNELL\" CO-AUTHOR, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST: Well, you know what's actually very interesting here is that, these two - the Representative Tran and then the Governor of Virginia. What they're really stating actually is what's been going on, anyway. What has been legal in this country for many, many years and in many, many parts of the country, in at least seven or eight states, including and Washington D.C., you can have an abortion up to nine months. And I - one of the things that, I think, is actually good and it's kind of going to sound really odd. But one of the things that's quite good about the Virginia Governor and Representative Tran stating their cases so clearly this week, has been the fact that - luckily, eventually people will find out what the law is in America. And the law in America can only come be compared to places like Pakistan, North Korea, China, this is who the club that America is in. And it's one of the things - and it's the main reason, by the way, that we made this movie. There was testimony, as you've just seen from that clip, the testimony from the good legal abortionist, describing what a good legal abortion looks like. And I can tell you, that having spoken to the jury members this is what we shocked them. That what was legal in America, what goes on legally in America, and has gone on for many, many years is, what a lot of people don't know. And when people do know, they don't like it. So there's something very valuable in what has just happened. And I know people are very, very shocked. It's very shocking that people are shocked, in the sense that they didn't know that this was going on, and I think, finally, people are going to find out."

What happens? PHELIM MCALEER, \"GOSNELL\" CO-AUTHOR: No. I mean and this goes on in abortion clinics and hospitals all across America at the moment and has been for decades.

In the meantime, he's disposing off bodies, taking bodies away, taking bodies out of the clinic who knows to where. But that's a very good question that you asked, Judge."
