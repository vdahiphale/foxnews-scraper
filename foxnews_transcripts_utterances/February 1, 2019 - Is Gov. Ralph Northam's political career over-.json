But I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians faith in that commitment. I recognize that it will take time and serious effort to heal the damage this conduct has caused.\" As you can imagine, it has also has caused a lot of reaction on Twitter and elsewhere, some of it interesting.

It can wait.\" -- Not overheard in the Northam Comms office.\" Karen Tumulty, \"I don't know how much Ed Gillespie was paying his oppo research team, but he should immediately demand a refund,\" Ed Gillespie the Republican who ran against Northam for Governor.

He denied that today. But hours later, this surfaced. It's a yearbook photo, his yearbook page in medical school 1984. There you see the image with this person in black face and in a KKK hood and robe. And the governor is admitting he is one of those people. We don't know which one. The Republican Party of Virginia saying \"Racism has no place in Virginia. These pictures are wholly inappropriate. If Governor Northam appeared in black face or dressed in a KKK robe he should resign immediately.\" The governor released a statement during this show saying \"I'm deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now. This behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career. But I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians faith in that commitment. I recognize that it will take time and serious effort to heal the damage this conduct has caused.\" As you can imagine, it has also has caused a lot of reaction on Twitter and elsewhere, some of it interesting. Jonah Goldberg, our friend, \"Hey, it's Beer O'Clock! Let's pick this up Monday. It can wait.\" -- Not overheard in the Northam Comms office.\" Karen Tumulty, \"I don't know how much Ed Gillespie was paying his oppo research team, but he should immediately demand a refund,\" Ed Gillespie the Republican who ran against Northam for Governor. Ed O'Keefe, \"Memo to reporters covering statewide campaigns, always find the candidates' yearbooks, all of them.\" Ben Shapiro \"Brett Kavanaugh's yearbook, though.\" The controversy obviously over the Justice now on the Supreme Court. Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Leslie Marshall, syndicated talk radio host, national security analyst Morgan Ortagus. OK. A lot to digest. Thanks for the quick turn on the audible here on the panel. Matthew, your thoughts? MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: Well, it's never a good day for a politician when you are confronted with the yearbook photo and the Washington, D.C. community in your state is trying to figure out whether you were the one in black face or the one under the Klan hood. This is a terrible end of the week for Northam, a week that didn't start well either with his comments on not -- it used to be defending partial birth abortion, but Northam seemed to be defending in that radio interview post-birth abortion, otherwise known as infanticide.

Whether you are a governor in Virginia, whether you are a congressman like Steve King, there has to be zero tolerance, and it can't be just Republicans asking for him to resign. It has to be Democrats. But would Republicans being saying the same thing if he had an \"R\" next to his name next to a \"D.\" I certainly hope so. But again, the people of Virginia might say, wait a minute, I may be offended by this, but I can forgive him because it was many years ago, he was young and foolish, he feels differently, and he has apologized."

Obviously, this is tremendously offensive and horrible.

There is no excuse for this picture which did not take place in the 1950s or 1960's. This was in 1984. This wasn't in high school. This was in a medical school yearbook. And there's a wonderful young man who is about 40 years old named Justin Fairfax who is the lieutenant governor of Virginia, young African-American man, who I might add, who I think could gracefully take over right away and lead Virginia in a much better place than the governor has. And I think that many people, no matter where you stand on abortion, are pretty shocked and appalled when you talk about things, about third trimester abortion, when you talk about potentially babies that could be born and could live full human lives ending that life. It wasn't just a terrible week politically, it was a disgraceful week for him, and I think it's time to go."

That was the closing argument was fighting racism. There's a quarter of the electorate in Virginia African-American. The lieutenant governor is African-American.

I do think actually, though, Kavanaugh did set a new standard. And sure, people are saying, of course you always look for the yearbooks.

One was the tendency in everyone who has announced so far and in their tweets and subsequent follow-up is to be incredibly angry at the state of the country and to complain about everything that's going on, and that's the driving force. And Booker of course has chosen to be the happy warrior. I also thought it's interesting that he has made race very much a central issue to his campaign. It will be interesting to see how a Democrat employs that in a primary. It's not something that Barack Obama really used against Hillary Clinton. So, those are the two things that stuck out.

      "utterance": "Yes, and actually that's why he is talking about race issues. Kamala Harris, African-American, threw her hat into the ring, a female. Even the president said she had a strong out-of-the-gate, if you will. But when she was attorney general in California, and if you look at the African-American community, there is a lot of pushback against her. And I think he is speaking specifically to those voters in announcing today and being completely contrary with her with regard to her saying, hey, let's abolish all private insurance, and I'm bringing up very specifically race issues. But if I may just say one more thing quickly -- his personality completely in contrast with the president, I don't think that is going to be a winning ticket for the Democrats.
