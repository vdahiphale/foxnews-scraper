That was as the S&P fell more than 7 percent during today's trading session, part of the volatility coming from uncertainty surrounding the virus, but the other part of these knee-jerk massive moves come from not just straight buying and selling of the market, but short-selling and then covering, which exacerbates those swings. It's one reason that some are warning the markets could shut down or implement new rules, though the Treasury secretary said that's not going to happen. But the economy itself, more door-closing, as you said, today's casinos, bars restaurants closing in Las Vegas, this in addition to the malls and retailers who said yesterday that they are going dark, Macy's, Nordstrom, Saks, Bloomingdale's, then Target and Best Buy reducing store hours as well. That will help those stores restock and clean. This is all coming as government officials are trying to put plans in place to contain the virus and stem the damages to business at the same time, more borders closed across Europe and North America, the U.S. and Canada agreeing to close their border, except for essential travel. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The administration pressuring Congress to pass a $1 trillion package that would allow for paid sick leave, payroll tax cuts, expanded loans, unemployment insurance, as well as the cash checks that have been discussed. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as Detroit's Big Three automakers instituted factory shutdowns, the president looking to invoke laws that would allow private companies to help deal with this pandemic as well, Neil.",

We're using the full power of government in response to the Chinese virus. I declared a state of national emergency that will make up to $50 billion in disaster relief funds available, which we can use to assist hospitals -- which, as you know, we need. I asked states to set up emergency operation centers and hospitals to activate emergency plans. And they've been fully notified. We're urging hospitals to cancel all elective medical procedures. My emergency declaration allowed us to waive regulations to give nurses and doctors maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and to protect our frontline professionals that we've authorized through telehealth nationwide, which is really becoming big stuff -- telehealth. It makes it a lot easier for patients, and it really has been working out amazingly well. We empowered states to authorize tests developed in their state. And we are working with the private sector to rapidly expand testing capacity. We have literally rebuilt that whole system. It was an obsolete system, and it's been rebuilt. And a lot of good things are happening. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We've ordered 500 million N95 masks to drive private production.

And they have actually, quite a few of them -- the construction companies. Who would think that? But they're going to be donating unused masks. And the Defense Department is making millions of masks available for health care workers. And we're asking every American to make major changes to reduce social interactions over the next two weeks. As we all know, we must make shared sacrifices, and that's what we're doing as a country. It's been amazing to see the way the country has come together. There's tremendous spirit. And even Republicans and Democrats are getting together -- for the most part, but they're getting together. So that's a good thing to see.

And as he said, we've taken decisive steps. We've enabled the expansion, availability of N95 masks. And Congress has worked a bipartisan way to make those more available.

      "sentences": "Samples had to be sent to the CDC in Atlanta. That obviously took quite a bit of time. These labs in Miami, Jacksonville, Tampa, since February 22, they have tested a total of 1,653. But if you look, just a week ago, that is a pretty significant increase to where we were a week ago. And then during the week of March 8, private laboratories began processing COVID-19 laboratory tests. So, Quest, LabCorp, there's other CLIA-certified labs. They do have to report the results, because this is a reportable disease. So they do the testing, and then the Department of Health gets the information, the basics. So they have been doing that. Now, obviously, we're going -- there's going to be a little lag sometimes in the information, as we see more of the drive-through testing. When that gets sent to private labs, a lot of times, the people, they're going to get a text message. And they will know certainly before the Department of Health knows what the result was. And then, at that point, that's when the investigations would begin. But they have done on the private side 2,050 tests. So if you go back a week, 10 days ago, I think that's probably three- or four-fold increase of where we were. I think we need to do way more tests than that. So that was one of the things. As soon as we declared the state of emergency, you had this stuff with the HHS kit. I asked Jared to get as many kits as possible. So we have now distributed 2,500 test kits, so each kit can do a number of tests. I think the total for 2,500 kits is over 600,000 individual tests. But what I have learned on this is, like, just getting a test kit doesn't mean you can just do the test. You got to get other parts. So Department of Health and DEM have distributed 200 negative and 200 positive controls. So that goes. That's another component to doing the test. And then we also are working on making sure all the labs have enough reagents to be able to do the test. But probably the biggest supply issue that we're seeing -- well, I'd say there's two big supply issues. One relates really specifically to testing. The other relates to everything. Just specific to testing is the swabs to take the sample. We put in an order probably a week-and-a-half ago for a half-a-million swabs. We have not gotten that fulfilled yet. We have also asked the federal government. We're in discussions with HHS and asked them to send. If we have enough swabs, and we set up the drive-through sites, you can swab people. Some of the state labs and private labs here in Florida could do it, but then the rest can be sent to Quest and LabCorp. So a huge supply of swabs will let us ramp up the number of people that can be tested very, very quickly. So I have told Jared, do whatever you can to get the swabs. Certainly, the president, that would be the one thing I would say would be helpful, that and the PPE for the health care workers. When you're doing these testing, you got to be in this special equipment, PPE, so that you don't catch the virus. Some of this stuff's not reusable. I mean, you think like, you just -- you got to use a new one every time. And so that stuff is in short supply. So I have been talking with a lot of hospital folks, and that's one of the main supply needs they have. But I think that's probably going to be nationwide. If you look at the last two, three weeks, this is probably the biggest rush to get medical supplies in the history of the United States. But we can't have enough PPE right now. So, the swabs, the reagents and the PPE, if we get more of that in, we're putting the infrastructure in place. And, hopefully, we would be able to greatly expand. And my view is, if you look at the different countries that have faced this, to me, the one that's been most successful, South Korea, because they were able to really do a lot of testing. They didn't do draconian controls on their population. They promoted social distancing. But they were able to do the test, do the investigations, isolate the proper people. And if you look in Florida right now, we have about 50 percent of our cases are Miami-Dade and Broward counties. The rest are kind of spread out here or there. Some counties don't -- I think a majority of our counties still don't have any -- or close to -- don't have any positive tests yet. So you have community spread in Broward and very likely Dade. Obviously, we want to know how many asymptomatic people are carrying that. And so if I have the materials, if we can get that in Florida, we would be able to expand the number of people and the categories of people who would be able to come in and get tested. So, that's what we have been working on nonstop. And I have learned a lot about how this works. But, hopefully, we're getting in the right place on that. The other thing I would say that hospitals have done, most of the hospitals in the state, have started to...",

A lot of people hear that, Doctor, and go, whoa, whoa, whoa, how much worse can this get? What is your sense of things? I know there's no way of knowing, but what do you think?  SHAMAN: Well look, I think we have to be very clear-eyed about what the worst case is in a very realistic way. The virus that we're dealing with here, unfortunately, has the right combination of characteristics that allows it to be particularly problematic and deadly. And those are really two things, firstly, that in the majority of people, it causes only mild symptoms. It's the type of thing that you and I would get in the winter, you get a cold, and you're like, you know, I will just take some ibuprofen, I will go to work, it's not a big deal, I will go shopping. We want to go out to a restaurant or a bar or movie theater, not a big deal, send the kids to school. The problem is that is that it then distributes the virus out in the broader community. Now, for most viruses, that's not a problem, because they don't cause a lot of mortality at the same time. But this one has what we would call a fat tail. There's a portion of the population, particularly the elderly and those with chronic conditions, that are at extreme risk for severe complications and mortality. So, not only does it have this component where 80, 90 percent of people are going to be mildly infected, but those people who are not mildly affected, who have to go seek clinical care and see a doctor, many of them are winding up in the ICU and are going to die. So the consequence of that is that, if we're looking at 50 percent under the population the world getting this, because it spreads so easily, because there's so many of these undocumented cases, let's say that's 4.2 billion people, right?",

That's when they try to cool things off by stopping trading for about 15 minutes just to let cooler heads prevail. Well, good luck with that, the Dow diving today on fears that whatever they're coming up with might not be enough, then again, optimism that this very hour, it might be happening, and soon. We're going to be talking to Senator Lindsey Graham about that. The major averages right now, even with today's comeback from our worst levels, are down about a third from their all-time highs reached last month. Washington continues to talk up a now well in excess of a trillion dollars. Man, oh, man, these are surreal times. Welcome, everybody.

Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. That was then. What the heck is going on now? We are grinding lower, but how much lower? And where do we go from here?

That was as the S&P fell more than 7 percent during today's trading session, part of the volatility coming from uncertainty surrounding the virus, but the other part of these knee-jerk massive moves come from not just straight buying and selling of the market, but short-selling and then covering, which exacerbates those swings. It's one reason that some are warning the markets could shut down or implement new rules, though the Treasury secretary said that's not going to happen. But the economy itself, more door-closing, as you said, today's casinos, bars restaurants closing in Las Vegas, this in addition to the malls and retailers who said yesterday that they are going dark, Macy's, Nordstrom, Saks, Bloomingdale's, then Target and Best Buy reducing store hours as well. That will help those stores restock and clean. This is all coming as government officials are trying to put plans in place to contain the virus and stem the damages to business at the same time, more borders closed across Europe and North America, the U.S. and Canada agreeing to close their border, except for essential travel. The administration pressuring Congress to pass a $1 trillion package that would allow for paid sick leave, payroll tax cuts, expanded loans, unemployment insurance, as well as the cash checks that have been discussed.

This is an act that's normally put in place to build tanks and ships and submarines and guns and things like that. Instead, it is going to be used, as Chuck Schumer there on the Senate floor implored the president to do earlier today, produce things like personal protective equipment, those respirator masks, as well as desperately needed ventilators.

It's going to take that kind of spirit to defeat this. But here's the problem. Eighty percent of the work force is going to be impacted by the containment policies. The money we're spending to deal with health care is going to pale in comparison with the money we spend to stabilize the economy.

We're using the full power of government in response to the Chinese virus. I declared a state of national emergency that will make up to $50 billion in disaster relief funds available, which we can use to assist hospitals -- which, as you know, we need. I asked states to set up emergency operation centers and hospitals to activate emergency plans. And they've been fully notified. We're urging hospitals to cancel all elective medical procedures. My emergency declaration allowed us to waive regulations to give nurses and doctors maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and to protect our frontline professionals that we've authorized through telehealth nationwide, which is really becoming big stuff -- telehealth. It makes it a lot easier for patients, and it really has been working out amazingly well. We empowered states to authorize tests developed in their state. And we are working with the private sector to rapidly expand testing capacity. We have literally rebuilt that whole system. It was an obsolete system, and it's been rebuilt. And a lot of good things are happening. We've ordered 500 million N95 masks to drive private production. American manufacturers are repurposing factories. One major manufacturer has already doubled capacity, and we've asked construction companies to donate unused masks. And they have actually, quite a few of them -- the construction companies. Who would think that? But they're going to be donating unused masks. And the Defense Department is making millions of masks available for health care workers. And we're asking every American to make major changes to reduce social interactions over the next two weeks. As we all know, we must make shared sacrifices, and that's what we're doing as a country. It's been amazing to see the way the country has come together. There's tremendous spirit. And even Republicans and Democrats are getting together -- for the most part, but they're getting together.

The President spoke today to the leaders of physician organizations from around the country. We garnered from them recommendations about how we can further support those of you that are coming alongside Americans that are impacted by coronavirus. And as the President said, we are absolutely committed to bringing the full resources of the federal government, the full resources of the American economy to work with states across the country, to be there for Americans struggling with coronavirus. But at the same level of priority, the President has made it clear that we are to make sure that the men and women who are serving those patients, and -- the nurses, the nurse practitioners, the emergency room nurses so well represented here and around the country -- are in the forefront of the President's mind. And as he said, we've taken decisive steps. We've enabled the expansion, availability of N95 masks. And Congress has worked a bipartisan way to make those more available. We're working on gowns and gloves and all of the personal protective equipment that all of you rely on every day. And I look forward to the discussion today about how we might be most helpful. But I hope you will carry back the gratitude of your President and of our entire team on the White House Coronavirus Task Force for the work that all of your members are doing every single day. They are the hands and feet of American compassion, and every American is grateful to our nurses."

They're fully engaged as of about two hours ago. And tomorrow, we're having a -- what I think will be a very interesting news conference, and I think you know what that's all about. So, we'll see. The FDA will be -- they've been working very, very hard, and I appreciate what they're doing. And I think we have some very interesting things that will be brought up tomorrow at the news conference.

If you're a bar owner or business owner, and you have had to shut down, you can go to the Small Business Administration, and get a loan to pay your employees up to $80,000 per employee, and we will forgive that loan for the first six weeks, to keep the paychecks coming.

So, the number one issue for me -- and I'm a broken record here -- is, I want you to have an income stream until we can contain the virus, not a one-time payment from the government.

And, in China, I believe 16 million residents are still in a lockdown of themselves spread across the country.

Obviously, we have to determine the percentage of police officers who themselves contract the coronavirus. So, it's a fluid situation. It has to be monitored on a daily basis. We have had in this city, and in other cities too, we have had some experience in this regard.

You know the last time that happened? Right after John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. That's how long it has been. So, Sin City has stopped. And it's not the only city that's like that. So, beyond stocks and all of that, when people don't leave their homes, when they don't get out, when they don't do much of anything, because, well, they can't, what do we do? We get the market watcher Gary Kaltbaum to help us with the impact of all of that. Gary, what do you think?"

I tell you, I'm hearing about tranches this, tranches that, and this deal and that deal and who's going to get this They may have to do this a dozen times going forward, or else -- because you see what markets do. And I have to tell you, I have studied every crack in the market going back to 1900. Some of these areas of the market, unprecedented. So keep fingers crossed.

      "utterance": "Samples had to be sent to the CDC in Atlanta. That obviously took quite a bit of time. These labs in Miami, Jacksonville, Tampa, since February 22, they have tested a total of 1,653. But if you look, just a week ago, that is a pretty significant increase to where we were a week ago. And then during the week of March 8, private laboratories began processing COVID-19 laboratory tests. So, Quest, LabCorp, there's other CLIA-certified labs. They do have to report the results, because this is a reportable disease. So they do the testing, and then the Department of Health gets the information, the basics. So they have been doing that. Now, obviously, we're going -- there's going to be a little lag sometimes in the information, as we see more of the drive-through testing. When that gets sent to private labs, a lot of times, the people, they're going to get a text message. And they will know certainly before the Department of Health knows what the result was. And then, at that point, that's when the investigations would begin. But they have done on the private side 2,050 tests. So if you go back a week, 10 days ago, I think that's probably three- or four-fold increase of where we were. I think we need to do way more tests than that. So that was one of the things. As soon as we declared the state of emergency, you had this stuff with the HHS kit. I asked Jared to get as many kits as possible. So we have now distributed 2,500 test kits, so each kit can do a number of tests. I think the total for 2,500 kits is over 600,000 individual tests. But what I have learned on this is, like, just getting a test kit doesn't mean you can just do the test. You got to get other parts. So Department of Health and DEM have distributed 200 negative and 200 positive controls. So that goes. That's another component to doing the test. And then we also are working on making sure all the labs have enough reagents to be able to do the test. But probably the biggest supply issue that we're seeing -- well, I'd say there's two big supply issues. One relates really specifically to testing. The other relates to everything. Just specific to testing is the swabs to take the sample. We put in an order probably a week-and-a-half ago for a half-a-million swabs. We have not gotten that fulfilled yet. We have also asked the federal government. We're in discussions with HHS and asked them to send. If we have enough swabs, and we set up the drive-through sites, you can swab people. Some of the state labs and private labs here in Florida could do it, but then the rest can be sent to Quest and LabCorp. So a huge supply of swabs will let us ramp up the number of people that can be tested very, very quickly. So I have told Jared, do whatever you can to get the swabs. Certainly, the president, that would be the one thing I would say would be helpful, that and the PPE for the health care workers. When you're doing these testing, you got to be in this special equipment, PPE, so that you don't catch the virus. Some of this stuff's not reusable. I mean, you think like, you just -- you got to use a new one every time. And so that stuff is in short supply. So I have been talking with a lot of hospital folks, and that's one of the main supply needs they have. But I think that's probably going to be nationwide. If you look at the last two, three weeks, this is probably the biggest rush to get medical supplies in the history of the United States. But we can't have enough PPE right now. So, the swabs, the reagents and the PPE, if we get more of that in, we're putting the infrastructure in place. And, hopefully, we would be able to greatly expand. And my view is, if you look at the different countries that have faced this, to me, the one that's been most successful, South Korea, because they were able to really do a lot of testing. They didn't do draconian controls on their population. They promoted social distancing. But they were able to do the test, do the investigations, isolate the proper people. And if you look in Florida right now, we have about 50 percent of our cases are Miami-Dade and Broward counties. The rest are kind of spread out here or there. Some counties don't -- I think a majority of our counties still don't have any -- or close to -- don't have any positive tests yet. So you have community spread in Broward and very likely Dade. Obviously, we want to know how many asymptomatic people are carrying that. And so if I have the materials, if we can get that in Florida, we would be able to expand the number of people and the categories of people who would be able to come in and get tested. So, that's what we have been working on nonstop. And I have learned a lot about how this works. But, hopefully, we're getting in the right place on that. The other thing I would say that hospitals have done, most of the hospitals in the state, have started to..."

She's trying to put together a day care right now, and child care, adjacent to or at some of our hospitals, nearby our nursing homes as well, doing everything we can to make sure that our first responders are able to keep working. Look, we also had at the meeting housing commissioner, DSS, mental health, all the other things that get unleashed when you are confronted with a crisis like this. You look at the number of folks who are homeless. And if you're homeless, and you get infected with COVID-19, where do we put you? Where can we find you, so you have a safe place you can be? We're trying to find additional facilities, field hospitals, other places, so that, for those in need of just intermediate care, no longer in a crisis or critical condition, they can free up beds in our hospitals and make space for others going forward. Look, we have been in contact with all of our regional governors. Josh can tell you about some of the other things we're doing together. We just issued a declaration as regards our major malls. We're going to be closing them down here in Connecticut, like they are in Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey, again, one more place where people are likely to congregate, one more place where people might get infected. And we're doing this out of love for each and every one of those citizens of this great state. We just put up the electronic billboards up and down our highways. It says, if you're sick, stay home. If you're over 60, stay close to home. Heal thyself. These are the messages we're trying to share. Look, I'm going to introduce you to Renee Coleman-Mitchell, our amazing commissioner of public health. I just want you to know that we have been planning for this."

And it seems to be well-coordinated among parties and whatever their disposition, whatever their points of view, very similar, as I said at the outset, to the feeling of camaraderie right after 9/11. Let's hope that stays, because we all need that -- after this. The doctor joining me right now, he's independent -- I'm sorry -- I will say this right. Dr. Shaman, I'm sorry. I have very -- trouble seeing here today. Doctor, let me ask you a little bit about the fear that these cases grow a lot, because the flip side is, if we get more and more cases, we -- the denominator gets bigger. So, fears about the death rate growing larger are somewhat mitigated. That seems like macabre way to look at it, but how do you feel about that?"

      "utterance": "Right.  SHAMAN: And so that the epidemic in itself is what we call self-limiting as the cycle goes through. But the problem that we have here is that, because this is a newly emergent virus, to which nobody has natural immunity to, it's going to go through an enormous portion of the population before it settles down and goes away. So, we're really looking at something, realistically, if we didn't have control measures in place, that would infect 50 to 70 percent of the world's population within a couple of years."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So you're an epidemiologist. All right, so you know about this. You also know about the fears that now it's a global pandemic or whatever. A lot of people hear that, Doctor, and go, whoa, whoa, whoa, how much worse can this get? What is your sense of things? I know there's no way of knowing, but what do you think?  SHAMAN: Well look, I think we have to be very clear-eyed about what the worst case is in a very realistic way. The virus that we're dealing with here, unfortunately, has the right combination of characteristics that allows it to be particularly problematic and deadly. And those are really two things, firstly, that in the majority of people, it causes only mild symptoms. It's the type of thing that you and I would get in the winter, you get a cold, and you're like, you know, I will just take some ibuprofen, I will go to work, it's not a big deal, I will go shopping. We want to go out to a restaurant or a bar or movie theater, not a big deal, send the kids to school. The problem is that is that it then distributes the virus out in the broader community. Now, for most viruses, that's not a problem, because they don't cause a lot of mortality at the same time. But this one has what we would call a fat tail. There's a portion of the population, particularly the elderly and those with chronic conditions, that are at extreme risk for severe complications and mortality. So, not only does it have this component where 80, 90 percent of people are going to be mildly infected, but those people who are not mildly affected, who have to go seek clinical care and see a doctor, many of them are winding up in the ICU and are going to die. So the consequence of that is that, if we're looking at 50 percent under the population the world getting this, because it spreads so easily, because there's so many of these undocumented cases, let's say that's 4.2 billion people, right?"
