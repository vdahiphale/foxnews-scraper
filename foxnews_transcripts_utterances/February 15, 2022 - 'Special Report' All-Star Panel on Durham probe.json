U.S. and NATO have rejected Moscow's demand to keep Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations out of the alliance, halt weapons deployments near Russian borders, and roll back forces from eastern Europe. But western powers have agreed to discuss other security measures that Russia had previously proposed.\" What about where we stand tonight?

And the good news is the president gave a very good statement today. Not one inch of a NATO country can be invaded without triggering the defensive response of every NATO country, so we should give props to the president for clarity on that. But the bad and the ugly is, why are we rushing arms to Ukraine at this late minute? It's not like this is a surprise? Putin had been menacing the country since 2014. And the ugly party is he's actually played the last four administrations, including Trump's, pretty well in terms of surprising us all the time. At some point we're going to figure out Putin is a mafia- like figure who is running a gas station, to quote Tom Cotton this morning. But we haven't figured it out yet.",

There are some Republican voices, like Josh Hawley, who thought that that would have been a good idea, but the west has stood pretty firm on that.

He hasn't even alleged that the information that they brought to him was in any way fraudulent, although it has been suggested that it's misleading. And Durham is operating from a premise that the government officials were duped, not that they were in on it. I think if you're going to have a Watergate style bonanza of a conspiracy, and we'll have to see what Durham's final product looks like, but you would think that the government officials in that kind of an arrangement would be driving the train.

Gordon Liddy and the only people who are going to get penalized for this are him, and Perkins partners aren't going to have to pay any liability. But if Sussman doesn't say anything, I think what Andy just said about the fact that it's a one-on-one conversation with the FBI general counsel in a weak false statements case, right now Sussmann is staying very strong, silent, and pushing back.

      "utterance": "I think there ought to be a lot more coverage, Bret, because it's very alarming. But you do have to keep reminding yourself that the only thing that Durham has alleged at this point is in connect with Michael Sussmann, the Democratic Party connected lawyer, the only thing he has alleged is that he misled the FBI about who his clients. He hasn't even alleged that the information that they brought to him was in any way fraudulent, although it has been suggested that it's misleading. And Durham is operating from a premise that the government officials were duped, not that they were in on it. I think if you're going to have a Watergate style bonanza of a conspiracy, and we'll have to see what Durham's final product looks like, but you would think that the government officials in that kind of an arrangement would be driving the train. And here what Durham is basically saying is that they were saps."

      "utterance": "Any prosecutor wants to have somebody cooperate and go higher. So that's always thrumming in the mix. But what I see, Bret, is that there's an interest allegation that's made, but it doesn't change the underlying facts of the case. And from Sussmann's perspective, at least from his lawyers are saying, they think it's a weak false statements case because it's only Sussmann and the FBI's general counsel in the room, so it's one guy's recollection against the others. It's not transcribed, it's not recorded, and they think that James Baker, the FBI's general counsel, has made different versions of what happened on different occasions."

      "utterance": "\"The Wall Street Journal\" has this, \"Trump really was spied on. White House communications are supposed to be secure, and the notion that any contractor -- much less one with ties to a presidential campaign -- could access them is alarming enough. The implication that the data was exploited for a political purpose is a scandal that requires investigation under oath. The unfold information underscores that the Russia collusion story was one of the dirtiest tricks in U.S. political history. Mr. Durham should tell the whole sordid story.\" And Hugh, the question is, will he, and when?"

      "utterance": "Well, it depends on Mr. Sussmann. It seems to me that the analogy that Sussmann is, he's either going to be John Dean, who was the desk officer for Watergate who rolled over and made a deal with the prosecutors and brought everyone down, or he's going to be G. Gordon Liddy and the only people who are going to get penalized for this are him, and Perkins partners aren't going to have to pay any liability. But if Sussman doesn't say anything, I think what Andy just said about the fact that it's a one-on-one conversation with the FBI general counsel in a weak false statements case, right now Sussmann is staying very strong, silent, and pushing back. So I just don't have a lot of optimism that this goes big unless he rolls over like John Dean did and rat everyone out."

      "utterance": "Yes, we don't know if there's anybody to rat out. That's the problem. This is one little piece of an investigation. So far, as you've just explained, the only crime that has been alleged is a false statement to the FBI. We've got to see what Durham comes up with, if anything."

      "utterance": "The media double standard here is absolutely glaring. As you mentioned, Bret, no time spent on any of the networks. \"The New York Times\" and \"Washington Post\" didn't even cover it until today when they each spent about 1,500 words defending it, downplaying it, explaining why it wasn't a big deal, after we just spent years and years of the media running with far less. If this was any sort of filing regarding Donald Trump is all we would be hearing about from the media day in and day out. And so that to me is the troubling issue here. The media has again revealed itself as putting their thumb on the scale for one side and not the other."

      "utterance": "Tom, how does this poll? It's interest to hear Democrats say, and we had Congressman Smith on last night, saying people care about more important things. But rewind the tape a few years to the early part of the Trump presidency and it was all about the Russia investigation. But how does this part, the Durham part, poll?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Well, obviously, it's split heavily along partisan lines. It depends on where you sit. If you are a Republican, it gets very important if you. If you are a Democrat, it's not important to you at all. Overall, in the general mix of things, it's pretty far down the list, the economy, inflation, and crime, and the like. But certainly, when people are asked about their trust in government institution, it is a factor. It's a contributing factor. It's something that has been in decline for a long time, and this only adds to it."
