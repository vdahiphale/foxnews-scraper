Given the varying accounts of what happened and outright lies that he told the media, why on earth is Phillips being treated like a delicate flower while a kid who did nothing is grilled? Why haven't the media actually examined the background of Mr. Phillips as well?

That's patently unjust, it's ridiculous. Now look evil still exists and of course racism does exist but this is a 1950s when minorities were denied opportunities across the board and when hateful stereo types were broadly applied to them. They genuinely suffered. Thankfully things have changed. Of course, pocket of racism still exists and always will but in the wake of the civil rights movement, opportunities for all minorities now our vast. The election of minorities to Congress, the Senate. Appointments of minorities to the Supreme Court and of course, the election of a black President. The success of minorities in academia, in business and sports and entertainment, it's inspiring. Black or white or yellow or brown, we are all children of God. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } No one should be profiled as a thug or gunned down for wearing a hoodie at night. And no one should be profiled as a racist and threatened for wearing a MAGA hat.

Meanwhile as frustrating as the current Washington stalemate is, things are actually - believe it or not - getting better in America. Just about everyone of all races and creeds have more money in their pockets to spend which means people should generally be less and not more angry and dissatisfied. But Democrats can't have that going into the next election, can they? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Happy voters, they don't want them. Nick Sandmann didn't cower or run away when he was confronted by the drum beating provocateur or those other angry black activists. Too often Republicans first instinct even one innocent is to back down or apologize in order to placate the left. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But here is a kid who with grace and dignity, maybe looking a little goofy but he's a kid. He smiled, he stood his ground and he refused to be bullied even today. He wasn't standing up either for white privilege or minority privilege but for American privilege. The privilege to believe what you wish and not to be attacked for it. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now to react is Michelle Malkin, syndicated columnist and host of Michelle Malkin Investigates, it's fantastic, on CR TV. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Along with Democratic strategist Scott Bolden, it's great to have you both on.

Each attorney is going to have 30 seconds to lay out the case, followed by rebuttal. Now if the judge needs more information, each of you will have an additional 30 seconds to explain. At the end, I'll bang the official gavel and give my ruling. Court is in session. First on the docket tonight, a New York man is now reportedly facing manslaughter charges after defending himself and his family against a home intruder. \"The New York Post\" reporting that Joel Christopher Paul went after Shamel Shauvo with a bat or knife after Shauvo tried to break into the home. Shauvo later died at a Queens hospital. Now months later, Paul is being charged in his death. Robert, you have 30 seconds for your opening argument.",

This is not a case where someone was simply at their home defending themselves and defending their family. They went above and beyond what was required and what was proportional to stop the attack.

Oh, is the light on? Where is the light? Yes, it's on there. They're working throughout the night as a deal on the wall and then end to the shutdown could be on the horizon. Well, we have some latest news that might throw some cold water on that. Mercedes Schlapp from the White House will join us in just a bit. And the Ingraham court is in session. I love this segment but first the privilege that matters that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Unless you've lived under a rock these past few years, you might have heard of a phrase tossed around by liberals that's designed to make you feel guilty. Well, guilty if you're not a minority.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "On the internet. Got to get right on that. Given the varying accounts of what happened and outright lies that he told the media, why on earth is Phillips being treated like a delicate flower while a kid who did nothing is grilled? Why haven't the media actually examined the background of Mr. Phillips as well? Why didn't Savannah ask him for instance, why he passed himself off as a Vietnam combat vet when in fact he was a reservist serving at home who is incidentally also arrested for assault and even at one point escaped from prison? No big deal. Perhaps Mr. Phillips gets the benefit of the doubt in this case and others because among the media elites, he enjoys something you might call, minority privilege. In other words his heritage and his grievances both real and imagined entitle him to special treatment and consideration. And by the way, if you dare question his motives or his opinions then you're a racist, period. That's patently unjust, it's ridiculous. Now look evil still exists and of course racism does exist but this is a 1950s when minorities were denied opportunities across the board and when hateful stereo types were broadly applied to them. They genuinely suffered. Thankfully things have changed. Of course, pocket of racism still exists and always will but in the wake of the civil rights movement, opportunities for all minorities now our vast. The election of minorities to Congress, the Senate. Appointments of minorities to the Supreme Court and of course, the election of a black President. The success of minorities in academia, in business and sports and entertainment, it's inspiring. Black or white or yellow or brown, we are all children of God. No one should be profiled as a thug or gunned down for wearing a hoodie at night. And no one should be profiled as a racist and threatened for wearing a MAGA hat. With 2020 around the corner, I'm afraid, this is all just going to get a whole lot worse. Instead of looking beyond race, American elites are using it cynically to divide us and to scare up new voters, they hope. Meanwhile as frustrating as the current Washington stalemate is, things are actually - believe it or not - getting better in America. Just about everyone of all races and creeds have more money in their pockets to spend which means people should generally be less and not more angry and dissatisfied. But Democrats can't have that going into the next election, can they? Happy voters, they don't want them. Nick Sandmann didn't cower or run away when he was confronted by the drum beating provocateur or those other angry black activists. Too often Republicans first instinct even one innocent is to back down or apologize in order to placate the left. But here is a kid who with grace and dignity, maybe looking a little goofy but he's a kid. He smiled, he stood his ground and he refused to be bullied even today. He wasn't standing up either for white privilege or minority privilege but for American privilege. The privilege to believe what you wish and not to be attacked for it. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now to react is Michelle Malkin, syndicated columnist and host of Michelle Malkin Investigates, it's fantastic, on CR TV. Along with Democratic strategist Scott Bolden, it's great to have you both on. Scott isn't it now beyond obvious that Mr. Phillips was given the benefit of the doubt over these kids principally due to his native American heritage?"

They didn't get the benefit of the doubt and let me say this, the black Israelites and the kids, they were beefy, that's one beef. But the second beef had to do with Phillips who was praying and banging his drum and the kids were doing tomahawk chops and not moving and I don't know what the intentions of the young man Sandmann were.

We never talk about the fact that minority conservatives have gotten the worst, most vile attacks, at least over the last 25 years that I have been a minority of color who happens to be a conservative in public life of being accused of race traitorism. Of being accused of \"selling out our community,\" when so many minority Democrats are the ones that are selling out their people and more and more and you see this now, it's an extraordinary movement of independent minded minorities who are leaving the so called ideological plantation and braving the slings and arrows of that.

Once the threat was neutralized, once the person had left the home, they followed him into the street. At that point, the homeowner and his brother proceeded to beat him with a baseball bat and stab him until he died. This is not a case where someone was simply at their home defending themselves and defending their family. They went above and beyond what was required and what was proportional to stop the attack. At that point, they should have, once they were probably individual, went into the house, called police, and allowed that person to be arrested by law enforcement."

It says that government shall not infringe on our God-given rights to defend ourselves. And just because they are using a bat and a knife, he is defending his family for my home invader.

It's New York, who doesn't love New York? But New York has a lot of problems in the city. And I hear residents complain all the time. I used to live there. It's been a while, but I go there a lot. There's a lot of problems in New York. You've got a lot of still homeless problems, you've got a lot of veterans on the street. You still have a lot of trash on the street, a lot of filth on the street, people shooting up in the alleyways. Doesn't New York kind of have its hands full with the problems that are already there?
