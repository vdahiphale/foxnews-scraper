You know, I heard a minute ago Admiral Kirby make reference to that the Biden administration, I think he said, quote, we're still digesting what happened back in August. Joe Biden's surrender and disastrous retreat from Afghanistan is -- is the worst military catastrophe for the United States in decades. And the consequences -- at the time I said, as a result of this incredible weakness, all of our enemies across the globe are looking to Washington, they are taking the measure of the man in the Oval Office. And, as a result, as I said back in August, the chances of Russia invading Ukraine have just risen tenfold, the chances of China invading Taiwan had just risen tenfold. We're seeing the first of those two shoes dropping today because of Biden's weakness. But, Bill, it's even worse than that. We had in place bipartisan policies to prevent what is happening right now. Specifically, in 2019, I introduced legislation, targeted sanctions directed at the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Nord Stream 2 is the pipeline that Putin is building from Russia to Germany. The reason he's building the pipeline is that it skips Ukraine. It goes right around Ukraine. Why? Because the real insurance that Ukraine had against invasion is that Putin has to take his energy, his natural gas, in pipelines that go through Ukraine. Once he builds Nord Stream 2, he no longer has to worry about those pipelines. In 2019, I authored sanctions, bipartisan sanctions in Congress, they passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities. President Trump signed my sanctions legislation into law. And Putin stopped building the pipeline the day President Trump signed those sanctions. That pipeline was dead for over a year until Joe Biden became president and Putin began building that pipeline again on January 24, 2021, four days after Biden was sworn into office. Why? Because he knew what was going to happen -- was going to happen, which was that Joe Biden formally waived sanctions on Russia, on Putin, and gave the green light to build Nord Stream 2. That is why we have over 100,000 troops and Russian tanks on the border of Ukraine preparing to invade. That's why we're on the brink of war in Europe.",

He refuses to do it. And they said, number two, provide lethal military aid. Give us the weapons to defend ourselves. And -- and, you know, I finally -- last month I forced a vote in the United States Senate on sanctions on Nord Stream 2. Every single Democrat in the Senate had voted for my sanctions legislation twice previously. But the difference was last time you had a president within and \"R\" behind his name. Now you've got a president with a \"D\" behind his name. When we voted, I won a bipartisan majority, a big bipartisan majority, 55- 44. But the Democrats filibustered the bill. They demanded 60 votes, ironically while at the same time they were calling the filibuster Jim Crow racist relic from the past. That same day they were filibustering to protect Russia and Putin, and 44 Democrats gave in to political pressure from the Biden White House. They voted in favor of Russia, against sanctions.

Joe Biden was part of an administration that was seen as by Russia as weak, particularly after they moved in 2014 to take the Crimea region of Ukraine. They saw him -- saw President Biden, one of his first actions was to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline. It's not an accident that in May, after Biden had waived the sanctions on Nord Stream 2, for reasons that are still inexplicable, that Putin went and issued a 20-page paper on the historic unity of Russia and the Ukrainians not only laying claim to Ukraine as being an integral part of Russia, but also suggesting that the Baltics and parts of Poland and Slovakia were also historically Russian and should be reunited. And then we had, of course, a defense budget where it was 2 percent increase but a 16 percent increase in non-defense spending and the defense budget being heralded as a new weapon against climate.

Now, we can quarrel about things in the past, but we have to look forward. You -- you -- you've rightly noted with Mr. Kirby on this morning that our NATO partners, the purpose, resolve, and unity is greater than it's been in 20 years. The president and this team has advanced -- has -- has -- I should say, ordered the advancement of weapons to Ukraine to ensure -- or to help them protect themselves. Diplomacy remains on the table. And we have all of the punishing sanctions in place if indeed he does invade. Now, has it been perfect? No. No lead-up to war is perfect. But I think it's important as we look at where we are today -- Jennifer's reporting is so critical because if indeed we've intercepted this kind of communique against -- with the mid-level and upper-level commanders, and it seems that -- that -- that some sort of invasion is imminent, I think the president's words today before the Security Counsel will be heard and resonate around the globe.

I think what is different from last August is that those NATO allies -- and I've been speaking to many of the top leaders of our strongest allies -- and they say that what the Biden administration did this time that they didn't do last August if they built a very strong alliance, and they have been informing those NATO leaders, including Germany. And, Germany, I would take issue with, has actually been on board. In terms of off-ramp's, the off-ramps are very limited at this point. There will be a debate as to whether the secretary of state should actually go ahead with a meeting with Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, slated for next Thursday if, in fact, Putin invades in the coming days, which is expected. So that is going to be a key point. But what officials have told us is that Russia always loves to talk while they are invading. I'd also like to take one issue -- point of issue with what Karl said. The appeasement of Vladimir Putin goes back far before the Biden administration. If you go back to 2007, Putin, in Munich, at the Munich Security Conference, stated what he planned to do in terms of rebuilding the Soviet Union. Robert Gates was the defense secretary at the time. President Bush, who Karl worked for, was the president. Shortly thereafter, Putin invaded Georgia. The U.S. and NATO did not do anything, did not do anything significant. That began -- Putin has been doing this. And then under President Trump, I remember traveling to NATO headquarters with Secretary Mattis, and that's when there was a feeling that President Trump was going to pull out of NATO during those four years. That did incredible damage to NATO unity. Right now what we're seeing, I think, is a much more unified NATO because they see how very dangerous Vladimir Putin is.",

The Ukrainian president has called for a meeting with the Russian President Putin, but this week, President Biden said he's convinced that Putin has decided to invade, a move that would rattle world markets, disrupt global energy supplies, and challenge the international order. In a moment, we discussed the new assessment with Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby, but we begin with team FOX coverage. Steve Harrigan on the ground in Kyiv where tensions are still high. Mike Tobin in southern Poland, where U.S. troops have been deployed by the thousands. But first, let's begin with Mark Meredith at the White House to find out where we are today. Mark, hello."

We don't know when we'll be back. The old and the young grab what they can carry and flee by bus and train to Russia, where President Putin promised evacuees $130 each. Ukraine's president bristled at the repeated warnings from the U.S. of a Russian invasion. It means crushing the national currency, he says, money being taken out. Can you live in a kind of country?

I think we've been very consistent about that. And when you look at what we're seeing, Bill, when you -- and some of this is in plain sight. You can see it through commercial satellite imagery. He continues to, as the secretary said yesterday, uncoil his forces and make them ready to poise -- to strike at any moment. So, I don't think -- I don't think we're sort of hammering over individual pieces of rhetoric here. What we're seeing actually happen is Mr. Putin act on certainly what looks to be very clear intentions to invade Ukraine again."

He has a lot of options available to him, and I think, you know, we wouldn't want to, you know, speculate that just because President Zelensky is out of the country for a few hours, that that would be his moment. He has had many moments and he has many moments going forward, Bill. He has options available to him. One of the options of course, and you mentioned this a little bit earlier in the show, is diplomacy, and we hope that's the option he chooses when his foreign minister gets to sit down with Secretary Blinken later in the week."

And we mean this as a very strong message to Mr. Putin and as a deterrent. If you pull the trigger on that deterrent, well then, it doesn't exist anymore as a deterrent. He has not conducted another invasion in Ukraine yet and we want to get -- we still think there's time to prevent that. So it's supposed to be a deterrent. If you -- if you punish somebody for something they haven't done yet, then they might as well just go ahead and do it. So we're holding that in advance and we're hoping that that could affect the calculus of Mr. Putin."

I mean, you -- just to the intro to this piece this morning, Bill, you showed the full court press by this administration to try to find a diplomatic path forward. And we have made serious proposals. Obviously, we met -- we met by the Russians in a reciprocal way, but we've made serious proposals about ways that we can change things that we're doing in Europe to try to address the situation there and to try to address some of Mr. Putin's concerns. Obviously, some things are clearly off the table, but we've made serious proposals, and we want -- we want the Russians to respond in kind to that."

That is not something that Mr. Putin can simply institute a veto over, or decide for himself. That kind of thing is, again, between the alliance and Ukraine."
    },

      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "We have -- we have made serious proposals and talked about changing, for instance, the scope and scale of some of our exercises in Europe, being willing to talk about offensive missile capabilities in Europe. We have -- we have certainly put forward other proposals to try to convince Mr. Putin that we're -- that we're serious."

      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "Okay. What has the administration learned from the chaos out of Kabul last August?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Well, we're still digesting what happened in August, Bill. I suspect that your question is trying to, you know, get at sort of anything we learn from August that we're trying to apply now. They are two very different circumstances, Bill, and there's not a lot of parallel between what we're seeing now in Ukraine and what we see -- what we saw in Afghanistan. We were ending a 20 year war there and we were dealing with a massive evacuation of a lot of people, 124,000 in the course of two weeks. This is not the same situation. This isn't -- this is actually trying to prevent a war from happening. And that's why, back to your earlier question, all of our administration officials have been out and about trying to find a diplomatic path forward, and at the same time, here at the Department of Defense, shoring up our NATO allies, making sure they know that we're with them and that our commitment to Article Five, collective self defense, is one we take very seriously."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Well, I certainly won't speak for the secretary of state. I work here at the Pentagon. But I would tell you that I suspect Mr. Blinken will, again, make clear that we are serious about trying to find a diplomatic path forward, that we are serious about wanting to avert a war. And I think he'll also make it clear that if Russia does this, they do it with diplomatic options left on the table. They won't have an excuse that merits any sort of credibility about why they went forward when there was a diplomatic path forward. They will choose this war, and Mr. Putin will be responsible for the casualties and the suffering and the sacrifice, the destruction, that will result -- as a result of any kind of military action."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "So, Putin -- I mean, just this week, they talked about genocide at the U.N. They talked about mass graves. Is there proof of that? Or can you outright deny that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "You have seen over the course of just last week, Bill, these sorts of outrageous claims. I'm not going to get into each and every one of them, but it is absolutely right out of the Russian playbook. He may be moving X's and O's around the field right now militarily, but it seems like he's using the same old playbook. And I don't want to make light of this analogy. This isn't a football game. This is potentially a war and lives are at stake here -- tens of thousands of lives are at stake here. So, we -- if you look at some of the things we've seen, you can go right back to 2014 and say here he is, he's claiming that he's the victim. He's claiming that Ukraine, incredibly Ukraine, surrounded by more than 150,000 Russian troops, is somehow going to attack Russia. I mean, these are just not credible."

      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "Uh-huh. One last question here today. Insiders say and they believe that Putin thinks he can buy anyone, and that would include the country of Germany and the pipeline for natural gas that's been installed. Now, it must make many Americans wonder, do we care more about this than some Europeans do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Well, I would tell you -- again, not speaking for other European countries. When we were in Brussels, the secretary had a chance to meet with the defense ministers of all our NATO allies. It was apparent to him coming out of there -- and he said this publicly -- NATO is more united, more resolve, more resolute than he's ever seen it in his entire military career, and I believe that's the case. We're all alarmed by what we are seeing."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Every country has to look at this their own way through their own prism. What I can tell you, though, Bill, is we've been sharing information with our allies and partners as we get it in near real-time. We did that again in Brussels this week. They are seeing the situation the same way we are seeing it. Every country has to decide for themselves how they are going to respond and react. But I'll tell you, and look -- not just the secretary, I was a naval officer for a long time. I did a lot of NATO exercises and NATO things in my career. I too -- I too have never seen the alliance really more unified and resolved. The one thing that Putin says he doesn't want is exactly what he's getting -- a very strong, unified NATO on his western flank."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRUZ",
      "utterance": "Not remotely. And -- and, tragically, Europe is on the verge of war because of the weakness, the fecklessness of -- of Joe Biden. You know, I heard a minute ago Admiral Kirby make reference to that the Biden administration, I think he said, quote, we're still digesting what happened back in August. Joe Biden's surrender and disastrous retreat from Afghanistan is -- is the worst military catastrophe for the United States in decades. And the consequences -- at the time I said, as a result of this incredible weakness, all of our enemies across the globe are looking to Washington, they are taking the measure of the man in the Oval Office. And, as a result, as I said back in August, the chances of Russia invading Ukraine have just risen tenfold, the chances of China invading Taiwan had just risen tenfold. We're seeing the first of those two shoes dropping today because of Biden's weakness. But, Bill, it's even worse than that. We had in place bipartisan policies to prevent what is happening right now. Specifically, in 2019, I introduced legislation, targeted sanctions directed at the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Nord Stream 2 is the pipeline that Putin is building from Russia to Germany. The reason he's building the pipeline is that it skips Ukraine. It goes right around Ukraine. Why? Because the real insurance that Ukraine had against invasion is that Putin has to take his energy, his natural gas, in pipelines that go through Ukraine. Once he builds Nord Stream 2, he no longer has to worry about those pipelines. In 2019, I authored sanctions, bipartisan sanctions in Congress, they passed with overwhelming bipartisan majorities. President Trump signed my sanctions legislation into law. And Putin stopped building the pipeline the day President Trump signed those sanctions. That pipeline was dead for over a year until Joe Biden became president and Putin began building that pipeline again on January 24, 2021, four days after Biden was sworn into office. Why? Because he knew what was going to happen -- was going to happen, which was that Joe Biden formally waived sanctions on Russia, on Putin, and gave the green light to build Nord Stream 2. That is why we have over 100,000 troops and Russian tanks on the border of Ukraine preparing to invade. That's why we're on the brink of war in Europe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "But now, in 2022, this Congress can't even agree on sanctions. And it is true, the president could go ahead with some sanctions as well on his own. But that to the side. The White House had been very aggressive in calling out Russian tactics and they've done it very publicly, by the day, I would argue. Would you concede that's worked so far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRUZ",
      "utterance": "No, it hasn't worked at all. If you look at what the Ukrainians want, they've been very explicit. They've said two things. They've said, number one, if you want to stop a Russian invasion, they've asked the United States explicitly, put sanctions on Nord Stream 2, right now, today. Joe Biden could do that this morning. He refuses to do it. And they said, number two, provide lethal military aid. Give us the weapons to defend ourselves. And -- and, you know, I finally -- last month I forced a vote in the United States Senate on sanctions on Nord Stream 2. Every single Democrat in the Senate had voted for my sanctions legislation twice previously. But the difference was last time you had a president within and \"R\" behind his name. Now you've got a president with a \"D\" behind his name. When we voted, I won a bipartisan majority, a big bipartisan majority, 55- 44. But the Democrats filibustered the bill. They demanded 60 votes, ironically while at the same time they were calling the filibuster Jim Crow racist relic from the past. That same day they were filibustering to protect Russia and Putin, and 44 Democrats gave in to political pressure from the Biden White House. They voted in favor of Russia, against sanctions. And, explicitly, the president of Poland, the prime minister of Poland, the president of -- the president of Ukraine, the prime minister of Ukraine, the president of the Ukrainian parliament, all explicitly said, if you want to stop this invasion, sanctions Nord Stream 2."

What -- what Durham alleged is the federal prosecutors, the special prosecutor, is that a lawyer for the Hillary Clinton campaign conspired with a big tech executive to monitor and spy on Donald Trump. To spy on him at his home, to spy on him at his office, and -- and indeed they were spying on the White House itself. They were spying on a sitting president. That -- that is -- you know, you and I both remember when -- when President Trump said the Democrats are spying on me, and -- and the corporate media collectively laughed at him, they mocked at him, they -- they -- they said, what a ridiculous claim for him to make. Well, if what -- what Special Counsel Durham is alleging is true, that -- what -- what Donald Trump said was absolutely right. And -- and to the extent Hillary Clinton is complicit with this, her campaign is complicit with it, her lawyers are complicit with it, big tech is complicit with it, if this is true, it's a lot bigger than Watergate.

What the president said is that only African American women are eligible for this slot. That -- that 94 percent of Americans are ineligible. Merrick Garland, whom -- whom Barack Obama nominated to the Supreme Court -- Merrick Garland was told, sorry, you're the wrong skin color and wrong gender, you're not eligible to be considered. I think our country has such a troubled history on race, we ought to move past discriminating based on race. The way Biden ought to do it is to say, I'm going to look for the best justice, interview a lot of people. And if he happened to nominate a justice who -- who was an African American woman, great. But, you know what, if Fox News put a posting, we're looking for a new host for \"FOX News Sunday\" and we will only hire an African American woman or an Hispanic man or a Native American woman, that would be illegal. Nobody else can do what Joe Biden did. And there's a reason for that. Racial discrimination is wrong. Now, that being said, when we have a nominee, I'll consider that nominee on the record. And I'm confident the Senate Judiciary Committee, we will have a vigorous process examining that nominee's record. And I -- what I can tell you right now is, we're not going to do what the Democrats did with Brett Kavanaugh. We're not going to go into the gutter. We're not going to engage in personal slime at attacks. We're going to focus on the nominee's record, on substance and what kind of justice she would make. And that's the constitutional responsibility of the Senate."

      "utterance": "Well, based on the reporting that I've been doing over the last few days, what we're seeing, and we heard this from the defense secretary, that the Russian military on the border with Ukraine is basically uncoiling. What does that mean? It means that more than half, at this point, of those forces are now moving into attack positions. That is a significant term in terms of military doctrine. That means that they are gassing up those tanks, they are moving, they have left the barracks, they are living in the fields, and they are just a few miles from the Ukraine border. They have not been given the order to cross the line of departure at this point. But what we are seeing, and \"The Washington Post\" is reporting this morning, that the intelligence that led to Biden saying that he believes Putin has taken the decision for an invasion, that that came from intercepted conversations and orders given down to those lower-level troops from -- from mid-level commanders. And so what we're seeing is the battle space being prepared right now for what I'm being told would be a significant invasion. He has the architecture in place for a massive invasion that would include taking Kyiv. And the people -- it's very notable that there's a National Security Council meeting this afternoon.

      "utterance": "Well, as of recently, they've been playing it pretty well, I think, in part because the threat of Putin taking Ukraine unifies our allies in Europe. But let's be honest, Putin is not just looking at what this administration has done recently. He's looking at the whole frame. Joe Biden was part of an administration that was seen as by Russia as weak, particularly after they moved in 2014 to take the Crimea region of Ukraine. They saw him -- saw President Biden, one of his first actions was to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline. It's not an accident that in May, after Biden had waived the sanctions on Nord Stream 2, for reasons that are still inexplicable, that Putin went and issued a 20-page paper on the historic unity of Russia and the Ukrainians not only laying claim to Ukraine as being an integral part of Russia, but also suggesting that the Baltics and parts of Poland and Slovakia were also historically Russian and should be reunited. And then we had, of course, a defense budget where it was 2 percent increase but a 16 percent increase in non-defense spending and the defense budget being heralded as a new weapon against climate. And then, finally, we have the Afghanistan debacle in August. And I think all of these have emboldened Putin. And so doing well recently, but the run-up to this has been -- has been very dangerous for us."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAROLD FORD, JR., EMPOWERMENT AND INCLUSION CAPITAL CEO AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, first off, happy Sunday. I think market implications, military implications, are all on the table. I think we have to put a little of this into perspective. And I've heard some this morning try to sort out old political grievances. I remember being in Congress when we were facing these kind of challenges on a national security stage, united at home. First off, Putin has never accepted the fact that the old USSR lost the Cold War, and he continues to try to revise the outcome. Crimea, Georgia, now now. Now, we can quarrel about things in the past, but we have to look forward. You -- you -- you've rightly noted with Mr. Kirby on this morning that our NATO partners, the purpose, resolve, and unity is greater than it's been in 20 years. The president and this team has advanced -- has -- has -- I should say, ordered the advancement of weapons to Ukraine to ensure -- or to help them protect themselves. Diplomacy remains on the table. And we have all of the punishing sanctions in place if indeed he does invade. Now, has it been perfect? No. No lead-up to war is perfect. But I think it's important as we look at where we are today -- Jennifer's reporting is so critical because if indeed we've intercepted this kind of communique against -- with the mid-level and upper-level commanders, and it seems that -- that -- that some sort of invasion is imminent, I think the president's words today before the Security Counsel will be heard and resonate around the globe. And it's clear that Putin's real, real concern here, Bill, is that he's losing ground. His relevance, he has to try to assert and inject himself. And what better way than to do this. I think the real audience -- where I agree with -- where I agree with Karl wholeheartedly -- is that China is -- is the audience that our national security -- our national security apparatus is probably looking at even more so than they are looking at Putin right now."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Bill, first of all, I would say that I don't think it did take a long time to get those NATO allies united. I think what is different from last August is that those NATO allies -- and I've been speaking to many of the top leaders of our strongest allies -- and they say that what the Biden administration did this time that they didn't do last August if they built a very strong alliance, and they have been informing those NATO leaders, including Germany. And, Germany, I would take issue with, has actually been on board. In terms of off-ramp's, the off-ramps are very limited at this point. There will be a debate as to whether the secretary of state should actually go ahead with a meeting with Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, slated for next Thursday if, in fact, Putin invades in the coming days, which is expected. So that is going to be a key point. But what officials have told us is that Russia always loves to talk while they are invading. I'd also like to take one issue -- point of issue with what Karl said. The appeasement of Vladimir Putin goes back far before the Biden administration. If you go back to 2007, Putin, in Munich, at the Munich Security Conference, stated what he planned to do in terms of rebuilding the Soviet Union. Robert Gates was the defense secretary at the time. President Bush, who Karl worked for, was the president. Shortly thereafter, Putin invaded Georgia. The U.S. and NATO did not do anything, did not do anything significant. That began -- Putin has been doing this. And then under President Trump, I remember traveling to NATO headquarters with Secretary Mattis, and that's when there was a feeling that President Trump was going to pull out of NATO during those four years. That did incredible damage to NATO unity. Right now what we're seeing, I think, is a much more unified NATO because they see how very dangerous Vladimir Putin is."

The further west you get from the -- from the Gulf of Mexico, along the Rio Grande River, the bigger the shift. And that's because you're getting deeper into energy country. So you've got a Democrat -- former Democrat truck driver who's making $110,000 a year because he's got a CDL license, and his wife is doing pretty well with the cafe in Uvaldi (ph) because there's a lot of -- you know, there are a lot of oil field people coming in and having lunch and leaving a nice tip. And suddenly you have the Democrats saying, you know, geez, the green new deal is terrific, let's end the reliance on hydrocarbons. And then you take the border, you take conservative values, you take respect for law enforcement, that includes the Border Patrol. There are a lot of people in south Texas who have a family member in the Border Patrol. And then you look at growing concern about farming and ranching and you've got an explosive combination here. We are likely to see two very competitive, congressional races in the fall, in south Texas, in which the likely Republican candidates are Latinos.

I would argue the body politic is stronger -- I'm a blue dog Democrat -- when you can have an honest and open debate within the party about where we go, but that debate should be centered around responding to people's needs. I would argue that this debate is not only happening, Bill, in the Democratic Party. You see it in Wyoming in the Liz Cheney race and you even see it in Texas, in the Bush-Paxton race. The body politic is strengthened when you actually have a robust debate and you, more importantly, respond to people.

More than 70 percent of the people who live in San Francisco voted against them. Now, this is a district represented by Nancy Pelosi. Eighty-five percent of the voters went with Democrats in 2020.

But San Francisco was very interesting, because what happened, this was organized to remove three members of the board who had tried to pull in a certain direction that it was Democrats who removed them.

There are going to be lots of people working at the state and local level running from legislature who are going to be talking about things like no mask mandates and curriculum transparency and upholding schools of excellence and meritocracy. This issue is going to be repeated across the country."

      "utterance": "Harold, \"The Wall Street Journal\" was more succinct, writing in their editorial page this, if it can happen in San Francisco of all places, Democrats should be worried. The woke may wake up to a far bigger shock in November. Virginia was mentioned twice, once with Jen and once with Karl there were Republicans swept the state less than three months ago. Are the voters already ahead of the politicians?"

      "utterance": "The voters are always ahead of the politicians and that's why the results change so frequently and rapidly year after year. Extremism can be rejected in San Francisco by Democrats. I hope it happens more. And extremism is rejected by Republicans and Democrats alike when anybody goes off the deep end. Lowell High School, which Jennifer referenced there, is the high school there in San Francisco where the lottery is being -- instead of meritocracy, being replaced. Parents are standing up and politicians would be well, well advised to listen to them."
