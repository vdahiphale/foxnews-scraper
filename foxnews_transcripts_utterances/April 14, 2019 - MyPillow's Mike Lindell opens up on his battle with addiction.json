And for me, a lot of things had to happen and I lost a 20-year marriage and had all these things happen in the mid-2000s.

So I was hiding out down there and I come out of the room and three of the biggest dealers, I didn't even know they knew each other and I said, \"What are you guys doing?\" The one guy goes, \"Mike's been up for 14 days.

I ran out of crack and I was doing one of these numbers and I headed down to the street of Minneapolis, about 2:30 in the morning, couldn't get drugs anywhere. And I went out, I was very resourceful, and nothing. I come back upstairs, all defeated. And he's standing there waiting out now for me and he says, \"Man, give me that phone. He says I'm going to take a picture of you.\" He says, \"You're going to need it for that book you've been bragging about telling us you're going to write,\" and he said, \"You've been telling us for years this My Pillow is just a platform for God and you're going to come back someday and help us out of this addictions and all the dealings that we have.\" And he says, \"We're not going to let you die honest.\" Because I would always tell these guys all the time.

That sounds horrible.\" But I my son hit me with that, and then in December of '08, something really happened that is very important to my story. My friend came to me and he was my equal. We had both did cocaine the same time in the 1980s started. We both were functioning addict throughout the '80s and '90s. In 2000, we both switched to crack about the same time and I heard he had found the Lord and been freed of these addictions for three years. And he came walking in I was all by myself this place out there. I had locked everything. I'm just a little pulse out there alive and, and within it with the company and stuff. And he came in I go, \"Dick, what are you doing here?? And he goes -- he goes, \"The Lord led me here,\" and I knew he had been straight for three years. I hadn't seen him in a year. And I go, \"Well, as long as you're here,\" I said, \"I've got some questions for you.\" I said, first one I asked him, I said, \"Isn't boring?\" And he goes, \"No man, it ain't boring.\""

And I knew that day, people say was that your bottom? Well, for money wise, I made sure I didn't have any money left because I knew I would be an incredible story to help people, a story of hope. I would always know these things as they were happening, something bad would happen. They go, \"Oh, that's going to be good in my book someday and help people.\" That was kind of weird thinking, but that day I knew my calling that God chose me for this to help people and with the addiction with everything that's going on.

And I'd be telling them, \"Hey, these drugs are bad.\" And I was telling about end times and Revelation in the Bible I read about in jail and they would quit that day and find Jesus and then I'd wake up like, \"I'm losing friends.

And I'm going to go, here's their hope matches because the closer you get to a match as a whole, here's your help, but here's the key thing. I'm going to tell you -- it's just like I'm selling to the addict. It's not the family. I'm talking to you, the addict, and to the addict. And I see you guys. Once you get out, I'm going to be there for. I'm going to have paid mentors all over the country that these addicts and I'm paying. They're going to be careers for them. That's all they're going to do. And now if they have a specific problem, there's an app, they'll put in, let's say that they didn't get that job.

I have an apartment complex with a waterbed. I became a carpet cleaner. You know, each thing I did, there was kind of -- it kind of manifested on a profit solution. But I want to say, having the passion, having faith, but here's one of the things I want to tell any entrepreneurs out there right now. One of the things I didn't have was a safety net. What we're living in right now with all these jobs and raises, you know, I mean, wages rising. I see it in my own company. I have 1,600 employees, but a lot of them now -- and these are careers. A lot of them are going out and taking the chance to starting their own little businesses and stuff because guess what? If they would happen to fail and learn from their failure, they can go back and do their job because there are jobs out there everywhere now. It's an amazing time we're living in for that. We are at this at this time, everybody -- don't be afraid. There is so many good ideas that are left on the shelf of people going, \"I've kind of great idea, but I just -- I'm afraid.\" Out of fear. Fear blocks all of that it's a false fear. If I didn't -- you know, all of the things that happened to me, you know deviations and I would tell you that -- I always -- I'm going to do a thing on deviations in my company. I have 1,600 employees, about 500 have my direct phone number. Well, I don't get calls, I only get calls when there's a deviation good or bad. So if there's peace, it's like, I can put it out of my head. And that's amazing. Now, if you're an entrepreneur, and no matter how big or small you are, if you watch those deviations, and you learn from them, and either focus on the good deviation or learn from the bad, and that includes failure. I have a friend of mine that I'm -- one of the smartest guys I've ever known. He's been working on something for four years. And it's got it -- he wants it to be perfect before he gets out there, and I go, you know what, if you've got that great idea and you don't do it, that's a shame. Get out there.

When do you combine them and it becomes a miracle? That's why I knew God was following me through that having that faith. But if you look back, most people you look back and say for entrepreneurs and ventures whatever, if something didn't happen here, you know, you wouldn't be here. When I got real big and then when I took you the five employees to 500, I took in tens of millions, a hundred million dollars in six months. At the end of it, I owed like five million. I had -- everything was done wrong. Other people had took advantage, but I learned from that and then I learned so much from that, and so another thing, too I want to mention for an entrepreneur out there or a business, learn from someone that you trust in that business so you can learn a lot and say, \"Okay, what have you done?\" And you know, so you don't have to -- all of this wasted time that you could save time on learning what he's done, his failures and his successes."

You know, was it wasted time? I think a lot of addicts look back and say, \"Wow, I wasted all that time.\" No, it's starting right here. There's Proverbs 356, \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Lean not to your own understanding, acknowledge him in every way and He will guide your path,\" and for me that became real -- not to look back and they say, with God all things are possible and I think, so there's really no regrets.

This is Mike Lindell, the sex crack-addict sitting with the President.\" And these are for me -- that's why I say like living inside of a movie. I think back to the old Mike in decades, it's like, I've been living - always kind of living inside of a movie with 14 near death experiences and all these things that I didn't think happen to normal people or anybody and I think -- and then and then all of a sudden, now you're here. If you took a thing -- one of the things to for me, is where I had that fear where I couldn't talk to people even two people at the same time. I was very shy. And now if you opened up a picture in the future, and there I'm speaking to 50,000 people, I would go, \"It ain't happening.\" And that's -- those are those two things that really get to me where I'm just - - I get goosebumps and go you know, God used my weakness of not being able to talk to be able to spread that and help."

That's why I know everybody really deep down, they are going, \"Wow, he's doing so good.\" But there's these this way over here, this force or whatever, that's trying to stop it and stop it.
