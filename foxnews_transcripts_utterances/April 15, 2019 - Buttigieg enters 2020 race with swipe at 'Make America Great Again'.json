A lot of those voters aren't so much younger than Bernie Sanders. So, while Pete Buttigieg is young and all that stuff, Bernie Sanders may be can make some hay out of saying hey, people over 70 are people too."

And this weekend, 2020 hopeful Kamala Harris released hers, showing an income of about $2 million in 2018. Beto O'Rourke just released a chunk of his, most recently from 2017 with an adjusted income of $366,000 and moments before our town hall, Bernie Sanders released his. Watch."

That's a lot of money varied and that money, in my case, my wife's case it came from a book that I wrote, pretty good book, you might want to read it. It's a best-seller, sold all over the world, and we made money. So, if anyone thinks that I should apologize for writing a best-selling book, I'm sorry, I'm not going to do it."

I wish everyone else could too and I hope he doesn't try to stop everyone from making money once he's made his, but no, he's done a very good job of making money and he should be a capitalist, but his policies really aren't there, as you and Bret so cleverly uncovered, but he is a silver tongue old fox, isn't he?"

The last two years he's paid a little over $0.03 on the dollar to charities. He doesn't pay much to the government. He doesn't pay much in charities. As art said, he's been a very, very successful capitalist and he isn't even apologetic about it. He says look, I'm not going to apologize for the money I made writing a book. It's much like what President Trump said, he doesn't apologize for his wealth. The only difference is that Bernie Sanders wants everybody else to pay a lot more in taxes but apparently isn't very interested in paying more himself."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

It's their, you know, it's their right to do whatever they want in charity so I don't begrudge him. He -- I think it was 3 percent, 3.6 percent may be, Art, but the whole basis of what he's talking about is that we all should want to give back more to even out the income inequalities in this country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "Well, he doesn't say we should want to. He says we will be forced to if he gets in. That's what he's going to do to the tax codes. And you know, what he doesn't talk about, Martha, which is really serious here, if I may, what he doesn't talk about, is how those taxes, when he is putting them on, will affect the economy. You know, whenever you do redistribution, and this whole thing was energy, was environment, was health care, was education, all of that, whenever you redistribute income, you take from those who make a little bit more and you give to those who make a little bit less. By taking from those who make a little bit more, you reduce their incentives and they work a little bit less and produce a little bit less. By giving to those who have a little bit less, you provide them with an alternative source of income other than working and they too will produce a little bit less. Now this is math. It's not -- it's not right wing, left wing, Republican, Democrat, it's not liberal or conservative, it's just plain economics. Whenever you redistribute income you reduce total income. And that is what he's doing. And I am very afraid that if he were elected, we would have an enormous crash in the market. Now that crash would come in anticipation of his election, but it's much like Obama, who I believe was the reason why we have the Great Recession. As he got closer and closer to winning the markets collapsed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this, though, Art, because he talks about income disparity and the fact that CEOs in this country make -- I forget the multiple, something like 300 times the average worker makes. That is a problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "Well, it is a problem and most of those CEOs get their things because they have relations with government rather than producing great products at low cost that benefit -- if you look at any of the major companies, much of their operation is relations with the government. We have all of these taxes, all of these regulations, we should move to a low rate, broad-based flat tax with no exceptions, no deductions, no exemptions, no exclusions and let people get back to working. But when you have a tax rate of 40 percent, people will spend 40 percent of their time trying to diddled their taxes rather than working and producing goods and services. It's just common sense. They focus on where they can make the most, and today, companies can make the most by lobbying government and it's been true for the last 20, 30 years, ever since we left office. I'm just joking."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "Well, I didn't -- I think it's just the wrong answer, totally the wrong answer. What we need is transparency. We need to know what medical services cost. We need to know the quality is of the people providing those things. We need full transparency in the medical and let people make good decisions on their own with their own income as to what to do with their own health care. But we need transparency so people know what costs and what the purposes and benefits will be from getting that. But transparency is critical to a free market and our medical system is the farthest thing from a free market. We need to bring it back to a free market through transparencies."

The myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back. It comes from people who think the only way to speak to communities like ours is through resentment and nostalgia. They are selling an impossible promise of returning to a bygone era that was never as great as advertised to begin with."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I disagree with pretty much everything he said. How horrible that a presidential candidate, someone who wants to run our country, is talking about not making America great. I actually don't understand his strategy with that. But the difference is that you can't refute it if it's working, Martha, and it's working for the people of this country. We see under this president so much success, economic success, manufacturing jobs coming back to this country. The people that he was specifically referring to are the ones who are feeling the biggest benefit from this president. So, I wholeheartedly disagree with everything he said, and especially, again, as someone who wants to be the president of our country, to say that he doesn't want it to be great, make America great is a myth, it's not a myth if it's working and it's working every single day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right, let's talk a little bit about Bernie Sanders, who went after the -- your boss in the reelection campaign, also your father- in-law, President Trump, basically saying that, you know, that it's been a myth and that he has basically benefited the rich people in this country and that that is creating a scenario of great economic inequality in America and he wants to sort of even everything out through some economic redistribution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, we are here, April 15th, Tax Day, and people are seeing on average across this country that they are saving around $1,200 apiece, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of this president passed. A 2.7 million new jobs created last year. The economic benefit that this president has given to the people is being felt everywhere and so for someone like Bernie Sanders to come in and say that he doesn't agree with that or that he wants to reverse it, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me because what is it that he and all of these other candidates in 2020 are running on? When you have a country that is doing as well as the United States is doing under this president. And I saw the DNC chair was saying that promises were not kept by this president. This president, of all presidents, Martha, has kept on most every single promise that he made to this country and we are feeling it every single day. So, I know Bernie likes to talk a lot."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "My gosh, we are back to the tax returns. So, there is no law that says that a candidate has to release their tax returns. This is just something that has happened over the course of many years in this country, and it's kind of become a standard practice. But Donald Trump said in 2016 he was under audit. He legally -- his counsel told him he could not release his tax returns. They advised him against it. I think he listened to them, quite smartly. He is still under audit; he is still not releasing his tax returns. The people in 2016 of this country did not care about it. I don't think they care about it now. It seems to be a good talking point, though, for the Democrats because Russia was not sticking as we saw."

As my cameraman Mal James, just zoomed beyond me and show you what we are seeing across the River Seine. We are seeing two different fire hoses still being applied to the cathedral. From time to time we see the glowing embers burn up. We're also seeing some of the smoke come up. This more than seven hours after this fire started some 6.30. Experts are not exactly sure what caused it but they believe it have to do with renovation work on that spire you were talking about. Again, this is an 850-year-old structure in need of renovation and somehow that apparently cause this fire. It's not believed that arson or other means was responsible for that. The fire burned through this cathedral very fast. But the good news is that the structure is intact. The towers are intact.
