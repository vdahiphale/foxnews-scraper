The Democratic Party is the biggest political party in the country. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The fact that there are a lot of people voting for a Marxist -- they can call him a Democratic socialist all they want.

      "sentences": "You're totally correct. In fact, when I go to conservative groups across the country, and I say, Bernie Sanders can be President of the United States, I'm usually met with scoff -- you know, people scoffing and dismissing it. No, it can happen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } When I visit college campuses, more so than almost anyone on the Conservative circuit. You know, Turning Point USA, we're on 2,000 high school and college campuses across the country. I'm getting daily, if not hourly, Intel reports of exactly what's happening on the ground. And I can tell you that there is a base of supporters that can grow, you know, rather significantly ahead of the election that Bernie Sanders can capitalize on. And look, I, for one don't want to go the way of the Democrats in 2016 and be just so dismissive of the other party nominee and say that person can't be President. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So we don't know if Bernie Sanders is going to be the nominee or not. But we do know that his rise is fueled by a broken culture, and a culture that we as conservatives have not engaged in enough especially on college campuses. The university system in particular, and the thousands of professors that occupy most of the History Department and the Humanities Department, have been teaching the next generation to hate our country and they have not been teaching them American history properly, if not at all, they've not been teaching them, the founding of our country. And when you're not thankful for something, Mark, why would you want to conserve that something? If you're not thankful for our country, of course, you would want to support a revolution to overtake it. And it's rooted in no understanding of economics, no understanding of exactly what the idea of free actually means. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And so what I do every single day is to try to bring the ideas of freedom and liberty and the Constitution to these college campuses. And a little point of optimism on it, though, there's an extraordinary amount of young people that are waiting for this message to be heard, because they have been silenced by the intelligentsia, if you will, on college campuses that believe that there should only be one set of ideas on these university campuses. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

What can I do about the rise of socialism in our country? And you hit the nail on the head, it's government run schools that are the primary culprit for why this has happened. Bernie Sanders is just a byproduct of a broken culture. He is exploiting a generation that has been trained to be victims. He is exploiting a generation and a populace that wants to take other people's money away. And that's -- it's very easy to be generous with other people's money.

The norm was a permanent serf class, and a despot dictator or ruler exploiting the citizenry, and people dying for some war, probably by the age of 30 or 35.

It was -- basically the title is not \"Wealth of Nations,\" it's an inquiry into the cause of wealth of nations because he was so curious as to why certain countries and certain areas specifically in Scotland where we got the Scottish Enlightenment were doing so much better than others.

It still wouldn't be correct, and that would be a violation of the tenet of liberty.

And after the Reagan revolution and Mark, you informed me on so much of this through your writings and through your radio show. The Reagan revolution was incredible. It was an economic Renaissance. We took communism head on. But unfortunately after HW Bush -- right after Reagan, we got HW Bush, we lost our way a little bit. We raised taxes. The Federal bureaucracy almost grew further with some of the people that Reagan pushed out. And so I'm fearful that what if we don't learn the lesson of the Reagan revolution? We don't put into writing the doctrine of the Trump era, because I don't want post Trump, the Republican Party or the conservative movement to go back to status quo, ruling class technocratic government, essentially philosophy. I think there's something so special about this President and what he's done for our country. He has restored impartial -- the impartial judiciary through Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. The economic success is unprecedented. The lowest ever black unemployment, Latino unemployment, Asian-American unemployment. We are finally energy independent, 10 million people off food stamps.",

And the answer to that question is large in part times, no. And President Trump has, I think, changed the entire conversation on China for the better in Washington, D.C., which I consider to be American greatest geopolitical foe. President Trump has upended the conversation in the Middle East, where he is ending, endless and perpetual wars, while also going after the terrorists that wish us the most harm, Qasem Soleimani and Al Baghdadi. He is unafraid to stand with our allies such as Israel, to move the embassy in Jerusalem and recognize the Golan Heights. And you ask yourself the question, why didn't past Republican Presidents do this in the last 20 years? Why would it take a billionaire businessman from New York to upend the political system? And the argument I make in the book is because from that second, he announced, his motives were correct. His motives were not to get invited to D.C. cocktail parties. It was, he looked at the country as something that he loves so much, and he was tired of seeing it being taken advantage of. So here's the question, will it be a Trump moment or a Trump movement similar to the Reagan revolution that gave us some of the greatest thinkers and writers and people such as yourself. I want to see President Donald Trump start a new renaissance of conservatism for the next 100 years and looking at it as 26 years old, I see him as an amazing inspiration and that's exactly why I wrote this book.",

He engages the culture in the terms of getting the left to finally be on defense, the first time in my life where I've seen the left actually be on defense, where he calls the media out for their outright activism for the Democratic Party.

We're told the Republicans might as well resign to the fact that the youth are going to go Democrat -- worse, socialist, and I want to explore this with you. I think this is a very, very important topic, and you've also written a magnificent book, \"The MAGA Doctrine: The Only Ideas that Will Win the Future.\" And really it relates to the topic. So let's, let's jump in here. First of all, I have said the conservatives better stop celebrating what the Democrats are going through with Bernie Sanders. The Democratic Party is the biggest political party in the country. The fact that there are a lot of people voting for a Marxist -- they can call him a Democratic socialist all they want. I know what he is. He knows I know what he is. He won't come and sit in that chair where you're sitting right now, so he and I can discuss it. This is very troubling to me, and I don't think we should be rooting for Bernie Sanders to be the nominee for the Democratic Party, am I wrong?"

In fact, when I go to conservative groups across the country, and I say, Bernie Sanders can be President of the United States, I'm usually met with scoff -- you know, people scoffing and dismissing it. No, it can happen. When I visit college campuses, more so than almost anyone on the Conservative circuit. You know, Turning Point USA, we're on 2,000 high school and college campuses across the country. I'm getting daily, if not hourly, Intel reports of exactly what's happening on the ground. And I can tell you that there is a base of supporters that can grow, you know, rather significantly ahead of the election that Bernie Sanders can capitalize on. And look, I, for one don't want to go the way of the Democrats in 2016 and be just so dismissive of the other party nominee and say that person can't be President. So we don't know if Bernie Sanders is going to be the nominee or not. But we do know that his rise is fueled by a broken culture, and a culture that we as conservatives have not engaged in enough especially on college campuses. The university system in particular, and the thousands of professors that occupy most of the History Department and the Humanities Department, have been teaching the next generation to hate our country and they have not been teaching them American history properly, if not at all, they've not been teaching them, the founding of our country. And when you're not thankful for something, Mark, why would you want to conserve that something? If you're not thankful for our country, of course, you would want to support a revolution to overtake it. And it's rooted in no understanding of economics, no understanding of exactly what the idea of free actually means. And so what I do every single day is to try to bring the ideas of freedom and liberty and the Constitution to these college campuses. And a little point of optimism on it, though, there's an extraordinary amount of young people that are waiting for this message to be heard, because they have been silenced by the intelligentsia, if you will, on college campuses that believe that there should only be one set of ideas on these university campuses."

And you see Republicans and I see some who are in broadcast, and they -- they're actually giddy.

We defeated communism when the Berlin Wall fell down, but then we fell asleep at the wheel and we've allowed the same Marxist ideas to infiltrate the minds of our most prized possession in our country, which is our young people. And so you're exactly right, Mark, when you say that, we should not be celebrating the rise of a Marxist and you're all of a sudden seeing ideas that otherwise would be considered radical in the Democratic Party now become mainstream. And so I get people -- people ask me all the time, what can we do about this? What can I do about the rise of socialism in our country? And you hit the nail on the head, it's government run schools that are the primary culprit for why this has happened. Bernie Sanders is just a byproduct of a broken culture. He is exploiting a generation that has been trained to be victims. He is exploiting a generation and a populace that wants to take other people's money away. And that's -- it's very easy to be generous with other people's money. In fact, what you and I have to communicate to the American people, liberty and freedom is actually a harder sell, if you will. It's harder to tell people to work harder or wake up earlier or metaphorically pull yourself up by the bootstraps. Well, Bernie Sanders is talking about his student loan forgiveness, debt cancellation, universal and free healthcare."

The question I always ask people is, do you think America is going to be more or less socialist in 10 years? And the only correct answer to that question is what's happening in culture. What are students reading? Are they reading the Founding Fathers? Do they understand American history? Are they appreciative of this gift that we've been given from God?

Plato also argued against the nuclear family. Aristotle said, no, actually, I think private property serves a role. I think that if you try to take people's stuff away, all of a sudden, you're going to take away their meaning and their ability to pass on wealth and ideas to the next generation. This divide between Aristotle and Plato is playing out today in our politics. And we have to understand that Bernie Sanders does not believe private property is a right. And we kind of just get away from this as conservatives. We don't mention that in the original drafts of some of our founding documents. It was life, liberty, and private property. And you informed me this at a young age by listening to your radio show. Now why is that important? Well, if you don't believe that being able to own private property is a right, well, then, of course, we can take away one sixth of the American economy and healthcare. If you don't believe private property is a right, then you actually don't own your own speech."

He was someone that argued that private property was the worst thing ever, yet, he lived like a plutocrat and as essentially part of the one percent. And so to your point, you have people in the so-called ruling class that are arguing for Marxism, what they're really arguing for is more power and control for themselves. They actually don't want to live under the very proposals that they are offering to the populace or offering to the people -- they are offering to the citizenry. And so what I think is so instrumental here, though, is if the left had their way, what would they allow in terms of private property? Because they would take our guns away. They would take our speech away. They would take our right to privacy away and the Fourth Amendment. And so this is the fundamental disagreement right now, where, if any journalists had an ounce of integrity, they would look Senator Sanders in the eye and they'd say, do you believe private property is a right? And he would probably tried to dance away from it, but eventually he would say no. And that's the core debate that's happening right now."

And the left actually hijacks this language against us. They use it incorrectly when talking about life, in talking about abortion, they say, well, it's your body, your choice. Well, that's a deeper discussion for a different time. However, what they're trying to say, they're trying to play on the tendency of young people to want to be free. They're arguing that human beings should have sovereignty over their own choices. That's really what they're getting at, which is actually a Lockean natural rights argument for governance. That our rights come from God, not from government. Bernie Sanders doesn't believe rights come from God. I don't even know if he believes in God.

You're stealing it from men and women who get up every morning and work for a living. This word liberty has been hijacked, too, like the phrase democratic socialism. There's no such thing. You're either a socialist Marxist or you're not. What does liberty mean to people who really understand and believe in liberty?"

But also that idea of liberty is quite honestly a new idea governmentally in the last couple of hundred years. Very few societies actually allowed citizens to have liberty in human history. In fact, the norm was typically the absence of liberty. The norm was tyranny. The norm was a permanent serf class, and a despot dictator or ruler exploiting the citizenry, and people dying for some war, probably by the age of 30 or 35. When liberty came around, not just economic liberty or personal liberty. You either have liberty or you don't. You don't get to pick and choose what kind of liberty you want. It's not some sort of buffet option. But that year of 1776 was so important not just because of the Declaration of Independence, but also because of the \"Wealth of Nations\" written by Adam Smith, and he did not create or invent capitalism, but he observed it. One can say he almost discovered it, and he was asking the question, why are certain countries richer than others? It was -- basically the title is not \"Wealth of Nations,\" it's an inquiry into the cause of wealth of nations because he was so curious as to why certain countries and certain areas specifically in Scotland where we got the Scottish Enlightenment were doing so much better than others. And what he found and what he realized and concluded, is this word liberty where people were allowed to make choices, people's lives actually got better. Here's the problem with liberty, though, is that liberty breeds apathy, and one of our genius Founding Fathers articulated that, which is when people have liberty, over a couple of generations, you're going to have hierarchies be created. So let's pretend, Mark, that there actually was enough money to confiscate from all the billionaires. It still wouldn't be moral. It still wouldn't be correct, and that would be a violation of the tenet of liberty. Because in order for them to get that wealth, they actually had to trade voluntarily with other people to make themselves rich and people equally as rich along the way."

The founding fathers were appreciating the sacrifice of the religious liberty, Judeo Christian values of the colonies. You have to understand that the people that came to America and founded the colonies originally, they left seeking liberty and freedom and put their entire life on the line. They could have died on the voyage over or they could have died of disease. There was no guarantee it would have worked out for them. And then they started to live under oppressive rule from King George and from the Monarchy, and they rebelled into the formation of the greatest, most prosperous, generous, benevolent civilization ever created in the history of the world. France, to your point was a rebellion not inspired by the American Revolution. That is a lazy interpretation of history. It was inspired by greed and that's what drives the collectivist and the socialists. They were upset that the French ruling class was living so well. So instead of having an American based revolution in France, where they wanted to restore natural rights and restore private property, they decided to begin what ended up being a decades' long slaughter of infighting, collectivist control. They tried what was called the Paris Commune for a very short period of time, it ended up being a total and complete disaster. I think it's rather instructive, because the left will always operate in predictable patterns. We can learn also from the Russian Revolution, which was different than the French Revolution. But this revolution right now -- this revolution that they're trying to do in America is a little bit of a mixture of both. The reason it's different, though, is that never before have we seen a Marxist revolution be so outwardly against the country they're trying to take over. The Russian Revolution, they actually disguised themselves as pro-Russia. They're actually trying to take over the country while convincing the populist it is a horrible and evil country."

We took communism head on. But unfortunately after HW Bush -- right after Reagan, we got HW Bush, we lost our way a little bit. We raised taxes. The Federal bureaucracy almost grew further with some of the people that Reagan pushed out. And so I'm fearful that what if we don't learn the lesson of the Reagan revolution? We don't put into writing the doctrine of the Trump era, because I don't want post Trump, the Republican Party or the conservative movement to go back to status quo, ruling class technocratic government, essentially philosophy.

      "utterance": "And it's because he, as a businessman -- and I write about this in the book -- has looked at every single issue analytically and asked himself the question, has the status quo in Washington, D.C. been benefiting the American people? And the answer to that question is large in part times, no. And President Trump has, I think, changed the entire conversation on China for the better in Washington, D.C., which I consider to be American greatest geopolitical foe. President Trump has upended the conversation in the Middle East, where he is ending, endless and perpetual wars, while also going after the terrorists that wish us the most harm, Qasem Soleimani and Al Baghdadi. He is unafraid to stand with our allies such as Israel, to move the embassy in Jerusalem and recognize the Golan Heights. And you ask yourself the question, why didn't past Republican Presidents do this in the last 20 years? Why would it take a billionaire businessman from New York to upend the political system? And the argument I make in the book is because from that second, he announced, his motives were correct. His motives were not to get invited to D.C. cocktail parties. It was, he looked at the country as something that he loves so much, and he was tired of seeing it being taken advantage of. So here's the question, will it be a Trump moment or a Trump movement similar to the Reagan revolution that gave us some of the greatest thinkers and writers and people such as yourself. I want to see President Donald Trump start a new renaissance of conservatism for the next 100 years and looking at it as 26 years old, I see him as an amazing inspiration and that's exactly why I wrote this book."

He engages the culture in the terms of getting the left to finally be on defense, the first time in my life where I've seen the left actually be on defense, where he calls the media out for their outright activism for the Democratic Party. And this President, he is open minded. This is a President in the past, you know, decades was not pro-life, and yet, he is the most pro-life president in American history. And he's unafraid to say I moved on this issue because I saw a real life instance of somebody that possibly could have been aborted and he is living a great life. He spoke at the March for Life. He's cut Planned Parenthood funding and he deserves great appreciation for this. He has stood for religious liberty better than any other President that I can think of since Reagan. And Israel, as I mentioned, embassy in Jerusalem, Golan Heights cutting funding to the Palestinian Authority, canceling the Iran Deal."

But what I love most about the President is his relentless commitment to delivering results to the people that voted for him and the people that didn't vote for him, the entire American populace. And this is really important because typically, you see politicians overly pander to the constituents that got them into office. The President has been unafraid to say, I was elected on putting China in check and better trade deals, but he's also going out of his way to deliver results for the black community, a community that predominantly didn't vote for him. Opportunity zones lowest ever black unemployment rate, lowest ever black poverty rate, criminal justice reform, record funding for HBCUs. He goes out of his way --"

He's gone out of his way to make sure that he is a president for all Americans, for bringing dignity back to forgotten America. And the main driving point behind this book that I think people can learn from is where to next? Not just next beyond Trump, but this next eight months. We have to know these principles better than ever before, because I truly believe we've been given a gift in this presidency. And I don't know if it's a gift that maybe we deserved it, maybe we didn't. But I'll tell you, what this President has delivered for our country is historic and it's something that has far exceeded the wildest expectations of many, many people in the entire kind of conservative intelligentsia. And so as we move forward and young people are looking for inspiration, I want us to further embrace this MAGA doctrine, not to go back to the ruling class Republican status quo of open borders and China appeasement and sending billions of dollars to Iran and being perfectly okay with that. But instead, a doctrine of sovereignty of American excellence, and American renewal."

Because finally, we have a leader of the conservative movement in the presidency that's unafraid to fight for principle, that gives young people the courage and conviction to stand up against the left. When they see President Trump go up against the media in a press conference, they say maybe I can go against my professor. When they see President Trump stand and sign that Executive Order that the media told him not to sign, they say, you know what, maybe I could start that Turning Point USA group or that Student for Trump group. And he gives us the conviction and the courage that we've been looking for from a politician, and long gone are the days of the Republicans that go along to get along with Mitt Romney and other names that we will not repeat. It's a new era for conservatism. One that is bold and one that will stand for American exceptionalism."

And so yes, it is a do or die election. Do I wish it was not the case? Of course not. But to your brilliant point, we are in a post constitutional period. And yes, this is the most important election of our lifetime, because every election is now the most important election of our lifetime, because the stakes just keep getting bigger and bigger. So I'm going to be visiting dozens and dozens of college campuses personally, from now to November, our network of thousands of campuses will be activated. And I'll tell you, Mark, this is a fight that I believe we're going to win, but it's not going to come easily. The left will not give us our country back if we ask nicely.
