The federal judge saying he was disgusted with President Trump's former national security advisor for lying to the FBI and warned that he could be sent to prison. The judge also sparking a media firestorm after questioning whether Flynn committed treason before walking back his comments. The White House is reacting today and it's standing by its criticism of the case and also blasting James Comey. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The first thing he asked him today is do you want to change your plea? No. Did the FBI do something bad? No. OK, so fine. I think in a way -- in the court of public opinion, that works a little bit. Flynn's lawyers did an excellent job of getting him to where he is, where he was going to get no jail time. But, again, with the judge, they have discretion, so sentencing guidelines are only that. They're guidelines. And the judge is basically indicating that he was possibly going to get jail time today. Flynn's team asked for a recess. They go back and they're going to delay it now for three months.",

It's a news hangover, right? This is the lingering headache and nausea from 2016 that won't go away. So the media here and elsewhere, it feels really dramatic. It's really important, but it's not. It's not. This is just the only game in town right now because it's the holidays, and because under Trump, the country is rolling along pretty well. Try to ignore the stock market because it's the end of the year. That tends to happen. But things are going along. We have declines in crime, terror. Optimism is high. So the media needs to focus on this thing, the Comey, the Flynn, the collusion. It's like a triangle of idiocy, right? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, I do believe he will get -- if anything happens he will get pardoned. And I think he deserves a pardon, if you compared to previous pardons, like this is nothing compared to the people that Clinton pardon. Clinton pardon like -- how many people on the last day? Well, 16 terrorists, 16 FALN terrorists he pardoned, people who tried to bomb our country or did bomb our country. So, if you say you think that Flynn doesn't deserve a pardon, read your history.",

So, so many things about -- the reason I think it's going to ultimately either get, you know, there's going to be a pardon. There's just so much nonsense here. One of the people interviewing him winds up being Peter Strzok, which is the guy who has, you know, those text messages, those anti-Trump text messages to his lover. The whole thing is a disaster.

What I find interesting is that if you look on social media or if you just look at the media in general, how sanctimonious they were when they're saying, like, \"no more thoughts and prayers.\" People would say, \"It's time for action.\" This is action. I mean, look -- it's multifaceted. Banning of bump stocks. We don't know if that's going to change anything. It wasn't in Parkland, but it was used in other crimes. Then you've got psychiatric -- changes in psychiatric and counseling, things like that. You have the armed protection piece. And you're allowing the administration to act. See, the whole point of this other stuff. They're fearful of enforcing any laws, because they're afraid of being punished themselves for being racist or whatever. That doesn't have anything to do with this guy, except that it allowed him, the program allowed him to get away with it. So what you're doing is, a lot of this stuff is based on research and not on emotion. No. 1, we know that deterrence works. Killers will choose a gun-free zone over the opposite. Any deviation from that is generally an accident. But they will -- if they see even an empty, parked cop car, they will drive by that. That's all you have to do. And the length of a gun attack is mitigated by the appearance of a second gun. So when somebody shows up and knows how to use the gun, the incident shrinks. So those are the facts that are based on this. And I think this is well- rounded. I think everybody gets something out of it. A lot a lot of gun- control people, they didn't like the bump stock stuff. We'll see if that helps. We -- then if you goe armed personnel that are trained, that will help.

And this is \"The Five.\" The sentencing for Mike Flynn being pushed back until March, after a dramatic day in court. The federal judge saying he was disgusted with President Trump's former national security advisor for lying to the FBI and warned that he could be sent to prison. The judge also sparking a media firestorm after questioning whether Flynn committed treason before walking back his comments. The White House is reacting today and it's standing by its criticism of the case and also blasting James Comey."

And we know that because James Comey told us that, and he said that the very reason that they did it was because -- the only reason that they did it, it was the Trump administration and they thought they could get away with it."

And then he said, well, you were working for a foreign government while you're working in the White House, talking about Turkey. And then, he got the dates wrong, had to correct that. What did you think about today's events?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's good to remember that judges have this discretion and this power and it's one of the reasons it's so important on who you put on the bench, right? So President Trump's focus from day one as president has been trying to get as many judges confirmed as possible. And the senate has been able to fulfill that. And so, Emmet Sullivan is known as somebody who -- he gets a lot of cases through his court. He is not shy about getting press attention. But, earlier this week -- well, I guess Monday, he went from hero to zero in a week, right? Because he asked, I want to know more about this situation. If you say -- you came here and you pled guilty, but you're saying now that the FBI agents like tricked you? So, I need to know more about that. And I want everybody to deliver their documents to me. So for a week, we spent having people think, oh, the judge is going to throw the whole case out, because of this thing. The first thing he asked him today is do you want to change your plea? No. Did the FBI do something bad? No. OK, so fine. I think in a way -- in the court of public opinion, that works a little bit. Flynn's lawyers did an excellent job of getting him to where he is, where he was going to get no jail time. But, again, with the judge, they have discretion, so sentencing guidelines are only that. They're guidelines. And the judge is basically indicating that he was possibly going to get jail time today. Flynn's team asked for a recess. They go back and they're going to delay it now for three months."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

Oh, we're going back to the gates. A couple of thoughts, the judge seemed very disgusted with Flynn, but I think it's because Flynn didn't give the judge what they -- what he wanted, right? It was something -- they didn't get everything they needed. It was like the judge wanted a PlayStation for Christmas, but he got, you know, a jumping rope. That's how I got from that. But I'm going to go back to the question that I asked that people hate, is this news? It's a news hangover, right? This is the lingering headache and nausea from 2016 that won't go away. So the media here and elsewhere, it feels really dramatic. It's really important, but it's not. It's not. This is just the only game in town right now because it's the holidays, and because under Trump, the country is rolling along pretty well. Try to ignore the stock market because it's the end of the year. That tends to happen. But things are going along. We have declines in crime, terror. Optimism is high. So the media needs to focus on this thing, the Comey, the Flynn, the collusion. It's like a triangle of idiocy, right? By the way, I do believe he will get -- if anything happens he will get pardoned. And I think he deserves a pardon, if you compared to previous pardons, like this is nothing compared to the people that Clinton pardon. Clinton pardon like -- how many people on the last day? Well, 16 terrorists, 16 FALN terrorists he pardoned, people who tried to bomb our country or did bomb our country. So, if you say you think that Flynn doesn't deserve a pardon, read your history."

Maybe he was going to come out and tell the judge I was set up, you know, I didn't really lie, and the judge was kind of asking are you really going to go that far. And the minute the Mueller's team heard that that was a possibility, they just dangled that Turkey consulting thing that he was unregistered as a foreign agent. And they're going to hit him hard if he doesn't do what they agreed to do."

      "speaker": "JEDEDIAH BILA, HOST",
      "utterance": "This whole story becomes so confusing because you can't reconcile it on so many levels. I can't reconcile why he lied. As someone who was, you know, incoming national security person, you would expect him to have some contact with Russian ambassadors. Why would he lie? Then you look at why you would be advised not to have lawyers present. If that's not shady, it certainly looks shady. Then you look at the fact that the agents knew essentially what he had said to the Russian ambassador. They already have the transcripts. So why are you going there and interviewing him for? You already know. Are you looking to entrap him? Then you have the 302, which is the FBI document about the report and it's filed nine months later after the incident. So, so many things about -- the reason I think it's going to ultimately either get, you know, there's going to be a pardon. There's just so much nonsense here. One of the people interviewing him winds up being Peter Strzok, which is the guy who has, you know, those text messages, those anti-Trump text messages to his lover. The whole thing is a disaster. I don't know how it's going to end. But you can certainly look at this, I think, and say Flynn shouldn't have lied. It was absurd that he did lie. He absolutely -- it's pretty clear to me that he did in fact lie and that is a problem. But also that this was some sort of bizarre set up to have him hopefully lie and appease certain people that were expecting him or wanting him to lie. It's really a mess."

And then he says, you know, look, I think there's no evidence that Strzok and Page -- oh, he says Strzok and Page may be deleted evidence. And then, of course, the reports that have come out said that's not true. So I'm thinking what is going on here? What's going on here is that all of a sudden this has become highly politicized, what's going on with Mike Flynn in a court of law. And you have a judge who's well respected, a judge who, by the way, throughout a conviction of Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican, once he found that the prosecutors he believed engaged in misconduct. So this is not a judge who is any, you know, weak willow. Oh, no. This is a strong, competent judge, well respected by both sides. But here is the thing, when you say to someone like Mike Flynn, you sold out your country. Jesse, I don't think there's anything more damning than that.

And then, once he becomes the national security advisor, you can't get much higher than that. This guy also had been head of the national security agency.

If you're in Afghanistan you want people say, you know what, the United States stands for what is right in this world, not that they're a bunch of murderers.  PERINO: All right. Jed, I just want to show you the president's tweet about this. He said, at the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a U.S. military hero, Major Matt Golsteyn -- Golsteyn, excuse me, who is charged with murder.

You're not just handing guns to any old people. Oftentimes it's military vets or people that used to work in law enforcement that are retired that I think would be a great option for people to come to the school and protect it. I think it's important because a lot of these schools that are in very rural communities, they get really nervous about if you call. You know, we're use -- I'm used to living in the city. You call the police, you know, you think, OK, they're going to be here really quickly. If you're in a more remote area, if you call for assistance, by the time those people can get to you, a lot of damage can be done. So, you need to have people that are on those sites that are able to -- you know, that are trained and are able to do that. A lot of people say, oh, well, you know, the classroom is too chaotic an environment. It's not safe. I can say as having worked in a classroom it would make me feel really comfortable if I had people that were trained and were carrying so that I knew that if there was a bad guy with an agenda that had a plan to do damage that they would be able to protect me and the kids."

So, instead of suspending or throwing them out, which is what I think happened with this kid, Nikolas Cruz, that instead you would do things like counseling, therapy, support of the like. What do you think?"

But I think what happened is, is they took a bad situation and I think the mechanism they used to correct it overcorrected. So now you have -- you're selling drugs, you're punching people in the face, you're hurting girls, you're disruptive and disrespectful to the teacher, they don't do anything to you. What -- we have one teacher in South Carolina said, you have a kid who finds out that you can say F-you to the teacher, flip over the table, run out of the classroom, can't suspend them. So once the kid knows you can do that, they'll do anything. So all they're saying is instead of putting them into these diversion programs like they did with this guy in Broward County, maybe if he does something terribly wrong, you have to hit him with a criminal charge. And I think that's a good idea."

There was pressure on the administration to look at some of the things that Obama had done, and they decided to do something different. And what I like about all of the report is that it's saying let local school districts decide. And I think that is where we need to be -- what we need to be doing, that those decisions are best made by the communities. And they know, as Jedediah was saying, some are rural communities. Some are urban communities. Let them decide. Including on discipline. I picked this up. I printed it, and I will share with you, Juan, if you want. But USA Today had 15 teams, and -- reporters, and they went out, and they followed teachers for an entire day, one day in September all across the country. It is shocking what these teachers have to go through. They deserve a lot more of our support, financial support. Some of that's the case. But also safety, from outside the classroom and also from inside the classroom. There's problems, too. So I'm all for this report. I think it's good that they put it out."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I -- I've seen different statistics including in Parkland, that are welcoming a lot of these changes. What I find interesting is that if you look on social media or if you just look at the media in general, how sanctimonious they were when they're saying, like, \"no more thoughts and prayers.\" People would say, \"It's time for action.\" This is action. I mean, look -- it's multifaceted. Banning of bump stocks. We don't know if that's going to change anything. It wasn't in Parkland, but it was used in other crimes. Then you've got psychiatric -- changes in psychiatric and counseling, things like that. You have the armed protection piece. And you're allowing the administration to act. See, the whole point of this other stuff. They're fearful of enforcing any laws, because they're afraid of being punished themselves for being racist or whatever. That doesn't have anything to do with this guy, except that it allowed him, the program allowed him to get away with it. So what you're doing is, a lot of this stuff is based on research and not on emotion. No. 1, we know that deterrence works. Killers will choose a gun-free zone over the opposite. Any deviation from that is generally an accident. But they will -- if they see even an empty, parked cop car, they will drive by that. That's all you have to do. And the length of a gun attack is mitigated by the appearance of a second gun. So when somebody shows up and knows how to use the gun, the incident shrinks. So those are the facts that are based on this. And I think this is well- rounded. I think everybody gets something out of it. A lot a lot of gun- control people, they didn't like the bump stock stuff. We'll see if that helps. We -- then if you goe armed personnel that are trained, that will help.

It happened in America. What was it, around the 1600s? I don't know. But I think overall, including Europe, it was like 50,000 people.
