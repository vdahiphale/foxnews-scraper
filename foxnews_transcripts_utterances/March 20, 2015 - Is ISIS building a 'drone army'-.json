It's becoming more commercially available. Shoot, one of my neighbors has a drone he flies around in our neighborhood just so show the capability that there is. So, there are benefits from having the high ground there so that they can survey, you know, have surveillance of the area that they maybe are about to strike or to pick up intelligence and so it really shouldn't surprise us.
