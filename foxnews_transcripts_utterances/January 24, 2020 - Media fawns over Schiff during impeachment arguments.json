      "sentences": "Welcome to HANNITY. We begin with a Fox News alert. A lot happening tonight, and moments ago, the Senate finally adjourned for the night. The Schumer-Schiff sham show part of it, oh, thankfully, is over, their repetitive nonsense -- more coming up. Also, tonight, we start with -- we are at the end of a huge week of massive accomplishments for the Trump administration. I doubt the mob and the media will talk about it. But a successful trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Remember, last week, it was the big China deal. It's going to help farmers, manufacturers. It's going to help our energy sector, service sector, oh, and our car industry, $220 billion in two years. The president then returned home to Washington in the swamp. He delivered a rousing speech at the March for Life rally. In doing so, he made history, the first president to speak of the largest pro-life rally in the country. Now, this is part of what we are calling the tale of two Americas, because while the president is advancing prosperity, every economic record, peace and security, end of the caliphate, Baghdadi, and, of course, Soleimani, for all Americans, across town on Capitol, what we've been witnessing? Really three long years, but a pathetic, delusional, psychotic, never- ending charade. And I regret to inform you that the Schumer-Schiff sham show, yes, we still have 24 hours, 16 hours, and then hopefully it ends, because you, the American people, I know you're busy. You work 12, 13, 14 hours a day. You're taking care of your kids. You pay your taxes, you obey the laws. You probably have more important things that you're doing every day than watch the -- well, compromised, corrupt, coward, congenital liar, Adam Schiff, spewing. It is insufferable. Nonstop venom, 24 hours. Let me fill you in on what you might have missed today. Thankfully, their ratings now bear this out. Hardly any Americans are watching. By the way, we want to thank you. And this is sincere from our heart. Thank you for making us number one again last night on cable news. Now, here's what's interesting. Network television, ABC, NBC, CBS, broadcast channels, they've barely got a million viewers. Less than 300,000 in the core demo. It's a disaster -- an unmitigated, unprecedented ratings disaster. And I'm not surprised, because over the past 24 hours, we've learned nothing new. Not one single thing. This has been mindless political theater, that's it. In fact, the Schumer-Schiff sham show, they're just still obsessing over the exact, same, thoroughly debunked -- believe it or not, not Ukraine, oh, they're advancing still the Russia conspiracy theories. Literally, Schiff is like drooling like three years ago. He looks like he's having, frankly to me -- not a professional -- like a mental, emotional breakdown at this point. Forget Ukraine, forget quid pro quo Joe, zero experience Hunter paid millions and investigations, the congenital liar, it's still all about, for three days now, not Ukraine -- Russia, Russia, Russia. Four investigations -- Russia. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Anyway, he is a raging lunatic. Day after day, month after month, this is three years. Over three years, this guy has been lying like a maniac, propagating a conspiracy theory, hoax. We had four separate investigations. We had, what, the FBI nine-month investigation, oh, no \"there\" there. We found nothing. Then, of course, we had the House Intel investigation. No evidence.

President Trump, you, we, the people, shocked the world. And late last night, there he was again, Schiff, overcome this time now by emotion. He didn't come to terms with his own rampant dishonesty and lies and that the four investigations proved he was a liar. He wasn't, by the way, being reflective of the damage that he's caused the country, the lies and conspiracy theories he's pushed, the smear, slander, besmirchment, the obsessive, compulsive discussion about never-ending Russia conspiracies.

But no matter how long this insufferable Schumer-Schiff sham show lasts -- I said it all week, I haven't messed it up -- this president will remain on offense, making history along the way.

We've only taken $4 trillion a year, $52 trillion in Medicare for All. No free choice on what you might have as health care -- well, we can't afford that. There's no money for defense either in that case. President, he touts the sanctity of life. What do we have, Democrats, oh, like Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, oh, first, we'll let the baby be born and then we'll make the baby comfortable and then we'll let the mother decide -- supporting infanticide or what he referred to as in labor, during labor, or post-birth abortion?

And I feel like that's what the Adam Schiff that they forget when they come over to the U.S. Senate and they go on the floor and they tell those 53 Republicans what they got told last night was about actually their head or that the president is a dictator, or that it's about make Ukraine great again and all of those Ukrainians we can learn so much. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } The truth is, Sean, it's wonderful to have allies and it's nothing against Ukraine, but we don't want to ever be like Ukraine.

I think -- again, they're making -- they have made their case for them. We've been there. We'll make the president's case. And we're going to take the time -- it's not just about rebutting.

You say there's not a scintilla of evidence that Hunter Biden and Joe Biden did anything wrong, that the only reason that Trump wanted to investigate the Bidens was for personal interest, see if that withstands scrutiny. Here's what I think -- I think people are ready to end this. We're going to vote based on the record assembled. When they say that the Trump administration betrayed the Ukraine, I would say it's quite the opposite. They did more than Biden. When they say that the only reason that President Trump wanted anybody to look at the Bidens is because of personal political gain, I would say good government demands that people look at the Bidens. Here's what I think will happen. The president will be stronger when the trial is over because people think it's unfair and this is going to be a nightmare for Joe Biden on the campaign trail and eventually every other Democratic, because when you get lectured to by Bernie and Elizabeth how the government is rigged against you, they're going to have to answer the question, are you OK with the vice president's son getting $3 million from the most corrupt gas company in Ukraine and us do nothing about it? Are you willing to let that go? And if you're willing to let that go, then that tells you a lot about how serious you are about making America different. This president, Donald Trump, had two years of investigation, $25 million, 19 lawyers looked at every business deal he's ever done. And my Democratic colleagues are sweeping the Biden event under the rug. What's more of corrupt? Asking for Biden to be investigated or covering up the fact that Bidens committed really bad things in the Ukraine.",

Super Bowl is coming up, I want to talk about it. The question is, do you think what Adam -- what they were saying about Adam Schiff is news? LARA LOGAN, HOST OF \"LARA LOGAN HAS NO AGENDA\" ON FOX NATION: It's a good question, Sean. I mean, and their -- what do you just played, what we have heard from many different people's opinion. It's clearly opinion. You are describing it, in adjectives. You know, at \"60 Minutes\", we also like try to stay -- minimize the use of adjectives because by their nature, right, they are infused with opinion and observation and analysis. They're not straight fact. And so, you always tried to be careful about that, and pejorative adjective especially because our job we always regarded as giving the audience and the viewer the opportunity to make up their own mind, not making it up for them. And adjectives can push you in one direction or another. That said, it would be one thing if you're offering your opinion, even if it is a glowing opinion, but you also took into account the other side of this. For example the context in which Adam Schiff is standing there and making the speech. For many Americans, he's lost credibility because he has lied over and over and over again. I mean, nobody actually buys that when he told everyone that he had never met the whistleblower and had no contact with the whistleblower, that you would then later, it gets -- you know, you find out that his office meant and coordinated with the whistle-blower. No one believes that his office knew about that and didn't tell him. Nobody believes as he said that he regretted he had been the more clear, words along those lines. So, there is a credibility here issue with Adam Schiff. And these journalists and news organizations are not acknowledging that. They're not saying, well, he did a great performance here. But Adam Schiff, you know, does have issues with many people. And perhaps that's why they are trying so hard to convince people that this was historic. Usually methinks the lady protesteth too much, right, the perception, and this is my opinion now, right? The perception you have is that they are trying too hard because when you look at the facts, there are facts that are left out of the conversation.",

And also tonight, more revelations, Peter Schweizer's brand new book, profiles in corruption about the so-called Biden Five as he calls them, and how quid pro quo Joe used his political power in the swamp to apparently hand out sweetheart deals to his zero experience son and brothers for years. Here to explain more, author in \"Profiles in Corruption\", brand new book, Peter Schweizer is with us. Incredible investigative work. Now, I just want to give it to you. So, it's not just, oh, you're not getting the billion unless you fire a prosecutor investigating my zero experience son, Hunter, being paid millions and millions. Why would any vice president demand the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor? Why would any company ever paid millions for a zero experience? You're telling us tonight this goes way beyond Hunter. PETER SCHWEIZER, \"PROFILES IN CORRUPTION\" AUTHOR: Yes, there's a pattern here, Sean, and it really blossoms during Joe Biden's tenure as vice president of the United States. Take his brother James, for example. We know for a fact that in November of 2010, a longtime Biden family friend named Kevin Justice who had just set up a construction company visits the Biden office in the White House. Three weeks after that meeting, James Biden, Joe Biden's brother, becomes executive vice president of this construction company. Here's the problem, James Biden has no background in construction. In about six months, they get a contract to build 100,000 homes in Iraq financed by U.S. taxpayers. They go on to sign a series of other contracts, construction contracts that occurred. This didn't happen before, this didn't happen after he was vice president. It happened during his tenure. And it's the same pattern that we've seen. These deals involve sometimes taxpayer-backed loans, they involve foreign governments. What they end in is the Biden family makes money off of these deals, deals that they're not qualified to have, skills that they don't possess.",

      "utterance": "Welcome to HANNITY. We begin with a Fox News alert. A lot happening tonight, and moments ago, the Senate finally adjourned for the night. The Schumer-Schiff sham show part of it, oh, thankfully, is over, their repetitive nonsense -- more coming up. Also, tonight, we start with -- we are at the end of a huge week of massive accomplishments for the Trump administration. I doubt the mob and the media will talk about it. But a successful trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Remember, last week, it was the big China deal. It's going to help farmers, manufacturers. It's going to help our energy sector, service sector, oh, and our car industry, $220 billion in two years. The president then returned home to Washington in the swamp. He delivered a rousing speech at the March for Life rally. In doing so, he made history, the first president to speak of the largest pro-life rally in the country. Now, this is part of what we are calling the tale of two Americas, because while the president is advancing prosperity, every economic record, peace and security, end of the caliphate, Baghdadi, and, of course, Soleimani, for all Americans, across town on Capitol, what we've been witnessing? Really three long years, but a pathetic, delusional, psychotic, never- ending charade. And I regret to inform you that the Schumer-Schiff sham show, yes, we still have 24 hours, 16 hours, and then hopefully it ends, because you, the American people, I know you're busy. You work 12, 13, 14 hours a day. You're taking care of your kids. You pay your taxes, you obey the laws. You probably have more important things that you're doing every day than watch the -- well, compromised, corrupt, coward, congenital liar, Adam Schiff, spewing. It is insufferable. Nonstop venom, 24 hours. Let me fill you in on what you might have missed today. Thankfully, their ratings now bear this out. Hardly any Americans are watching. By the way, we want to thank you. And this is sincere from our heart. Thank you for making us number one again last night on cable news. Now, here's what's interesting. Network television, ABC, NBC, CBS, broadcast channels, they've barely got a million viewers. Less than 300,000 in the core demo. It's a disaster -- an unmitigated, unprecedented ratings disaster. And I'm not surprised, because over the past 24 hours, we've learned nothing new. Not one single thing. This has been mindless political theater, that's it. In fact, the Schumer-Schiff sham show, they're just still obsessing over the exact, same, thoroughly debunked -- believe it or not, not Ukraine, oh, they're advancing still the Russia conspiracy theories. Literally, Schiff is like drooling like three years ago. He looks like he's having, frankly to me -- not a professional -- like a mental, emotional breakdown at this point. Forget Ukraine, forget quid pro quo Joe, zero experience Hunter paid millions and investigations, the congenital liar, it's still all about, for three days now, not Ukraine -- Russia, Russia, Russia. Four investigations -- Russia. Take a look."

Anyway, he is a raging lunatic. Day after day, month after month, this is three years. Over three years, this guy has been lying like a maniac, propagating a conspiracy theory, hoax. We had four separate investigations. We had, what, the FBI nine-month investigation, oh, no \"there\" there. We found nothing. Then, of course, we had the House Intel investigation. No evidence. Now, we had the bipartisan Senate committee, and then the ultimate of all ultimates, the Mueller report. No, no Russia. And yet the sham articles of impeachment, they even have nothing to do with Russia but he's still talking about Russia. The term \"Russian collusion\" is never mentioned in one of these articles. And, by the way, neither is the word quid or pro or quo like Joe, or bribery, which they kept throwing out there time and time again. Not a single time. Now, this Schumer-Schiff sham show, it's nothing to do with truth or evidence or facts. Of course, the Schumer-Schiff sham show has nothing to do with truth. Now, it's all about their undying, never-ending, psychotic, unyielding rage and inability to accept the loss of an election. President Trump, you, we, the people, shocked the world. And late last night, there he was again, Schiff, overcome this time now by emotion. He didn't come to terms with his own rampant dishonesty and lies and that the four investigations proved he was a liar. He wasn't, by the way, being reflective of the damage that he's caused the country, the lies and conspiracy theories he's pushed, the smear, slander, besmirchment, the obsessive, compulsive discussion about never-ending Russia conspiracies. He wasn't even upset about his own botched impeachment proceeding in the House. He doesn't realize, nobody likes this guy -- not even Democrats think at this point. I think they realize he took them over a cliff here. No, the congenital liar decided to -- well, tear up like a baby about Republicans not adhering -- get this -- we get lectures from him about the truth. The country's biggest liar lecturing the rest of the country on truth and honesty. His over-the-top crocodile tears, it's almost as cringe- worthy as his unprecedented, rampant hypocrisy.

Right matters, and the truth matters. Otherwise, we are lost. I share the view that there are parts of the dossier that have been corroborated and that seemed credible. Right doesn't matter anymore."

My Pillow coupled with this guaranteed to knock you out for 24 hours. Needless to say, Republican senators, they're not buying this charade. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are struggling to stay awake. Look at this, some are playing tic-tac-toe. True. Some are literally walking around the chambers so they can keep their eyes open. You've got Rachel Maddow's Area 51, the conspiracy channel, they are screaming at the Democrats -- please, I know it's horrible, boring, but just pretend. Act like you're interested. Do it for the sake of the country. Democrats need 67 votes to convict the president -- it's not going to happen. Not even by a long shot. Iowa Senator Joni Ernst slamming Democrats for their hypocrisy. Wyoming Senator John Barrasso accusing Chuck Schumer of using impeachment as a political trick to become majority leader. That's with those phony votes on day one were, with new votes would come later. According to an \"Axios\" report, quote, Democrats -- who need four GOP senator votes and not to lose any from their own party -- will struggle to get more than three. Let's hope that's true tonight. Their last hope to extend the trial is quickly fading. I pray for the sake of the country that this is true. We have 284 days until election. According to the report, it now seems like a straight road to Trump's acquittal by the end of next week. Now, without extra witnesses, the president's, quote, impeachment could be over by the end of next week. They report that will be good news for we, the people, because we all know how this will end. Witnesses will be subject to court battles and claims of executive privilege and pleading the Fifth and weeks and months of legal limbo. Ultimately, President Trump will be acquitted, regardless. Republican senators need to end this charade. They need not take on the constitutional duty of the House of Representatives. They have the sole power to impeach. They have impeached, they have made their case, they will have the president's lawyers talk, and then, we'll have 16 hours of questions. Then let's vote on the answer here. Get back to work for the American people. But no matter how long this insufferable Schumer-Schiff sham show lasts -- I said it all week, I haven't messed it up -- this president will remain on offense, making history along the way. But what will the Democrats run on? What have they done for the people that they are supposed to be public service to servants of? What have they done? Have they created any jobs? No. And as I sat at the top, this is a tale of two Americas. This matters here. Are they public servants or are they just out for a power grab? You got President Trump killing Iran's top terrorists. Democrats complained and are mad? Soleimani slaughtered fellow Americans. He led all of the terrorism of the world's number one state sponsor of terror. You can't say \"good job, President Trump, you just got rid of that guy that slaughtered our fellow Americans.\" President Trump makes new trade deals around the world. Let's see, China, Japan, Mexico -- oh, that means they're paying more. I wonder if we'll use that money for the wall. And Canada and our Eastern European allies, and we're energy independent. Democrats accused him of economic warfare. President lowers taxes for millions of middle-class Americans. Democrats even complain about that. The economy is on fire by every single solitary measure. Democrats dream, they want to implement a $94 trillion, trillion, New Green Deal in 10 years. We've only taken $4 trillion a year, $52 trillion in Medicare for All. No free choice on what you might have as health care -- well, we can't afford that. There's no money for defense either in that case. President, he touts the sanctity of life. What do we have, Democrats, oh, like Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, oh, first, we'll let the baby be born and then we'll make the baby comfortable and then we'll let the mother decide -- supporting infanticide or what he referred to as in labor, during labor, or post-birth abortion? That would be infanticide. Another word that comes to mind, murder. Two hundred and eighty-four days, you're the ultimate jury. You will choose between the two Americas. Will you choose the radical, extreme, socialist group of political hacks who have done nothing for we, the people the last three years except hate the president you elected and not accept the result of we, the people?

But he did it to the Republican Senate, Sean, and they don't put up with us. He said, your heads are going to be on a stake, and they literally all said, no one told us that if we oppose the president. And who would believe that when you have Senator Rand Paul, you've got Senator Mike Lee, they question the president. They open -- they come on broadcast like this and question the president. Go to the media and openly question the president. Unlike the other side, they have no issues with that. And I feel like that's what the Adam Schiff that they forget when they come over to the U.S. Senate and they go on the floor and they tell those 53 Republicans what they got told last night was about actually their head or that the president is a dictator, or that it's about make Ukraine great again and all of those Ukrainians we can learn so much. The truth is, Sean, it's wonderful to have allies and it's nothing against Ukraine, but we don't want to ever be like Ukraine. I don't ever want to be dependent on other countries for my security or be debated around like this. It was -- it was absurd for our country, the idea of propping up the Russian intelligence service. I think -- again, they're making -- they have made their case for them. We've been there. We'll make the president's case. And we're going to take the time -- it's not just about rebutting.

And why does it matter to the American people as to what happened? The vice president of the United States was told to go to Ukraine, straighten up the place, investigate corruption, tell them to turn around and do better. How can you send out a message when your own son is working on the board of Burisma, the most corrupt gas company in the country and receives $3 million and you don't know about it? I think that's bad government. I think it's bad foreign policy, and how could you not know that John Kerry's stepson was also on the board of Burisma?

And I asked them, who did the looking? They asked Dr. Hill, one of their witnesses, do you think Hunter Biden did anything wrong? No. Dr. Hill, did you even look? Where's the outrage of people on the ground in Ukraine in 2014, '15 and '16 when they knew the vice president's son, Hunter Biden, was being paid by the most corrupt company in Ukraine? Why didn't some to call Washington and say this undercuts our message, it's not bad government? So, I want an oversight of the Bidens. I'd like it to be outside of politics. But if it has to be done by the Congress, so be it. But I am not going to live in a country where the Trump family can be investigated for years, spend millions of dollars on legal fees, and the Democratic vice president's son takes $3 million on the most corrupt gas company in the Ukraine and nobody gives a damn.

Here's what I think -- I think people are ready to end this. We're going to vote based on the record assembled. When they say that the Trump administration betrayed the Ukraine, I would say it's quite the opposite. They did more than Biden. When they say that the only reason that President Trump wanted anybody to look at the Bidens is because of personal political gain, I would say good government demands that people look at the Bidens. Here's what I think will happen. The president will be stronger when the trial is over because people think it's unfair and this is going to be a nightmare for Joe Biden on the campaign trail and eventually every other Democratic, because when you get lectured to by Bernie and Elizabeth how the government is rigged against you, they're going to have to answer the question, are you OK with the vice president's son getting $3 million from the most corrupt gas company in Ukraine and us do nothing about it? Are you willing to let that go? And if you're willing to let that go, then that tells you a lot about how serious you are about making America different. This president, Donald Trump, had two years of investigation, $25 million, 19 lawyers looked at every business deal he's ever done.

      "utterance": "Billy Joel? OK. No. Joining us now with the reaction, the host of \"Lara Logan Has No Agenda\" on Foxnation.com, Lara Logan. Fox News contributor, Dan Bongino. All right. I know you are more about news, not taking sides, Lara. Fair enough. You identify that. I am a talk show host. I do straight news. I do investigative reporting, I do opinions, I do sports. Super Bowl is coming up, I want to talk about it. The question is, do you think what Adam -- what they were saying about Adam Schiff is news? LARA LOGAN, HOST OF \"LARA LOGAN HAS NO AGENDA\" ON FOX NATION: It's a good question, Sean. I mean, and their -- what do you just played, what we have heard from many different people's opinion. It's clearly opinion. You are describing it, in adjectives. You know, at \"60 Minutes\", we also like try to stay -- minimize the use of adjectives because by their nature, right, they are infused with opinion and observation and analysis. They're not straight fact. And so, you always tried to be careful about that, and pejorative adjective especially because our job we always regarded as giving the audience and the viewer the opportunity to make up their own mind, not making it up for them. And adjectives can push you in one direction or another. That said, it would be one thing if you're offering your opinion, even if it is a glowing opinion, but you also took into account the other side of this. For example the context in which Adam Schiff is standing there and making the speech. For many Americans, he's lost credibility because he has lied over and over and over again. I mean, nobody actually buys that when he told everyone that he had never met the whistleblower and had no contact with the whistleblower, that you would then later, it gets -- you know, you find out that his office meant and coordinated with the whistle-blower. No one believes that his office knew about that and didn't tell him. Nobody believes as he said that he regretted he had been the more clear, words along those lines. So, there is a credibility here issue with Adam Schiff. And these journalists and news organizations are not acknowledging that. They're not saying, well, he did a great performance here. But Adam Schiff, you know, does have issues with many people. And perhaps that's why they are trying so hard to convince people that this was historic. Usually methinks the lady protesteth too much, right, the perception, and this is my opinion now, right? The perception you have is that they are trying too hard because when you look at the facts, there are facts that are left out of the conversation."

Then he said this and then he said that."

He is telling a story, the problem is the story is false. Sean, there are two elements of the stories that have never changed and nothing Adam Schiff is going to tell anyone in America will change. The aid was delivered to Ukraine before the deadline. Fact. Second, there is no victim in this alleged high crime and misdemeanor the president is being impeached for. Who is the victim? What -- the Ukrainians have said we weren't pressured and even the minister of foreign affairs was on CNN the other saying, no, they review this thing all the time. It's no big deal. Nothing Adam Schiff says will change those two immutable facts. And he can B.S. all he wants. America is not buying it."

When we come back tonight, a \"Hannity\" investigative report and that relates to five Biden family members making a fortune off of quid and pro and quo and Joe. We have a second case now of the coronavirus, which was confirmed in the U.S. We'll have a live update. Peter Schweizer, though, exposes how did all of these Biden family members get so rich?

It was a woman in her 60s in Illinois who had recently traveled to China. The CDC is confirming that that woman had arrived in the U.S. January 13th, then just a few days later called a doctor to report possible symptoms. Lab tests then confirmed the 2019 strain of the virus, that's the same one that's already infected more than 1,200 and killed 41 in China leading to the complete quarantine of Wuhan, that's the city that's home to millions."

      "utterance": "All right, Marianne. Obviously, everyone is keeping an eye on it. Thank you. And also tonight, more revelations, Peter Schweizer's brand new book, profiles in corruption about the so-called Biden Five as he calls them, and how quid pro quo Joe used his political power in the swamp to apparently hand out sweetheart deals to his zero experience son and brothers for years. Here to explain more, author in \"Profiles in Corruption\", brand new book, Peter Schweizer is with us. Incredible investigative work. Now, I just want to give it to you. So, it's not just, oh, you're not getting the billion unless you fire a prosecutor investigating my zero experience son, Hunter, being paid millions and millions. Why would any vice president demand the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor? Why would any company ever paid millions for a zero experience? You're telling us tonight this goes way beyond Hunter. PETER SCHWEIZER, \"PROFILES IN CORRUPTION\" AUTHOR: Yes, there's a pattern here, Sean, and it really blossoms during Joe Biden's tenure as vice president of the United States. Take his brother James, for example. We know for a fact that in November of 2010, a longtime Biden family friend named Kevin Justice who had just set up a construction company visits the Biden office in the White House. Three weeks after that meeting, James Biden, Joe Biden's brother, becomes executive vice president of this construction company. Here's the problem, James Biden has no background in construction. In about six months, they get a contract to build 100,000 homes in Iraq financed by U.S. taxpayers. They go on to sign a series of other contracts, construction contracts that occurred. This didn't happen before, this didn't happen after he was vice president. It happened during his tenure. And it's the same pattern that we've seen. These deals involve sometimes taxpayer-backed loans, they involve foreign governments. What they end in is the Biden family makes money off of these deals, deals that they're not qualified to have, skills that they don't possess."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this, Peter, because he admits, well, why do you think they gave you millions and millions? I don't know. Maybe because your dad is the vice president in charge of Ukraine? Probably. No other -- nobody gets that deal. He said he didn't get a penny from the China deals, is that -- is that -- is that false?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "Now, look, to be blunt about it, they've have lied about this repeatedly. First, they denied that Hunter Biden sat on the board of directors of this Chinese-funded investment firm. Then when we showed the website that said he was on the board of directors, they changed their tune. Then they said he wasn't making any money off of the deal. Now, they admit, OK, he has assets but he hasn't cashed out the money yet. That's the problem. They haven't been honest about this from the beginning."
