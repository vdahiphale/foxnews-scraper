      "sentences": "And thanks for friends of \"The Five\". Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News alert. President Trump has fulfilled a key campaign promise. He has pulled America out of the Paris climate agreement. Great for jobs, great for the economy, great for business. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, Vice President Mike Pence is here later tonight. He has reaction. Also tonight, Mike Huckabee, Sarah Carter, John Solomon, Herman Cain will all join us. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But, first, there is a massive effort underway to silence conservatives in America. So, tonight, it is time to fight fire with fire. We will expose the massive huge double standard when it comes to liberals and free speech. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And by the way, tonight, we ask the question, where are the so-called champions of civil rights and freedom of speech on the left? Why are liberal commentators like Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert - why aren't they speaking out defending freedom of speech? And by the way, why has not one liberal cable news host stood up for me and my right to freedom of speech and this whole effort to silence conservative voices. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, where is Lawrence O'Donnell, Don Lemon, Chris Hayes, Chris Matthews, Anderson Cooper? Where are you people? Tonight, we will display for you how ugly, vile, vicious the left is to the president, to conservatives in this country. It's so over-the-top. And that is tonight's extremely important opening monologue. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Right. As we have now been highlighting right here in the show, there is a well-funded, highly organized, orchestrated left-wing effort to silence conservative voices. Now, I've only become the latest target of this left- wing smear machine. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, thankfully, there is now a moment and a movement that is gaining traction and momentum, fighting back against all these attacks and defending freedom of speech for conservatives. We're going to have a lot in a few moments here tonight, but first why aren't outspoken liberal commentators coming to the defense of conservatives. Why do they never come to the defense of conservatives? Now, I just mentioned, there's not a single liberal cable host in America that I know of that has spoken out against the effort to get me fired. Not one. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } For example, there's people like Bill Maher. Well, they say they speak up, stand up for freedom of speech and they have in the past. But why is he - why are others so eerily silent? In this case, nobody came to the defense of me, defending me and my rights here. There is a massive double standard when it comes to the First Amendment and the left in this country. Liberals get to say and do pretty much anything they want when it comes to smearing and attacking conservatives. And 99 percent of the time, they actually get away with it. They don't have to face any backlash. No outrage, no uproar, no boycotts, trying to silence them. And as I was saying last night, this is probably why Kathy Griffin, she thought it was OK for her to pose like an ISIS with a bloodied, decapitated head that looks like President Trump. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, we must warn you, this photo is graphic. And here it is. Now, because Griffin's actions were so vile, so vicious, so disturbing, which she had to later admit when she apologized, well, there were finally consequences for her actions. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, I don't support or condone what she did in any way, shape or form. It is beyond disgusting, offensive and vile, but did you hear me call for her firing? No, you did not. Meanwhile, liberals like Jim Carrey, tonight, they're actually defending Griffin and making, well, their own vicious, vile smears. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Now, would you think that the left might have a little sympathy, a little compassion, a little bit of respect for an 11-year-old kid, let alone the president's son? You know what?

And then there's people like Stephen Colbert. At the beginning of May, remember, he viciously attacked the president in a monologue. You may remember this.

Guys, good to see you. Brent, welcome to the discussion and debate. You've been in the forefront of this hypocrisy, Brent, for decades. And you had enough to. And you now agree - and by the way, Melanie and Brian are not doing a boycott. They just show the outrageous things said. They started with one show. They moved to another show tonight.

This was a bad deal from the moment it was signed by the last administration. It's an international treaty that was never submitted to the Senate probably because it never would have had a chance there. This is an agreement that puts an enormous burden on Americans consumers, on the American economy, while allowing countries like India and China to virtually get off scot-free for a decade or more. And the president after listening to all sides, after listening to European leaders, last week made a decision to fulfill his word to the American people to get out of the Paris accord, but also to leave the door open to the possibility of negotiating a completely new deal or going back into the agreement under terms that will put the American economy and the American people first.",

Now, while there was an initial report of shots fired near the restaurant. This turned out not to be true. We want to apologize to Clayton's for that error.

      "utterance": "And thanks for friends of \"The Five\". Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News alert. President Trump has fulfilled a key campaign promise. He has pulled America out of the Paris climate agreement. Great for jobs, great for the economy, great for business. Now, Vice President Mike Pence is here later tonight. He has reaction. Also tonight, Mike Huckabee, Sarah Carter, John Solomon, Herman Cain will all join us. But, first, there is a massive effort underway to silence conservatives in America. So, tonight, it is time to fight fire with fire. We will expose the massive huge double standard when it comes to liberals and free speech. And by the way, tonight, we ask the question, where are the so-called champions of civil rights and freedom of speech on the left? Why are liberal commentators like Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert - why aren't they speaking out defending freedom of speech? And by the way, why has not one liberal cable news host stood up for me and my right to freedom of speech and this whole effort to silence conservative voices. By the way, where is Lawrence O'Donnell, Don Lemon, Chris Hayes, Chris Matthews, Anderson Cooper? Where are you people? Tonight, we will display for you how ugly, vile, vicious the left is to the president, to conservatives in this country. It's so over-the-top. And that is tonight's extremely important opening monologue. Right. As we have now been highlighting right here in the show, there is a well-funded, highly organized, orchestrated left-wing effort to silence conservative voices. Now, I've only become the latest target of this left- wing smear machine. Now, thankfully, there is now a moment and a movement that is gaining traction and momentum, fighting back against all these attacks and defending freedom of speech for conservatives. We're going to have a lot in a few moments here tonight, but first why aren't outspoken liberal commentators coming to the defense of conservatives. Why do they never come to the defense of conservatives? Now, I just mentioned, there's not a single liberal cable host in America that I know of that has spoken out against the effort to get me fired. Not one. For example, there's people like Bill Maher. Well, they say they speak up, stand up for freedom of speech and they have in the past. But why is he - why are others so eerily silent? In this case, nobody came to the defense of me, defending me and my rights here. There is a massive double standard when it comes to the First Amendment and the left in this country. Liberals get to say and do pretty much anything they want when it comes to smearing and attacking conservatives. And 99 percent of the time, they actually get away with it. They don't have to face any backlash. No outrage, no uproar, no boycotts, trying to silence them. And as I was saying last night, this is probably why Kathy Griffin, she thought it was OK for her to pose like an ISIS with a bloodied, decapitated head that looks like President Trump. Now, we must warn you, this photo is graphic. And here it is. Now, because Griffin's actions were so vile, so vicious, so disturbing, which she had to later admit when she apologized, well, there were finally consequences for her actions. Now, I don't support or condone what she did in any way, shape or form. It is beyond disgusting, offensive and vile, but did you hear me call for her firing? No, you did not. Meanwhile, liberals like Jim Carrey, tonight, they're actually defending Griffin and making, well, their own vicious, vile smears."

This president now, not only him, but his family, the president's 11-year-old son Barron, now he has to see stuff like this. TMZ reported he was watching TV when he first saw that image of Griffin with the bloody head of his father and got so scared because he thought it was real. Now, would you think that the left might have a little sympathy, a little compassion, a little bit of respect for an 11-year-old kid, let alone the president's son? You know what? That didn't stop people from continuing the attacks or supporting Kathy Griffin. For example, \"Jeopardy!\" champion Ken Jennings, remember him? Look at what he tweeted yesterday. \"Barron Trump saw a very long necktie on a heap of expired deli meat in a dumpster. He thought it was his dad and his little heart is breaking.\" That's really sick. That's ugly. That's twisted. Now, imagine if this were ever done to the Obamas. And then there's people like Stephen Colbert. At the beginning of May, remember, he viciously attacked the president in a monologue. You may remember this. STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, \"THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT\": John Dickerson has way too much dignity to trade insults with the president of the United States to his face. But I, sir, am no John Dickerson. Mr. Trump, your presidency, I love your presidency. I call it Disgrace the Nation. Sir, you attract more skinheads than free row games.

Now, some of you in this audience have actually been mad at me for not doing that because I've defended his right to be so offensive. Now, over the years, I have been consistent on the issue not to try and get shows canceled. Now, people might not like it, but I support people like Bill Maher and their right to say whatever they want to say even if it's about me or the president, insane, nasty, crazy disagreeable. You know what? I don't want to silence anybody. In fact, over the years - let's go to the videotape again - I've defended Maher a number of times. Take a look."

      "utterance": "All right. Now, I've said in 2007 and 2008, journalism in America is dead and the people you just saw have zero credibility. They are partisan, ideological hacks, they've been hell-bent on destroying the president from even before the time he got elected. But as we've also said on this show, if you don't like what they're saying, guess what, you can turn the channel. You don't have to watch it. You can turn the on and off button off. But my larger point tonight is this. Where is the so-called free speech tolerant left, the champions of free and open exchange of ideals and opinions? When do they ever stand up for conservatives? I haven't seen it. And when do they stand up for conservatives' First Amendment rights, conservatives' ability to speak out, conservatives that are under attack when their voices are trying to be silenced? And by the way, you watch the Clinton/Soros funded group. You know what? When are they going to go after people on their side? They never do that. Now, just look at the disturbing photo, for example, from a satire site called The Onion, but I don't really find it funny. It's kind of like the Kathy Griffin decapitated ISIS look, holding the president's head with all the blood on it. Now, I don't particularly find this funny. And by the way, nor does my 15- year-old daughter. That's me. Yes, bloody, gruesome, multiple knees, coming out of a corpse. Now, I don't believe in boycotts. I'm consistent. I never have. I never will. But if we don't as conservatives fight back and fight fire with fire, more conservatives will be isolated, targeted in Greta Linskey (ph) style and voices will be silenced. And that's what my next three guests are doing. They are fighting back. The cofounders of the Media Equality Project. That's Melanie Morgan, Brian Maloney. As we told you last night, they are just getting started. They gave us a preview of other hosts whose extreme comments they will be highlighting and their advertisers, along with the president of the Media Research Center Brent Bozell. Guys, good to see you. Brent, welcome to the discussion and debate. You've been in the forefront of this hypocrisy, Brent, for decades. And you had enough to. And you now agree - and by the way, Melanie and Brian are not doing a boycott. They just show the outrageous things said. They started with one show. They moved to another show tonight. What are you doing?"

      "speaker": "BRENT BOZELL, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, you and I have disagreed on boycotts in the past, but you used the word consistent. You've always been consistent. The left has been utterly inconsistent and hypocritical because they don't believe in free speech. Where Kathy Griffin was concerned, people have asked the question, how does she not know she was crossing the line? This is because the left believes there is no line that you can cross. And where conservatives are concerned, there is no line for them whatsoever because they shouldn't be there. Now, what are we going to do? I think we've had enough, Sean. I think maybe we have to do a little bit of soul-searching ourselves fast. Why is it that we have left the far left get away with consistently calling us racist, homophobes, Nazis, everything else they can think of and we haven't responded? I, for one - I guess, I drew the line with the attack on you. One can disagree with what you said, but you have every right to say it. And I think there comes a point where we say enough is enough. We're going to have conversations with advertisers. The next time you smear a conservative, I'm going to go right to your sponsor and I'm going to ask your sponsor, is this what you are paying for? Are these your values? Do you believe in character assassination? If so, you ought to be sponsoring the show. If not, you ought to be thinking twice about it because we're going to attach that to you if you pay for it. And, Melanie, let me go to you because some people said, well, you're only going after one show. And tonight, you changed your website. Tonight, you said, no, the preview of coming attractions was real. This is not about any one person at all. And people apparently have said, oh, you're only going after one person. That's not true. You're just exposing what they say and who's paying for it, correct?"

And first of all, I'd just like to say thank you to the hundreds of thousands and millions of Sean Hannity supporters who have joined our guerrilla effort that's been underway since April 26 with my friend Brian Maloney and myself. And what they have done is they've come together at Stop the Scalpings which is a Facebook page and at Mediaequalizer.com. And what we're doing is gathering the force of one and turning it into many. And it is working. I am so thrilled to announce that Kathy Griffin has lost her gig at CNN. And why? It's because all of our people, 61,000 people who are dialing advertisers over and over again - and isn't it interesting how liberals really hate to get a taste of their own medicine. That's what we're doing. We're crossing over into a line - well, educational opportunity. Let's just say that Media Matters has taught us how to do it correctly and we're emulating their model. You know what, it's working pretty well."

I had no idea the types of crap they spewed every night. I just don't watch it. And so, I've learned a lot, but I still support the right to say it. But what you're saying is, if you isolate, target one conservative again, you're going to get the same treatment. Now, do you think - because you've said they're going to be - you'll be going after people at CBS and NBC and ABC and CNN and - tonight CNN apparently - and MS. As you go after them, do you think these networks are going to finally maybe get up to speed with what we've been living through as conservatives for years?

Mediaequalizer.com is where you can get all the information that you need. It's funny, Sean, because I've been interviewed by major publications, all of them, and CNN. They called me up. And instead of interviewing me, they argue with me. They want to argue. They want a veto power over your show and the topics that you cover. And they're indignant when I say, hey, why can't Sean talk about what he wants. Well, that's not an approved topic. You can't talk about that because this and that and the other.

So, tonight, well, we're talking about Hillary Clinton who has been the leading voice of these tinfoil hat crackpots for decades. The number one in America conspiracy theorist, Hillary Clinton. That's tonight's mini monologue. Blaming anyone and everyone else for her failures, that's nothing new for Hillary Clinton. Well, she's now gotten to the point of constantly making bizarre excuses for the 2016 election loss. Now, in just seconds, we're going to play some of it, we're going to show you some of this. But let's go back to the 1990s. Her husband Bill Clinton embroiled in scandals and controversy.

Now, Hillary Clinton continues to peddle conspiracy theories, no evidence whatsoever, and make ridiculous excuses about why she lost to President Trump. She's now offering up a long laundry list of reasons for her crushing defeat in November. Now, take a look at the side of your screen. Now, Hillary conveniently forgot to mention that she didn't bother to campaign a whole lot in Michigan and Wisconsin and that a large majority of you, the American people, thought that - as I do, thought she was corrupt and untrustworthy, and those are just a few examples. Now, let me explain what's really going on here. Hillary Clinton is the ring leader in pushing bizarre conspiracy theories meant to destroy and damage President Trump. And, of course, the propaganda media, they just follow in suit like the sheep they are. Now, Clinton and the left and the destroy Trump media, they have a shared goal now, and that is to delegitimize Donald Trump's presidency, undermine American democracy, the will of the American people. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and I'll keep rolling this on the side of the screen, governor. There's nothing she doesn't blame here.

I've known the Clintons a long time. I've never known ever for Hillary to just walk to the microphone and say, you know what, the reason something didn't work is because I failed, because I didn't do it right. Even in the book Shattered, it was very obvious that even her husband tried to tell her that the polls were not accurate, that they needed to go campaign in some of these Rust Belt states, but they didn't listen. And now she's blaming Jim Comey, she's blaming the Russians, she's blaming anybody and everybody, she's blaming the DNC which has not really made her a darling of them and they're pretty angry about it, but she's never just said, ultimately, the candidate is responsible for winning or losing. And as somebody who's been in elections, the number one thing you've got to do is just suck it up and say - it's me, that's why we lost."

Every night, we play Clapper and Comey and Rogers and Maxine Waters and Diane Feinstein and Joe Manchin saying there's no evidence of collusion, months and months and hundreds of hundreds of hours of coverage.

All of these are the agenda items that Donald Trump has put forth. But every time I hear a Democrat interviewed on television, they keep on - they remind us that Hillary Clinton got the popular vote. Well, we don't elect a president because of popular vote, by the electoral vote. And if you want to change the Constitution, then use your interviews doing that rather than coming up with these phony Russian stories that have so far been proven to be a whole bunch of - as my friend Larry Gatlin would say - bovine droppings."

What we suspect is that other people are being unmasked, and that came around in hints from the former chairman -- well, he was still the chairman, but, you know, head of the committee Devin Nunes who spoke a little bit about that, Peter King and others who had some knowledge of what is in those documents.

And the big question, of course, was real legitimate surveillance being used as a ruse to spy on Americans and get intelligence about the Trump campaign, about members of Congress? And you see such an increased use of this surveillance unmasking that it raises serious issues in your mind about whether or not spying on Americans and political opponents occurred.

Now, in the case of Samantha Power, there's still some things we need to learn. A person is defined as a U.S. person if they are in the U.S. at the time that they're intercepted legally. And so it's possible that the U.N. ambassador was intercepted by the NSA and Susan Power needed to know what that U.N. ambassador was saying. But if it isn't something like that, everyone I talked to say they can't fathom another reason that Samantha power would need to be looking at unmasked American intelligence.

      "utterance": "Yes, it does. That's the big concern here. You have got to think about this. General Flynn's name itself was classified. That was a classified name that should have never been leaked. And the conversation that was unmasked, realize that only very few people had access to that. So it won't be difficult according to the sources that I've been speaking to, to kind of narrow that down and find out who had access to his name and who had the possible motive to leak it? So that's an absolute possibility. I think another thing, and John brought this up very clearly, was about Susan Power. But I can say from sources that I've been speaking to, that was a huge surprise and a great concern, because one of the things that nobody would ever think Susan Power would be unmasking people.

You have the history channel, you have the American Heroes Channel, you have the Fox News Channel, you have ESPN, then you have the conspiracy news channel. And it's almost like as I watch over there occasionally or I read about what they say, it's like they want the president to fail. They want impeachment. They want to take him out. And that's pretty dangerous for the country from my perspective. What's yours?"

      "utterance": "The same thing. They have given a double meaning to DTS. It is not only Trump Derangement Syndrome, it's Trump Denial Syndrome. It's both of those to them. And unfortunately they don't even realize how off target they are. You take something as bold as pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, with logical reasons, and they twist it to say he's all wrong. That shows that they are using no logic for their criticism and for their crassness when it comes to this president and his administration. I believe that their viewership is going to continue to go down, because as I have said many times, Sean, on your show and others, the American people are not stupid. And they are basically talking as if the American people are stupid. And we are not. Even some of the most ardent critics of the president are seeing through this smoke."

Number two, he said he's open to negotiating, but not a bad deal, and that's another promise that he kept. So tell us why is this so important?"

      "utterance": "I always tell people it's the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to President Donald Trump. And one of the biggest reasons, this is a man who gets up every day to keep the promises he made to the American people. And by withdrawing today from the Paris Climate Accord, the president has demonstrated his commitment not just to keep his word, but to put American workers, American consumers, American energy, and the American people first. This was a bad deal from the moment it was signed by the last administration. It's an international treaty that was never submitted to the Senate probably because it never would have had a chance there. This is an agreement that puts an enormous burden on Americans consumers, on the American economy, while allowing countries like India and China to virtually get off scot-free for a decade or more. And the president after listening to all sides, after listening to European leaders, last week made a decision to fulfill his word to the American people to get out of the Paris accord, but also to leave the door open to the possibility of negotiating a completely new deal or going back into the agreement under terms that will put the American economy and the American people first."

But I think this is really the only show in America that has listed the president's accomplishments. And I noticed when he was in the Rose Garden today that he went through part of that list. It never seems to get reported. What are you most proud of? And what do you see coming, because I'm a little bit worried about the timeframe, the legislative calendar about getting a lot of these things done before the end of the year."

There's a reason why the month of May we just found out a quarter of a million new jobs have been created. This economy is --"

As I travel around the country, the confidence, the enthusiasm, I tell people from the shop room floor to the boardrooms this country know they have got someone in the Oval Office who gets up every day and is fighting for them and fighting for American free enterprise and for jobs for the American people. But the list is kind of hard to go through in a short period of time -- 14 different bills that rolled back Obama era regulations that would have cost our economy more than $18 billion a year. The confirmation in record time since the 19th century of Supreme Court justice who is committed to the rule of law and to constitutional principles and to holding back the administrative state. You look at a commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare, the way he is driving forward on tax relief, Tax reform. And the American people get it all the way through the decision today to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. This is a president who is fighting for the American people, fighting for American jobs, I think the results whether it be job numbers, whether it be in the confidence you see in businesses and even in our stock market, all speak for itself. America is back because they have a president in President Donald Trump who is fighting every day for them."

Such a great decision, and a campaign promise kept. We want to hear from you. Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, and let us know what you think. Before you go, this past March we ran a few stories about spring break activities on South Padre Island. On March 28th, one of our colleagues on the program stated that a shooting had taken place at Clayton's Beach Bar and Grill on the island. Now, while there was an initial report of shots fired near the restaurant. This turned out not to be true. We want to apologize to Clayton's for that error. When we make a mistake, we mean it, we're sorry. That's all the time we have left this evening. Thanks for being with us, and, with Fox's permission, I will see you back here tomorrow night.
