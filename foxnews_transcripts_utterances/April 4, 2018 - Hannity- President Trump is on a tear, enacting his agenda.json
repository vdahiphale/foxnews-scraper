Plus, we have media reacting to the president and, by the way, that he is not a target. Oh, it's driving them insane. And he is only a subject in the corrupt Mueller investigation. There is a total freak-out over this.

There is already precedence for all of this, well George W. Bush and Barack Obama, they actually did the exact same thing. And President Trump's tough rhetoric, calling for Mexico to disband this caravan, as you see, of asylum seekers heading for the U.S. border. That's also working. According to reports, the more than a thousand person caravan is now falling apart. Leaders of the group are now saying they will no longer head for America's southern border. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This is the start of good news for the president. Look at this, a brand new Rasmussen poll, his approval rating is now 51 percent, which is higher than Barack Obama's during the exact same time in his presidency. He was only at 46 percent. And he got reelected. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the liberal media probably won't be telling you that tonight. They are too busy orchestrating an onslaught of any negative story that they can possibly find obsessing over, oh, Stormy Daniels and Trump-Russia collusion, Russia, Russia, Russia, that doesn't exist. There is also a fake news CNN poll. This is pretty amazing. It shows President Trump making major gains with four key groups. He's gained eight points with men since February, five points with younger voters, nine points with middle aged voters, and he's up 10 points with college graduates. Here's what's so interesting about these polls, just imagine if the president wasn't constantly under attack from a media that wants to destroy him. Imagine if Robert Mueller and his team of Democratic donors weren't carrying out their never ending witch-hunt, don't you think the president's poll numbers would be a lot higher if a majority of the country wasn't being fed an endless stream of outright lies, propaganda, distortion and misinformation? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Despite all of that, President Trump, he is just rolling along doing his job every day, the job that you elected him to do. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look at this, manufacturing. This is good news, by the way, for the media to be so successful in their attacks against Trump, they are kind of cheering against the country succeeding. Look at this, the strongest in three years. ADP, Moody's Analytics, they are now saying 241,000 jobs created in March. And that's on top of the record low unemployment numbers that we now have. Over 3 million jobs created since Donald Trump was elected. And, by the way, the lowest unemployment numbers ever for African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Look at this, home equity at this at record level, $5.4 trillion. The president is also taking a big step -- this is amazing, nobody ever reports it -- to make healthcare more affordable for everybody and getting around some of the devastating ObamaCare mandates. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } There is an op-ed in 'USA Today' explains how the Trump administration is now set to lay out a new rule. They are about to implement this. It will lower the cost, create choices by expanding association health plans. These plans allow businesses and trade associations to come together and buy health insurance plans in bulk. That saves a ton of money. And, by the way, a huge development, you get more care for less money. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And the president also is taking steps to reduce the bloat. Remember that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that nobody liked? Well, thank god, he is now -- he reluctantly signed it, now, this is the bill the president threatened to veto. But remember, he was forced to kind of sign it because Congress -- well, they left town. They are too lazy. The White House is looking into using what is known as the Impoundment Control Act. It's a law from 1974. It gives the president the authority to cancel spending already approved by Congress. By the way, they only need 51 votes in the Senate, Mitch. Congress would have 45 days to approve the president's request to cut from the massive spending bill. Again, he is keeping a promise. Let's hope that happens. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then, on top of all of, this just take a look at the side of your screen. You will never see this in the media. A list of just some of the president's many accomplishments during his short time in office. Remember the Heritage foundation they did a study the president's first year, they found he has already accomplished 64 percent of his agenda, which by the way, is higher than Ronald Reagan's 49 percent at the same time in his presidency. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } These are real, tangible achievements that help the forgotten men and women that voted in November of 2016 that the liberal media will never talk about because they never want to give the president credit for anything. And as we have been explaining, President Trump is just on fire and it's time for congressional Republicans to follow suit, time to get a back home. Time to keep their promises. No more waiting around. Let's see what happens in 2018. It's time for members of the GOP, keep their word. Keep their promises. And that means they should build this southern wall. They should keep the seven-year promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare. You know, things they said and promised when they were campaigning. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Here's what's going to happen if Republicans don't keep their promises -- Democrats are going to try to systematically undo every single one of those accomplishments, we will put them back on the screen. Nancy Pelosi has already threatened that she's going to try and repeal the tax cuts that benefit 90 percent of Americans. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } By the way, you keep going, Nancy, good job. Don't stop. I want you to stay on message. So, it's up to congressional Republicans to show some backbone, some spine and actually fight for the president's agenda that you voted for. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz -- now, he is going to join news a few minutes -- he's out with a list 10 things that Congress should be doing right now. In the article, Chaffetz suggest Congress should explain and clarify the conflicts of interest on special counsel Mueller's team. I don't think there is an explanation. They should formally demand the appointment of a second special prosecutor with the power to prosecute. He lists call FISA court judges before Congress to offer public testimony. They were all lied to. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Call Attorney General Jeff Sessions to testify about outstanding congressional subpoenas. Hold hearings on securing our borders. Fortifying them with a wall and then pass legislation allowing the president to reallocate funds from the DOD. And, of course, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, she should be called to testify. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey, they should be called to testify about their speech suppression practices, especially against conservatives. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, Zuckerberg will testify before lawmakers next week about Cambridge Analytics. Congress by the way should make an effort to reform the broken budget process. They should give states the opportunity to vote on whether Congress should be subject to balancing the federal budget and finally the Senate should refuse to recess until every single one of the president's appointees have been voted on. Mitch, time to work. Anyway, Congressman Chaffetz will be here in a minute. But, first, we have breaking news tonight. House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes, he has sent a letter to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray. Nunes is blasting the repeated stonewalling by the Department of Justice which is being led by Rosenstein and refusing continually to hand over documents that have been subpoenaed by Congress. Remember, Rosenstein is the guy that ran in to Paul Ryan's office back in January at the last hour, begging Speaker Ryan to block Congressman Nunes' request for documents about all the FISA abuses in the dossier. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban17', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We wouldn't have learned that had Paul Ryan capitulated. Without those documents there never would have been a Nunes memo and wouldn't have known about any of the massive scandals we are talking about every night unfolding like the FISA abuse, lying to judges to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate. In that case, Carter Page. Rod Rosenstein, why does he want to keep all of this a secret? Why does he want to protect all his corrupt friends? But now, after months of obstructing, Chairman Nunes is demanding answers. And, by the way, Nunes has been asking for documents. Some go back to August of 2017. Rod, hand the documents over to the American people. That's how ridiculous this entire process is, and Nunes is now requesting the DOJ do their job and, of course, Congress has their jobs, we have checks and balances, we have co-equal branches of government. The DOJ turn over the unredacted version of an FBI memo related to the bureau's opening of the Russia investigation. Nunes has set a deadline April 11th. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Given what we have seen from Rosenstein, it's probably going to be a long time before the House Intel Committee gets to see this. The level of obstruction and protection, the incestuous nature of the relationships, this is beyond disgraceful. Rosenstein has done everything possible that he can do to prevent Congress from doing their job which is oversight. They have constitutional not only right but duty to do so. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, tonight, it's time for Rod Rosenstein to stop hiding the truth from the American people. Now, his boss is the Attorney General Jeff Sessions. And Jeff Sessions rightly said last week that he is angry at the slow pace that these documents are being turned over. Well, you know what? Well, the attorney general needs to do something about it. If the attorney general is angry, he needs to take action and force the Deputy A.G. Rosenstein to do his job. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And if Rosenstein doesn't want to, then he needs to go, because that is how our government is supposed to work. Congress needs to be able to get answers on behalf of you. We now see corruption at the highest levels of government. And then you got a corrupt media -- well, they are in major denial. That's they're beside themselves over reports that President Trump is not currently -- oh, let me repeat, not a target of the special counsel Robert Mueller's corrupt investigation. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Despite this new development, the media is desperate. They are holding out hope. They are on their knees. They are praying to god that somehow, some way, Robert Mueller will still find a way to make Donald Trump the target and go after the president. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Think through this. If that ever happened, is that good for the country? Is that good for the forgotten men and women of the country? Does that create jobs? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Does that get people out of poverty and offer food stamps? No. Does it keep us safer? No. Do they seem to care? No. Take a look. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Working for you, the American people. And, by the way, this is all news you will not get from the destroy Trump media. The commander-in-chief is now following through on his tough talk about securing the southern border and earlier today, he signed a proclamation to immediately deploy the National Guard to help enforce America's immigration laws. New poll numbers prove the Trump agenda is working, despite, of course, fierce liberal opposition. Also tonight, we have information the House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, he is blasting the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for stonewalling Congress. This needs to end. We'll explain. Rod Rosenstein needs to be fired. And Nunes is also demanding that the FBI, the DOJ hand over the key documents about the opening of the Russia investigation. Plus, we have media reacting to the president and, by the way, that he is not a target. Oh, it's driving them insane. And he is only a subject in the corrupt Mueller investigation. There is a total freak-out over this. And Jonathan Turley is out with a brand new op-ed that is bashing the abusively biased press for refusing to accept this fact. Also tonight, Alan Dershowitz was phenomenal last night, he is back. As well as Joe diGenova. They'll give us reaction to the latest legal developments. And Jason Chaffetz, Congressman Chaffetz, he has a list of the top 10 things Congress should be doing right now so that they will serve you the American people, the supposed to be public servants, and it would help Republicans in the end actually win.

The Department of Defense is a longtime partner of Department of Homeland Security and I thank them for their support. While plans are being finalized, it's our expectation that the National Guard will deploy personnel in support of CBP's border security mission."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And tonight, we have learned that President Trump has signed the proclamation to send the National Guard to the southern border. The president, he deserves a lot of credit because if Congress -- if they're not going to lift a finger to solve the problem, then he is going to take the steps as commander-in-chief and do it on his own, which he now has. Before the liberal media, all you leftists out there, start losing your collective minds over the National Guard being deployed at the southern border, with all due respect, we will educate you. There is already precedence for all of this, well George W. Bush and Barack Obama, they actually did the exact same thing. And President Trump's tough rhetoric, calling for Mexico to disband this caravan, as you see, of asylum seekers heading for the U.S. border. That's also working. According to reports, the more than a thousand person caravan is now falling apart. Leaders of the group are now saying they will no longer head for America's southern border. This is the start of good news for the president. Look at this, a brand new Rasmussen poll, his approval rating is now 51 percent, which is higher than Barack Obama's during the exact same time in his presidency. He was only at 46 percent. And he got reelected. But the liberal media probably won't be telling you that tonight. They are too busy orchestrating an onslaught of any negative story that they can possibly find obsessing over, oh, Stormy Daniels and Trump-Russia collusion, Russia, Russia, Russia, that doesn't exist. There is also a fake news CNN poll. This is pretty amazing. It shows President Trump making major gains with four key groups. He's gained eight points with men since February, five points with younger voters, nine points with middle aged voters, and he's up 10 points with college graduates. Here's what's so interesting about these polls, just imagine if the president wasn't constantly under attack from a media that wants to destroy him. Imagine if Robert Mueller and his team of Democratic donors weren't carrying out their never ending witch-hunt, don't you think the president's poll numbers would be a lot higher if a majority of the country wasn't being fed an endless stream of outright lies, propaganda, distortion and misinformation? Despite all of that, President Trump, he is just rolling along doing his job every day, the job that you elected him to do. Look at this, manufacturing. This is good news, by the way, for the media to be so successful in their attacks against Trump, they are kind of cheering against the country succeeding. Look at this, the strongest in three years. ADP, Moody's Analytics, they are now saying 241,000 jobs created in March. And that's on top of the record low unemployment numbers that we now have. Over 3 million jobs created since Donald Trump was elected. And, by the way, the lowest unemployment numbers ever for African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. Look at this, home equity at this at record level, $5.4 trillion. The president is also taking a big step -- this is amazing, nobody ever reports it -- to make healthcare more affordable for everybody and getting around some of the devastating ObamaCare mandates. There is an op-ed in 'USA Today' explains how the Trump administration is now set to lay out a new rule. They are about to implement this. It will lower the cost, create choices by expanding association health plans. These plans allow businesses and trade associations to come together and buy health insurance plans in bulk. That saves a ton of money. And, by the way, a huge development, you get more care for less money. And the president also is taking steps to reduce the bloat. Remember that $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that nobody liked? Well, thank god, he is now -- he reluctantly signed it, now, this is the bill the president threatened to veto. But remember, he was forced to kind of sign it because Congress -- well, they left town. They are too lazy. The White House is looking into using what is known as the Impoundment Control Act. It's a law from 1974. It gives the president the authority to cancel spending already approved by Congress. By the way, they only need 51 votes in the Senate, Mitch. Congress would have 45 days to approve the president's request to cut from the massive spending bill. Again, he is keeping a promise. Let's hope that happens. Then, on top of all of, this just take a look at the side of your screen. You will never see this in the media. A list of just some of the president's many accomplishments during his short time in office. Remember the Heritage foundation they did a study the president's first year, they found he has already accomplished 64 percent of his agenda, which by the way, is higher than Ronald Reagan's 49 percent at the same time in his presidency. These are real, tangible achievements that help the forgotten men and women that voted in November of 2016 that the liberal media will never talk about because they never want to give the president credit for anything. And as we have been explaining, President Trump is just on fire and it's time for congressional Republicans to follow suit, time to get a back home. Time to keep their promises. No more waiting around. Let's see what happens in 2018. It's time for members of the GOP, keep their word. Keep their promises. And that means they should build this southern wall. They should keep the seven-year promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare. You know, things they said and promised when they were campaigning. Here's what's going to happen if Republicans don't keep their promises -- Democrats are going to try to systematically undo every single one of those accomplishments, we will put them back on the screen. Nancy Pelosi has already threatened that she's going to try and repeal the tax cuts that benefit 90 percent of Americans. By the way, you keep going, Nancy, good job. Don't stop. I want you to stay on message. So, it's up to congressional Republicans to show some backbone, some spine and actually fight for the president's agenda that you voted for. Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz -- now, he is going to join news a few minutes -- he's out with a list 10 things that Congress should be doing right now. In the article, Chaffetz suggest Congress should explain and clarify the conflicts of interest on special counsel Mueller's team. I don't think there is an explanation. They should formally demand the appointment of a second special prosecutor with the power to prosecute. He lists call FISA court judges before Congress to offer public testimony. They were all lied to. Call Attorney General Jeff Sessions to testify about outstanding congressional subpoenas. Hold hearings on securing our borders. Fortifying them with a wall and then pass legislation allowing the president to reallocate funds from the DOD. And, of course, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, she should be called to testify. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey, they should be called to testify about their speech suppression practices, especially against conservatives. So, Zuckerberg will testify before lawmakers next week about Cambridge Analytics. Congress by the way should make an effort to reform the broken budget process. They should give states the opportunity to vote on whether Congress should be subject to balancing the federal budget and finally the Senate should refuse to recess until every single one of the president's appointees have been voted on. Mitch, time to work. Anyway, Congressman Chaffetz will be here in a minute. But, first, we have breaking news tonight. House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes, he has sent a letter to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray. Nunes is blasting the repeated stonewalling by the Department of Justice which is being led by Rosenstein and refusing continually to hand over documents that have been subpoenaed by Congress. Remember, Rosenstein is the guy that ran in to Paul Ryan's office back in January at the last hour, begging Speaker Ryan to block Congressman Nunes' request for documents about all the FISA abuses in the dossier. We wouldn't have learned that had Paul Ryan capitulated. Without those documents there never would have been a Nunes memo and wouldn't have known about any of the massive scandals we are talking about every night unfolding like the FISA abuse, lying to judges to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate. In that case, Carter Page. Rod Rosenstein, why does he want to keep all of this a secret? Why does he want to protect all his corrupt friends? But now, after months of obstructing, Chairman Nunes is demanding answers. And, by the way, Nunes has been asking for documents. Some go back to August of 2017. Rod, hand the documents over to the American people. That's how ridiculous this entire process is, and Nunes is now requesting the DOJ do their job and, of course, Congress has their jobs, we have checks and balances, we have co-equal branches of government. The DOJ turn over the unredacted version of an FBI memo related to the bureau's opening of the Russia investigation. Nunes has set a deadline April 11th. Given what we have seen from Rosenstein, it's probably going to be a long time before the House Intel Committee gets to see this. The level of obstruction and protection, the incestuous nature of the relationships, this is beyond disgraceful. Rosenstein has done everything possible that he can do to prevent Congress from doing their job which is oversight. They have constitutional not only right but duty to do so. So, tonight, it's time for Rod Rosenstein to stop hiding the truth from the American people. Now, his boss is the Attorney General Jeff Sessions. And Jeff Sessions rightly said last week that he is angry at the slow pace that these documents are being turned over. Well, you know what? Well, the attorney general needs to do something about it. If the attorney general is angry, he needs to take action and force the Deputy A.G. Rosenstein to do his job. And if Rosenstein doesn't want to, then he needs to go, because that is how our government is supposed to work. Congress needs to be able to get answers on behalf of you. We now see corruption at the highest levels of government. And then you got a corrupt media -- well, they are in major denial. That's they're beside themselves over reports that President Trump is not currently -- oh, let me repeat, not a target of the special counsel Robert Mueller's corrupt investigation. Despite this new development, the media is desperate. They are holding out hope. They are on their knees. They are praying to god that somehow, some way, Robert Mueller will still find a way to make Donald Trump the target and go after the president. Think through this. If that ever happened, is that good for the country? Is that good for the forgotten men and women of the country? Does that create jobs? Does that get people out of poverty and offer food stamps? No. Does it keep us safer? No. Do they seem to care? No. Take a look."

You know, when Comey -- before Comey was fired, he said -- he told Trump that he was not a target of their investigation. It appears that nothing has changed after over a year."

Collusion is not a crime. But, first, joining us now, our top story, Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz. I am holding this in my hand. This was a brilliant idea, 10 things Congress should do but won't. And I read this and I am saying why wouldn't they, especially in light of everything that I just laid out that the president is doing, troops to the border, is he helping on healthcare, is he going to go back to the omnibus bill. You know, everything -- he's doing what he can on his own. Why doesn't -- why don't the Republicans want to do these things?"

You know, last night, I got such incredible reaction to your comments. Collusion is not a crime. But we go from collusion to obstruction to then bank records. He is not a target.

But it's not the cover-up. It's that prosecutors induce cover-ups, which is why innocent people shouldn't be testifying unless they absolutely have to because you can be indicted for perjury even if you tell the truth.

The fact that he has been recently notified that he is the subject means absolutely nothing. He is not even a subject. He is a witness. A subject is a person hesitate conduct is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation. What the hell does that mean? It means they don't have anything on him. There have been 19 criminal cases. Not one piece of evidence against the president of the United States. And now, we are told that Mueller wants to interview the president of the United States who knows nothing, who has been a witness to nothing, who is not a target of the investigation.
