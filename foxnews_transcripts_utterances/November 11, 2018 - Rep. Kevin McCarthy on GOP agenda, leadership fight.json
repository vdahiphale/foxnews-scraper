I think we have to retool part of what the Republicans said we needed to do. But a couple things happened that concern me as well. Money mattered in some of these races.

On this day in the year 1918, church bells rang, families embraced and celebrations, as you know, filled the streets like never before in towns throughout Europe and the United States. But victory had come at a terrible cost among the Allied forces. More than one million French soldiers and 116,000 American service members had been killed by the war's end. And millions more were wounded. Countless would come home bearing the lasting scars of trench warfare and the grisly horrors of chemical weapons. During the final battle of the war, over 26,000 Americans lost their lives, and more than 95,000 were wounded. It was the single deadliest battle in United States history. Think of that; 26,000 Americans lost their lives in a battle. Here on the revered grounds of Suresnes American Cemetery lie more than 1,500 U.S. service members who made the ultimate sacrifice in the First World War. Among those buried here are legendary Marines who fought in the Battle of Belleau Wood. In that treacherous forest and the surrounding fields, American Marine soldiers and Allied forces for. And they fought through hell to turn the tide of the war. And that's what they did. They turned the tide of the war. It was in that battle that our Marines earned the nickname Devil Dogs, arising from the German description of their ferocious fighting spirit. John Kelly knows that name Devil Dogs very well, John, right? Earlier this year, President Macron presented an oak sapling from Belleau Wood as a gift to our nation, an enduring reminder of our friendship sealed in battle. We fought well together. You could not fight better than we fought together. Sergeant Eugene Weir (ph) from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, was one of the Marines at Belleau Wood. Eugene raced straight into a barrage of enemy fire like no one has ever seen before to bandage his friend's wounds and carry him back to safety. Months later, Eugene was mortally wounded. He passed away one day after Christmas. His mother would come right here to mourn by the grave or her precious son. She loved him so much. She was one of the thousands of American moms and dads whose beloved children found their final resting place on the hillside of Suresnes. Each of these marble crosses and Stars of David marks the life of an American warrior, great, great warriors, they are, who gave everything for family country, God and freedom. Through rain, hail, snow, mud, poisonous gas, bullets and mortar, they held the line and pushed onward to victory. It was a great, great victory, costly victory, but a great victory. Never knowing if they would ever again see their families or ever again hold their loved ones. Here are the words of a young soldier name Sergeant Paul Maynard (ph) from a letter he wrote only a few days before the end of the war. \"Dear mother, I think of you all at home, and I know, if I am spared to get back, that I shall appreciate home more than ever, ever before. It will seem like heaven to me to be once more where there is peace and only peace.\" On November 11, 1918, Paul died in the final hours of battle, just before the end. No, sadly, he did not make it. He was among the countless young men who never returned home. But through their sacrifice, they ascended to peace in heaven. Rest in peace, Paul. The American and French patriots of World War I embody the timeless virtues of our two republics, honor and courage, strength and valor, love and loyalty, grace and glory. It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago. It is now my great honor to present Major General William Matz (ph) with an American flag as a symbol of our nation's gratitude to the American Battle Monuments. The commission has done such an incredible job. And, General, we very much appreciate it. Today, we renew our sacred obligation to memorialize our fallen heroes on the soil where they rest for all of eternity. Thank you very much. And, General, this is a great honor. Thank you very much.

As being a son of a firefighter, I just want to assure them all resources will be provided to make sure we take care of this fire out there. Tuesday night, we now face a divided government and a divided country. It's our job to put it back together again. There are a lot of reasons why some of these races were lost. I think we have to retool part of what the Republicans said we needed to do. But a couple things happened that concern me as well. Money mattered in some of these races. The Republicans were outspent by $150 million, Bloomberg spent just some of these California races alone $8 million just in two that we ended up losing. And I have a little concern even with your own network, FOX, calling election at 6:33, when California and a number of -- seven other states out in the West were still opened. Now we're finding from Utah and others that, after the election, some of these returns are coming back not as people thought as the election was going forward. Did some people not vote because of that? We know this has been an issue for both sides. Back in 1984, there was a resolution passed in the House and Senate condemning these type of actions. We want to make sure everybody votes. And I always think that you probably should not call elections or change in an entire Congress before all the polls are closed."

When you look at the seats we have lost, more than 15 of those are going to be carried by counties or areas that President Trump carried. I look at what the Democrats' agenda is. What is it? It's investigating the president, trying to impeach him, abolishing ICE. America is too great to be led by such a small vision. And that's why I believe we will make sure that, one, our first agenda is to make sure we move America forward. Our second would be win this majority back."

Unfortunately, the Democrats in the last Congress, not one of them would vote for either bill, just as not one Democrat would vote for the tax bill in the House or the Senate that moved our economy to be the strongest in the last 50 years. That, I hope, will change as we move forward, to be able to solve the problems that are still standing before us."

That has been the challenge."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, first, you want to look at what happened under the eight years of Republicans being in the majority. It's the history of government to always increase spending every year. When you look at what we will be spending, discretionary, that part that Congress has control over, we will be $13 billion less than we were when we took over back in 2011, the last time Nancy Pelosi was speaker. If you look at those eight years, and you look at what Congressional Budget Office said we would be spending today, having eight years of Republicans, overall total spending, we have saved $4.3 trillion by having Republicans in control. Now, we have got a lot further to go. We have got the economy growing at a pace no one thought we could."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And, of course, the president will layout his budget come January. And then you will be working in a new era with the Democrats in the majority. What, realistically, can get done with the Dems in the majority? You just said much of the platform on the left is to investigate the president. So what do you believe can get done legislatively?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, we will want to find common ground. We will look to make sure we continue to make our military strong, make sure that we can combat China and others of their aggressive actions and also, when it comes to trade, expanding. We want to find places that we can find common ground, but those places that we principally disagree with, we will stand up strongly to show America the difference to make sure that we can continue to grow this country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, you wonder if the president makes a policy mistake by agreeing to something like an infrastructure package, where there seems to be common ground, but costs $2 trillion, adding to the debt. I mean, isn't it true that we're spending $1 billion a day just on interest payments, given the fact that interest rates are moving up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, you look at -- with interest rates moving up, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, if we want to protect those for the future, we have got to be able to secure those, and that means finding common ground to solve the problem as we move forward. Republicans have been very successful in these eight years of bending that cost curve on the discretionary funding that we have control over. The Democrats were not. We're actually spending $13 billion less in discretionary money today over the last eight years, the last time Nancy Pelosi was speaker. That's a real concern to me, that they come back for their old ways, because, remember, they won a majority only because history repeated itself, not because they had an agenda that moved America in the right direction."
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

He's got his races next week as well. He's on the Judiciary Committee. And he has been very vocal about saying he wants to see the president's tax returns. That's going to be one of the priorities of the Judiciary Committee. Your thoughts on how you and the Congress will deal with all of the investigations that are sure to come? Will the Democrats be able to stop the president's agenda?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think the Democrats are going to be able to stop this agenda, because look at how much we have been able to grow. I know what the Democrats want to do, just investigations and impeachment. But as I have said before, America's too great for a vision so small. I believe what we're able to achieve as we move forward is finding where we grow economically, we're able to secure that middle-class tax cut and make it permanent, whether we're able to continue to give raises to our military, whether we're able to combat the opioid problem in the future, and actually curtail this debt that we have that's going to hurt the future generations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, how do you do that, though? If you're talking about protecting the military, you're talking about making sure that those raises go in place, then you're also talking about cutting spending or getting that balanced budget back in place. The only option left is to cut some of the entitlements, right, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, the real fear I have is what the Democrats plan to do. They believe Medicare for all, a government-controlled health care system - - this is what more than 100 of the Democrats have co-sponsored inside the House. That will bankrupt Medicare. More than 50 percent of Americans get their health care from their employer. That will become illegal in the process. It would break the system that we currently have. That is why it's important that Republicans continue to put forth their ideas, their ideas to make health care a better quality at a lower price, that we continue to do this on a time-and-time- again basis."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Let me -- let me ask you about practicality in terms of the agenda, when you are working with the Dems in the majority. You have been working on tax cuts 2.0. Does that go away at this point, given the fact that not one Democrat voted for your first tax cut plan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "I don't believe so, because it's already passed the House. We still have a number of weeks in session that's over in the Senate. We will continue to fight for it, because, Maria, it is the right principle. It is the right policy. And that should overcome politics. We should put people before politics, and I will be excited to see the day that the Democrats want to join us with that."

If you look what's happening in China, as our market has continued to rise, as our economy has continued to get stronger, theirs has become weaker. And this is really by the leadership of President Trump.

Exactly 100 years ago today, on November 11, 1918, World War I came to an end, thank God. It was a brutal war. Millions of American, French and allied troops had fought with extraordinary skill and valor in one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history. We are gathered together at this hallowed resting place to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle. Earlier, Melania and I were deeply honored to be the guests of President Macron and Brigitte at the centennial commemoration of Armistice Day. It was very beautiful. So, well done. To all of the French military leaders and dignitaries in attendance with us now, thank you for joining us as we honor the American and French service members who shed their blood together in a horrible, horrible war, but a war known as the Great War. We're also joined by many distinguished American military leaders. Thank you to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford. Thank you, Joe. Thank you. Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley. Thank you, Mark. Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Curtis Scaparrotti. General, thank you. And Air Force Commander Europe General Tod D. Wolters. Thank you. Thank you, General. thank you as well to the members of Congress who have joined us, Ralph Abraham, Anthony Brown, John Carter, Paul Cook, Henry Cuellar, Richard Hudson, Bill Huizenga, Dutch Ruppersberger, John Rutherford, and Steve Stivers. Thank you all very much for being with us. Thank you very much. I know you wanted to be here very badly. We appreciate it. In the United States, Armistice Day is now enshrined as Veterans Day. We have a number of amazing veterans with us today, including six veterans of World War II. James Blayne (ph). James -- where is James? James, thank you. Thank you, James. Frank Divita (ph).

And he worked and saved all of his money for two years to make this trip to France. He wanted to be here in person to honor the American heroes of World War I. Matthew, thank you.

On this day in the year 1918, church bells rang, families embraced and celebrations, as you know, filled the streets like never before in towns throughout Europe and the United States. But victory had come at a terrible cost among the Allied forces. More than one million French soldiers and 116,000 American service members had been killed by the war's end. And millions more were wounded. Countless would come home bearing the lasting scars of trench warfare and the grisly horrors of chemical weapons. During the final battle of the war, over 26,000 Americans lost their lives, and more than 95,000 were wounded. It was the single deadliest battle in United States history. Think of that; 26,000 Americans lost their lives in a battle. Here on the revered grounds of Suresnes American Cemetery lie more than 1,500 U.S. service members who made the ultimate sacrifice in the First World War. Among those buried here are legendary Marines who fought in the Battle of Belleau Wood. In that treacherous forest and the surrounding fields, American Marine soldiers and Allied forces for. And they fought through hell to turn the tide of the war. And that's what they did. They turned the tide of the war. It was in that battle that our Marines earned the nickname Devil Dogs, arising from the German description of their ferocious fighting spirit. John Kelly knows that name Devil Dogs very well, John, right? Earlier this year, President Macron presented an oak sapling from Belleau Wood as a gift to our nation, an enduring reminder of our friendship sealed in battle. We fought well together. You could not fight better than we fought together. Sergeant Eugene Weir (ph) from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, was one of the Marines at Belleau Wood. Eugene raced straight into a barrage of enemy fire like no one has ever seen before to bandage his friend's wounds and carry him back to safety. Months later, Eugene was mortally wounded. He passed away one day after Christmas. His mother would come right here to mourn by the grave or her precious son. She loved him so much. She was one of the thousands of American moms and dads whose beloved children found their final resting place on the hillside of Suresnes. Each of these marble crosses and Stars of David marks the life of an American warrior, great, great warriors, they are, who gave everything for family country, God and freedom. Through rain, hail, snow, mud, poisonous gas, bullets and mortar, they held the line and pushed onward to victory. It was a great, great victory, costly victory, but a great victory. Never knowing if they would ever again see their families or ever again hold their loved ones. Here are the words of a young soldier name Sergeant Paul Maynard (ph) from a letter he wrote only a few days before the end of the war. \"Dear mother, I think of you all at home, and I know, if I am spared to get back, that I shall appreciate home more than ever, ever before. It will seem like heaven to me to be once more where there is peace and only peace.\" On November 11, 1918, Paul died in the final hours of battle, just before the end. No, sadly, he did not make it. He was among the countless young men who never returned home. But through their sacrifice, they ascended to peace in heaven. Rest in peace, Paul. The American and French patriots of World War I embody the timeless virtues of our two republics, honor and courage, strength and valor, love and loyalty, grace and glory. It is our duty to preserve the civilization they defended and to protect the peace they so nobly gave their lives to secure one century ago. It is now my great honor to present Major General William Matz (ph) with an American flag as a symbol of our nation's gratitude to the American Battle Monuments. The commission has done such an incredible job. And, General, we very much appreciate it. Today, we renew our sacred obligation to memorialize our fallen heroes on the soil where they rest for all of eternity. Thank you very much. And, General, this is a great honor. Thank you very much. Thank you."

We won all across America running on a message to get things done for the American people, to focus on driving down the cost of health care, particularly the cost of prescription drugs, raising family incomes by rebuilding the country and creating 16 million good-paying jobs with a serious infrastructure bill, and taking on the serious corruption in Washington, the money and politics, and reforming our system. So Democrats ran on that. We won in places like Kansas and Pennsylvania and Michigan. And it shows, when Democrats speak about the issues that matter in people's lives and have an agenda to improve those things, we can get elected, and we can win. So I think was a great night for our party, a great night for our country."

    {
      "speaker": "CICILLINE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, nothing could be further from the truth. Democrats ran on a very specific agenda. I helped craft it with my two co- chairs on the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. It's an agenda for the people of this country. It's focusing on driving down the cost of health care, driving down the cost of prescription drugs, protecting coverage for preexisting condition, raising family incomes by rebuilding our country with a serious infrastructure plan for our roads, bridges, ports, transit systems. We will create 16 million good-paying jobs. And taking on the corruption in Washington by getting money out of our political system. Those are issues Democrats ran on and won. That's our agenda. We're going to make good on those promises. Obviously, we also have a responsibility to do oversight. It's a constitutional obligation. We ought to do it, do it carefully, do it seriously. But we are able to do both things. The American people expect us to move forward on the things that are going to make their lives better and, at the same time, hold this administration accountable and do oversight, as the Constitution requires."

We just saw 4.2 percent economic growth in the second quarter, 3.5 percent economic growth in the third quarter. We are seeing record unemployment numbers. So the economic policies have clearly been working. But not one Democrat voted for the tax cuts. A lot of your colleagues complained about the rollback in regulations. Are you going to try to raise taxes?"

And the fact is, that tax gave 83 percent of that tax cut to the top 1 percent, to the richest people in this country. And now the Republicans are proposing we pay for that by cutting Medicare and Social Security. We can't do that. We have got to protect Social Security and Medicare. We need a tax cut for middle-class families, not 83 percent of it going to the top 1 percent, richest people in this country, and the most powerful corporations."

The way you grow the economy is, you make sure middle-class families have more money in their pocket, so they can buy the goods and services business produces. Growing the middle class is how you have sustainable economic growth. This sort of trickle-down economics, that if you just let rich people keep more of their money, somehow it's going to trickle down to the rest of it, just doesn't work in the long term."

That will save tens of billions of dollars, not only for consumers, but for the taxpayers. This is a simple thing to do, allow the government to negotiate discounted prices, and save on prescription drugs. The president has spoken about it.

In terms of the oversight role, because you're going to have a very key role in terms of oversight, being a member of the Judiciary Committee, obviously, and looking at some of this oversight investigations that you mentioned, you want to see the president's tax returns. We know that the Senate is -- the majority in the Senate is Republican. Is this going to be just a big waste of time, given the fact that we know that it's going to -- you're going to need two-thirds of a vote in the Senate, 67 votes in the Senate to get anything passed?

We have independent responsibilities to do oversight. We will do both things. We don't need the Senate to do oversight. So, I hope that they will agree with us that that agenda about driving down health care costs, rebuilding our country, and taking the money out of our political system, that we can find common ground. The president spoke about those three things as three of his priorities. He actually hasn't delivered on them, but he says he's committed to them.

Speaking of corruption, we know that there was massive abuse to the FISA court when information was not given to the FISA court about the Democrats and Hillary Clinton paying for the dossier, et cetera. There has been this investigation in the Judiciary Committee, your committee, as you know, Bob Goodlatte leading the investigation of Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr. Are you going to drop that investigation now, or are you going to pursue the truth there?"

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. And we're back with Rhode Island Democratic Congressman David Cicilline. And, Congressman, we ended there talking about the FISA abuse that took place in the 2016 election. We know that the FBI and the DOJ, that a warrant to wiretap an American citizen based on a dossier which was actually unverified and it was paid for by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign. Are you saying that was not FISA abuse?"

      "speaker": "CICILLINE",

    {
      "speaker": "CICILLINE",
      "utterance": "It had to -- it has to do with an ongoing campaign to undermine the legitimacy of this investigation. We shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the Russians attacked American democracy. They attacked American democracy. And we ought to take that seriously. And we should do oversight."

      "speaker": "CICILLINE",
      "utterance": "There have been -- people have been fired because of the appearance of impropriety, because of some text messages that were made. But I think this is an important investigation. There has been an ongoing effort from many of my Republican colleagues to undermine the legitimacy of this investigation. Fortunately, some of them lost because the American people want to get to the bottom of this."

      "speaker": "CICILLINE",
      "utterance": "The Democratic -- the House Judiciary Committee will conduct oversight on the many issues which have not been the subject of oversight for the last two years. We have a 500-page document that details our efforts to do oversight that our Republican colleagues have refused to do. And we're going to get to work on that right away."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Hard to know where to begin. The notion that there was no FISA abuse is ridiculous. The FISA court wasn't told the reason why Steele was no longer an FBI informant, which is not only that he spoke to the press, but that he lied about it. There's a big difference in his credibility."
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Exactly. Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Secondly, Carter Page, who was the subject of the FISA warrant, they had to show that -- probable cause to believe that -- not only that he was an agent of a foreign power, but that he was involved in the commission of a crime. The one person in all of this who has not been charged with a crime is Carter Page."

    },

      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, the notion that there is -- that there is a constitutional duty of oversight, it's hogwash."

      "utterance": "Yes."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Let me switch gears and ask you about this legal spat over naming Matthew Whitaker as the acting attorney general. Your thoughts on this? Does the president need to get a Senate-confirmed A.G. in there as soon as possible, or what are your thoughts on Matthew Whitaker?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "I don't know Matthew Whitaker. I know people who think highly of him. But that doesn't necessarily mean that he can fill this position. The -- there is a statutory authorization to name somebody who has the qualifications Matt Whitaker has. He's been there for 90 days in a senior role. The -- under the Vacancies Act, he can be appointed. However, the Constitution says that the president can appoint officials, which is defined by Supreme Court cases as principal officers, only with the advice and consent of the Senate. Matt Whitaker is not -- wasn't in a position that was confirmed by the Senate. There are people who were."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, but -- right. But Noel Francisco, who is the solicitor general, could be put in as acting, and he would be qualified."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "We're going to -- we're going to keep following this, because this -- this is going to be real critical, particularly as the Dems are trying to investigate the president. Will they be able to get his tax returns and create and perhaps impeach, impeach the president, based on what they have?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Look, impeachment is a political act. And if they have a majority, conceivably, they could pass an article of impeachment. Obviously, they need two-thirds of the Senate to convict. And that's not happening. Whether they're going to do that or not, I have no idea. In order to get his tax returns, they would have to show that it relates to a subject that they are legitimately investigating. If they can, they will get them."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "All right, we will leave it there. Michael Mukasey, it was a pleasure. We needed more time with you this morning. We hope you will come back. Have a wonderful Sunday, everybody.
