We have low crime. We have a lot of optimism. So now, we have all these little things. And the reason why it's all about Trump is because the media makes it all about Trump. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If there was no Trump, God help us all, right? What would we be talking about? Anyway, prison reform, OK? I kind of get the sense that this is the Ms. Congeniality award, right? This is like, oh, finally, something good. I have mixed feelings about this. I look and I think we're into our fourth decade of decline in violent crime. This is the safest society known to mankind. Do necessarily reform something that is this successful? if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Having said that, I read the reforms. I think they're fairly moderate. I don't see anything -- it's affecting 10 percent of federal inmates -- 10 percent of the prison population. It's focusing on a portion of that. There's like 2,500 other prisoners that can apply for some kind of early release. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } So, it's actually fairly small steps. The key is the training, right? To get these -- to get inmates to learn something, so that when they get out of prison they don't end up back in prison, and I think that's an important piece to this and that's the positive part about this. But my overall observation on this is, you got criminal justice reform, you've got actual gun control, he banned bump stocks, we're pulling out of Syria, the deficit keeps growing, I'm pretty sure we have a progressive in office. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I mean, we've said this three years ago, Trump is a centrist.

It's weird to see the Democrats not cooperating with this guy when he did prison reform, right? Well, he's pulling out of Syria. He wants the wall. What will he give you?

I've described everyone. Which is why I go out of my way to find Christmas stories that do the opposite. Like this one. It stars former NASA engineer Mark Rober, who decided to punish people who stole packages from his front porch. Using his extensive background devising unusual machines, he booby-trapped some fake packages and then left them outside for thieves to take. These harmless but highly devious packages contain exploding packets of very fine glitter, as well as a stink bomb that goes off after the glitter explodes. Also inside, he has camera phones that will capture the mayhem. So like clockwork, after putting the packages out on a few porches, they were stolen. And this is what happened.",

And President Trump declaring victory internationally here against ISIS in Syria in a tweet, and announcing the 2,000 American troops will be withdrawing very soon. All of this, of course, happening as Democrats prepares an onslaught of investigations into President Trump and his administration. Dana, I'll start with you. This feels like a muddy moment."

But also, giving a hand to the Democrats who said we want to work with him. It's that important. Sometimes issues take so long to work its way through, and the public has to come along. It takes a little while to do that. This is a big win and it will help a lot of people, so that's good. On ISIS, I think that one is -- it's certainly the president's prerogative.

Everyone was saying, oh, you know, that reflects that the libertarian wing of the Republican Party is strong. Also, when you talk about Syria, withdrawing the troops, I think it was a different side of him. And it was a side that he campaigned heavily on. I remember when he was campaigning, hearing him talk about, you know, his involvement in potential war, that was something -- I have a strong libertarian streak that kind of attracted me to him. And I wonder if that part of the party, the Rand Paul's, the Mike Lee's have pull a little bit of pressure on him to not go so hawkish and to try to get some of these things done that they feel will appeal more to not only them but also to independent voters, to people on the center, to younger voters as he looks forward to, you know, his next run. He's going to need a lot of those people in the middle who might be attracted to policies like that."

I think a lot of people feel as if they've been talking and just stomp by the presence of Jeff Sessions as attorney general who refused to move on this, and then Mitch McConnell who wouldn't call a vote. Mitch McConnell changed his mind and went along. But the president and the White House had been in favor of this all along. And so, yes, in that sense you could say it's a win for the president."

So much of it is just everything Trump is news. But in fact, I think what you're going to see especially from Nancy Pelosi in House leadership is an emphasis on showing voters that, guess what, our party is able to succeed and to reach solutions, get things done for you. Like, for instance, when we talk about this wall, I mean, President Trump said, oh, you know what, Mexico is going to pay for it. That's what he campaigned on, right? Then he said, oh, the military will build it, right? And then he said, oh, no, I'll find the money, we're going to get -- and, obviously, it was never going to get done. It's not going to get done."

      "utterance": "No, I'm going to put them -- number one, we all think this is big news because the really big news isn't happening, which means the country is in pretty good condition. We have low crime. We have a lot of optimism. So now, we have all these little things. And the reason why it's all about Trump is because the media makes it all about Trump. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If there was no Trump, God help us all, right? What would we be talking about? Anyway, prison reform, OK? I kind of get the sense that this is the Ms. Congeniality award, right? This is like, oh, finally, something good. I have mixed feelings about this. I look and I think we're into our fourth decade of decline in violent crime. This is the safest society known to mankind. Do necessarily reform something that is this successful? Having said that, I read the reforms. I think they're fairly moderate. I don't see anything -- it's affecting 10 percent of federal inmates -- 10 percent of the prison population. It's focusing on a portion of that. There's like 2,500 other prisoners that can apply for some kind of early release. So, it's actually fairly small steps. The key is the training, right? To get these -- to get inmates to learn something, so that when they get out of prison they don't end up back in prison, and I think that's an important piece to this and that's the positive part about this. But my overall observation on this is, you got criminal justice reform, you've got actual gun control, he banned bump stocks, we're pulling out of Syria, the deficit keeps growing, I'm pretty sure we have a progressive in office. I mean, we've said this three years ago, Trump is a centrist. He's a pragmatist. You can't guess which way he's going to go. He's not an ideologue. It's weird to see the Democrats back to the wall. It's weird to see the Democrats not cooperating with this guy when he did prison reform, right? Well, he's pulling out of Syria. He wants the wall. What will he give you? He will give you what you want. So, it's clearly about being obstructionist. That's the Democrats. The Democrats are the law (ph)."

Documents reportedly show it allowed companies like Netflix, Spotify, to read users private messages. And search engine, Bing, was able to see the names of almost all of user's friends without permission. Facebook denying it did so without consent saying, quote, \"To be clear, none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people's permission, nor did they violate our 2012 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.\" Greg, you keep up with this stuff, what do you think?"

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

You can't actually define what it is, so it just keeps rolling along. And you know that old line, it's easier to ask forgiveness than to beg for permission. That's their mission statement because you don't know what they are. They just make the mistake and go whoops. That was an accident. But, of the three major social media platforms, they're the least bad of the three. Google has turned your desires into a commodity. They're selling your searches to the highest bidder. They pretend to be a charity. Here, use our product, but then it's actually theft. They're stealing you and they're selling you. And then, Twitter, you know, is a message board run by seriously stupid, naive people, you know, who basically operate solely on target shaming. Twitter is now designed to isolate and hurt people. So, of the three, I would say Twitter is the worst, number one, Google is second, and Facebook, you know, they're just making mistakes along the way."

But then, how are they going to make money? They make money by selling ads. What other kind of companies sell ads? Media companies sell ads. And so, I think that, politically, that that's where this is headed. And it's going to come from the right and the left. This is where you might actually see a lot of bipartisanship. They have different issues. The right is concerned about some of the censorship issues. The left is going to say they're concerned about privacy. But right now, at this moment, the Democrats are having a big fight about their list and who's going to be able to have access to it. Why? Because information about people is really important. Marketing, if you subscribe to a newspaper, guaranteed that you're on a list somewhere so that they know -- OK, you can share with others and that's how you -- the phone calls you used to get or things like that. This also does remind me a little bit though of the NSA surveillance program that was -- everyone was up in arms. So, yes, it is possible that you could surveil everybody and everything and they could listen to all of your phone calls. But, you know what? They have a job to do, so they were looking for actual intel on things where they can prevent threats. What do Spotify and Netflix and those guys need to do? They need to make money. So are they reading all of your personal messages because they really want to know, like something -- like deeply personal about you? I'm not saying that it's right.

Position is a safety blanket, but now it's been spread over culture and it's suffocating real speech. The only solution to this, and also if you -- the one scary thing about P.C., if you have a -- if you forgive somebody for doing something that's considered a violation of the P.C. thing, you're an accessory to the racism or sexism or homophobia or transphobia that has occurred.

It stars former NASA engineer Mark Rober, who decided to punish people who stole packages from his front porch. Using his extensive background devising unusual machines, he booby-trapped some fake packages and then left them outside for thieves to take. These harmless but highly devious packages contain exploding packets of very fine glitter, as well as a stink bomb that goes off after the glitter explodes. Also inside, he has camera phones that will capture the mayhem. So like clockwork, after putting the packages out on a few porches, they were stolen. And this is what happened."
