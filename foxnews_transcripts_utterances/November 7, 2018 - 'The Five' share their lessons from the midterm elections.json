But what happened was everyone was mad at Secretary Rumsfeld, not necessarily President Bush, but he knew that the frustration was really pent-up, especially on Capitol Hill. So you lose. You should make a change, right? You should do something to show that you got it, you heard it, and you're moving on to try to fix something. So it was like the next -- I believe it was the very next day after the midterm, President Bush did let Rumsfeld go, said goodbye to him. And as Secretary Gates came onboard it was interesting just thinking back on that, so many people in the senate and legislators were so upset and said if you had fired Rumsfeld before the midterm, then we wouldn't have lost all these seats. I don't know if that's necessarily true. I think it was maybe, sort of, baked in the cake. But, yes, this feels like that. The president, from a communications standpoint, I think very smart not to reveal that he was going to fire Jeff Sessions after the press conference that he did for 87 minutes. But he gave a couple of tales. One of the things I think to watch for is throughout the press conference the president said over and over again the Mueller investigation is costing the American people too much money. It's too expensive. It's too expensive. Matt Whitaker is on record saying that it is within the power of the attorney general's office to whittle down the budget of the special counsel.

The president already naming Sessions' chief of staff Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general.

And also the people that won aren't crazy progressives. In the suburbs, a lot of them are veterans. And the one that loss, a lot of them like Beto and a few other people were progressive. So that's good. So the good news is the Dems get the house so the kids get to play with the toys. The Republicans get the senate so the adults handle the heavy machinery. And it creates a whole new story line for us, for us in the media. It's like your favorite sitcom getting a new neighbor, right? So now you have a whole new thing, the nemesis.

You now have a house that is dominated by the Democrats, and that's going to change things dramatically. They're already sort of chomping at the bit to get their hands on a number of these committee leaderships which is going to, I think -- one of the things I think that's very interesting this morning is that, you know, the day after the election, it was sort of that feeling, and I'm talking about the presidential election, that, you know, you sort of have the feeling -- oh, wow, you know, this is an incredible outcome. President Trump won so I guess this is the new reality and everyone is just going to sort of -- maybe accept this and the country moves on and you see where it goes next. But, no, it was like, bam, right out of the gate. And I felt that way this morning as well, watching the president's news conference this afternoon. You know, you sort felt like after last night, OK, so maybe things settle in a little bit. You've got, you know, divided government which is a very American reality situation. And right out of the gate, we have an incredibly contentious, and I know were going to talk about this a little bit more later, but incredibly contentious news conference and a very clear new reality in America."

Yeah, I mean, because I was so disappointed by what happened with the governor and the Democratic governor, would have been the first black governor of Florida -- or Stacey Abrams who is still in a contest in Florida. I think lots of Democrats were heavily emotionally as well as financially invested in Beto O'Rourke in Texas that came close. So, to me, it was terrific in terms of looking at the house races. And as I say, the big news is the Democrats now control the house. So when Greg says that's really good news, I was so pleased to hear my friends say that. But I think that it's big news in part because it's change the political landscape. That where you had one party rule in our country for the last two years, you now have Democrats in position not only to act as a check but to participate in terms of the legislative process, ideas and policies, in ways that we have grown accustomed to. But I just come back to the idea that when we have such a divided country, it's dangerous. I think there are a lot of feelings -- and I'm just disappointed and, you know, I would have liked a stronger sort of signal to President Trump that people don't like the divisive rhetoric and the anger and the kind of things he does. And you look at it and the results are that women, especially white women in the suburbs, went for the Democrats. The independents went for the Democrats. In rural America, President Trump had a very successful political strategy--"

And if you look at the big map, right, there's red all the way across in all the rural areas. Republicans are so strong there. But in the cities, these big major population centers including in Texas, you have Austin, San Antonio, Houston, Dallas, and those are growing cities that Republicans are going to have to keep -- I'm thinking 20 years down the road, you've got to think about that. Republicans usually had won the suburbs for a couple of decades. And to see that ground to Democrats is--"

Rocky relationship this has been and it's really been documented in the media since Sessions recused himself from the Mueller investigation. The president announcing that Matthew Whitaker who currently served as chief of staff to Sessions will become the acting attorney general. In a tweet earlier, President tweet -- President Trump - - you could call him president tweet."

So, Dana, I heard you earlier today saying that it sort of reminded you of your days at the Bush White House and the falling of the Rumsfeld tree."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. So leading into the midterms in 2006, people go back in time, the Iraq war in 2006, we suffered many casualties, many more Iraqi casualties. The American public was getting frustrated. The war was considered not to be going in a good direction. It was right after that that the surge was created. But what happened was everyone was mad at Secretary Rumsfeld, not necessarily President Bush, but he knew that the frustration was really pent-up, especially on Capitol Hill. So you lose. You should make a change, right? You should do something to show that you got it, you heard it, and you're moving on to try to fix something. So it was like the next -- I believe it was the very next day after the midterm, President Bush did let Rumsfeld go, said goodbye to him. And as Secretary Gates came onboard it was interesting just thinking back on that, so many people in the senate and legislators were so upset and said if you had fired Rumsfeld before the midterm, then we wouldn't have lost all these seats. I don't know if that's necessarily true. I think it was maybe, sort of, baked in the cake. But, yes, this feels like that. The president, from a communications standpoint, I think very smart not to reveal that he was going to fire Jeff Sessions after the press conference that he did for 87 minutes. But he gave a couple of tales. One of the things I think to watch for is throughout the press conference the president said over and over again the Mueller investigation is costing the American people too much money. It's too expensive. It's too expensive. Matt Whitaker is on record saying that it is within the power of the attorney general's office to whittle down the budget of the special counsel. And so, I don't know if that's what's going to happen, but that's a tell to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "There's been some speculation that he might suggest defunding the investigation over all. He has also indicated that he felt that the investigation has run amok of its purview in terms of investigating the actual Russia attempts to potentially hurt the -- affect the election. And it is, you know, sort of bled into family finances for the Trumps and all of that. Question, Jesse, in terms of Rod Rosenstein because a lot of people -- you know, he's the deputy attorney general. He was not moved up. Matt Whitaker was pulled in which is an odd succession for Sessions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Right. So they've sidelined Rod and put Whitaker at the top. So when the Mueller report comes in, it goes to Whitaker. It doesn't go to Rod. And, you know, whoever gets this report they can disclose whatever they want. They can keep it close to the vest. They could disclose everything. It's really up to Whitaker to do what he sees fit with this report from Robert Mueller. I was talking to your cohort, Stirewalt, and he was briefing me on the politics of this. And you know what? He's a lot smarter than you give him credit for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "I think I might actually do a podcast with him and steal him away because this is what he said. He said this is all about leverage with the negotiations about the interview that presidents supposed to give to Mueller. Right now they've been jockeying for position. Is it going to be oral? Is it going to be written? And they put it off until after the midterms. And right down now you're basically at the finish line. And is the president going to sit down and answer questions or it's all going to be written? And what this does by appointing Whitaker to oversee this thing, it gives leverage to the president. It signals to Robert Mueller that I'm in charge. I have more control than you do. And let's wrap this thing up based off on what Whitaker has said in writing. And in the past people call him a political operative. I understand why. But this is, right now, I think the next two months is -- you know, were going to see the end of this Mueller investigation."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And even suggestion that it was going to happen after the midterms. And suddenly there's all these shock and outrage, Greg. You know, everybody can't believe that the president did something that he'd been talking about and has the right to do for some time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "This is not a big story. It is not a big story. It's the yawn of the day, Dana. He made it two years. In Trump years, that's actually eight years. And so -- and the real casualty here is Jim Acosta because he had that 50 seconds of heroic outrage fame and it's kind of been quickly forgotten, although we'll bring it back in the next block. But the winner here pot smokers. Right now, I mean, you're watching marijuana stocks go up since this decision because we all kind of implicitly knew that Sessions was going to be a barrier to decriminalization and whatnot. So I think this is going to make that much easier. The love that the letter, the firing letter was probably dated and signed ages ago, right? I mean, it wasn't dated. It was signed ages ago and written. I think Trump does this with his marriages too. I'm not sure. But they're like pre-nups. He has them ready. Pulls them out, there you go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Today's the day. Juan, you know, some folks look at this and say President Trump, you know, he and Jeff Sessions had a great relationship early on. He was one of the first people to come on board, the Trump campaign. But it soured quickly when he recused himself from the Russia administration. And some people feel like, you know, President Obama had Eric Holder. They were symbiotic. They were on the same page in a lot of ways. And that a president deserves to have someone who he doesn't feel as an adversary in a difficult environment for him leading the justice department."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I don't think Jeff Sessions was ever an adversary to Donald Trump. I think the question was whether or not he should have recused himself and the president said the opinion that he should not have recused himself. And what you heard from Jeff Sessions is that he felt he had no choice because he not only had been in the campaign, remember he was being question, Martha, about contacts with Russian officials. So what strikes me here is that Whitaker is almost like mark. Whitaker has written articles saying he would have indicted Hillary Clinton, and that he does not think that the finances, the president's finances should be investigated by Robert Mueller."

And Pelosi was a mess last night when she, you know, was celebrating. She didn't look good. She was reading off a teleprompter. At one point she goes, let's give a hand to everybody with pre-existing conditions. I mean, like, what was that? I mean, she sounded like -- she's not ready to have won the house but she gained her composure today and I thought she said some good things about unity. And I think there's potential to do deals on health care and infrastructure."

And when we need to use it, we'll use it judiciously, but we certainly will use it. And if we don't need to use it, then, of course, we're open to negotiations. And the president says the same thing. I'm happy to deal with you to talk about infrastructure. He said Nancy and I could get along well he believes. And you know what? It's possible that they could. But he said if you hold this kind of acts over my head with more investigations, it's not going to be on the table. So I think they're both sort of in their corner and it's a question about who the bigger person is who can actually come forward and say let's try to work on something. And I think it's all about 2020 as well, in terms of figuring out, you know, do you want to host something that you can say this is what we accomplished and we're able to cross the aisle\"?

They even mentioned Puerto Rico, to investigate what happened down there. So they're, like, lining them all up. Look, there's one thing I've learned about Donald Trump over two years, reciprocity. It's like, if you do right by him, he will do right by you. And for example, I mean, he's a salesman. So he's always willing to -- like he talked to Kim Jong-un. So he can talk to anybody. So there is hope there that they can negotiate with him. However, if you do something bad, then it's mutually assured destruction. If you have a pie and he has a pie, and you throw that pie, he's going to throw the pie. It's far better to share the pie. Right?

A couple years later, Republicans won, like, 60-something seats in 2010. And Pelosi doesn't want to go out like that. This is the end of the road for her. She wants a legacy.

And Jeff Sessions, as you can see, being applauded at the moment. This is right outside the Justice Department on Constitution. That's his new -- the new attorney general Mr. Whitaker, shaking hands with him. It looks like he's about to get emotional air, and you can understand why. It's been a rough road. And that letter, as Jesse pointed out, was unsigned that he had given to the president. The president releasing the letter today and Jeff Sessions leaving tonight. So this was all done in rapid fashion. Sessions getting into a car there right outside the Justice Department, surrounded by senior staff.

He likes to push back against the media. Republicans have complained about the media for a long time. Conservatives have always felt that the media is unfair to them. Sort of call it out as your logs (ph) and weekly magazines that you get. But this is on a whole different scale. Some of the polling from last night about the dismal state of affairs for how people believe the president or don't believe the president; believe the media, don't believe the media. It's also part of this polarization that's happening. It did feel -- I felt bad for the young woman there that is -- she works for the president.

We didn't do as poorly in the House as they thought, picked up some very significant governorships.\" And he walked in there, and he didn't realize that a lot of the folks in the room had something totally different for breakfast.

And then Acosta and Gloria Borger, I think her name, were both wondering if Trump would use the word \"shellacking,\" because it was a shellacking. It wasn't a shellacking, you bozos. It wasn't even a blue wave. So I think that Jim Acosta actually embarrassed all of those people in there with his behavior. Because in a nutshell, what he said was \"President Trump, will you agree with me that I -- would you agree with me that you are a racist?\" That was what he was saying, and that's what CNN wanted them to say. They cannot move from their bitter emotional position. The president came out there sounding positive and conciliatory. It didn't matter. It just proves that CNN can't have nice things.

All of those editing decisiont things are happening up on the Hill. Now, the Democrats are driving the news and that the White House, if you're on defense, you're constantly trying to figure how to get back on offense. This might not be a problem for this White House, but I saw it happen in 2006 and '07 when, all of a sudden, the White House reporters didn't matter as much. And there's another reason.

The one who refused the accusatory bait and voted for Kavanaugh, Joe Manchin. He won. This is good news. It shows that many Americans saw a witch trial unfold before their very eyes, and they didn't shrug it off. It's true that the two biggest monsters, Feinstein and Crazy Mazie, did fine in the land of sunstroke and fish paste, but for the rest, their currently actions had consequences. Four people lost their jobs. So maybe the next time they're asked -- asked to play fair, Democrats might fear for their careers before destroying another's. Sure, it would be nice if they didn't resort to such horrible tactics, because they're good people, but they're politicians. On the evolutionary table of people we admire, you'll find nurses at the top and politicians at the bottom. They do what they do out of desire for power. So if they can't understand right and wrong, maybe they'll understand living their crap out in boxes. Do you think it had an effect, Dana?"

The worst poll I've ever seen in a midterm election in these Senate races. I could go on and on. Also, look at these approval numbers for President Trump in crucial states. Michigan, he's at 45.
