      "speaker": "ANITA HILL, BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "My advice is to push the pause button on this hearing, get the information together, bring in the experts, and put together a hearing that is fair, that is impartial, that is not biased by politics or by myth, and bring this information to the American public."

      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK, so the calls are for the FBI to get involved with this. They say that's not what we do. We prepare the file, we give it to the White House. Both the Democrats and the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have their own staff of investigators. Both could be involved in this process. Grassley has said we will send our people to Dr. Ford wherever she wants to tell the story so she doesn't have to come here. He says the Democrats aren't cooperating with that. They have their own investigators."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "They could do it themselves together or separately. The Democrats on the committee have staff investigators. They could start an investigation. And by the way, the Judiciary Committee gets special funds specifically to bulk up the staff temporarily to handle a Supreme Court nomination. There is the money to do it. They can go out there, presumably if the Democratic staff could talk to Christine Ford and the witnesses they can't talk to, Mark Judge. He's not going to talk to anybody, it appears. So they could possibly shake loose some information. And, believe me, the press would be interested in anything that they could discover."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So we've got a couple of letters just in the last hour, literally as I'm getting ready to come out for the show. We have a very lengthy letter from the chairman to all the Democrat members and what he said in the very end is there's been delay and obstruction of this process at every turn and with every argument available. Therefore I will view any additional complaints about the process very skeptically. He outlines exactly what they've tried to get done. He also sent this letter to the ranking member, Dianne Feinstein, and basically said to her I want to see this letter. And I think he is trying to figure out how exactly it got leaked, which seems to be a bit of a mystery how her name, Karen, ended up in the public sphere. No one's pointed the finger."

    {
      "speaker": "TUMULTY",
      "utterance": "Yes, but the incident was in the public sphere, but it was only after she, according to our reporting, really agonized over much of the summer as to whether she would actually put her name to this allegation. And can I just say, I have dealt with stories like this, some of which I've written about, some of which I haven't written about, and that is very typical. Very often as a journalist, and I assume the same thing happens in this kind of setting, somebody will come to you and they say something happened, I would like to talk to you confidentially about it. So this is not an unusual kind of process."
