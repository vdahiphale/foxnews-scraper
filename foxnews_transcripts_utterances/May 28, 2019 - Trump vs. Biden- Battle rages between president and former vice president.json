It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” The road to 2020 looking like a good one for the president, three new projection models predict Trump will win re-election, that's according to a former Obama administration official, Steven Ratner saying the combination of a strong economy and being the incumbent currently point to a win for Trump. And as the race to the White House continues to heat up, the president not letting up on his attacks on Joe Biden. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } While overseas, Trump ripping the former vice president for his role in the 1994 crime bill, critics say that legislation led to the mass incarceration for African-American, quote, anyone associated with the 1994 crime bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African-Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for criminal justice reform which has tremendous support and help fix the bad 1994 bill. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } But the road to 2020 could prove difficult for Biden. The Washington Post calling out his campaign strategy which is apparently not doing a lot of campaigning. Quote, the light public schedule reflects the unique position of his campaign. Advisors say with near universal name recognition high favorability ratings among Democrats, the former VP doesn't need to introduce himself to voters like nearly every other candidate. And as the leader in early polls, he can attract media attention without splashy events. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Oh, but how long, Greg, can you do that? Does a lack of campaigning eventually catch up to you if you don't look like you are really hungry for it?",

Now you can add the fourth horseman which is social media. And that's arguably the most powerful of the four. So now you have four groups that are coming after you, and social media will do it in different ways by playing up positive stuff for the Democrats on their platforms, and playing down positive stuff for Trump on their platforms and you won't even know it. So that's going to be a new hurdle. The other new thing is about -- you have is you have a president who's now a heavyweight contender defending his belt. That's what Trump is. He's Ali defending his belt which means he's going to be trash talking all the way to the end. I just addressed four topics for you.",

Over the weekend, political science professor Ian Bremmer tweeted this quote attributed to President Trump, quote, Kim Jong-un is smarter and would make a better president than Sleepy Joe Biden. No joke. You could almost hear Trump saying that which is the problem. A bunch of hysterical anti-Trumpers believed it clogging twitter with breathless outrage for a day. Later Bremmer said it was a joke and he took it down. He apologized, problem solved. But here are a few lessons to turn this tiny, tiny story into a segment. If a parody doesn't offer a clue that it's a joke then it's not a parody, it's just misleading. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Unlike most media which misleads on purpose by parodying actual journalism, and it's on Memorial Day weekend which notes the sacrifices of those who died for our country. One way to commemorate that is to make sure in the future that your country's blood is always treated as precious. So we must be doing somewhat better if our military foot print seems to be shrinking, and that many of the wars among adults are now over tweets. Two years ago we worried about real missiles coming from Kim, now it's about fake tweets heading toward him, that's progress for now anyway. He apologized promptly. I think the problem was it was plausible as he said.",

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” The road to 2020 looking like a good one for the president, three new projection models predict Trump will win re-election, that's according to a former Obama administration official, Steven Ratner saying the combination of a strong economy and being the incumbent currently point to a win for Trump. And as the race to the White House continues to heat up, the president not letting up on his attacks on Joe Biden. While overseas, Trump ripping the former vice president for his role in the 1994 crime bill, critics say that legislation led to the mass incarceration for African-American, quote, anyone associated with the 1994 crime bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African-Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for criminal justice reform which has tremendous support and help fix the bad 1994 bill. But the road to 2020 could prove difficult for Biden. The Washington Post calling out his campaign strategy which is apparently not doing a lot of campaigning. Quote, the light public schedule reflects the unique position of his campaign. Advisors say with near universal name recognition high favorability ratings among Democrats, the former VP doesn't need to introduce himself to voters like nearly every other candidate. And as the leader in early polls, he can attract media attention without splashy events. Oh, but how long, Greg, can you do that? Does a lack of campaigning eventually catch up to you if you don't look like you are really hungry for it?"

This is all hands on deck approach, like telling people that Trump is gonna win, Trump is gonna win, so you better not be complacent because that's what happened with Hillary. So they don't want people to get complacent, so they're not going to play down the Democrats positive polls and play up any Republican or Trump poll to do that. I could talk about the crime bill, but I -- it's -- you can't throw the baby out with the bath water. There's some good stuff in that crime bill and Biden did a good job on it. Trump is coming lately to that stuff and saying that he's, you know, for criminal reform which he has -- but -- this is a new time for Republicans because it used to be -- there're now four housemen after them. It used to be media, academia and entertainment industry. Those were the three groups that were coming after Republicans all the time. They would paint you -- they would say that if you didn't vote Democrat you weren't cool. That was four decades. You were a dork if you weren't a Democrat. Now you can add the fourth horseman which is social media. And that's arguably the most powerful of the four. So now you have four groups that are coming after you, and social media will do it in different ways by playing up positive stuff for the Democrats on their platforms, and playing down positive stuff for Trump on their platforms and you won't even know it. So that's going to be a new hurdle. The other new thing is about -- you have is you have a president who's now a heavyweight contender defending his belt. That's what Trump is. He's Ali defending his belt which means he's going to be trash talking all the way to the end. I just addressed four topics for you."

I think it's strange because to go with Greg's analogy if this is Muhamad Ali defending the belt, he just dropped his hands because everybody is gonna say, ah, Mr. President, what about you and the Central Park 5, people that you wanted executed who were later exonerated. That's how vicious and angry you were in terms of crime. And Greg picks up another good point which is, hey, wait a second, I thought lots of conservatives, in fact, liked the crime bill, and thought that, in fact, putting more people -- and I will say, you know what? It's not fair to Greg. It's not just conservatives. There're a lot of people in the black community, the majority of the black caucus in Congress --"

Then when he's all dizzy because he's not used to handling it that way, he'll come from the hard-right on immigration or hard-right on taxes. It's an unorthodox fighting style that a non- traditional candidate isn't used to defending against. And I don't think Biden has the political dexterity to handle those types of attacks. He's old, he's rusty, and he's so traditional. He'll be overwhelmed."

I'm not trying to play games of the kind of - - I was -- Ratner was accused of. I think Ratner is based on this on a economic model.

Over the weekend, political science professor Ian Bremmer tweeted this quote attributed to President Trump, quote, Kim Jong-un is smarter and would make a better president than Sleepy Joe Biden. No joke. You could almost hear Trump saying that which is the problem. A bunch of hysterical anti-Trumpers believed it clogging twitter with breathless outrage for a day. Later Bremmer said it was a joke and he took it down. He apologized, problem solved. But here are a few lessons to turn this tiny, tiny story into a segment. If a parody doesn't offer a clue that it's a joke then it's not a parody, it's just misleading. Unlike most media which misleads on purpose by parodying actual journalism, and it's on Memorial Day weekend which notes the sacrifices of those who died for our country. One way to commemorate that is to make sure in the future that your country's blood is always treated as precious. So we must be doing somewhat better if our military foot print seems to be shrinking, and that many of the wars among adults are now over tweets. Two years ago we worried about real missiles coming from Kim, now it's about fake tweets heading toward him, that's progress for now anyway. He apologized promptly.

He can't have any human food. But we all worked - we worked it out. He had a little vacation. There's Peter with him at the beach. It was a lot of fun."
