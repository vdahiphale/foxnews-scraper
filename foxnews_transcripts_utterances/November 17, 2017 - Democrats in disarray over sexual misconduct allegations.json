      "utterance": "The funny thing is neither party is immune to this, and that is the important thing. Everybody is trying to figure out what the model is for how you respond to these things. I would put out that when Mitch McConnell became majority leader his staff put together a guide book on how they respond to individual members' crises, and he dealt with a number of them. You remember John Ensign in 2009 went through his extramarital affair and later resigned. Every scandal that came out, the McConnell operation knew how to respond. This is different. These harassment scandals are a very different breed of problem, and both parties are trying to figure out how to cope it. And clearly they haven't come up, either party hasn't come up with a good model yet, and that's what we're seeing everybody sort through right now."

Chelsea Handler, a known Democratic supporter, and Juanita Broaddrick, Chelsea Handler, \"Imagine being molested by an older man, then that man denies ever doing it, then goes on, gets elected to the United States Senate. What kind of message does that send to young girls everywhere and to all the men who abuse women?\" obviously she is there referring to Senator Moore and the allegations. Juanita Broaddrick tweets back, \"Yes, Chelsea Handler, I can imagine. I was raped by the Arkansas attorney general who then becomes governor and president, and NBC held my interview explaining the rape until after his impeachment hearing. But I'm sure you don't want to go there.\" Chelsea Handler, \"I am sorry I'm just seeing this. You are right and I apologize to you for not knowing your story. Democrats along with Republicans and the rest of the world's political parties all need to do better and respect the firsthand accounts of victims. I believe you.\""

      "utterance": "Remember, that was an issue during the campaign. There was a lot of discussion about Juanita Broaddrick and the accusations, incredible accusations that she has leveled back then and repeated during the campaign, and she wasn't believed at the time. People were believing accusers based on party affiliations rather than the substance or credibility of the allegations. This is the ultimate Washington hypocrisy story. Everybody on every side pointing fingers in every different direction, people choosing teams because of political parties. You saw what Al Franken had said about President Trump. You now have seen what President Trump has done to respond. President Trump has been accused I think credibly by a number of women on his own and who admitted on tape to doing some of the things, or at least being aggressive. This is why people don't like Washington. This is what this is. It's just finger pointing in every direction at everybody based on partisanship."
