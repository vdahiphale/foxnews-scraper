There was one line that really struck me. I think I forget who said it but he said don't consider this the end of an era, consider this the invitation to fill the void left by this great man. And all of the leaders today, I believe were really touched by this. It was an incredibly special moment for the country. And his legacy, in fact, played out there among the congregation because this is a moment where Democrats, Republicans came together and listened. They put all of their egos aside and they reflected and honored a man who put the country above himself and put the country above party. And laughing and listening and reflecting on all those beautiful moments was almost a healing moment for the nation. And I just hope that we can all come away from this. Sadly, death brings us together but we can all come away from this with just a more intense desire to unite as a nation, because George H.W. Bush truly was a uniter, especially post-presidency.",

And I think that the crux of -- when George Bush was doing his eulogy up there about the fact that it was just kind of rolling with laughter and it was -- the importance of teasing, he brought up that his father teased a lot. And he brought up the concept of self-deprecation which I've always said is the most important thing on a TV show. As if you're with people who cannot make fun -- who cannot even make fun of themselves, you will not have fun with them. People have to be able to laugh at each other and laugh at you, and you have to share in that.

We're living in a time essentially among the younger generations of saying that's not funny, OK? That's not funny.

So everybody was taking about it. It was like the kind of thing where everybody can relate, people who don't like to eat their vegetables. People who do think it's good. In fact, Barbara Bush said we're having -- not only are we having broccoli for dinner. We're having broccoli soup. So she was a broccoli fan. He was not.

Although, he had so many other strengths. You know I watch this today the entire thing and laughed and cried, and so many beautiful, touching moments and anecdotes. There was one line that really struck me. I think I forget who said it but he said don't consider this the end of an era, consider this the invitation to fill the void left by this great man. And all of the leaders today, I believe were really touched by this. It was an incredibly special moment for the country. And his legacy, in fact, played out there among the congregation because this is a moment where Democrats, Republicans came together and listened. They put all of their egos aside and they reflected and honored a man who put the country above himself and put the country above party. And laughing and listening and reflecting on all those beautiful moments was almost a healing moment for the nation. And I just hope that we can all come away from this. Sadly, death brings us together but we can all come away from this with just a more intense desire to unite as a nation, because George H.W. Bush truly was a uniter, especially post-presidency."

      "utterance": "You're like a TV psychic because that's exactly my point. I mean, we keep talking -- we talk a lot about the military but not about mirth. And we talk about heroism but not about humor. And I think that the crux of -- when George Bush was doing his eulogy up there about the fact that it was just kind of rolling with laughter and it was -- the importance of teasing, he brought up that his father teased a lot. And he brought up the concept of self-deprecation which I've always said is the most important thing on a TV show. As if you're with people who cannot make fun -- who cannot even make fun of themselves, you will not have fun with them. People have to be able to laugh at each other and laugh at you, and you have to share in that. It's the necessary lubrication for daily life. And I know that people talk about, you know, we have this loss of civility. I'm more concerned about the loss of humor, because humor is the precursor to civility. It's a unifying quality that brings everybody who disagrees together, they can come together over a joke. We're living in a time essentially among the younger generations of saying that's not funny, OK? That's not funny. It is happening all over the place, and I think today was an important reminder the vitality of laughter and that humorlessness only leads to division, but humor can bring unification."

It was kind of known that he didn't like broccoli. But when he banned it, it resulted in a story and the story became a sensation. This was prior to, as you point out, Dana, social media. So everybody was taking about it. It was like the kind of thing where everybody can relate, people who don't like to eat their vegetables. People who do think it's good. In fact, Barbara Bush said we're having -- not only are we having broccoli for dinner. We're having broccoli soup. So she was a broccoli fan. He was not. And I think it really spoke to people about a sense of knowing him. And I think that's so important that -- I've mentioned and I think you mentioned, Dana, he was a terrific note writer, terrific friend to so many people. Alan Simpson said today, you know, at a moment when he was down on his popularity ratings, the president called him and said come on out to Camp David. He's that kind of guy. And to me, watching along with my colleagues here today, you know what stood out was father and son. We saw two presidents, both, father and son, celebrating a relationship. And certainly in the words of the son, but I think it was the father who made this possible because I don't think George W. Bush, the president you serve, was an easy child from all I can hear."

And then talking at the end in what to me was the highlight of the whole day, saying, you know, I can see him holding my mom's hand, holding Robin, the lost daughter's hand. To me, this was so emotional, so powerful, and so full of love. And I think at times, you know, Greg's talking about loss of mirth, I think sometimes it's very difficult especially for someone who's been President of the United States, a public figure, to show depth of love and affection for another human being. And it's not -- we're not talking about, you know, the kind of love that is male-female. We're talking about human affection from the heart, and that's what we saw today."

I will let you talk about whatever you want, but I thought I would set it up with this, there's that moment when George W. Bush comes in and he shakes the hand of President Trump, the first lady, and he sneaks something to Michelle Obama, of course we later learned they've got this little thing going back-and-forth with a little piece of candy or cough drop that he had -- he pulls it out of his pocket on the way there and hands it to her, and she gets a little bit of a laugh.

And watching what we're looking at right now, the first pew. And that moment, Dana, when George W. shook the hands of the president, leaned in to shake the hand of the first lady, and then leaned forward again to former President Barack Obama. And he realized he needed to walk around and shake all the hands of the living presidents and first ladies. And maybe that was one of the few unscripted moments there because he kind of leaned over and had to change course. But, otherwise, Dana, an incredible display of our American military. You got to see it firsthand. It was chilling. As an American, I almost wished that schools were closed and schoolkids could have watched every minute of this because it is something I will remember forever. The military, you know, the procession to the national cathedral, it was just -- every single minute was planned, scripted, rehearsed. You have to think that this was in the works for decades, Dana. And by the way, credit to the army's military district of Washington. They were responsible for planning and playing out what was a 20 page script for this funeral. All the way down to the anthems and hymns, right down to the number of ruffles and flourishes. That, of course, preceded the hail to the chief, 16 of them played today, 21 gun salute, three of them rang out, and then the funeral bell, you heard it ringing time after time when the coffin reached the steps of the cathedral. Well, it rang 41 times naturally. And just the incredible military display. It just makes you so proud as an American to watch this today. It was really something."

You know, Juan, what's interesting to me with this whole thing is that -- think about how it started. So Hillary loses and the Democrats needs to blame someone besides Hillary so they blame Russia and slap sanctions on the Russian so the Trump transition team says, hey, Flynn, called the Russian ambassador and tell him, you know, de-escalate the sanction situation. Don't hit us back with sanctions. He gets on the phone, calls Kislyak, the ambassador, and obviously this thing is recorded by the national security apparatus, and then he gets unmasked and this thing leaked, the conversation, to the Washington Post.

And the suggestion coming forth, unknown, so I'm just speculating here, is that the lie was directed from the very top of the administration. But we don't know that. We don't know why he lied. And what we do know is that for 19-plus meetings, hours exponentially beyond those 19 meetings, he's talking about not only the campaign but the transition. He was only in office for a very short time. So he's talking about what happened during the campaign and, of course, the Kislyak discussion. Suggesting that he knows a lot and is pointing not only at President Trump, it's pointing at his son-in-law, potentially pointing at his son, and we know that right now Roger Stone has taken the fifth. I remember when Donald Trump said anybody that takes the fifth is disreputable. It's terrible, he said. Oh-oh, now Roger Stone is taking the fifth."

I think the main thing he did wrong was lying to Pence about the conversation. And I think the only reason he did that was because of all this collusion story was swirling around and he didn't want to make it look like he was colluding with the Russians, when in fact he was just told to call the guy up and be a diplomat."

And the reason why you say -- you keep saying the words we don't know, we don't know, it's because the Mueller team, Robert Mueller is not telling us anything. So, I think there are some takeaways.

And then, what's the consulting contract for? I'm not willing to go there. I don't know. I actually thought that they might be pleased that Michael Flynn was not being recommended for any jail time. I mean, the president and Rudy Giuliani both said he doesn't deserve jail time. And so, I think that if he doesn't get jail time that's actually, probably, good for Michael Flynn and they can feel good about that.

So, Flynn, essentially, is the frog in that boiling pot and he's been found guilty of trying to get out of the pot. So, personally, my lesson is I would never accept a role in government because if you win the other side will initiate an investigation. And I will undoubtedly be called in, and I will be asked 100 to 200 questions. And I can tell you the odds are strong that I'm going to lie on 7 to 12 of them. Some of them might be about personal behavior, who knows. Something I did -- I'm a little -- I'm embarrassed about. So, at the end of this road you have a pile of human beings whose careers are destroyed because they entered the political sphere, and the losers get back at them by destroying them. There's no way around it. Human beings in these situations panic. They might tell a fib. I'll be that guy. So I will never --"

It will pass in front of an honor guard here and be put into a hearse for that caravan from here to the church, St. Martin's Episcopal, where people will be able to pay their respects to the president later tonight through early tomorrow morning.

Remember, there was a four-and-a-half-hour wait outside. And 43 said, ‘No, let the public come in. We want to be surrounded by them.’ And then they go around shaking hands with everyone.

That would be great.\" And he did not want to wear a jacket. He's casual up there in Kennebunkport. So he gave me a hard time for about two hours. He kept asking me, ‘Do I have to wear a jacket?’ I said, ‘It would be nice if you wore a jacket. It's just for 45 minutes.’ He said, ‘I know the jacket I'm going to wear.’ And he went into his bedroom, and he comes back out into the living room.

I did want to thank Bill Hemmer, who stayed around an extra hour to sit with me for \"The Daily Briefing\" show and helped me through that, because I didn't have time to prepare. I didn't know anything that was going on in the news; and I really leaned on him and appreciated that. So Sandra, thanks for letting me have him for the afternoon. And now we'll go to Juan."

In fact, they threw a record 34,000 bears onto the ice. Tossing teddy bears at a hockey game is a tradition starting in '93. The charity drive now a staple for several minor league teams. The stuffed bears will be Christmas gifts for children's through schools, food banks, the Children's Miracle Network and the American Cancer Society. Way to go to the Hershey Bears."

It's really interesting for me to watch this decision that he had early on in his life to go to Texas, to leave New England and all the comforts and, basically, the privilege that he had been born into. And he said, ‘No, let me go and try to make it on my own.’ And then he decided to make Houston his home. And if anyone is wondering about, can you make it somewhere else? Can you move on and find upward mobility and find a home in a community in another place, there are places around America where you can still do that. Houston might be one of them. But it really is amazing that he's going back there to such a hero's welcome."

And you know, he was at the right place in the right time and definitely did well for himself. And his son, W., tried to do the same thing. Not as successful, but successful in his own right there. And politics were in both of their blood; and they both went on to become presidents."
