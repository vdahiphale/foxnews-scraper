Remember that New Jersey school district that yanked all holiday names off the calendar just to avoid hurt feelings? Well, they just reversed course.

I was talking to a guy the other day, he was at one of the Randolph meetings. He said, never go to school board meeting in my life, and now they've gone to several of them and you see American parents all across the country saying, wait, what's going on in my school district and showing up at school board meetings, which is actually, I think very healthy. You want people to be more energized, engaged, and possibly you'll see somebody, you know, like Ian Prior. I'm not speaking for him. I don't know. But you could imagine that because he is awoke in this movement in Lowden County, Virginia, perhaps he'll run for school board. You always like ask yourself, like, well, would you want to run? Would you want to run? And actually getting into the arena is one of the important things.

I think the indoctrination is present in our culture, our entertainment industry, academia, and also, our corporations. Have you seen a typical H.R. e-mail lately? We won't mention it but the language is directly lifted from academic identity politics' lexicon. It is everywhere you look. I don't think I have seen anything spread so fast in my life and it preys upon these two -- the two flaws of human nature. One of them is fear. People are terrified of being ostracized, or losing their jobs or both, which is why you see students parroting this woke babble from their teachers and you see corporate execs embracing the diversity platitudes, and why entertainers are so desperately waving the BLM flag. It's because they would rather you not look in their past for any sexual indiscretions. That's fear. But the other thing is that fear causes people to blend in, right? This is why human beings imitate each other's behavior. They don't want to stand out. That was the whole -- that was a method for survival. So, if you don't want the woke after you, then you parrot the woke, right? Its memetic camouflage. So that's why I believe that this stuff is spreading, and I don't know how to stop it because fear and just wanting to belong is letting it happen and it's happening all around us. That's why these things are into -- I'm glad they are there at the school board and maybe that's where the fight has to happen because it's visual and people will be persuaded by it. But I think about like, are we going to have a fight with our corporate H.R.? No. Are people going to fight at the principals at their schools -- well, I guess they are -- the colleges? Are they going to go after -- I don't know.",

So if you start, you know, even the grade school level, the high school level. But to Dana's point, most Americans are go along get along kind of folks who really try to avoid controversy. They work their asses off. They are dealing with their families and their friends and church, and maybe they want to go fishing once every few months. They really don't have time for this nonsense. But all it takes is one small group of trifling sanctimonious jerks to set them off. And I call it the reverse domino theory. So instead of falling down one by one, you have one -- it just takes one person to stand up, one outraged parent (ph), one -- or citizen speaking up and then 10 more will stand up because they feel supported and they get loud, and that's how change happens. And this is not -- they are trying to paint it like these are conservative parents and conservative individuals. No way. You start to look at who's a lot of these people are. They are across the spectrum of races and socioeconomic groups, but they see their children being indoctrinating into hate.",

Now it's just every day, like CNN will say there were eight mass shootings this week and you go, wow, I didn't hear of any of them. And then you look at them, it's like, oh, you know, that's gang stuff. The problem with this stuff when they keep saying gun violence, and this is where their whole theory falls apart. The guns existed before and after this dramatic spike. So, it's not just gun violence. It's actually the perpetrators, a rise in perpetrators. A rise in violence. The gun is simply a tool. And when you explain these statistics plainly to the media, their response is after you saw what, I think with Stelter, Brian Stelter a few days ago, rather than acknowledge the spike in crime, the issue becomes are you blowing the spike in crime out of proportion? So whenever the media is found to be wrong on something, rather than admit it, they look at you and you go, but you're pouncing on it. You're blowing this out of proportion. Yes, yes, yes. I mean, there was crime -- there's crime, but you're blowing it out of proportion because the media cannot report on crime because it illustrates the failure of the far left policies that they have been pushing for decades and recently embraced in the last few years through the BLM movement.

So, I think one of the reason they're having this event tomorrow is they know that they've got an issue so they're trying to shore themselves up politically. But if you remember, it was -- President Biden, when he was senator and the Clintons before him, their support of the 1994 Crime Bill was what the progressive left was hanging on their necks as an albatross. It was going to make it very hard for them to be able to get the votes of the left wing of the party.

And I think we have to acknowledge that America is country that has poor supporters. So, if you have bad gun laws, say for example, in a bordering state, you can go over there, you can buy a gun and you can drive it across the border, right? And many of the guns that we see and many of the mass shootings that we see happening in this country sometimes happen because of illegal guns. In the city of Chicago, right, this past weekend was one of the most horrific weekends there and most of those crimes were committed because of illegal guns. Not purchased in the city of Chicago because you can't purchase a gun in the city of Chicago. They are purchased in Indiana and in other parts of the country that have terrible gun laws. So what Joe Biden is going to do tomorrow is say, hey, look, we've got to do something. Thoughts and prayers around the fact that we have a surge in gun violence in this country is not enough. Since the beginning of the year, we've had 283 mass shootings in this country. That's a 40 percent increase since last year and a 65 percent increase since 2019.

Black Americans got slaughtered in the streets and then you deny there was a crime wave. Now all of a sudden they are waking up to the fact that there is a crime wave and they're heaping praise on Joe Biden for tackling the crime wave they help to create. The \"Washington Post,\" because you know I read these briefing materials for these segments very carefully, they actually did a whole story on this. They quoted an aid to Michael Dukakis. Michael Dukakis said there is nothing the federal government can do about crime because it's a local issue. It's the same Michael Dukakis that got rocked by 41 by being soft on crime. Then they quoted three anti-police activists in the article. No balance at all, and it leads the reader to believe it's the fault of the Republicans for the rise in crime because blah, blah, blah, NRA. They didn't spend one minute interviewing a black crime victim. They didn't interview any family members who had their family members shot. They didn't interview anybody scared that's living in the inner-city that is afraid to go to school. All they care about is the political effects on the Democrats and if it's risky or if it's safe for the Democrats. No, no, no. This is about life and death in the inner-city and the media doesn't care about it.",

Think about the contradiction between that message and the message of diversity which is positive. Hey, black people, you can be an astronaut, you can be an engineer, you can be a rocket scientist, but you can't get an ID, because that's beyond your abilities.

I was talking to a guy the other day, he was at one of the Randolph meetings. He said, never go to school board meeting in my life, and now they've gone to several of them and you see American parents all across the country saying, wait, what's going on in my school district and showing up at school board meetings, which is actually, I think very healthy. You want people to be more energized, engaged, and possibly you'll see somebody, you know, like Ian Prior. I'm not speaking for him. I don't know. But you could imagine that because he is awoke in this movement in Lowden County, Virginia, perhaps he'll run for school board. You always like ask yourself, like, well, would you want to run?

I think the indoctrination is present in our culture, our entertainment industry, academia, and also, our corporations. Have you seen a typical H.R. e-mail lately? We won't mention it but the language is directly lifted from academic identity politics' lexicon. It is everywhere you look. I don't think I have seen anything spread so fast in my life and it preys upon these two -- the two flaws of human nature. One of them is fear. People are terrified of being ostracized, or losing their jobs or both, which is why you see students parroting this woke babble from their teachers and you see corporate execs embracing the diversity platitudes, and why entertainers are so desperately waving the BLM flag. It's because they would rather you not look in their past for any sexual indiscretions. That's fear. But the other thing is that fear causes people to blend in, right? This is why human beings imitate each other's behavior. They don't want to stand out. That was the whole -- that was a method for survival. So, if you don't want the woke after you, then you parrot the woke, right? Its memetic camouflage. So that's why I believe that this stuff is spreading, and I don't know how to stop it because fear and just wanting to belong is letting it happen and it's happening all around us. That's why these things are into -- I'm glad they are there at the school board and maybe that's where the fight has to happen because it's visual and people will be persuaded by it. But I think about like, are we going to have a fight with our corporate H.R.? No. Are people going to fight at the principals at their schools -- well, I guess they are -- the colleges? Are they going to go after -- I don't know."

So if you start, you know, even the grade school level, the high school level. But to Dana's point, most Americans are go along get along kind of folks who really try to avoid controversy. They work their asses off. They are dealing with their families and their friends and church, and maybe they want to go fishing once every few months. They really don't have time for this nonsense. But all it takes is one small group of trifling sanctimonious jerks to set them off. And I call it the reverse domino theory. So instead of falling down one by one, you have one -- it just takes one person to stand up, one outraged parent (ph), one -- or citizen speaking up and then 10 more will stand up because they feel supported and they get loud, and that's how change happens. And this is not -- they are trying to paint it like these are conservative parents and conservative individuals. No way. You start to look at who's a lot of these people are. They are across the spectrum of races and socioeconomic groups, but they see their children being indoctrinating into hate."

It's interesting watching how the media and the democrats change the language so that it absolves the criminals. So what they are doing now is they're including gang shootings and routine gun crime that's been around as mass shootings, which mass shootings were always about these planned rampages, right? Now it's just every day, like CNN will say there were eight mass shootings this week and you go, wow, I didn't hear of any of them. And then you look at them, it's like, oh, you know, that's gang stuff. The problem with this stuff when they keep saying gun violence, and this is where their whole theory falls apart. The guns existed before and after this dramatic spike. So, it's not just gun violence. It's actually the perpetrators, a rise in perpetrators. A rise in violence. The gun is simply a tool. And when you explain these statistics plainly to the media, their response is after you saw what, I think with Stelter, Brian Stelter a few days ago, rather than acknowledge the spike in crime, the issue becomes are you blowing the spike in crime out of proportion? So whenever the media is found to be wrong on something, rather than admit it, they look at you and you go, but you're pouncing on it. You're blowing this out of proportion. Yes, yes, yes. I mean, there was crime -- there's crime, but you're blowing it out of proportion because the media cannot report on crime because it illustrates the failure of the far left policies that they have been pushing for decades and recently embraced in the last few years through the BLM movement. All of this stuff is falling apart before their eyes. And they'd rather see a country suffer than admit they were wrong and back the right course."

We talked yesterday about the polling numbers showing that crime and the issue of immigration are the two issues that are weighing down his approval ratings even though he is still up 52 percent where he had been at 57 or 58 percent. So, I think one of the reason they're having this event tomorrow is they know that they've got an issue so they're trying to shore themselves up politically. But if you remember, it was -- President Biden, when he was senator and the Clintons before him, their support of the 1994 Crime Bill was what the progressive left was hanging on their necks as an albatross. It was going to make it very hard for them to be able to get the votes of the left wing of the party. And so now, if they go forward tomorrow and they say, well now we're going to get tough on crime, I don't think he's going to say that. He would be, you know, called a traitor by the left and no one on the right would take him seriously."

So, how can you marry the two?

Number one, as a licensed gun owner myself, I don't think this is about taking the guns out of the hands of people like myself, but I think it's making sure that most of the crimes that we see happening that are gun crimes are because of folks have illegal guns. And I think we have to acknowledge that America is country that has poor supporters. So, if you have bad gun laws, say for example, in a bordering state, you can go over there, you can buy a gun and you can drive it across the border, right? And many of the guns that we see and many of the mass shootings that we see happening in this country sometimes happen because of illegal guns. In the city of Chicago, right, this past weekend was one of the most horrific weekends there and most of those crimes were committed because of illegal guns. Not purchased in the city of Chicago because you can't purchase a gun in the city of Chicago. They are purchased in Indiana and in other parts of the country that have terrible gun laws. So what Joe Biden is going to do tomorrow is say, hey, look, we've got to do something. Thoughts and prayers around the fact that we have a surge in gun violence in this country is not enough. Since the beginning of the year, we've had 283 mass shootings in this country. That's a 40 percent increase since last year and a 65 percent increase since 2019.

Now all of a sudden they are waking up to the fact that there is a crime wave and they're heaping praise on Joe Biden for tackling the crime wave they help to create. The \"Washington Post,\" because you know I read these briefing materials for these segments very carefully, they actually did a whole story on this. They quoted an aid to Michael Dukakis. Michael Dukakis said there is nothing the federal government can do about crime because it's a local issue. It's the same Michael Dukakis that got rocked by 41 by being soft on crime. Then they quoted three anti-police activists in the article. No balance at all, and it leads the reader to believe it's the fault of the Republicans for the rise in crime because blah, blah, blah, NRA. They didn't spend one minute interviewing a black crime victim. They didn't interview any family members who had their family members shot. They didn't interview anybody scared that's living in the inner-city that is afraid to go to school.

Years from now, people are going to look back at this era, especially what Chuck Schumer did in the Democratic Party as the real racist, the white liberal supremacist for assuming that blacks can't get an ID. Think about the contradiction between that message and the message of diversity which is positive. Hey, black people, you can be an astronaut, you can be an engineer, you can be a rocket scientist, but you can't get an ID, because that's beyond your abilities.

So, now he's selling these things are trying to for half a million dollars. I'd say that -- of that price, 90 percent is bribery, maybe 10 percent is for the paint, but nobody now is going to buy this dreck because they're going to have their background looked into.

Greg's humans are bad people. Think about this. You're a squirrel and you see some bird feeder and you're hungry and you keep trying to get up there but you just can't do it. But you keep trying because you know it's there. And just gravity says if you climb up, you could do it. Not if the person who owns it has coated the pole with Vaseline. She wanted to stop the squirrel from stealing food out of her bird feeder so she smeared Vaseline on the bird feeder pole making her a bad person. I almost sound like you, Dana."
