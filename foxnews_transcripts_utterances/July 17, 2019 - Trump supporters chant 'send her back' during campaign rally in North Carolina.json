Now we will bring you all the highlights and what it all means in a moment with Dan Bongino and Chris Hahn, Candace Owens and more. Plus, my “Angle” tonight continues our narrative revealing a Democrat and media establishment now in complete panic and meltdown mode after Trump has turned has turned the last 48/72 hours or so into a political reckoning.

And obviously and importantly Omar has a history of launching vicious Anti- Semitic squads. Representative Rashida Tlaib agreed with Omar's characterization of 9/11 and said that members of Congress who support Israel forgot what country they represent. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that illegal immigrants are more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be. Can you believe that? That's what she's saying.

So the media needs to spare us the outreach. One if my last thing is when I get it some of the tweets could be worded differently and some of the language probably if you go back, he would take it back. I get that.

Rasmussen has him today at 50 percent in the daily tracking poll, up four points since the controversy began. The president reacted this way. \"New poll, the Rasmussen, one of the most accurate in predicting the 2016 election, has just announced that Trump numbers have recently gone up by four points, 50 percent. Thank you to the vicious young Socialist Congresswomen. America will never buy your act.\" The president is correct. People are smart enough to know that the AOC plus three agenda is dangerous. If a Democrat should, God forbid, win the presidency, these people will have an outsized influence on their policies. The economy will tank. Discontent and misery will follow.

Where was, again, the media outcry there? It was minimal at best. The Democrats couldn't even get together a resolution where they put her name in it condemning Ilhan Omar.

And so the fact that it all relied on the testimony of this person who is now a convicted perjurer should have told everybody that Cohen was not the person to place all your eggs on. Secondly, the idea that this was a campaign finance violation was such a stretch, such a reach, it really was not true to the law that was at stake here. And so I thought back at the time that was happening this was going to collapse. It ultimately did. But as you said, the media doesn't care anymore. They are trying to move on to impeachment or to these fights with these congresswomen, because this was in the end a legal loser, and a lot of people at the time should have gotten up and said that they could tell it wasn't going to work."

      "utterance": "And Sol, I think the media do try to shape public opinion the way they predict what development will ultimately bring down the president. This has happened time and again really since 2015 when he got into the race. But when you have Lanny Davis out there today and he says why is Michael Cohen the only guy to go to jail, and he admitted his crimes, that amounts to zip in the end, doesn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "That's true, because you always have to look at the credibility of your witnesses. That particular thing that Lanny said amounts to zip, and that's been a big problem that took us a while to realize. It's relevant to the whole question of the obstruction portion of Mueller's probe as well when you talk about how strong the evidence is of alleged obstruction. Anything that relies on a Michael Cohen is very weak. Any prosecutor looking at a case about whether or not you want to prosecute has to look at the credibility of your chief witness. And whatever little shred of credibility he had left was destroyed with his House testimony, with Lanny Davis sitting behind him and doing nothing to try to salvage the situation."

But Nancy Pelosi is in a trick box here because she has to kind of mollify those folks on the left of her party who really want blood. And they think his comments and the tweet, that amounts to an impeachable offense. But what is impeachment reserved for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "I think, Laura, you're right, it's a political loser. But there's a more important constitutional lesson behind impeachment. If Democrats, if critics of the president really believed all the rhetoric that they are flinging his way, that he's unfit for office, that he's committed crimes, that he's committed obstruction, then the Constitution's primary tool to actually constrain a president who would really be guilty of those things is impeachment. So if a majority of the House of Representatives -- the majority of Democrats are voting against impeachment, than they should stop with the rhetoric accusing the president of committing these alleged crimes, because they themselves won't use the tool that the Constitution gives them to correct any of those abuses of power."

Nothing happens with criminal contempt unless the attorney general authorizes the Justice Department to prosecute. And that's another thing I don't understand. They could -- Congress could have held them in civil contempt, gone into district court and tried to get a declaratory judgment. But I guess that wouldn't have been as exciting, or they were afraid maybe that they were going to lose. Instead they've done something that's entirely symbolic, will have no effect whatsoever. They just think it will, I guess, be effective politically. But actually if they had taken it into court, if they had taken a lot of these things to court, if they had taken Don McGahn to court much earlier, if they had subpoenaed him on day one --"

And in fact, 19 of the 22 defendants entered the U.S. illegally within the past three to four years. The good news is one real-life action hero is taking on the outlaws exploiting our porous border. Mark Lamb is the sheriff of Pinal County, Arizona, just north of the Mexican border, and he's taking on the drug traffickers, including the infamous El Chapo's former cartel. And on patrol he rocks in AR-15, and did I mention his ringtone is the \"G.I. Joe\" theme song? Here now, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. All right, sheriff, what does it take --"

That's crazy. In this heat, they are still pumping them through. And that's the cartel. They are abusing people, they are bringing drugs into our community, affecting our children.

I've challenged congressmen and women and senators to come down, come to the border, come to my county. I will show you around. I will show you so you can decide for yourself. None of them come. A few Republican congressmen have come. Zero of the Democrats have come. So the left wants to keep talking about it, but they're not willing to do anything about it. I'm glad they have enough time to go smoking and joking in the corner and trying to impeach our president when they have so much work to do in Congress.

He said -- well, he said there's a lot of talk about the fact that she married to her brother. I know nothing about it, how the national media has largely ignored this story and mocked the president for even bringing this up, but we will not. Well, the president mentioned something that's a little bit uncomfortable. But I wonder why no curious media ever follows up on immigration fraud, charges, or accusations. No, we'll just take her word for it. But the president never gets that benefit of the doubt. Mike Emanuel, the \"Fox News @ Night\" team, take it all from here.
