Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And we are again reporting tonight from Las Vegas where the motive for the deadliest mass shooting in the history of this country remains a mystery. Now police just provided an update for questions still remain tonight. What caused Stephen Paddock, a multimillionaire with no criminal record to unleash hell on a crowd, killing 58 people and injuring over 500? Now, we will tell you where we are in this investigation, we will examine all the evidence tonight including a new crime scene photo. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, the suspect's girlfriend is back now in the United States and was questioned by authorities. Now police are calling her a person of interest and her lawyer is giving a statement. We will give you all the details. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And also tonight, the president made a very emotional trip right here to Las Vegas to visit with victims, first responders, members of law enforcement and hospital employees -- many of the heroes in this town. In just a few minutes, we will actually meet a husband whose wife of 32 years died in his arms on Sunday at the concert. We will also hear unbelievable stories of heroism. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Plus, the liberal mainstream media, late-night comedians, Democrats, they continue to obnoxiously politicize this tragedy and push their agenda. We will tell you the truth about gun control, facts you will not hear anywhere else on the media landscape anywhere today. And let's see if the left can handle that. All of that and much more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue from Vegas. All right. So, as we report tonight from Las Vegas, law enforcement has still not revealed the possible motive in this horrific mass shooting. And here's all the new information that we know tonight. The Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, he said there is evidence that Stephen Paddock wanted to survive or escape. Now, the sheriff also called Stephen Paddock disturbed and dangerous and authorities add that Paddock spent decades acquiring weapons and ammunition and was living obviously a secret life. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } We are also learning that Paddock had large amounts of an explosive called tannerite in his car. We will get to that in a moment. And authorities are trying to piece together the final weeks of Stephen Paddock's life including by examining his computer and his cell phone records. And according to a report, the gunmen bought 33 of the 47 weapons he owned in the past year alone. Also the Daily Mail has obtained two new crime scene photos. We must warn you tonight, they are very, very graphic. The first shows more guns on the floor inside the shooter's hotel room. Authorities have told us that 12 of these guns were modified to fire like an automatic weapon. There is also questions being raised about this photo. It shows the legs of the shooter and a piece of paper on a side table. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And there is some speculation that it could be a note but police are saying, it is not a suicide note but they did not comment any further tonight. Also the suspects' girlfriend Marilou Danley is back in the United States and has now been interviewed by the FBI. Danley flew back to the U.S. from the Philippines last night. And tonight, her attorney wrote a statement on behalf of his client. Let's listen. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Because we are Americans and the last time I checked, the First Amendment is at least as important as the Second Amendments. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "sentences": "We'll talk about it tonight. And you're free to talk about anything you want. But you might learn facts, we will educate you about the facts that you may not hear in your liberal bubble out here in Hollywood. The left in this country so often feigning moral outrage and using victims to try and to make a point about gun control because their political position is not backed up by facts. Liberals keep asking, \"Well, why can't we have a discussion?\" Let's have the discussion with truth, information, facts and data that the media will never tell you about in this country. Democrats say gun control leads to less violence? Well, if that's the case, then I would like them to explain why cities with the highest murder rates in this country, with the strictest gun control in this country, that have run by Democrats for decades in this country, let's look at the numbers. For example, murder rate in 2016, all these cities have Democratic mayors and have been run by liberals for years. Yet when you look, their crackdowns on the Second Amendment have done nothing to stop the violence. Liberals, they also don't want you to know about these shocking statistics. For example, during the Obama presidency, over 3,900 murders in his adopted hometown of Chicago. We ran the names once on this program while everybody else ignored it. More than 18,000 people in Chicago who were shot only during the last six years of Obama's presidency. I only heard Obama talk about it, what, two, three, four times max, during his presidency? Did you remember hearing people on the left speaking out about this out-of-control violence happening day in and day out in the City of Chicago? I don't remember. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, there's a lot of hypocrisy going on about this issue. And we also have some charts provided to us by John Lott, Jr., he is the President of Crime Prevention Research in that center. He's an expert on the issue. He'll join us in a few minutes tonight. Now, look at this chart about the Chicago murder rate. Now relative to the other nine largest U.S. cities, the yellow vertical line that you see there indicates when they ban handguns. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } And as you can see, after gun control over the years, the murder rate went up. Now the same goes for Washington, D.C., as John Lott's research shows D.C.'s murder rate is relative to the other 48 large U.S. cities excluding Chicago, went up after they ban handguns. We also have examples from foreign countries in case you are interested. Remember after Great Britain, they banned handguns. The homicide rate spike and then slowly began to go down, only slowly. And here is another example from Ireland after that country passed gun control legislation. The murder rate actually increased. And then there's Jamaica, look at how the murder rate also increased after they put gun control in place. There is also this revealing statistic out of France. They have some of the strictest gun control laws on the planet. And France has had more casualties from public shootings in 2015 than during the entire Obama presidency. And finally, the left, they love to say that people -- giving people the right to carry does not prevent crime. But the figures, the truth, the data it shows otherwise. Let's take a look. This chart shows violent crime before and after right to carry laws were enacted in the United States. And as you can see, having more citizens that are armed leads to a decrease in violent crime. Those are the facts. Here's another graphic on murder rates before and after right to carry laws were put into place. Now also, the U.S. murders have plunged as a result. And as John Lott, Jr. points out, as more people in fact carry guns, you can see further drops in both of those statistics. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now this is why this show isn't, will never be like the rest of the mainstream media. We actually care about truth, about facts. The left? They don't believe in your right as the American people to be responsible, that you have the right to defend yourself, your children and your home, in your community. They only seem to believe in big government, not the individual, which is why they try to exploit these tragedies and rush to judgment to push what is a radical, rigid, leftist agenda that infringes on your constitutional rights even though it is not supported by data, not supported by facts. It is beyond shameful. Another question. How many of these celebrities, how many of this late-night comedians, how many of these politicians, oh, when they go out in public, how often do they have armed guards with them or body guards with them? Really? The rest of us, most Americans, they can't afford that. Joining us now with reaction, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, John Lott. And Fox News legal analyst Bob Massi. John, I'll start with you. You provided a lot of this research. How many years have you been investigating more guns and less crime?

Things that make it riskier for criminals to go and commit crimes. But the fact that a victim might be able to go in defend themselves also makes it riskier for criminals to go and commit crimes. I will just give you a simple example. There is something called hot burglary. These are burglaries that occurs while the residents are in the dwelling. In the United States, only about 13 percent of burglaries occur when the residents are there. In a country like England, it's about 60 percent. And there are surveys that are done with burglars who have been from different countries. And American burglars spend about twice as long casing a home before they break in, compared to their British counterparts. And the reason why they gave it, is that they are worried about getting shot. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } If nobody is at home, they don't have to worry about that but if somebody's home and they break in, they have to worry about the person defending themselves.

Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And we are again reporting tonight from Las Vegas where the motive for the deadliest mass shooting in the history of this country remains a mystery. Now police just provided an update for questions still remain tonight. What caused Stephen Paddock, a multimillionaire with no criminal record to unleash hell on a crowd, killing 58 people and injuring over 500? Now, we will tell you where we are in this investigation, we will examine all the evidence tonight including a new crime scene photo. Plus, the suspect's girlfriend is back now in the United States and was questioned by authorities. Now police are calling her a person of interest and her lawyer is giving a statement. We will give you all the details. And also tonight, the president made a very emotional trip right here to Las Vegas to visit with victims, first responders, members of law enforcement and hospital employees -- many of the heroes in this town. In just a few minutes, we will actually meet a husband whose wife of 32 years died in his arms on Sunday at the concert. We will also hear unbelievable stories of heroism. Plus, the liberal mainstream media, late-night comedians, Democrats, they continue to obnoxiously politicize this tragedy and push their agenda. We will tell you the truth about gun control, facts you will not hear anywhere else on the media landscape anywhere today. And let's see if the left can handle that. All of that and much more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue from Vegas. All right. So, as we report tonight from Las Vegas, law enforcement has still not revealed the possible motive in this horrific mass shooting. And here's all the new information that we know tonight. The Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, he said there is evidence that Stephen Paddock wanted to survive or escape. Now, the sheriff also called Stephen Paddock disturbed and dangerous and authorities add that Paddock spent decades acquiring weapons and ammunition and was living obviously a secret life. We are also learning that Paddock had large amounts of an explosive called tannerite in his car. We will get to that in a moment. And authorities are trying to piece together the final weeks of Stephen Paddock's life including by examining his computer and his cell phone records. And according to a report, the gunmen bought 33 of the 47 weapons he owned in the past year alone. Also the Daily Mail has obtained two new crime scene photos. We must warn you tonight, they are very, very graphic. The first shows more guns on the floor inside the shooter's hotel room. Authorities have told us that 12 of these guns were modified to fire like an automatic weapon. There is also questions being raised about this photo. It shows the legs of the shooter and a piece of paper on a side table. And there is some speculation that it could be a note but police are saying, it is not a suicide note but they did not comment any further tonight. Also the suspects' girlfriend Marilou Danley is back in the United States and has now been interviewed by the FBI. Danley flew back to the U.S. from the Philippines last night. And tonight, her attorney wrote a statement on behalf of his client. Let's listen."

Our own Adam Housley will join us later tonight with more details on where the investigation stands. Also, President Trump as I mentioned was in Vegas earlier today, he visited with victims in the hospital from Sunday's horrific attack.

And we grieve the loss of the law enforcement personnel who were killed in this vicious attack. Here on Earth, we are blessed to be surrounded by heroes. As one eyewitness recounted this week, while everyone else was crouching, police officers were standing up as targets, just trying to direct people. And tell them where to go. The officers were standing up in the line of fire, to help those in danger and to find out where those horrible shots were coming from.

Well, maybe it's too soon for you because deep down inside, you know, in your heart, you know you bear some responsibility for the fact that almost anyone can get any weapon they want and now you want to cover yourself until the storm of outrage passes and you can go back to your dirty business as usual. But it's not too soon for us. Because we are Americans and the last time I checked, the First Amendment is at least as important as the Second Amendments."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "We'll talk about it tonight. And you're free to talk about anything you want. But you might learn facts, we will educate you about the facts that you may not hear in your liberal bubble out here in Hollywood. The left in this country so often feigning moral outrage and using victims to try and to make a point about gun control because their political position is not backed up by facts. Liberals keep asking, \"Well, why can't we have a discussion?\" Let's have the discussion with truth, information, facts and data that the media will never tell you about in this country. Democrats say gun control leads to less violence? Well, if that's the case, then I would like them to explain why cities with the highest murder rates in this country, with the strictest gun control in this country, that have run by Democrats for decades in this country, let's look at the numbers. For example, murder rate in 2016, all these cities have Democratic mayors and have been run by liberals for years. Yet when you look, their crackdowns on the Second Amendment have done nothing to stop the violence. Liberals, they also don't want you to know about these shocking statistics. For example, during the Obama presidency, over 3,900 murders in his adopted hometown of Chicago. We ran the names once on this program while everybody else ignored it. More than 18,000 people in Chicago who were shot only during the last six years of Obama's presidency. I only heard Obama talk about it, what, two, three, four times max, during his presidency? Did you remember hearing people on the left speaking out about this out-of-control violence happening day in and day out in the City of Chicago? I don't remember. Now, there's a lot of hypocrisy going on about this issue. And we also have some charts provided to us by John Lott, Jr., he is the President of Crime Prevention Research in that center. He's an expert on the issue. He'll join us in a few minutes tonight. Now, look at this chart about the Chicago murder rate. Now relative to the other nine largest U.S. cities, the yellow vertical line that you see there indicates when they ban handguns. And as you can see, after gun control over the years, the murder rate went up. Now the same goes for Washington, D.C., as John Lott's research shows D.C.'s murder rate is relative to the other 48 large U.S. cities excluding Chicago, went up after they ban handguns. We also have examples from foreign countries in case you are interested. Remember after Great Britain, they banned handguns. The homicide rate spike and then slowly began to go down, only slowly. And here is another example from Ireland after that country passed gun control legislation. The murder rate actually increased. And then there's Jamaica, look at how the murder rate also increased after they put gun control in place. There is also this revealing statistic out of France. They have some of the strictest gun control laws on the planet. And France has had more casualties from public shootings in 2015 than during the entire Obama presidency. And finally, the left, they love to say that people -- giving people the right to carry does not prevent crime. But the figures, the truth, the data it shows otherwise. Let's take a look. This chart shows violent crime before and after right to carry laws were enacted in the United States. And as you can see, having more citizens that are armed leads to a decrease in violent crime. Those are the facts. Here's another graphic on murder rates before and after right to carry laws were put into place. Now also, the U.S. murders have plunged as a result. And as John Lott, Jr. points out, as more people in fact carry guns, you can see further drops in both of those statistics. Now this is why this show isn't, will never be like the rest of the mainstream media. We actually care about truth, about facts. The left? They don't believe in your right as the American people to be responsible, that you have the right to defend yourself, your children and your home, in your community. They only seem to believe in big government, not the individual, which is why they try to exploit these tragedies and rush to judgment to push what is a radical, rigid, leftist agenda that infringes on your constitutional rights even though it is not supported by data, not supported by facts. It is beyond shameful. Another question. How many of these celebrities, how many of this late-night comedians, how many of these politicians, oh, when they go out in public, how often do they have armed guards with them or body guards with them? Really? The rest of us, most Americans, they can't afford that. Joining us now with reaction, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, John Lott. And Fox News legal analyst Bob Massi. John, I'll start with you. You provided a lot of this research. How many years have you been investigating more guns and less crime? And I know you have many variations of your book that has come out."

You say, if there's more guns, if more people have a right to carry, if people have a right to defend themselves, oh, there's going to be less crime. And in a liberals mind, they say that's just impossible, that's illogical. Explain why in fact your data proves that to be true?"

      "utterance": "Well, look, I think people understand you can deter criminals. If you have higher arrests rates, higher conviction rates, longer prison sentences, the death penalty. Things that make it riskier for criminals to go and commit crimes. But the fact that a victim might be able to go in defend themselves also makes it riskier for criminals to go and commit crimes. I will just give you a simple example. There is something called hot burglary. These are burglaries that occurs while the residents are in the dwelling. In the United States, only about 13 percent of burglaries occur when the residents are there. In a country like England, it's about 60 percent. And there are surveys that are done with burglars who have been from different countries. And American burglars spend about twice as long casing a home before they break in, compared to their British counterparts. And the reason why they gave it, is that they are worried about getting shot. If nobody is at home, they don't have to worry about that but if somebody's home and they break in, they have to worry about the person defending themselves. Their British counterparts don't have to worry about that and so they don't care really whether somebody is in the home when they break in."

Look at what these officers, next time there's an incident, are we going to give these guys the benefit of the doubt, the presumption of innocence until they are proven guilty? Look at what they go through every day."

Green tag probably will be fine or possibly they could get worse. I had seconds to do this but what was amazing about this whole thing, the patients were the greatest patients I've ever taken care of.

I lay things out tonight. Most of those people live in big, fat, gated communities. They have security systems that are the envy of the world. They go out in public and they have bodyguards, some armed and some not. Jimmy Kimmel has how many security guards in his studio every night?
