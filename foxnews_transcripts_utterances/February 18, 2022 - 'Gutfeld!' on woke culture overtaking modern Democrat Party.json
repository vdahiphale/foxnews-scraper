      "sentences": "It's almost the weekend. Yes. Almost the weekend. Clap away, my little friends. Happy Friday, everyone. Well, it's been a good week and a bad one. Legendary writer and humorous P.J. O'Rourke passed away. It sucks. But he was kind enough before he went to leave so much behind for all of us. And not just cigar butts and empty whiskey bottles, which sounds like the name of Kat's autobiography. He left us some amazing books like Parliament of Whores, Modern Manners and the one that changed me. Republican Party Reptile which is now Liz Cheney's nickname. He also gave us two of the greatest pieces of satire ever written the National Lampoon 1964 high school yearbook, and the Sunday newspaper parody. O'Rourke was one of the greatest editors of one of the greatest magazines ever, National Lampoon. He may not have written Animal House, but he lived it, he made it happen. And he made me happen too. OK. You can't win them all. But he gave me hope and he gave me a path. A place to go for someone who didn't fit in really anywhere. I bring this up tonight because what we're seeing in today's culture is in part P.J.'s legacy. What he did for the right is make it OK for them to be wrong. In the best sense of the word, to be funny, to be loose, to be high, to be horny. Which sounds like the name of my autobiography. He told us -- he told us it's OK to be alive, which was everything that stereotype of the right was not. We didn't always have to be staid or stiff or judgmental. And you didn't have to cede culture to the left. The left had their Abby Hoffman's and their Merry Pranksters. And O'Rourke said they might be onto something. And then came Andrew Breitbart, our Merry Prankster. So it works thesis was simple. Politics ruins everything, so fight back with fun. When I was younger, I wrote a piece called The Dean Wormer Effect. Based on this fellow from the movie Animal House.",

      "sentences": "So, in every situation the right had a stick up their ass. Meanwhile, the left had a joint in their mouths. My goal was to flip that - - reverse the Dean Wormer effect. And my inspiration was PJ. He made it clear that to find politics, the weapon was always going to be fun. And now it's happening. The big flip. We're having fun. They aren't. It's driving them crazy. And we really didn't have to lift the finger. And when we do thanks to P.J., it's always the middle one. All it took was a little Trump and a lot of wokeism. Donald Trump showed us that we could be as obnoxious, funny and feisty as they are and when. Now P.J. was definitely no fan of Trump. But Trump was all Animal House and no Dean Wormer. He was more like Rodney Dangerfield character in Caddyshack. Americans no longer had to choose between robotic helmet haired Hillary Clinton, or robotic helmet haired Mitt Romney. Somehow allowed by billionaire from Queens taught Republicans how to have a good time. In an instant we found ourselves laughing at the hapless CNN which became a gibbering Dean Wormer. In fact, their entire lineup became a string of minor wormers shrieking all as well, while the real world ran them over. And that wokeness came along and turn to once tolerant Democratic Party into a political version of Jonestown. Adhere to an ideology or die. The party that once said, keep the government out of my bedroom is now the party that forces men to bring their lawyer with them on a date. The party that wants to advocated for a colorblind society now sees pigment, but nothing else. The party that was pro women now replaces moms with birthing persons. So, the Dems are in all-out panic because voters now think their party is too preachy and judgmental. Probably from the constant preaching and judging. The brand is now more toxic than a cup of Drano. That's wokeism. Political Drano. They're so puritanical they make Jerry Falwell look like Gene Simmons. The Democratic Party is now as repressive as a bag full of Ayatollahs as woke as suck the fun out of everything. I had a friend who in order to lose weight, would eat some of his meal and then empty an ashtray on the rest. It worked. He stopped eating, and it ruined everyone else's appetite too. That's what woke ism has done to the Democratic Party, but also the Women's Sports, Awards Shows, Disney, our justice system. It's an ashtray, loaded with carcinogenic orthodoxy. Because it can't create, all it does is destroy. It's a political construct that forces humans to comport to a natural demands. That may be fun in bed but not in politics. It pretended to be about tolerance, intimidating a party through threats of cancellation, obey, or they will ruin you using social media and its media accomplices. Like your wife's driving. Their success was based on scaring you, not convincing you. So why make a good argument when you could have rioters burning businesses in media hacks doxxing private citizens for speaking the truth? That -- that's how they took over the Democratic Party. Then, like Brian Stelter trapped in a Frito-Lay warehouse. They ate everything from the inside. It's funny, and cheap. I would say the Dems are Dean Wormer. But right now it's worse. It's Reagan from The Exorcist.",

      "utterance": "It's almost the weekend. Yes. Almost the weekend. Clap away, my little friends. Happy Friday, everyone. Well, it's been a good week and a bad one. Legendary writer and humorous P.J. O'Rourke passed away. It sucks. But he was kind enough before he went to leave so much behind for all of us. And not just cigar butts and empty whiskey bottles, which sounds like the name of Kat's autobiography. He left us some amazing books like Parliament of Whores, Modern Manners and the one that changed me. Republican Party Reptile which is now Liz Cheney's nickname. He also gave us two of the greatest pieces of satire ever written the National Lampoon 1964 high school yearbook, and the Sunday newspaper parody. O'Rourke was one of the greatest editors of one of the greatest magazines ever, National Lampoon. He may not have written Animal House, but he lived it, he made it happen. And he made me happen too. OK. You can't win them all. But he gave me hope and he gave me a path. A place to go for someone who didn't fit in really anywhere. I bring this up tonight because what we're seeing in today's culture is in part P.J.'s legacy. What he did for the right is make it OK for them to be wrong. In the best sense of the word, to be funny, to be loose, to be high, to be horny. Which sounds like the name of my autobiography. He told us -- he told us it's OK to be alive, which was everything that stereotype of the right was not. We didn't always have to be staid or stiff or judgmental. And you didn't have to cede culture to the left. The left had their Abby Hoffman's and their Merry Pranksters. And O'Rourke said they might be onto something. And then came Andrew Breitbart, our Merry Prankster. So it works thesis was simple. Politics ruins everything, so fight back with fun. When I was younger, I wrote a piece called The Dean Wormer Effect. Based on this fellow from the movie Animal House."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Love him. I know that that's John Vernon. I noted that in every narrative, the framework always stayed the same. We Republicans were always Dean Wormer and the Dems were Animal House. The cheerful troublemakers, the wise guys."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "So, in every situation the right had a stick up their ass. Meanwhile, the left had a joint in their mouths. My goal was to flip that - - reverse the Dean Wormer effect. And my inspiration was PJ. He made it clear that to find politics, the weapon was always going to be fun. And now it's happening. The big flip. We're having fun. They aren't. It's driving them crazy. And we really didn't have to lift the finger. And when we do thanks to P.J., it's always the middle one. All it took was a little Trump and a lot of wokeism. Donald Trump showed us that we could be as obnoxious, funny and feisty as they are and when. Now P.J. was definitely no fan of Trump. But Trump was all Animal House and no Dean Wormer. He was more like Rodney Dangerfield character in Caddyshack. Americans no longer had to choose between robotic helmet haired Hillary Clinton, or robotic helmet haired Mitt Romney. Somehow allowed by billionaire from Queens taught Republicans how to have a good time. In an instant we found ourselves laughing at the hapless CNN which became a gibbering Dean Wormer. In fact, their entire lineup became a string of minor wormers shrieking all as well, while the real world ran them over. And that wokeness came along and turn to once tolerant Democratic Party into a political version of Jonestown. Adhere to an ideology or die. The party that once said, keep the government out of my bedroom is now the party that forces men to bring their lawyer with them on a date. The party that wants to advocated for a colorblind society now sees pigment, but nothing else. The party that was pro women now replaces moms with birthing persons. So, the Dems are in all-out panic because voters now think their party is too preachy and judgmental. Probably from the constant preaching and judging. The brand is now more toxic than a cup of Drano. That's wokeism. Political Drano. They're so puritanical they make Jerry Falwell look like Gene Simmons. The Democratic Party is now as repressive as a bag full of Ayatollahs as woke as suck the fun out of everything. I had a friend who in order to lose weight, would eat some of his meal and then empty an ashtray on the rest. It worked. He stopped eating, and it ruined everyone else's appetite too. That's what woke ism has done to the Democratic Party, but also the Women's Sports, Awards Shows, Disney, our justice system. It's an ashtray, loaded with carcinogenic orthodoxy. Because it can't create, all it does is destroy. It's a political construct that forces humans to comport to a natural demands. That may be fun in bed but not in politics. It pretended to be about tolerance, intimidating a party through threats of cancellation, obey, or they will ruin you using social media and its media accomplices. Like your wife's driving. Their success was based on scaring you, not convincing you. So why make a good argument when you could have rioters burning businesses in media hacks doxxing private citizens for speaking the truth? That -- that's how they took over the Democratic Party. Then, like Brian Stelter trapped in a Frito-Lay warehouse. They ate everything from the inside. It's funny, and cheap. I would say the Dems are Dean Wormer. But right now it's worse. It's Reagan from The Exorcist."

That it was a moralism, a puritanical, obsessed with a moral behavior. That directly applies to wokeism that is the new religion. That is why they're obsessed with behavior.

Yes, they booted Black Lives Matter off its charity platform, Amazon Smile, over the organization's shady financials. BLM has come under fire for not disclosing where tens of millions of dollars of donations have gone. But perhaps, bricks are an all-cash business. Any who, that's what they call a no-no in the nonprofit world. On the bright side, it's how the mob build casinos. Amazon Smile which gives a portion of eligible purchases to charities temporarily suspended BLM foundation for falling out of compliance with nonprofit rules in several states. Spokesman telling the New York Post they'll be suspended until Amazon needs something to distract us from workers peeing in bottles. It's true. So, could this mean the beginning of the end for the controversial organization now that their accounts suspended like it's Judge Jeanine's driver's license?

And if you touch it, it's like wet. Your eyeballs are wet. There's like crusty stuff in your nose. Then hair has grown out of places that's just embarrassing.
