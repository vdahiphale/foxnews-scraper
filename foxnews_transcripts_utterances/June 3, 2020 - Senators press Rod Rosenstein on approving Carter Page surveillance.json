Breaking tonight, a knew and more severe criminal charge against the Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck leading to his death and sparking more than a week of protest that many times have devolved into violent looting or rioting across the country. Prosecutors are now charging former officer Derek Chauvin with second- degree murder.

That is the complete and total sense of chaos in our government, where the president is trying to deal with two incredibly difficult crises, with the pandemic and the racial trouble and the riots, two incredibly difficult situations, and can't get his hands around him, right.

Breaking tonight, a knew and more severe criminal charge against the Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck leading to his death and sparking more than a week of protest that many times have devolved into violent looting or rioting across the country. Prosecutors are now charging former officer Derek Chauvin with second- degree murder. They're also leveling charges against the three other officers involved in arresting and restraining George Floyd. This comes on the same day, President Trump's defense secretary breaks ranks. Says, he doesn't support the use of the Insurrection Act now to use active duty U.S. military to protect U.S. cities. Secretary Mark Esper told reporters this afternoon, the military should only be used as a last resort. But late this afternoon, after a meeting of the White House, Esper reversed an earlier decision to send about 200 active-duty soldiers home from the Washington, D.C. region.

It stops short of first-degree which the family wants, but in Minnesota requires premeditation and deliberation. The other officers at the scene, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J.

And obviously, the American people are very outraged over the death of George Floyd. It's legitimate, it's right to be concerned, and push for reform in that system. But I think we do need to do that and make sure that we don't do that in a violent way. And what we've seen at the department is we see a lot of these nonviolent protests, we see violent protesters taking part of that, infiltrating those nonviolent protests, and that's really where we have cause and concern. And specifically, as it relates in targeting federal law enforcement officers, local, and state law enforcement officers, and that's something that we can't have. And then, that's really what we've been concerned about at the Department of Homeland Security, making sure that we support our state and local federal officials, law enforcement officers pushing information to them, intelligence to them, and personnel, and resources to them. So, I think there's a way that we can do this. As you indicated, some of that violence has subsided over the last several days, we hope that continues. At the same time, if those legitimate protesters want to do so in a non-violent way, exercise their First Amendment, they should be able to do that. The department supports that. But when we talk about violence, that's where we have to draw the line and we have to be very forceful and very clear that that's not appropriate."

During the day, what you see is coordination using phone calls, you see meetings, and then, you see caches of weapons -- homemade weapons mainly, being stashed around different metropolitan area. So, at night, when these protests become more violent, those weapons are at hand. I think overall, what we have seen as far as taking place sort of boots on the ground in these metropolitan areas, are the groups like Antifa or anarchist in general. And those are the -- those are the types of people that we see. That's the Intel that we're getting back, primarily moving these violent protests and these organizations in a certain way usually occurs after nightfall. So, during the day we usually see the nonviolent protests occurring. And then when it gets to the night, we see the more violent protests starting to happen. Criminals starting to take place, organized -- loosely organized during the day to achieve a specific goal."

I don't think that we see that yet, but again, we're continuing to analyze the intelligence, and really getting the feedback from the state and local law enforcement officials in these individual cities. So, we'll continue to look at. We are partnering -- we have a number of investigators at the department that are working with DOJ and working with FBI. We know that they've opened up a number of cases specifically targeting some of the leaders of Antifa and other organizations that are involved. So, I know they're already going down that path.

So, whether you're in phase one or phase two or somewhere in between, I think we're seeing progress there. I think it's very important that we open up that economy and we do so in a safe and responsible way. And we've put out guidelines. White House Coronavirus Task Force has put out guidelines on how to reopen the economy and provided those resources to state governors and other officials there. So, we continue to look at that. I think, as we look at the civil unrest over the last several days and we see these large groups, I think we see a lot of mass. But obviously, we're not doing the social distancing that we've been talking about over the last several months. So, that's a little concerning to a variety of us. And we'll have to see if there's any impact -- long-term impact to that. But I think, overall, we're on the right trajectory -- downward trajectory. But we still have got to do a number of things across the country, continuing to mitigate, continuing to do some of that social distancing, but we got to do so in a responsible manner. But one, that we got to get the economy back up and running. We need to open up back America.

What he thinks about that. But it has also been very clear about law and order, the rule of law, and needing to establish that. So, I know the media likes to focus on some harsh words and some direct words that can be delivered at times, and I think that's needed at times. But I encourage the American people and really everyone to look at his comments as a whole, and I think you will see that they have been balanced, and he has taken the right tone regarding the events in Minneapolis. But making sure he's going to stand up for law and order. He's going to stand up for the law enforcement officials that are being targeted over the last several days.

Then late in the afternoon returning, reversing a decision to send some 200 active duty military that are around the Washington D.C. area back to their home base. What now? There are reports that the White House, the administration, the president, upset with Esper. What's going to happen? Let's bring in our panel, Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer. Mara, it was interesting to watch this, the press conference, kind of a walk back of sorts, and then a change."

      "speaker": "MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I was stunned, actually. I wouldn't have expected the defense secretary to break with the president like this. I don't really understand what the later moved to bring back those troops means. But he read from a statement. This was not off the cuff. He is breaking with the president on the Insurrection Act. He also has clearly had second thoughts about accompanying the president on that walkthrough Lafayette Park. He did refer to it as a photo-op. It's hard to imagine how he can stay on in the cabinet after this. But we'll see. The White House was very careful today. Kayleigh McEnany did not say the president had faith in him, just we have to wait to see what happens."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Ari, you have been through administrations where there's a turnover of different officials, but now you have a former defense secretary, the first defense secretary for President Trump, with this scathing commentary in \"The Atlantic,\" Jim Mattis, saying \"Donald Trump is the first president of my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people, does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us.\" He goes on in a pretty lengthy article. Ari, would do make of this deliberate effort, he says, of drawing the country apart?"

      "speaker": "ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Scathing is right. That piece was very tough on the president, and it got right to the greatest fault line in our society, how divisive the president can be, how divisive the times we live in are. I think people are equally divisive back to the president. But clearly for General Mattis, he reached has breaking point. And he is uncomfortable with what he's seen. It's extraordinary that a former member of the president's cabinet would criticize the man who gave him that position in such blunt terms. It's a sign of the trouble that the president is in. You don't want to be a president when you have such great division where you are losing former allies, especially in an election year. So I do think this is a troublesome sign of people who once supported the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "The law and order pitch, the president says you have to dominate the streets, Mo. You've heard the former vice president denounce the rioting and the looting but obviously support protesters. The president said similar words about a peaceful protest. But it seems like it's kind of one versus the other now. How do you see this as we get ready for this election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I think one of the challenges the president has is he says the right things about peaceful protests, but then in front of the whole world with cameras rolling, authorizes militarized law enforcement to use excessive force against peaceful protesters on his way to the church. So it's a real problem. Look, I get why the president is speaking about law and order, right. I may be a Democrat, but I don't like the rioting in the streets. That needs to stop. Those people need to be fully prosecuted, but not at the expense of our ability to peacefully protest. And I think where the president may be miscalculating a bit is while the tough law and order comments, he may believe can help him politically, I think there's something that's a little bit more at defining right there for a lot of people, and that is chaos. That is the complete and total sense of chaos in our government, where the president is trying to deal with two incredibly difficult crises, with the pandemic and the racial trouble and the riots, two incredibly difficult situations, and can't get his hands around him, right. This seems to be getting away from our federal government, and on top of that the economy is starting to go into freefall. And so the political calculus may be that law and order works, but I think there are a lot of folks out there who are just saying I'm done with the chaos. We need a steady hand of leadership."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Well, the last part about, the economy going into free fall, there are positive signs that actually the job losses are less than predicted, and the market really loved that today. So there may be kind of turning the corner. We'll see how the rest of the week looks. Here is the president talking to Brian Kilmeade this morning."

    {
      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "They burned down the church the day before. I heard how nice and wonderful the protestors were over there. Really? Then why did they burn down the church the day before? They didn't use teargas. They didn't use -- they moved them out. When I went, I didn't say oh, move them out. I didn't know who was there. I figured I was going to walk over to the church very nearby. Most religious leaders loved it."
    },

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Mara, they didn't use teargas. They used pepper spray pellets --"

      "utterance": "Right, they used pepper spray."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And there's all this nuance about what was used. But they cleared them out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, they cleared the mob. There was smoke in the air, and people were coughing and tearing up. Look, the president has been trying to send two messages. It's just that one is much louder than the other -- the law and order message versus the healing message. He actually has a YouTube ad up today with his remarks from the space lunch which were all about healing. But you don't hear that. What you hear is the tough law and order messages. In terms of religious leaders loving it, there were a lot of religious leaders who criticized it, including the religious leaders whose church that is. So the president is trying to have it both ways. And maybe it will work. In the past, law and order messages have worked for Republicans and against Democrats when there are violent protests. But Mo made a really important point. The president is not just the law and order president. He is the president of chaos and disruption. And that's something that people might just be exhausted by."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, Ari, it was just interesting to see all of the pushback about that walk across the street, obviously, from even the religious leaders from that church, but not a lot of talk about the burning church. We talked about that last night. Last word here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Can you imagine of the Tea Party surrounded the White House when President Obama was in office, and the worst elements burnt down or burnt the basement of St. John's Church across the street from the White House, and President Obama said I want to go visit that church, and they moved people away so he could visit. He would be praised by the media for sending every right message. What a hero. And you know the press would be all over those Tea Party protesters at the White House. And they would say it's entirely appropriate that the White House -- the Secret Service, I'm sorry -- moved the protesters so that the president could go to the church with his Bible. This is hypocrisy at the highest order. I thought, frankly, Bret, the president going to the church, he marched for people who want to go to church. There is another part of the symbolism of that. Quite important."

After pleas from individuals to take a knee, a few officers did. They lowered to the ground, and the crowd erupted in applause. In Nashville, police officer Garren Hoskins started talking with a peaceful protester there about their shared faith. Hoskins asked him if he'd like to pray. The protester put down his sign and the two embraced and prayed together. Good news. That's it for us. Fair, balanced, unafraid. Here's Martha.
