What do we need to know? PETER SCHWEIZER, \"RED-HANDED\" AUTHOR: Yes, Mark Zuckerberg has long coveted a relationship with China, and he has these bizarre overtures. One of the stories I recount in the book is that the chief propagandist for the Chinese Communist Party actually visits Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook headquarters in California. Zuckerberg gives him a tour of the entire building, then brings him back to his office. The chief propagandist sits down in his chair, and he notices that on Zuckerberg's desk there is a 500- page book looks familiar because he helped put it together. It's a collection of the speeches and thoughts President Xi of China. And the propagandist asks Mark Zuckerberg why is this book on your desk? And Zuckerberg tells him straight-faced, I am reading it and I bought copies for all my senior executives so they can also understand socialism with Chinese characteristics. So it's this sucking up, and it's very real, tangible deals that he has done that enhance the military and intelligence capabilities of China.",

Not just to change or add to our judiciary, but to change our entire system of government. And frankly, our entire way of life. It's a left-wing cartel that we warned you about over a year ago. Meet the opaquely funded group called Demand Justice, which is really just a front group for the 1630 fund. Demand Justice is led by former Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon, who yesterday revealed how this group bullied Breyer off the court and how they want the court to help validate a far- left wish list of radical policies from climate to gun control."

That's what they want. The better name for the group Demand Justice would be demand revolution. And these constitutional assassins don't come cheap. A few years ago, the Washington Free Beacon reported that George Soros' open society policy center marked that it had sent $2.5 million to Demand Justice for general support. That was between April 1 And June 30, 2018. Soros' group sent $87,000 more between October 1 and December 31 to support what they call advocacy on judicial nominations. Now, the money's all fungible. But some of that money helped fund the highly coordinated and vile attacks on Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation. They were the ones waving those glossy Stop Kavanaugh signs trying to derail the confirmation hearings. Now, this same unsavory lot intends to pick Breyer's replacement. They don't deny that they shame Breyer into retiring. In fact, they're proud of it. Even featuring this headline on their website. And Demand Justice ain't fringe, my friends. They have friends and former employees in very high places, including the White House.

And in Arizona, Biden's at 42 percent. OK, Mark Kelly, think carefully before you vote in lockstep with the radicals. These Democrats have a choice to make. Are they going to do what the dark money groups want? Or are they going to listen to their own voters? I don't believe voters in any of these states. We forgot Jon Tester in Montana, want to turn the Supreme Court into a rubber stamp for the MSNBC crowd. Now, let's be clear. If you care about your Second Amendment rights, this nomination needs to be stopped. If you believe criminals should be punished, this nomination needs to be stopped. If you believe that Biden's team doesn't actually have the power to shut down any business that disagrees with Dr. Fauci, this nomination, oh yes, it needs to be stopped. And if you believe that traditional religious beliefs are protected by the First Amendment, this nomination needs to be stopped. We don't have to wait for the nomination to get started.

Lyndon Johnson nominated people who failed. And they failed because when they got into the investigations, then they got into the hearings, the country concluded they were bad, that they weren't appropriate to be on the Supreme Court. So, I start with the idea that President gets to nominate. He doesn't get to approve. The Senate has an obligation to look carefully at whoever is nominated. Find out what their views are, what their past is, and then see what happens. And we've had a number of cases over the last half century, where the nominee just kind of melted down, couldn't take the heat. So I don't want to prejudge this. Although, I thought it was kind of interesting that Biden today used the pronoun, she, which if you think about the University of Pennsylvania's swimming situation, automatically kind of narrows it down. But I think the fact is, that he'll send somebody up, that person will be thoroughly vetted, thoroughly questioned, and the country ought to be calm about making a decision.

That the Supreme Court's job is to interpret the Constitution. And the idea you have somebody, who - oh, sometimes they will, sometimes they won't. But as long as they're far enough to the left, we don't mind if they invent new things. That person should be defeated.

Saying that the action taken based on that record of decision, including the sale itself of the drilling leases, were based on calculations that were arbitrary - arbitrarily excluding the impacts on foreign energy consumption when calculating its greenhouse gas emissions.

I thought, what you just talked about right there with the difference between a liberal justice and a radical justice being key, Demand Justice has been pushing really radical ideas. And because of the money that they're able to pour into Democratic campaigns, they get a lot of things that that you would think would be just completely untenable. You might remember that a bunch of senators said that they supported court packing. Nobody in America really supports court packing, but Demand Justice does and they have the money."

President Biden pledging to be both racist and sexist, and discriminating against people who aren't the preferred sex and race. Something that if any of the rest of us did that in our hiring decisions would be not allowed. And yet, he openly pledged it. I think people should strongly speak against such sexism and racism, but also the point that they do not care about the Constitution and upholding the law. This is a threat to the entire country. We have seen what happens when justices don't care about First Amendment protections of speech, and religious liberty of Second Amendment protections involving gun rights. All of these things can cause deep harm to the country and to the future of the Republic. And so Republican senators need to not do this thing that they frequently do of just okaying--"

The teachers are investing in a service called Newsguard. And AFT President Randi Weingarten proclaimed, \"It will provide a valuable lesson in media literacy and a discussion point for teachers in class on what can and can't be trusted.\" This is ironic. Two fronts, right. First, because Weingarten and her cronies, all they do is spread fears, fear in lies to keep schools closed, make everyone paranoid about COVID, even little kids. Is that misinformation, Randy? And secondly, the founder of Newsguard once called the New York Post Hunter Biden laptop story, \"a hoax\" likely perpetrated by the Russians. And it's not just the classrooms that are being targeted by these self-appointed misinformation czars. Even the COVID overlords are getting into the act.

Pressure campaigns led to our friend Dan Bongino being permanently banned from YouTube, over rightly questioning the efficacy of masks. And OAN was just dropped by DirectTV after it face calls from far-left advocacy groups and (inaudible) talking heads on CNN. Again, misinformation. So the new sensor seek to purge any traditional or conservative viewpoints from the public square. Even liberals who question them are ultimately called the purveyors of misinformation. And they're using government and big tech to stifle free speech and all debate. They'll ultimately come for you. I promise you. You know the result, though, of one group controlling everything you know, it's called misinformation. Joining me now is J.D. Vance, Ohio Senate candidate. J.D., I always say this, when you allow one group of activists to shut down debate, they ultimately come for other people on the left, because that's all they have is gobbling up other points of view and suppressing them. Your thoughts on this tonight? J.D. VANCE, \"HILLBILLY ELEGY\" AUTHOR: Yes, you're exactly right. Look, at the end of the day, it's not about misinformation, it's not about public health, or anything else. It's about controlling the narrative, because the Democrats know that if they have to face us in an honest debate, they're going to lose. So they try to control the narrative. They try to control the facts, and they use their big tech allies to do exactly that. One of the things I try to remind people, though, is that this is enabled by weak Republicans that we sent to Washington, that refuse to fight back against the tech industry, and all the institutions that control information in this country. So one of the guys running against me in the Senate is Matt Dolan, the guy who owns the Cleveland Indians. And when the woke mob came after the Cleveland Indians, he bent the knee and changed their name. At the end of the day, if you're not willing to stand up for a team that you own, a legacy institution in the state of Ohio, how can you actually stand up against Facebook, against Google, against Fauci, against all of the powerful actors that are making it hard for conservatives to actually have a fair stake in this debate?"

All the lingo that's being used in schools to shut down concerns about COVID restrictions, misinformation. I mean, they are all working in lockstep, J.D., and they're even now going after Substack, \"The Washington Post\" is taking its \"misinformation\" crusade against them, saying \"Conspiracy theorists, banned on major social networks, connect with audiences in newsletters and podcasts. Newsletter company Substack is making millions off anti-vaccine content.\" J.D., they need to crush all dissent, they are so scared right now."

These people were all hall monitors in middle school, and now they've decided they're going to complain to the principal whenever they see anything that challenges their worldview. It's not just COVID. I think one of the big issues where misinformation is used to censor conservatives is the immigration debate, right. Think about how many of our own voters, Laura -- think about how many media personalities have been censored for pointing out the fact that you've got floods of people coming across the southern border completely unchecked, of course bringing fentanyl, which is killing our people, bringing sex trafficking. They are censoring that, too. At the end of the day these people are trying to control the debate in this country because they know they can't win in a fair fight. And the thing to ask, Laura, is think about the history of this. When has the group of people trying to censor the debate, censor the narrative, ever been the good guys? They never are."

Again, no words. There is zero reason to do this, especially as China is about to get huge P.R. by hosting the genocide games. But they're not alone. Both Pelosi and some Senate Republicans are helping as well. Here to explain all this, this dynamic, Indiana Congressman Jim Banks, Chairman of the Republican Study Committee. Congressman, Republican voters coast to coast have no reason to support candidates who are soft on China and want to add to our trade deficit by easing these tariffs."

There are still Chamber of Commerce type Republicans who are weak on China who expose themselves every single day on issues like these. We have to do more to hold China accountable. We can't pass bills like the fake China bill that Nancy Pelosi and Adam Kinzinger and others in the House are pushing forward that mentions coral reefs more than it mentions China. So beware of these types of efforts. The Republican Study Committee, we're fighting against it. This particular bill actually funds the U.N. climate fund. It rewards woke universities and the National Science Foundation. It advances Critical Race Theory by creating a chief diversity officer at the National Science Foundation. It does nothing to hold China accountable. That's why we have to defeat efforts like these."

They were exceptionally effective, but they never liked them because they are used to getting pushed by the Business Roundtable, Wall Street, and of course the Chamber of Commerce, to allow for the easy offshoring of American jobs and American manufacturing. So that's been a problem for the Republican Party, and was, Congressman, before Trump. And Trump tapped into that blue-collar sensibility that I think sustains the party today, unless the party leadership sells us out again. That's the concern, and I'm hearing it everywhere I travel."

And here we are a year after President Trump has left office, and we have done nothing to hold China accountable. We haven't studied -- we haven't held them accountable for blocking any studies into the origins of COVID. We haven't held them accountable for what they've done to wreck the American economy and put America on our knees economically. We haven't held them accountable as they reached to invade Taiwan and deter them from doing that as President Trump did over four years. That's what's startling and troubling about this moment that we find ourselves in, with weak leadership at the very top of our government. We have to do more to hold China accountable. And that's what we're trying to do at the Republican Study Committee at the same time as opposing some of these weak efforts that reward China rather than to anything to hold them accountable."

What do we need to know? PETER SCHWEIZER, \"RED-HANDED\" AUTHOR: Yes, Mark Zuckerberg has long coveted a relationship with China, and he has these bizarre overtures. One of the stories I recount in the book is that the chief propagandist for the Chinese Communist Party actually visits Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook headquarters in California. Zuckerberg gives him a tour of the entire building, then brings him back to his office. The chief propagandist sits down in his chair, and he notices that on Zuckerberg's desk there is a 500- page book looks familiar because he helped put it together. It's a collection of the speeches and thoughts President Xi of China. And the propagandist asks Mark Zuckerberg why is this book on your desk? And Zuckerberg tells him straight-faced, I am reading it and I bought copies for all my senior executives so they can also understand socialism with Chinese characteristics. So it's this sucking up, and it's very real, tangible deals that he has done that enhance the military and intelligence capabilities of China."

He is no more. He actually goes on podcasts and says that the Chinese government, the dictatorship there, is more representative and responsive to the people than the representative democracy in the United States. He talks about how great China is, how efficient their leadership is. And the problem is that a lot of the technologies that are now in China as part of his factory there are the same technologies that are used on his SpaceX rockets, which launch American military and intelligence satellites up into space.
