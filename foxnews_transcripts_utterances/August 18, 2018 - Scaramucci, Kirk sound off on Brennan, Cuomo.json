You had the Federal Communications Commission shutting down his Liberty Radio and slapping it with a $15,000.00 fine. The Chair of the FCC testified before a Senate panel and said that the station has been operating without a license since at least 2013 and that this was not about policing speech, it was about enforcing the law for pirate radio stations like the one that Jones was running. Now, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, he says that it was in accordance with their normal rules that they put him on what they are calling a Twitter timeout for posting a video that was offensive. Bottom line is, for Alex Jones, he is saying that he has a conspiracy theory about why everyone is coming after him. He says it may be a false flag to distract from what he calls the big event. Some sort of civil unrest or the assassination of President Trump, that shows you why Jones is an easy mark. He comes up with these conspiracy theories, so that's why the private sector has been targeting him, the government as well, but it's a slippery slope. Does this open the door to others on the left and the right potentially being targeted, being sidelined?

The media has already covered her 24/7. In fact, Tuesday's White House press briefing featured nearly four times as many questions about Omarosa than any other topics. Thirty nine Omarosa questions compared to just 10 questions for everything else. So now, some other news. Democrat Keith Ellison won the Minnesota primary Tuesday night for the state's Attorney General, but what you haven't heard is that he has been accused of domestic abuse by his ex-girlfriend."

Remember, when abuse accusations emerged about former White House staffer Rob Porter a few months ago? The news network went wild dedicating an hour and 40 minutes of programming to the allegations versus just four minutes 21 seconds to the Ellison scandal. For you guys that are good at math, that's 24 times as much coverage of Porter than Ellison. And by the way, Ellison has been seen hanging around Lewis Farakan. He's defended a cop killer and he doesn't even believe in borders. This is the Deputy Chair of the DNC. It would be nice if the media would hold him accountable to the same level they do Republicans. Chilly news out of New Mexico where five people were found in an extreme Muslim compound allegedly training children to go into school and shoot teachers and police officers. Officials said the body of one toddler, who was abducted by the ringleader was found buried underneath the compound, and 11 more children were being kept in filthy, dangerous conditions surrounded by loaded rifles and handguns. They were arrested and arraigned in court, but despite this, Judge Sarah Backus granted them just $20,000.00 bail. She is a Democrat with a history of giving very low bail. At least one of the five suspects is an illegal immigrant. Jany Leveille came here from Haiti more than 20 years ago. She has been detained by ICE, the agency Democrats want to abolish. Another, Siraj Wahhaj has ties to the blind sheikh, the mastermind behind the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and yet another, recently returned from Saudi Arabia. Where has the media been on this story? They've barely touched it. I think you guys know the answer. And on Wednesday, the FBI join Terrorism Task Force swarmed a Sacramento apartment in what is being called one of the most of significant arrests of an accused ISIS terrorist in the US. Officials arrested Omar Ameem who according to prosecutors was an ISIS and Al-Qaida hit man. He accused of killing an Iraqi policeman while driving a pickup mounted with a machine gun and flying an ISIS flag just a few years ago. Five months later, he arrived in the United States under the Obama administration's refugee program. The same program that our former President touted for its tough vetting process."

But all of that pickups steam this week when the government decided to jump in as well. You had the Federal Communications Commission shutting down his Liberty Radio and slapping it with a $15,000.00 fine. The Chair of the FCC testified before a Senate panel and said that the station has been operating without a license since at least 2013 and that this was not about policing speech, it was about enforcing the law for pirate radio stations like the one that Jones was running. Now, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, he says that it was in accordance with their normal rules that they put him on what they are calling a Twitter timeout for posting a video that was offensive. Bottom line is, for Alex Jones, he is saying that he has a conspiracy theory about why everyone is coming after him. He says it may be a false flag to distract from what he calls the big event. Some sort of civil unrest or the assassination of President Trump, that shows you why Jones is an easy mark. He comes up with these conspiracy theories, so that's why the private sector has been targeting him, the government as well, but it's a slippery slope.

It bleeds into the news pages. That's really the story. That's what the President is targeting, not editorial pages. Fox has editorials. Fox has op-eds essentially. When Sean Hannity comes on, the primetime shows, people have opinion, people have edge. We make that distinction. So the New York Times can have a liberal editorial page, the Wall Street Journal can have a conservative editorial page. I think what clearly frustrates the President more is that that editorial position on any given issue bleeds oftentimes into the news pages. And another important distinction, when the President first tweeted about the enemy of the American people months and months ago, he said fake news was the enemy of the American people. That's different than saying the entire media."

We're trying to hold powerful people accountable.\" They don't have a leg to stand on, on that issue. He is saying there the enemy because for the last year and a half, they have called him the enemy. They've called him the enemy of the Constitution, of minorities, of the rule of law, and he is a counterpuncher. He hits back and he says, the fake news is the enemy of the people because the fake news isn't telling the American people the truth. They are biased, they are very slanted and they are denying the people the right information. They are not reporting the good things he does. They are not giving him any credit for the good things.

    },

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "No. I have not met Henry. Henry was a lifeline. He needed some help over there. All right, ladies, Diamond and Silk, they don't need any help. They go it all under control. Up next, \"Last Call.\" All right \"Last Call.\" As you enjoy your summer weekened, \"Watters' World\" wants you to please, please be safe. Do not be like this guy in Estonia whose jet ski exploded. I don't know what happened here. I didn't even know jet skis could explode like that or had ejector seats, but the rider was apparently okay. There he goes. Shoots right him into the water and onto a nearby boat. He's all right. That's what counts, but please be safe. That's it for us tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, \"Justice With Judge Jeanine\" is next. And remember, I am Watters and this is my world.
