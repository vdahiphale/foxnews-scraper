      "sentences": "It's so interesting, because he was the disruptor candidate from 2016, but now he is the incumbent. And incumbency comes with a lot of benefits, okay? You've got the plane, you've got the organization, and now you have a record. He has got a big war chest and he has organization like he's never had before. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } I think I would make it about three things. Number one, keep the economy hot; as hot as possible. He's got to figure out a way to maybe moderate the things that could hurt it, such as the trade wars, try to land that deal with the Chinese; avoid a debt default crisis, and the Congress is already trying to work that out. And to the extent that he possibly can, if the Democrats are willing, when they do that one bill that they'll get through this year, if they'll cut a deal on infrastructure, try to do that and show that you have some ability to move things forward. Second thing I would do is define the Democrat. So he was very good at defining all of the Republicans that he ran against in the 2015 and 2016 primary. Now, he has to do that to the Democrat. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Voters disliked Hillary a lot more than they love Donald Trump. Now, as you can see, at this rally, there's a lot of people that love Donald Trump. But the Democrats are also very energized. So he has to define them very quickly. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Then the third thing is I think he has to figure out a way to remain the change candidate as much as he possibly can. He is more anti-establishment than any Democrat running except for perhaps, Bernie Sanders. And eight of the last 10 elections were all about change. Those are the ones that were successful. So how do you run as an incumbent and still say that you are the change candidate. I think he would have to say, \"I got so much done, you can't even believe how much I got done. It's amazing. It's beautiful. All that I got done. But there's still a lot more to do.\" That's how I would do it. And I would also try to throw as much chaos into the Democratic primary as possible. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

      "utterance": "It's so interesting, because he was the disruptor candidate from 2016, but now he is the incumbent. And incumbency comes with a lot of benefits, okay? You've got the plane, you've got the organization, and now you have a record. He has got a big war chest and he has organization like he's never had before. I think I would make it about three things. Number one, keep the economy hot; as hot as possible. He's got to figure out a way to maybe moderate the things that could hurt it, such as the trade wars, try to land that deal with the Chinese; avoid a debt default crisis, and the Congress is already trying to work that out. And to the extent that he possibly can, if the Democrats are willing, when they do that one bill that they'll get through this year, if they'll cut a deal on infrastructure, try to do that and show that you have some ability to move things forward. Second thing I would do is define the Democrat. So he was very good at defining all of the Republicans that he ran against in the 2015 and 2016 primary. Now, he has to do that to the Democrat. Voters disliked Hillary a lot more than they love Donald Trump. Now, as you can see, at this rally, there's a lot of people that love Donald Trump. But the Democrats are also very energized. So he has to define them very quickly. Then the third thing is I think he has to figure out a way to remain the change candidate as much as he possibly can. He is more anti-establishment than any Democrat running except for perhaps, Bernie Sanders. And eight of the last 10 elections were all about change. Those are the ones that were successful. So how do you run as an incumbent and still say that you are the change candidate. I think he would have to say, \"I got so much done, you can't even believe how much I got done. It's amazing. It's beautiful. All that I got done. But there's still a lot more to do.\" That's how I would do it. And I would also try to throw as much chaos into the Democratic primary as possible."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I think that the more that President Trump in his reelection efforts can push the Democrats further to the left, the better off he will be. We've already seen Joe Biden have to go left to where he's been for decades, the Hyde Amendment on abortion funding; China, for example; the crime bill, we'll see how he does on that. Next week, when he does the debates, he is the tallest oak in the yard, and all of those other Democrats are going to want to chop him down. So I think the more that President Trump can put a spotlight on that focus on that chaos, push them to the left, the better off he will be and the better off that the other members of Congress could be that are running for reelection, or those that are just running for election, the 31 House seats that went Democrat that gave Nancy Pelosi the Speaker's gavel, those are up for grabs again in 2020. And this time, instead of like 2018, this time, you have President Trump at the top of the ticket, and maybe those seats could flip back to Republicans if they play their cards right."

One is that if he does, in fact, go for this, and there's now confirmation from senior administration officials, I was speaking to somebody earlier today who was saying, \"No, this is real, this is going to happen.\" They're going to start telling people who have had all their due process who are in the country illegally, who've been adjudicated, and it has been found that they should be deported under the law. They're told that they have to go, Democrats are going to oppose this. Democrats are going to say, \"Well, hold on a second. That's not right. That's not fair,\" which also gives the lines what they've been saying all along about the Central American migrant crisis, the so-called asylum seekers that, \"Oh, we promise, once they get their process, sure, it will be okay with them being deported.\" That's obviously not the case. So they're really in on this scam. And it going to force Democrats to have to admit that they don't believe in the rule of law. They like the process until it comes to an end. And then the process isn't really for them anymore."

      "speaker": "SEXTON",

I mean, there are prominent Democrats, you seem to think that Manafort in solitary confinement is some great justice and the country is achieving a better future because of it. But the massive and systematic fraud -- and that's what it is -- that has been perpetrated at our southern border with Democrats really complicit in it by pretending that we don't all know what's happening. We don't know that people are lying about being family units. We don't know that people are lying about fleeing violence, when in fact, they just are economic migrants who want a better future. This is going to finally bring into focus at a perfect time because we're heading the election that the Democrats are effectively an open borders party, and they only believe in the law when they like the law."

They come here illegally, and yet we still treat them very humanely, and to say that that's the moral equivalent of what the Nazis did of forcing Jews into concentration camps and then gassing millions of them to death.

And they know they can get away with it because their fellow travelers and the mainstream media instead of fact checking them actually are tying themselves in knots today defending her making outrageous statements. I mean, even saying -- one CNN senior editor said Auschwitz was a work and concentration camp.

Doug MacGregor is a retired U.S. Army Colonel and he joins us tonight. Colonel, thanks a lot for coming on.

First, what Buck has already covered about securing the border, and secondly, about his promise to end these pointless and endless wars in the Middle East. He needs to get us out of Afghanistan. He needs to get out of Syria and he needs to get out of Iraq. If he can't turn to an audience like the one he's got tonight, a year from now and say, \"Look, I promised, I delivered.\" I think he is not going to see everybody show up at the ballot box that he would like to be there."

But yes, this is the official kickoff, and it just proves to us what we've known since at least 2000, Florida, Florida, Florida. That was a big part of the President flipping the narrative around on the mainstream media, which said again, and again, that the math doesn't work that he simply could not get to 270 electoral votes. Once he turned Florida and then he went up, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, obviously, that's what got him far beyond that number. And look, it's instructive that the same, you know, wise people who say they seem to know everything about politics are telling us again, the President is behind in all of these battlegrounds. Quinnipiac, for example, a poll out just a couple of hours ago, saying the President is down nine points in the State of Florida to Joe Biden. Guess what? Quinnipiac had Andrew Gillum, the Democrat winning the governorship by seven points in 2018. He is not the Governor tonight, as the President stands on that stage in Orlando. So these polls can be off, and I think that's one of many things this President is banking on because of the strong economy."

His numbers have come down a little -- not a lot -- little. But look, this is a kickoff for the President tonight. The kickoff really for the Democrats is next week when they have their first debates.
