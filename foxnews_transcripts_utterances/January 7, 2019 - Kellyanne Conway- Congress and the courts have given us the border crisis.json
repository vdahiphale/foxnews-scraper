And plus, could President Trump really be in a position to pick a third Supreme Court Justice sometime this year? We have an important update for you later tonight. And Joe Biden versus Barack Obama? Once best buddies, we're going to explain how the 2020 nomination fight could actually lead to a bitter breakup over the future of the Democratic Party.

Those statistics I just gave you, they're important. But we need to emphasize how illegal immigration has directly and at times tragically affected the lives of all Americans and including the people trying to come into the country. It's been dangerous for them. The speech should be wide-ranging, hitting all the big immigration issues, from chain migration to the visa lottery, the need for mandatory e-verify in the workplace, and also yes, even the scam of so-called birthright citizenship. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } That's where children of non-U.S. citizens are granted automatic citizenship, just for being born here. Every year, thousands of Chinese, Russians, and others travel to the United States to have babies just for the U.S. passport. It's called birth tourism. It is a complete outrage. It's big business. And no, it's not a constitutional right. So don't try me on that. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } As for all those who claim, by the way, that illegal immigration is not a crisis, I think American families of these victims would disagree. The day after Christmas, California officer Ronil Singh was shot in cold blood during a routine traffic stop. He left behind a wife and a five-month-old baby. His murderer, illegal alien Gustavo Perez Arriaga. Thousands of citizens and hundreds of officers attended the funeral service. I wish all of you could watch it. And this happened over the weekend. This is the Fiji Ambassador, the officer originally hailed from Fiji, speaking at the service, and I was watching him today. I hadn't seen it until today. He has a better grasp of this tragedy than many American commentators. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

The President cannot relent. He must continue to speak for these families and frankly for the millions of you who believe that every country, not just our - every country around the world has the sovereign right to determine who can and cannot reside here. It's not immoral to do so. And if our elected representatives refuse to do their solemn duty to defend our country, then we in essence - we kind of already have a government that shut down, shut down to the will of the people.

Take a lesson from the Democrats. They never break ranks. Think about what you Republicans accomplished by supporting the President during the confirmation fight of Brett Kavanaugh.

Now, take Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden. Just one month ago, on his first day in office, he ended a program called 287(g). Now, I wonder that program the Sheriff's office reported the immigration status of its inmates to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, something Tom Homan knows a lot about. Now, McFadden says that the goal is to build a rapport with law enforcement and the community that they serve. But I wonder if the community knew what they were getting into when this guy was elected. Early last year, undocumented immigrant Kevin Santos shot a man during an attempted robbery. He was being held in Mecklenburg County jail under the 287(g) program that McFadden just ended. The man he shot, he wants to remain anonymous. Can't hardly blame him. But he told local news in Charlotte that his dream of joining the army was snuffed out due to the severity of his injury. Meanwhile, Santos is free to walk. And he is walking the streets until his hearing in two months. So my question is, why isn't this individual immediately deported? Any illegal who commits a felony is, by law, to be immediately deported in the United States. So why aren't local officials enforcing this? This should be fast-tracked out of the country. All told, McFadden's office says that 28 people who were held under this 287(g) provision have been released in just a month's time. 28. And a source said that those release present a danger to the public. We invited Sheriff McFadden on. I truly want to hear how he explains this. Maybe there's a good explanation. He declined, citing an inconsistency in the reporting that's wholly separate from this whole 287(g) issue. That invitation now remains open. For more on why Trump won and how the GOP could do it all again, grab a copy of my new paperback, Busting the Barricades: What I Saw at the Populist Revolt. It's in bookstores everywhere. It makes a great New Year gift. And up next, President Trump is set to address the country tomorrow night about the real crisis at our southern border, saying that it could classify as a national emergency. Wow!

The Congress and the courts have failed to do their job. They've given us this crisis. And when people deny the use of the word crisis of this border, it's very sad to me because what is not a crisis if not an increase in the drugs and the meth, the fentanyl, the cocaine and the heroin coming over the southern border. 90 percent of the heroin, the government statistics say, come over the southern border.

Now, to give you a sense of just how bad it is, in October and November of this past year, that's the first two months of the new fiscal year, almost 102,000 people have been caught. That's quite a clip. The number of people crossing illegally with children has also skyrocketed. In the Rio Grande Valley sector alone, the number spiked 27 percent since last year, jumping from like 49,896 in fiscal year 2017 to 63,278 in the last fiscal year. Not a crisis?

Now, I would hope that when he does this, the President personalizes the border crisis. Those statistics I just gave you, they're important. But we need to emphasize how illegal immigration has directly and at times tragically affected the lives of all Americans and including the people trying to come into the country. It's been dangerous for them. The speech should be wide-ranging, hitting all the big immigration issues, from chain migration to the visa lottery, the need for mandatory e-verify in the workplace, and also yes, even the scam of so-called birthright citizenship. That's where children of non-U.S. citizens are granted automatic citizenship, just for being born here. Every year, thousands of Chinese, Russians, and others travel to the United States to have babies just for the U.S. passport. It's called birth tourism. It is a complete outrage. It's big business. And no, it's not a constitutional right. So don't try me on that. As for all those who claim, by the way, that illegal immigration is not a crisis, I think American families of these victims would disagree. The day after Christmas, California officer Ronil Singh was shot in cold blood during a routine traffic stop. He left behind a wife and a five-month-old baby. His murderer, illegal alien Gustavo Perez Arriaga. Thousands of citizens and hundreds of officers attended the funeral service. I wish all of you could watch it. And this happened over the weekend. This is the Fiji Ambassador, the officer originally hailed from Fiji, speaking at the service, and I was watching him today. I hadn't seen it until today. He has a better grasp of this tragedy than many American commentators."

The President cannot relent. He must continue to speak for these families and frankly for the millions of you who believe that every country, not just our - every country around the world has the sovereign right to determine who can and cannot reside here. It's not immoral to do so. And if our elected representatives refuse to do their solemn duty to defend our country, then we in essence - we kind of already have a government that shut down, shut down to the will of the people. And by the way, the people routinely rank illegal immigration as one of the most urgent problems facing this nation. And as for the Republicans on Capitol Hill, think about it for a moment. Take a lesson from the Democrats. They never break ranks. Think about what you Republicans accomplished by supporting the President during the confirmation fight of Brett Kavanaugh. When things got tough, when the media were piling on, Republicans stood firm. Do it again here. The Democrats are desperate to divide and conquer the GOP. Don't let them. And that's The Angle.

Now, take Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden. Just one month ago, on his first day in office, he ended a program called 287(g). Now, I wonder that program the Sheriff's office reported the immigration status of its inmates to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, something Tom Homan knows a lot about. Now, McFadden says that the goal is to build a rapport with law enforcement and the community that they serve. But I wonder if the community knew what they were getting into when this guy was elected. Early last year, undocumented immigrant Kevin Santos shot a man during an attempted robbery. He was being held in Mecklenburg County jail under the 287(g) program that McFadden just ended. The man he shot, he wants to remain anonymous. Can't hardly blame him. But he told local news in Charlotte that his dream of joining the army was snuffed out due to the severity of his injury. Meanwhile, Santos is free to walk. And he is walking the streets until his hearing in two months. So my question is, why isn't this individual immediately deported? Any illegal who commits a felony is, by law, to be immediately deported in the United States. So why aren't local officials enforcing this? This should be fast-tracked out of the country. All told, McFadden's office says that 28 people who were held under this 287(g) provision have been released in just a month's time. 28. And a source said that those release present a danger to the public. We invited Sheriff McFadden on. I truly want to hear how he explains this. Maybe there's a good explanation. He declined, citing an inconsistency in the reporting that's wholly separate from this whole 287(g) issue. That invitation now remains open."

The Congress and the courts have failed to do their job. They've given us this crisis. And when people deny the use of the word crisis of this border, it's very sad to me because what is not a crisis if not an increase in the drugs and the meth, the fentanyl, the cocaine and the heroin coming over the southern border. 90 percent of the heroin, the government statistics say, come over the southern border. DHS says there's about a 73 percent increase in fentanyl coming over the border.

So I can understand where maybe President Obama would be coming from. I don't care how old the guy is, in all honesty. But the issue is about ideas, and whether a person is going to come and just oil the machinery, or if a person is going to be disruptive and try to really change this country. That's how Donald Trump got to be the president. And I think that disruptive style, though it's unsettling to people in the D.C. -- I will not call it a swamp, because swamps have an ecological purpose -- the D.C. sewer, they can't stand it.

And the reason is Biden could win in places like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. It was a narrow victory for President Trump, and I think looking forward, you would say oh, boy, just from a donor perspective, political strategist perspective, this is a guy who can go in there, and just like you and the governor said, we like Joe Biden, possibly win some Trump voters back over to the Democratic Party's ranks."
