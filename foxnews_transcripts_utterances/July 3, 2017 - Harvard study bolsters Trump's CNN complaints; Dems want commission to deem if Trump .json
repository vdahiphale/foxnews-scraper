He's fcaing his first meeting with Russian President Putin along the sidelines of an international summit in Germany. Mr. Trump will be traveling to Poland for a speech, then to Hamburg for the annual Group of 20 gathering. You might recall Mr. Trump raised some eyebrows in Europe earlier this year by refusing to explicitly endorse NATO's common defense treaty. He also scolded fellow world leaders for not spending more on their military operation. And reports tonight that North Korea has launched another ballistic missile. This comes just days after President Trump delivered a stern warning to Pyongyang over its repeated test firings of short and long range weapons. Washington is concerned that North Korea is working to build a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the U.S. I'm Marianne Rafferty. Now back to \"Hannity.\"",

Over 20 liberal lawmakers are now backing plan that would create an oversight commission to deem if the president is mentally or physically unfit to serve, which could then lead to his removal under the 25th Amendment. Joining me now with reaction, Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel and Fox News anchor and attorney Gregg Jarrett. Good evening to you, gentlemen.

And let's go back to the Goldwater rule from 1964, when mean partisans tried to bring down Barry Goldwater by calling him crazy. The American Psychiatric Association said in 1973 after a lawsuit was brought by Goldwater, no way. Physicians, especially psychiatrists, cannot speculate on something they see over a camera, a patient they haven't examined, someone that they have no clue about, someone that they're guessing about. It's unethical. It's immoral. It's stigmatizing.

It's not a full repeal of Obamacare, and at the end of the day it is still a big government subsidy, but it's a little less horrible than Obamacare. So they've got to pass something. The problem is that the conservative wing of the GOP knows that this Senate health care bill stinks and they don't want their names attached to it. I totally understand that. But if the GOP can't come together and do this, they are going to get blamed for Obamacare's failure. Obamacare is falling apart, and something's got to be done. Premiums have doubled since 2013. Deductible continue to go through the roof. Insurers are fleeing the market. And if Republicans continue to be purists and they don't work together, nothing is going to get done. We are going to be stuck with Obamacare, and 2018 is going to be an ugly election year. So they've got to compromise. They have got to get something done.",

But somehow, pro- wrestling is so real that they're afraid of it. This is amazing. Most of the wounds that the press think they're experiencing -- they're self-inflicted. And I don't know of anyone who's calling for anybody in the press to be hurt. Quite frankly, I don't know of anyone who wants to hurt the press. They just want to laugh at them because they hold them in contempt. And what's happened on the press is a sense of which they no longer practice journalism. They practice a very targeted, hateful attempt to destroy the legitimacy of Donald Trump's presidency. And people in America, at least beyond the coasts, they're not stupid. They figured this out. And they just are laughing at the press and saying, you know, It's not journalism that we're afraid of. It's not journalism that we don't like. We would appreciate some journalism."

And it seems like CNN and some of the others in the liberal media really jumped at this opportunity, which most normal people thought it was pretty funny. I mean, it wasn't something that was trying to be, you know, taken seriously. But the part that disturbed me most -- and I'm going to ask you about this. You know, as a father, as well, what do you make of CNN calling your daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, you know, a liar since they went out of their way to try to make a personal attack against her?"

I mean, how much more irony could there be? But I think my daughter is handling that quite well. She's strong enough to deal with it. She's a strong woman. And unlike some women in the media, who melt any time someone comes after them, my daughter is handling it I think quite remarkably."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Yes, she was articulate. She had great answers. She came right back. She was able to hold her own, I mean, really, I think being a great representative, you know, for women and for women in journalism to say this is the standard of how you conduct yourself. She was unflappable. There wasn't anything that they said or came after with that she couldn't handle, and she just answered the questions professionally, directly, politely. And you know, that's what we need to do, have that level of discourse. She's showing that even though they're not being respectful on the other side. She is rising up to the occasion, I thought really handling herself unbelievably well. So let's talk about the members of the media. Do you think they're being a little bit hypocritical for being outraged over this? You bring up the point about Shakespeare in the play and -- Shakespeare in the Park, the play, and also Kathy Griffin, things like that. They don't seem to be, you know, up in arms over that, looking to defend that, to say, Oh, this is outrageous. We shouldn't have this kind of behavior that is disrespectful or dangerous to the president. Yet they're upset about this parody tweet that he did."

If we read it and we don't know whether the reporter likes us or not, that's real journalism. If, when reading the story about yourself, you say, Gosh, that guy hates me, or that person who wrote that really likes me..."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Well, and of course, you know, having a father who has been in politics, I think she's got that kind of experience and background to know the type of things that the press will sling at you, the smear pieces, the hit pieces, trying to go after you, the personal attacks. And I think it's one of the reasons why, you know, she's used to dealing with them and she understands, you know, how they behave. But let's talk a little bit more about CNN, you know, again, their outrage this weekend over the president's, you know, wrestling tweet. But they themselves deserve to be criticized after getting stories wrong and really unrelenting, constant negative coverage of the Trump administration and trying to push a false narrative with the Russian collusion story where there is not one fact to support it."
    },

      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",

They had to fire or ask for the resignations of three of their people because of improper and unethical behavior. I mean, this is a network that really is in a meltdown. It has nothing to do with Donald Trump. It has to do with their inability to be objective. The one thing we expect out of our press is that you just report the news. Let us make up our minds how we feel about it."

The freedom of the press only works when there is a responsibility of the press to be objective. And when they start acting that way, they might get a little respect, but right now, they're about as popular as the Zika virus from a mosquito."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",

Previous Republicans have either ducked or tried to ignore the media. Even Reagan, in his avuncular fashion, tried to go over the heads of the media. But he never confronted the media with the same gladiatorial directness as Trump. So I think with Trump, he's a culture warrior. He's fighting not just on the political but on the cultural front. He knows how to get to these guys. He's very good at it. And the reason that they're upset is not because he's ineffective, it's because he's so effective."

And I think while they think that they are sort of covering so that the Democrats can just continue to obstruct, obstruct, obstruct and be the party of no, what I think is, in fact, happening is that they are self- destructing, and the president is going to see to it that he carries this through to fruition."

He also scolded fellow world leaders for not spending more on their military operation. And reports tonight that North Korea has launched another ballistic missile.

Well, Democratic obstructionists are working on a new plan to try to impeach President Trump after the Russian collusion narrative has completely fallen apart. Well, the bill appears to be getting support from Democrats in the House. Over 20 liberal lawmakers are now backing plan that would create an oversight commission to deem if the president is mentally or physically unfit to serve, which could then lead to his removal under the 25th Amendment. Joining me now with reaction, Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel and Fox News anchor and attorney Gregg Jarrett. Good evening to you, gentlemen. Yes, this is a real story that we are reporting on, and I will go to you, Gregg, about the legal aspects of it. Has anything like this ever been done before?"

It envisions somebody who has a stroke, somebody who has an accident, or in the case of JFK, what if he had survived but was brain-damaged? That's how it all came about. So she either misunderstands or misinterprets it, one of the other. You know, I think it's really she just doesn't like this particular president. She doesn't like his politics. The only mechanism for removal there is called the ballot box. It's an election."

But I would speculate about Representative Jamie Raskin who is bringing this action. A freshman Congressman, I wonder why. There is absolutely no evidence of any mental instability here. And let's go back to the Goldwater rule from 1964, when mean partisans tried to bring down Barry Goldwater by calling him crazy. The American Psychiatric Association said in 1973 after a lawsuit was brought by Goldwater, no way. Physicians, especially psychiatrists, cannot speculate on something they see over a camera, a patient they haven't examined, someone that they have no clue about, someone that they're guessing about. It's unethical. It's immoral. It's stigmatizing. And as a matter fact, the reason I'm bringing this up is because this so- called committee, Kimberly, is supposed to be composed of psychiatrists, physicians. What are they going to do, exactly? Are they going to haul President Trump in for an examination? I want to say again, you don't know the person. You are watching him over the television screen. And he's also reacting to being blasted. \"Washington Post,\" \"New York Times,\" CNN always saying negative things about him. So if he's a little defensive, what do you expect? No sign of mental instability and we cannot speculate about such things. It's unethical."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Isn't it, Gregg, a natural reaction that if someone is making false accusations and attacking you constantly that you might want to defend yourself and call them out to call them fake news, especially when CNN had to fire three people and retract a story. The New York Times has had to retract about the intelligence agencies, 17 intelligence agencies, that wasn't true, Associated Press, Washington Post, it goes on and on."

    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Sure. And what is lost in the conversation is what prompted the president's angry tweet at Mika and Joe last week on MSNBC. It was because they were calling him things like dope, mentally ill, demented, a thug. Where is the equivalency here? Why aren't they being condemned, instead just the president for being human and reacting to it and calling them out for what they are, biased. There was a Harvard study. Ninety percent of the coverage of the president since he took office has been negative compared to Barack Obama, which was only 41 percent. This president realizes that he is the victim of unabashed scorn and hatred by the media and he is, to his credit, fighting back."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIEGEL",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And the president has shown a sense of humor here, which we're not seeing on the other side. He showed compassion when Representative Scalise, when Whip Scalise got shot. He talked about him being a fighter on his birthday. They talk about he's always about himself. On his birthday he never mentioned that it was his birthday, only talked about the man being a fighter. Guess how predictive that ended up being. He pulled himself out with great courage. Right now, President Trump is trying to look after a young baby. I think that there's signs -- now, again, I'm not going to speculate about President Trump, who I have not met. I don't know about his health, physical or mental health. But I'll say this, it's really unethical and irresponsible for physicians to try to do it on television or anywhere."

    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "And even if somebody suffers from mental illness, that doesn't invoke the 25th Amendment. Duke University did a study of all American presidents and concluded that roughly half of them suffered some form of mental illness, including Lincoln, who had terrible depression. He used to go to the vault of his dead son, have them open the coffin, and sit for hours at a time. That seems a little crazy, and yet Lincoln was perhaps our greatest president."

Hilarious reinforcement of FNN.\" Joining me now with more on the media's glaring double standard is Fox News contributor Deroy Murdock, legal analyst and former prosecutor Lionel, and columnist for The Hill Kristin Tate. Thank you all for being here with me tonight. A lot of new developments. We have the tweet from Don, Jr., and you have the meme that was out this weekend. And Deroy, I'll begin with you.

It's been from when he was elected, even before he was elected. It goes on and on, well beyond CNN. You've had Madonna saying that she dreams about blowing of the White House. Snoop Dogg did a video where he pulled the trigger on a revolver at this clown that was dressed up to look like Donald Trump. Obviously Kathy Griffin holding that chopped off head of Donald Trump, I call this assassination chic. And it's not just done by odd people out there in the hinterland. This is done by people who are artists, people who sell platinum records. These are people who have been in some of the biggest movies and entertainment vehicles in our country. And that sort of thing is appalling, and I think unfortunately it leads to people pulling the trigger like we saw in Arlington, Virginia, a few weeks ago."

Then they turn around and they use divisive rhetoric and violence inciting rhetoric all the time. Where was the outrage, again, when Kathy Griffin held up Donald Trump's severed head? The hypocrisy is flagrant. And the left love saying Donald Trump's tweets aren't presidential. They are right, it's not presidential. But that's why people voted for Trump. This is no ordinary president. People wanted a fighter, someone who wouldn't be afraid to go to Washington, D.C., flip over the table, and stick it in the media that middle America has come to despise them."

For example, the Media Research Center took a look at the signature ceremony for this policy for the V.A. that should have more accountability, firing incompetent and corrupt people at the Veterans Administration. NBC and ABC didn't bother to cover that. So they say that this is a discretion, but then why don't they when this isn't happening actually focus on public policy?"

You're going to need two beefsteaks for eyes, and a supporter.\" This was violence, signed HST. We loved it. Give him hell, Harry. Trump, with a little tweet, this is nothing.

And every Republican and conservative and even moderate and some Democrats voters who voted for these people expect and demand these guys do their jobs, stop monkeying around and get it together. And I think the simply way to do it is basically the moderates want more money, the conservatives want more freedom, so whatever spending we have, put the spending into health savings accounts and other vehicles like that so you make people who are basically beneficiaries of government services become consumers. They can go out and pick and choose the care they want.

It's not a full repeal of Obamacare, and at the end of the day it is still a big government subsidy, but it's a little less horrible than Obamacare. So they've got to pass something. The problem is that the conservative wing of the GOP knows that this Senate health care bill stinks and they don't want their names attached to it. I totally understand that. But if the GOP can't come together and do this, they are going to get blamed for Obamacare's failure. Obamacare is falling apart, and something's got to be done. Premiums have doubled since 2013. Deductible continue to go through the roof. Insurers are fleeing the market. And if Republicans continue to be purists and they don't work together, nothing is going to get done. We are going to be stuck with Obamacare, and 2018 is going to be an ugly election year. So they've got to compromise. They have got to get something done."

There is no Obamacare. It's a mess. But the good news for the president is that he can now turn to the American people and say, what you expect? I can't get any kind of a limitation on immigration, which is what you voted me in for, without them calling me the racist. I can't budge no matter what I try to do."

This time with GLOW or something to drive these people completely over the edge, because it takes one more, I'm telling you, it takes one more meme or tweet for the entire mainstream media to lose it completely. We can only pray."

Go back in November of next year and say to the voters, look, you voted us in, and we had the House and Senate and the White House and we didn't do a thing so vote us back in? I don't think so. Also they seemed scared. What are the Republicans afraid of? They all look terrified on these shows. What are they afraid of, the American people will say, oh, thank you for keeping your promises? They have nothing to fear other than that awful paper on Eight Avenue here in New York writing nasty editorials. There's no reason they should be afraid of that. Those are all badges of honor."

If nothing gets done, the Republicans know it's going to be really ugly next year. The Democrats have proven that they are the party of no, they are going to obstruct. So it's got to be the Republicans that get this done, and I think they know that. So if they are smart, they will compromise and push this through."
