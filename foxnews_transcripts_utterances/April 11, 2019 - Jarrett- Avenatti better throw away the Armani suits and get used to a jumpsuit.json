Now, starting tonight -- and I'll explain in a minute -- and in the coming weeks and days and months, those deep- state bureaucrats, along with their friends in the Democratic Party, the hate-Trump media mob, they will face what is an avalanche of facts, truth, equal justice and, yes, equal application of our laws.

Just hours ago, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes sent a criminal referral notification to the attorney general, William Barr. Nunes believes the Department of Justice will, in fact, take these charges very seriously. Many bad actors will be held accountable. Get this, believe it or not, a prominent Democrat, yes, has now been charged as a result of the Mueller investigation. Where was the predawn raid with Navy SEALs and frogs and amphibious vehicles? Where was that?

Remember, tell Vladimir I'll have more flexibility after the election. Yes, he worked for that President Obama. It was Obama's White House general counsel. Now, keep in mind, the country of Ukraine is begging us right now to open an investigation admitting that they actually did involve themselves in collusion and it was between one of their government officials and the Clinton campaign to help Hillary in 2016. Don't expect to see this get any attention from the rage Trump media mob. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } Now, they don't care about collusion claims unless they can use it against Donald Trump.

By the way, Jim and Rod Rosenstein may have serious issues as Rod Rosenstein personally signed the fourth FISA request, the third renewal when he wasn't planning on taping the president against his knowledge. Now, the dossier was a pack of Russian lies, unverified, uncorroborated paid for by Hillary Clinton. And, by the way, they never told the court directly, these little asterisks may have slight political taint. Jim Comey, you signed off on this application in October of 2016. Like you said, that it's to the best of your knowledge true and accurate or there's consequences. But then that was October of 2016 you signed that. In January 2017, James Comey, you told then President-elect Trump that its contents were salacious and unverified.

Either way, that makes you a liar. I would bet you probably lied on the application to spy on an American citizen because you knew full well that even the author of the dossier, Christopher Steele, because Bruce Ohr warned you in August of 2016, he didn't know if the dossier was true, because Steele testified in an interrogatory in Great Britain, he has no idea if it's true.

But it gets worse. One of those settlements was $4 million for a man who was paralyzed and mentally ill. The indictment says Avenatti not only stole the money, he then wouldn't file paperwork saying the man received a settlement award, so the paralyzed men also lost his disability payments. Avenatti also allegedly stole the $2.5 million settlement by a private jet, which has now been seized. In all, Stormy Daniels former attorney is looking at 335 years in prison. Avenatti responded in part quoting, \"Along the way, I have made many powerful enemies. I am entitled to a full presumption of innocence, and am confident that justice will be done once all the facts are known\". And don't forget those are just the West Coast charges.

Tonight, the corrupt, high ranking unelected bureaucrats that rigged Hillary Clinton's investigation tried to rig the 2016 election and then tried to destroy your duly-elected president are no longer safe from facing the justice that they deserve. Now, starting tonight -- and I'll explain in a minute -- and in the coming weeks and days and months, those deep- state bureaucrats, along with their friends in the Democratic Party, the hate-Trump media mob, they will face what is an avalanche of facts, truth, equal justice and, yes, equal application of our laws. They will not be able to withstand the pressure. The boomerang of justice starts tonight. Just hours ago, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes sent a criminal referral notification to the attorney general, William Barr. Nunes believes the Department of Justice will, in fact, take these charges very seriously. Many bad actors will be held accountable. Get this, believe it or not, a prominent Democrat, yes, has now been charged as a result of the Mueller investigation. Where was the predawn raid with Navy SEALs and frogs and amphibious vehicles? Where was that? Where was CNN? Now, President Obama's White House counsel Greg Craig has, in fact, been indicted two counts of lying to investigators about his work for the pro- Putin president of Ukraine. Remember, tell Vladimir I'll have more flexibility after the election. Yes, he worked for that President Obama. It was Obama's White House general counsel. Now, keep in mind, the country of Ukraine is begging us right now to open an investigation admitting that they actually did involve themselves in collusion and it was between one of their government officials and the Clinton campaign to help Hillary in 2016. Don't expect to see this get any attention from the rage Trump media mob. Now, they don't care about collusion claims unless they can use it against Donald Trump. No principles, just selective moral outrage. You know, take a look at this disparity in coverage with Justice Kavanaugh and the serious rape and violent sexual assault being laid about the lieutenant governor of Virginia. Now, the media mob is freaking out over Attorney General Barr stating what is an irrefutable fact. The Trump campaign was spied on by our own government. The freak-out begins. Take a look."

Let me break this down for super patriot Jim Comey that knows better than we smelly, Walmart, irredeemable, deplorable Trump voters that tend to be angry and cling to our God, guns, religion and bibles.

In order to get a FISA search warrant, you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information in the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.

Now, the dossier was a pack of Russian lies, unverified, uncorroborated paid for by Hillary Clinton. And, by the way, they never told the court directly, these little asterisks may have slight political taint. Jim Comey, you signed off on this application in October of 2016. Like you said, that it's to the best of your knowledge true and accurate or there's consequences. But then that was October of 2016 you signed that. In January 2017, James Comey, you told then President-elect Trump that its contents were salacious and unverified. You told him that at Trump Tower. So, Jim Comey, did you lie on the FISA application or to the President- elect Trump? Either way, that makes you a liar. I would bet you probably lied on the application to spy on an American citizen because you knew full well that even the author of the dossier, Christopher Steele, because Bruce Ohr warned you in August of 2016, he didn't know if the dossier was true, because Steele testified in an interrogatory in Great Britain, he has no idea if it's true. It's raw intelligence, 50/50. And he had no idea if any of it was true. Well, that would make that dossier unverifiable according to its own author. I told Comey and many times before, you have the right to remain silent. It looks like you should have taken that advice and maybe you might want to start.

Speaker Pelosi telling the \"A.P.\" that she doesn't trust Attorney General Barr. She trusts Robert Mueller. Well, someone should remind Nancy about this direct quote from the Mueller report.

If he was compromised, why would he expel 60 Russian diplomats, why would he authorize military action against Putin's thugs in Syria during a battle that resulted in a major embarrassment for the Russian dictator? And don't forget, President Trump also pushed for increased military spending in the European allies as a deterrence initiative against Russia and Putin. And thanks to this administration, the United States is flooding the market with American oil and natural gas. That is the lifeblood of Putin's hostile regime, and if American begins to export massive amounts of oil and gas around the world to our European allies, to Asia, to elsewhere, we will absolutely destroy the economy of the hostile regime of Vladimir Putin and the hostile actors in Russia -- by the way, something no Democrat would ever do. Hillary Clinton was too busy hitting reset buttons and getting kickbacks from Putin's minions in the Uranium One deal and Obama was telling Putin that he would have more flexibility after the elections. Which brings to other news tonight and that's WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. For years, the media mob have observed over Assange, spreading a baseless lie that he was the key to finding Trump-Russian collusion. Well, now, Assange was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embasy in handcuffs, Ecuador withdrew his asylum, British police arrested Assange on a U.S. extradition warrant over a 2010, quote, scheme to steal military secrets with former army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.

Now, in both the Manning case and the leaked DNC and Podesta e-mails, Assange maintains, he said that he was merely acting as a journalist, publishing information provided to him from his sources. As a matter of fact, if you look at WikiLeaks' record, they never printed a single thing proven untrue in 12 years. Whether you like their work or don't. That's a better track record than the fake news media mob right here in America that has been doing nothing but lying and peddling you conspiracy theories for 2 1/2 years. And that brings up a fascinating legal issue about the freedom of the press in this country. Remember the 1971 landmark Pentagon Papers case? Well, the U.S. Supreme Court, 6-3, they ruled the media outlets could publish stolen materials as long as they didn't conspire to steal the information. In an interview with yours truly in 2017, I went to the Ecuadorian embassy in London. And Assange, I asked him directly about influence, Russia sources.

Now, one would assume that Assange, he could have been the guy that offered computer forensics that would prove exactly where that information came from. Mueller didn't take the time to ask? Either way, we have known that Russia has been a hostile actor on the world stage for years. Devin Nunes warned us about their nefarious intentions in election interference that would happen in the 2016 election. He did that in 2014. But nobody seemed to care or pay attention. And don't forget this all happened on Obama's watch, not Donald Trump's watch. So, now, we as a country have a decision to make. When will our federal government -- this is an important question -- when will we ramp up efforts to stop hackers from accessing our sensitive materials that impact our security in this country? In other words, when is the government going to get serious about cyber security threats that we face every day? Because this is now been going on for decades. At what point does it become not shame on you, shame on you, what about shame on us for not fixing a serious significant progress in what is the digital age? Our government has not ever built cyber security that makes our national security invulnerable. It's vulnerable and needs to be fixed. It's why Clinton's private server with top secret and classified information on it was and is a national security threat. And, by the way, also a felony.

Let me begin with you, Carter, because this directly impacted you. The fact -- if the Grassley-Graham memo is true and the bulk of the information was Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian dossier that its own author doesn't stand by, then that would mean it would have been impossible to corroborate and verify.

If they had indicted him for merely publishes classified materials, this would be the Pentagon Papers case modern version. But they were very clever. And they indicted him on a very factually questionable basis for encouraging Manning to try to get information, for asking Manning for the first part of a password into a computer. It factually is a very weak indictment but it doesn't indict him for publishing classified material. One of the reasons for that is, Great Britain probably wouldn't extradite somebody who is charged merely with publishing information. But if the allegation is conspiracy to try to essentially hack a government computer by getting into the password, then that might pass the level for extradition. But this is going to take a long time. He's going to fight it. One question is, where does he stay while he's fighting it if he's in prison all that time while he's fighting?"

They went back to Chelsea Manning and as Alan Dershowitz said, you know, they've gotten this very thin -- they're walking on a very thin line saying that he conspired with Chelsea Manning to retrieve a password.

That they've acknowledged that they'd started doing in at the end of July. You all - you just had Carter Page on, they consider that all legal spying. They then leaked that information, right? Shortly after the election, all through the spring that was leaking out. Why? To create a narrative that Donald Trump shouldn't been President, that he's a Russian asset et cetera, et cetera. So spying and leaking. Then you have culmination of the ultimate spying where you have the FBI Director spying on the President, taking notes - illegally leaking those notes of classified information. Why?

They were never going to be the same. There are kids that went home for dinner that night that looked across at a dinner table at an empty chair to a dad or a mom that was never going to show up again, and ask him about their homework.

The last time Ms. Omar came out with anti-Semitic diatribe, her own party was unable to summon the moral and political courage to do a straightforward resolution condemning anti-Semitism. This should come as no surprise to anyone. It's not like she just came out with these kinds of comments. In 2012 she said she tweeted, \"Israel has hypnotized the world. May Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel\". She is a long record of anti-Semitism anti-Israel beliefs. And no one now on the Left is willing to call her out. Why? Because they now share those beliefs. Their refusal to call her out and condemn anti- Semitism straight-up shows how deeply entrenched it is in the Left and sadly in the mainstream Democratic Party."

All right, when we come back - this is a big story. Michael Avenatti is in serious, significant, real legal trouble tonight, accused of stealing millions from clients.

    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Indeed it has Sean. In the 36 new counts facing Michael Avenatti there's embezzlement, tax evasion, perjury and others. But there are also several charges of wire fraud, and that's significant, because the wire fraud is alleging that he stole his clients' settlement money. And for a lawyer that's a rock bottom move. But it gets worse. One of those settlements was $4 million for a man who was paralyzed and mentally ill. The indictment says Avenatti not only stole the money, he then wouldn't file paperwork saying the man received a settlement award, so the paralyzed men also lost his disability payments. Avenatti also allegedly stole the $2.5 million settlement by a private jet, which has now been seized. In all, Stormy Daniels former attorney is looking at 335 years in prison. Avenatti responded in part quoting, \"Along the way, I have made many powerful enemies. I am entitled to a full presumption of innocence, and am confident that justice will be done once all the facts are known\". And don't forget those are just the West Coast charges. In New York Avenatti is charged with trying to extort Nike for $20 million, gets bigger and bigger. Sean."

When liberal mainstream so-called journalists thought Michael Avenatti could be used as a tool to take down President Trump, well, he was the media mob's media darling.

If the Feds can prove just a fraction of this, then Avenatti better throw away the Armani suits and get used to a jumpsuit. Because if the Feds say he was essentially the Bernie Madoff of lawyers running a Ponzi scheme, stealing from one client to pay another, to pay his creditors for the lavish lifestyle and the jet that he had and the pyramid, eventually just came crashing around him. And the behavior and his victims - this is just unconscionable for a lawyer and it's also, if proven, criminal."

He shows up all of a sudden on the East Coast with a porn star and two fake Kavanaugh gang rape accusers. And CNN declares him the Dragonslayer, Avenatti 2020. Well, what was he really? He was a complete scam artist and the media never kicked the tires. They never checked under the hood, because they didn't want to know. They put him right out in the middle of the showroom, because they know what moves merchandise. And what moves merchandises in the media is Trump hate and impeachment."

It comes one week after the actor refused to reimburse the city $130,000 to cover the cost of police overtime while investigating the alleged hate crime hoax. Smollett, who TMZ says, is vacationing in Hawaii with family has not commented, but the civil complaint very much outlines the state's attorneys case against Smollett that he employed two brothers to help him stage the fake attack, even telling the brothers to hit him, but not to hurt him. The complaint says Smollett also coordinated the details of the alleged hoax right down to the this is MAGA Country comments. Of course, in a stunning reversal, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx dropped all the charges without explaining exactly why. Foxx now says the outrage against her might have something to do with race, despite the fact that the city's new mayor, who's black, has also called on Foxx to better explain why the charges were dropped. Smollett has not apologized or shown remorse. All right. Trace, thanks for that second report tonight, we appreciate it. I wish we had another four hours, I mean, there's so much news. But all this is coming. Let not your heart be troubled. We will never be the hate, rage, destroy-Trump media. And let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham is in the swamp tonight. Laura?
