Breaking tonight, we have previously heard about early drafts of James Comey's July 2016 public statement, exonerating Hillary Clinton in the e-mail investigation. But for the first time tonight, we're actually getting a close look at the actual changes in black-and-white, and it's not pretty for James Comey. It suggests major edits were made by FBI agent Peter Strzok and others to give Clinton a political assist and try, at least, to damage Republican Donald Trump. Here's the timeline from Senate Homeland Security Chairman, Ron Johnson, who has gotten this information tonight: if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } May 2nd, 2016, Comey e-mail's a draft statement clearing Clinton of criminal wrongdoing to FBI Director Andrew McCabe and two others before the FBI has interviewed Clinton and other key witnesses. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } May 6, 2016, FBI officials have changed proposed edits to Comey's statement and McCabe forwards that draft statement to other officials like, yes, Peter Strzok. Who he -- we later learned, sent all those pro-Clinton text messages. Now, there were repeated edits, at least three times, the words \"grossly negligent\", taken out. Comey originally writing, \"there is evidence to support a conclusion that Secretary Clinton and others used the server in a manner that was grossly negligent with respect to the handling of classified information.\" Changed for Comey to instead say this: if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

We are learning that Comey made a side agreement that requires the FBI to destroy evidence on electronic devices that were turned over to the agency. All this coming as a very powerful Republican, Senator Chuck Grassley, is demanding answers about those anti-Trump text messages -- exchange between Strzok and FBI colleague Lisa Page. In a new letter, to the deputy attorney general, Grassley demands to get to the bottom of the text from August 2016 that invokes a meeting in the office of the FBI Deputy Director, we mentioned, Andrew McCabe, that appears to go beyond just personal political views.

This is a midterm election next November 2018 in a Republican administration.

So, his approval ratings are very high in those states. So, if he really takes it -- what needs to do in the next year is abandon the Steve Bannon kamikaze mission of going after Republican incumbents and weakening your own party. Which we just saw fail miserably in Alabama, where Steve Bannon managed to elect a Democrat in a state that hasn't elected a Democrat since 1992.

But now, writer Hayden Frye has penned an opinion piece in USA Today detailing why Anakin Skywalker should have been removed from the Jedi order for sexually harassing Padme Amidala in \"Star Wars Episode II,\" or as Frye said, quote, \"while this may have happened a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, it deserves to be called out now. Frye then goes on to list his reasons, including that Skywalker was assigned to protect her, but aggressively pursued her. And because her life is in danger, Amidala has no way to flee her predator. \" It's clear Hayden Frye is writing satire, or is it? Because the subject matter has been front and center for months, and because the Me Too Movement has proven to be so powerful, many readers took Frye's piece as is. On twitter post read, quoting, is this satire? Please say this is satire. To which, Hayden Frye responded, it's supposed to be funny, but many didn't think it was funny, quote, the worst excuse of satire I have ever read in life and, usually, I'm pretty good on picking this up. Or this quote, I cannot tell parody from seriousness anymore. And this tweet kind of sums up the conundrum, quoting again, the satire illuminates how the current moment affects 2018 romance. Stalkers are creepy. No one from the notebook is adorable and noteworthy for his dogged pursuit of love. Although, nobody appears to be arguing that Harvey Weinstein and others simply had their noble intentions misunderstood, and the moral of Hayden Frye's satirical op-ed might have a serious take away when he notes the Jedi council inability to remove a toxic misogynistic predator from its ranks ultimately brings about its downfall.

But for the first time tonight, we're actually getting a close look at the actual changes in black-and-white, and it's not pretty for James Comey. It suggests major edits were made by FBI agent Peter Strzok and others to give Clinton a political assist and try, at least, to damage Republican Donald Trump."

      "speaker": "Here's the timeline from Senate Homeland Security Chairman, Ron Johnson, who has gotten this information tonight",
      "utterance": " May 2nd, 2016, Comey e-mail's a draft statement clearing Clinton of criminal wrongdoing to FBI Director Andrew McCabe and two others before the FBI has interviewed Clinton and other key witnesses. May 6, 2016, FBI officials have changed proposed edits to Comey's statement and McCabe forwards that draft statement to other officials like, yes, Peter Strzok. Who he -- we later learned, sent all those pro-Clinton text messages. Now, there were repeated edits, at least three times, the words \"grossly negligent\", taken out. Comey originally writing, \"there is evidence to support a conclusion that Secretary Clinton and others used the server in a manner that was grossly negligent with respect to the handling of classified information.\" Changed for Comey to instead say this:"

      "speaker": "JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR",

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "In addition, the draft statement had Comey saying similarly: \"the sheer volume of information that was properly classified as secret at the time, it was discussed on e-mail -- that is excluding the up classified e- mails, supports an imprint of the participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that information.\" That changed dramatically again. More innocuously saying, \"In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found information that was properly classified as secret by the intel community at the time it was discussed on e-mail.\" Now, another bit of information in this document dump tonight about the FBI's agreement to give immunity to key witnesses like Clinton Cheryl Mills. We are learning that Comey made a side agreement that requires the FBI to destroy evidence on electronic devices that were turned over to the agency. All this coming as a very powerful Republican, Senator Chuck Grassley, is demanding answers about those anti-Trump text messages -- exchange between Strzok and FBI colleague Lisa Page. In a new letter, to the deputy attorney general, Grassley demands to get to the bottom of the text from August 2016 that invokes a meeting in the office of the FBI Deputy Director, we mentioned, Andrew McCabe, that appears to go beyond just personal political views. Talks about having an insurance policy against a Trump presidency. Listen."

They think they've been a little weird, frankly, that's the word that was used, and they think that James Comey is afraid about the truth coming out -- not about the miller investigation, but about how he handled the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton, Martha."

Remember, there were 10,000 and it would take the FBI forever to go through them. And Fox News got them and went through them in three hours. I mean, it's pretty obvious here that these text messages are only going to pile on to this growing, I think, crisis in public confidence of an operation here with the new FBI director and special counsel that was supposed to provide more objective look at these things that were going on in our country -- and the opposite seems to be happening."

What I say in the pieces, look, theories that seem far-fetched two months ago that this dossier was paid for by the Clinton campaign and the Democrats, peddled to the FBI and then used to start the whole Russia investigation even though it has tremendous amounts of, clearly, false information. I would have said that was preposterous. But now, as these facts emerge, the public is saying maybe this is true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And just as you say, you know, many of the people that you polled are not fans of this president or his presidency and they feel this way. They watch this and say, you know what, this isn't fair. What happens now? I mean, what needs to happen now because then any outcome that's found by this panel isn't going to be trusted by the majority of people according to your numbers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, that's right. There's a 40 percent in this country who are anti-Trump no matter what; 40 percent that are pro-Trump almost no matter what; and that middle 20 percent. When I see numbers like 63 percent, that means the middle 20 percent has real questions here. And that means these are not just partisan issues, these are issues that are going to have been settled in this country, and somebody who's an adult is going to have to stand up, say so, and clean this operation on. MACCALLUM: Who do you think that should be?"

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. So, what he said was 40 percent are pro-Trump, 40 percent anti-Trump. There's 20 percent in the middle. When you get up to those with 60 percent numbers, that means that those people in the middle have questions, and questions about the investigation, question at this point about Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel. And to my mind, there's nothing new here. Of course, they're going to have questions. There's an ongoing effort by the Trump administration and by their surrogates on Capitol Hill to raise questions about everything that would suggest the relationship between Russia and the Trump campaign."

You know, they had two tactics, which could've got a document dump and put everything out there, but they've given us a stone wall. They won't provide witnesses, they won't provide documents, they won't provide the financial trail. And then, when they see it, Director Comey's story starts to break down. He said, no reasonable prosecutor would ever prosecute this. But in his own words, he was going to be grossly negligent, and they probably would've done that. The tarmac supposedly was the reason that the FBI was even doing this and making the statement in the first place. That story starts to totally break down. And to suggest, as Director Comey said, well, we didn't coordinate, we didn't talk to the Department of Justice at all. In their own notes, they talk about communicating with the office of general counsel, which I'd have to check, but I believe is part of the Department of Justice. So, why are we supposed to just believe everything when we're starting to find a huge conflict of interest? And people, the guy's wife works for the very institution that they were looking at. She was a fact witness."

      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Democrats would gain the house before they can the Senate. The Senate is much tougher because of the seats that are up. But in the House, Democrats need to flip net 24 seats. It doesn't sound like many in a House that's 435 members, but actually, it is because there are so few competitive districts. The districts have been drawn in most states in such a way that they're really not competitive. You don't really have contests that are even close. So, 24 seats, is a lot. This is a midterm election next November 2018 in a Republican administration. Normally, that means the out of party picks up a certain number of seats, I would say right now, the Democrats have a very good chance at maybe 15, 16 seats -- they need 24. We'll see what happens in the coming year. You never know whether President Trump's popularity will go up or down or stay the same. But it's doable for the Democrats, it's an uphill climb but it's less uphill than it was. And they're hoping the trend continues."

How do you see those factors playing in?"

The out-of-power-party tends to be energized at midterm elections, because they're A, B, C, D. Whatever has happened during the first two years of a presidential administration. And because they're energized, as we've seen in Alabama, as we've seen in Virginia, as we've seen actually in a couple of dozen state legislative and special congressional elections that have been held in 2017, Democrats are our doing themselves and turn out. That is, they're doing much better even if they lose the race, they're doing much better than you would expect them to do based on their normal performance in those state legislative or U.S. House district."

We don't know who the nominees are yet, so we'll have to wait, but that could be competitive. Look, you can have several other seats potentially becoming competitive. Some people mentioned Tennessee, which to me is a stretch, but it's possible. Strange things happen in politics. Let's keep in mind that Democrats have 10 seats with Democratic Senators coming up in a state that President Trump carried sometimes by 25 percent point. So, you have to look at both sides of it."

Marc, what are your thoughts on what Larry just said in those numbers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "I think it really depends on what happens in some of these Senate races. I mean, the reality is that Donald Trump doesn't have to have national approval ratings because there's no national election, there's no national Senate races. What matter in the key states that are up next year. And the fact is the Republicans, at least in the Senate, have a major advantage because there are ten Democrats running in states that Donald Trump won in 2016, including five that are running states that he won by double digits -- in some cases by 30 or 40 points. So, his approval ratings are very high in those states. So, if he really takes it -- what needs to do in the next year is abandon the Steve Bannon kamikaze mission of going after Republican incumbents and weakening your own party. Which we just saw fail miserably in Alabama, where Steve Bannon managed to elect a Democrat in a state that hasn't elected a Democrat since 1992. And state focusing on, specifically on those five vulnerable Democrats, because if he can beat those five of several of those five, he's going to expand his Senate majority. Then, he won't have to worry about, about some of these defections like Marco Rubio today or John McCain on the Obamacare vote, because he'll have a cushion. That's what he needs to do. MACCALLUM: All right. I want to get your thoughts on that Matt, but first I want to play this little sound bite. Because today, the president was touting his achievements in terms of cutting through regulations in this country -- he's eliminated, I think, ten for every new one.

And it's not new, we did it. The things he's cutting, some of them are very, very popular like allowing people not default on student loans when they've been defrauded shady colleges.

That pile of regulations he showed great there, they're like that's thousands of little fusion threads holding down job creators, holding down businesses that are trying to create jobs.

As a matter of policy, the president has said he wants to push back on Iran, but we don't have a strategy with specifics to do that. As an example, Iran is trampling all over Syria. They about own the country. The institute of the study of war has declared that Iran has established a land bridge now from Iran through Iraq, through Syria to Lebanon. That is something we should never have permitted to happen. Iran is trampling all over our political interests in Iraq. They've got 150,000 Shia militia, Martha, some of whom are on the border with Syria and Iraq, but who have undue influence in Iraq. We should be pushing back on that. And we should also be taking a stand to help Saudi Arabia with the problem they have in Yemen. But we don't have any of those specifics."

The president signed into law the FY18 national defense authorization act which brings us close to a $700 billion budget, approximately $100 billion plus up over Obama's budget, which is a huge down payment in rebuilding the military. Problem is that the budget caps are still there and the appropriators have to pass legislation and they have to remove those budget caps or it doesn't -- we don't fund $700 billion, we fund $549 billion, and that means no, I say no, military plus up. That's got to be done in the next couple of weeks. And they need Democratic support to do it.

But now, writer Hayden Frye has penned an opinion piece in USA Today detailing why Anakin Skywalker should have been removed from the Jedi order for sexually harassing Padme Amidala in \"Star Wars Episode II,\" or as Frye said, quote, \"while this may have happened a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, it deserves to be called out now. Frye then goes on to list his reasons, including that Skywalker was assigned to protect her, but aggressively pursued her. And because her life is in danger, Amidala has no way to flee her predator. \" It's clear Hayden Frye is writing satire, or is it? Because the subject matter has been front and center for months, and because the Me Too Movement has proven to be so powerful, many readers took Frye's piece as is. On twitter post read, quoting, is this satire? Please say this is satire. To which, Hayden Frye responded, it's supposed to be funny, but many didn't think it was funny, quote, the worst excuse of satire I have ever read in life and, usually, I'm pretty good on picking this up. Or this quote, I cannot tell parody from seriousness anymore. And this tweet kind of sums up the conundrum, quoting again, the satire illuminates how the current moment affects 2018 romance. Stalkers are creepy. No one from the notebook is adorable and noteworthy for his dogged pursuit of love. Although, nobody appears to be arguing that Harvey Weinstein and others simply had their noble intentions misunderstood, and the moral of Hayden Frye's satirical op-ed might have a serious take away when he notes the Jedi council inability to remove a toxic misogynistic predator from its ranks ultimately brings about its downfall.

      "utterance": "There you go. Today, the president and the first lady unveiled their official Christmas photo dress in black attire holding hands next to two snow-covered trees decked in bright gold lights. Remember, it was one of candidate Trump key campaign promises that we'll all going to say Merry Christmas again. But one place where they will not be saying Merry Christmas this year is Jesus' hometown of Nazareth. Local leaders are cancelling a number of the Christmas festivities. They blame President Trump for his decision to declare that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. They say that that has taken the joy out of all their celebrations, and it has annoyed the Palestinians. So joining us now, Pastor Robert Jeffress has met with the president couple of times this week, spent a fair amount of time with him and the first lady, and he's a Fox News contributor. Pastor, good to have you with us tonight."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "First of all, explain to us the irritation about the decision which is obvious -- obviously on the face of it, but this decision to remove the Christmas celebration from Nazareth is quite striking really when you think about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRESS",
      "utterance": "Well, really, Martha, this is a pretty good year for the Palestinians to skip celebrating Christmas because the historical account of the birth of Christ actually proves that the Palestinians are absolutely wrong and President Trump is absolutely right about Jerusalem. And here's why, in Luke's gospel it notes that Jesus was a descendant of King David. We know from history that David is the one who named Jerusalem as Israel capitals in 1,000 B.C. That's a full 1,100 years before the term Palestinians was invented by the Roman emperor Hadrian. And you know, Tuesday night at the White House Christmas party, President Trump asked me to say a few words before I closed in prayer, and I thanked President Trump for having the guts to do what no other U.S. president has been willing to do and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. President Trump is not only on the right side of history, he's on the right side of God."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Obviously, there some backlash in Nazareth, which I guess as you say it set to be expected. They don't like the origin of the Christmas story and the Christmas tradition. So, let me just take a look at a pew poll that we also found interesting, and I think that people who believe that Christmas is a Christian holiday will find it a little bit disheartening. Those who believe it's a religious holiday that has declined by 5 percent. Those who think it's a cultural holiday is now up to 33 percent. I guess, you know, we have our own materialism to thank for that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRESS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think so. Look, the tenancy of any culture that become more secular, and as that happens, unbelievers still in power to come out of the closet and share what they really believe or what they don't believe. But Martha, opinion polls don't change historical facts. The fact is, that we divide human history, we divide out calendars by the birth of Christ. Every time we type a right the year 2017 we're affirming it's been 2,017 years since the birth of the son of God."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRESS",
      "utterance": "Well, I would remind people that no matter what happened in the world, as the world gets darker and darker the light of the gospel of Jesus shines that's much more brightly. And we have so much to celebrate and that's what we can concentrate on this year."
