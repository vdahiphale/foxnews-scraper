Remember, none of these smarty pants saw the internet as an existential threat to dictionaries or even bother to look up the word in a dictionary. Yet here they are desperately competing for attention while the whole planet ignores them, which is why the Oxford Dictionaries picked Climate Emergency as its word of the year, even though I think it's two. Oxford said its use reflects the ethos, mood or preoccupations of the passing year. Translation: it's what rich elites do as they board planes for a holiday in France. I remember when dictionaries were awesome. They contained words, not the politics of pretentious editors. Now they're just like every other medium full of anxious social climbers straining for relevance. Unlike me, right, Greg? Existential. Existential, existential. Existential, existential. Existential.

Five o'clock in New York City, this is \"The Five.\" President Trump lighting up the world today as impeachment enters a new phase. The House Intelligence Committee expected to vote soon on Chairman Adam Schiff's newly released report. The GOP releasing their own prebuttal report, it says there's no evidence of an impeachable offense and warns that the Democrats are setting a dangerous precedent. Trump sounding off on all of this while he attends the NATO summit in London."

Proceeding with this circus knowing that there is a split in the country, that half the country's against it, yeah, it's unpatriotic because you know -- could it create widespread discontent, and perhaps, economic collapse? Yeah, I would say that's unpatriotic. So, you're pursuing all of this rather than participate in an election that you started, you started this process three years ago and it's all because you feel bad inside. You're putting your feelings before the country. That's unpatriotic."

So, to me, it's like you have two reports out today, Dana, one from the Republicans, one from the Democrats. And it's like alternate realities. It's like listening to me and Greg on this show.

And then you have the Democrats come out and they say this unbelievable, unprecedented obstruction of justice and obstruction of an impeachment process, telling people not to come testify before an equal branch of government, the Congress; keeping documents away from Congress. And we have a call log and that was the one thing that really struck me, the Republicans are really all about the political argument. The Democrats offer some factual base and saying here are call logs that demonstrate how Devin Nunes, who's the lead Republican on House Intel, was involved with Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer with the president, with Lev Parnas, this guy who's been indicted for financial campaign abuse."

It's urgent that they get it to the Judiciary Committee and they will continue to investigate even after it's handed over, while also admitting that they don't have all of the information, that they haven't interviewed key people that were named in this testimony who haven't spoken to him. And it's very clear that Schiff doesn't have the confidence to go through the court system to try and find out if he has the authority to haul people like Secretary Pompeo --"

We were promised high crimes and misdemeanors and Juan is talking about a call log. Come on, Juan. You went home to Thanksgiving. No one's talking about Ukraine. My liberal mother's not talking about Ukraine. The whole thing backfired. If you look at every single swing state, impeachment is now underwater. This unified Republicans more than it unified Democrats. Democrats are broke. The DNC has no money. Republicans are raising money like I'm not going to say it. They're raising a lot of money. And now they're trying to play all these tricks like they did with Kavanaugh. All of a sudden, Ambassador Sondland gets hit with not one, not two, but three sexual harassment allegations in the middle of all this. And you have Trump over there with Melania looking very striking, meeting with world leaders, fresh off killing Baghdadi and unifying NATO against the Russians. And then you have Adam Schiff passing this scam to little Jerry Nadler, who's supposed to carry it across the finish line. I just don't see how this thing is going to stick. And even swing state Democrats know it because they're whispering about ways to get out of having to vote for this now."

Something I think I coined. But one thing I want to say about watching Trump today in these meetings: his mantra is they owe us money, right? So, everything he does is on behalf -- he's like, he's our agent. He's America's agent in a meeting. And he's such a jerk, but he's our jerk. Did you see how we dealt with the Canadian -- ?"

Actually, you guys are paying -- but we're getting other people and we've done so much better. And NATO is going to fold. And he's like what is NATO for. Is it for terrorists or is it for Russians?

I read the New York Times article about her. She couldn't think of the name for her own memoir so she poll tested the name of her memoir. She literally poll tested herself.

Senators usually do not make presidential candidates, and they rarely win elections, or I think-- I don't know when the last time was. And if you look at this field, you have a lot of senators. And she managed a terrible campaign. There was so much dissent on the campaign that in the last like six weeks, maybe even eight weeks, there were articles from within the campaign of people saying that they were very unhappy.

She was using it as a way to go after Trump. But when she was pressed on it, she could never explain why she did the things that she did. She was a follower, not a leader. She got very insecure with her positions. I remember watching her in that series of town halls that CNN did, and Bernie Sanders came out first in the hour before her and said that felons, including prisoners, should be able to vote from prison, including the Boston Bomber.

Yet here they are desperately competing for attention while the whole planet ignores them, which is why the Oxford Dictionaries picked Climate Emergency as its word of the year, even though I think it's two. Oxford said its use reflects the ethos, mood or preoccupations of the passing year. Translation: it's what rich elites do as they board planes for a holiday in France. I remember when dictionaries were awesome. They contained words, not the politics of pretentious editors. Now they're just like every other medium full of anxious social climbers straining for relevance. Unlike me, right, Greg? Existential. Existential, existential. Existential, existential. Existential.
