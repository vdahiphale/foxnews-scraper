And the Russians, by the way, continue to defend that deadly hospital strikes, saying it wasn't deliberate, but it precedes attacks on at least 18 other hospitals prior. The World Health Organization, like many of our guests, are saying that might be a conservative number of hospitals. But between that and ongoing power outages at the old Chernobyl nuclear plant, that the Russians came with 1,500 feet of taking out the reactor, add to the worry that the longer this drags on the more desperate and evil Vladimir Putin gets. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World\" on top of fast-moving developments, including reaction from NATO allies and exactly what we plan to do now with an aid package that is meant to get emergency aid to the Ukrainians ASAP, but ASAP for the Ukrainians is like right now. And a lot of that isn't going to happen right now. We have got your covered with Trey Yingst in Kyiv, Ukraine, Jennifer Griffin with a read from the Pentagon. We begin with Trey -- Trey.",

Over the past 24 hours, we have seen explosions on the horizon, seen Ukraine's anti-aircraft system in play, and also air raid sirens sounding throughout the capital city. The war is getting closer and closer to this city with a population of nearly three million people, though the mayor of Kyiv, he says, today, about half of the city's residents have left since the war began. Staying in the city is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who spoke directly to Russian soldiers who invaded his country. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): They want us to feel like animals because they blocked our cities, the biggest cities in Ukraine. And they blocked -- and because they don't want our people to get some food, water.",

At least 17 others were wounded in that attack. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has called the attack a war crime. And as you can see from that video, there is indeed evidence that a crime was committed against a civilian population in the southern city. The deputy mayor of Mariupol detailed other disturbing actions by the Russian since the invasion began, saying more than 1,200 people have been killed, with dozens buried in mass graves. With no time to bury the dead, these lifeless bodies are just thrown into the ground. It's gut-wrenching, but it's a reminder of the brutality being inflicted on the civilian population here. This comes as Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today alongside the president of Poland. And she really made clear the Biden administration does support an investigation into war crimes.

Also, remember, NATO ally Turkey sold armed drones to Ukraine and delivered them just before the Russian invasion, much to Moscow's dismay. These drones have been very effective. The way that the Ukrainian armed forces have organized themselves with the anti-tank Javelins and kept their air defenses intact, so Russia cannot for the most part use its air force has been the biggest factor so far in stopping the Russian military. The MiGs, I'm told, Neil, have not necessarily been maintained and would require some work. Remember, Ukraine still has most of its warplanes intact, several squadrons, I'm told. If Poland wants to provide the MiGs to Ukraine, U.S. -- the U.S. will not stand in its way.

There has -- there was concern, because of some reports out of Moscow, some words being stated by a spokesman, a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Moscow, about the concern about the U.S. and Ukraine using biological or chemical weapons. What intelligence officials here in the U.S. have said is, that is an old Russian play to say something that, in fact, they are planning to do. So what those intelligence officials have said is, we need to be on the lookout for this. Remember, the Russians have allowed forces to use chemical weapons in Syria. So there is a great deal of tension right now, as Russian forces face conventional problems on the ground, those tank columns getting blown up. The concern by U.S. officials is that Putin will go to more dramatic means of killing civilians, whether it's bio or chem weapons or using a nuclear weapon, God forbid. He has 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons in his arsenal, and a doctrine that says that you can use them on the battlefield. So that's the concern. There's no evidence right now that any chemical weapons are being moved into Ukraine. But there's also a lot of Russian disinformation about trying to blame the U.S. and Ukraine for having those weapons. That is not true. And that is Russian disinformation.",

And I think if he -- for the life of me, I don't know why we're letting Putin put fear in us, when we should be putting fear in Putin by that -- we're not -- we're not moving the fighters into Ukraine. Why? Because we fear Putin may escalate. We should be telling him unequivocally what our concerns are, and drive this thing in the right direction. Certainly, the world is not going to tolerate the use of chemical weapons or nuclear weapons, for that matter. And I cannot fathom the thought that Putin, who is struggling here way beyond anything thing he imagined -- his forces are two weeks in here, and they still haven't taken a major city. And they have -- by anybody's definition now, they're starting to experience heavy casualties.

And then this is a combined arms fight that they're in. And the basic functions, they're failing at all three. One is, you have to have reconnaissance. Where is the enemy?

And that's the approach Americans have to take right now; 60 percent of drivers said that they would change their driving habits if the price rose above $4 a gallon. And, well, we are way over that. Some of these drivers here at this Costco have been waiting over 30 minutes to fill up. But it's not a surprise that people are willing to wait, when you consider that gas is up around 60 cents from just a week ago and up a $1.50 from a year ago. Now, you do obviously have to get a membership to be able to afford -- or to be able to buy this gas. I ran the numbers for you though, Neil. So a membership at Costco is $60. If you have a small car, that's about 17 trips to this pump to make up the cost of $60. A lot of the people I spoke to, they get the membership for the bulk deals.

And the Russians, of course, hope that, at some point, somebody will say, OK, for the love of God, please stop this killing, we will do anything. And I think that's what they're aiming for. Fortunately, the West is sticking together. President Zelenskyy, I think, has inspired the entire globe, with his personal courage and leadership, but it's not just him.

Now, the Chinese are tough bargainers with us, but they're also tough bargainers with anybody they're doing business with, particularly if Russia is in a crisis moment and doesn't have very many other options.

But my guess is that Russia is not going to be nearly as happy with that economic relationship as they might be with the public relationship. And we will see. I think what happened was, one, Putin was watching Ukraine become much more focused on the West after the terrible behavior starting in 2014 with Crimea in the western part -- in the eastern part of the country. Two, I think, after Afghanistan, he thought there was an opportunity here, that we were not the kind of adversary that we might have been in the past. And, three, I think he thought the Chinese would bail him out of sanctions that probably wouldn't approach the sanctions that he's now facing. So, on all three counts, he's turned out to be pretty dramatically wrong. It doesn't mean the Russians won't eventually, for some period of time, be able to prevail in the military fight. But I don't think they're going to be able to prevail in any kind of real conquest of the Ukrainian people. And the Ukrainian people are showing that every minute of every day, led by President Zelenskyy, who has responded in a way that has to be inspiring to the whole world.",

And the Russians, by the way, continue to defend that deadly hospital strikes, saying it wasn't deliberate, but it precedes attacks on at least 18 other hospitals prior. The World Health Organization, like many of our guests, are saying that might be a conservative number of hospitals. But between that and ongoing power outages at the old Chernobyl nuclear plant, that the Russians came with 1,500 feet of taking out the reactor, add to the worry that the longer this drags on the more desperate and evil Vladimir Putin gets. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.

The war is getting closer and closer to this city with a population of nearly three million people, though the mayor of Kyiv, he says, today, about half of the city's residents have left since the war began.

And as you can see from that video, there is indeed evidence that a crime was committed against a civilian population in the southern city. The deputy mayor of Mariupol detailed other disturbing actions by the Russian since the invasion began, saying more than 1,200 people have been killed, with dozens buried in mass graves. With no time to bury the dead, these lifeless bodies are just thrown into the ground. It's gut-wrenching, but it's a reminder of the brutality being inflicted on the civilian population here. This comes as Vice President Kamala Harris spoke today alongside the president of Poland. And she really made clear the Biden administration does support an investigation into war crimes.

Therefore, we assess that the overall gain is low.\" Take a look at this extraordinary scene of Ukraine's forces ambushing a column of Russian tanks about 14 miles northeast of the capital, Kyiv, using shoulder-fired weapons. Also, remember, NATO ally Turkey sold armed drones to Ukraine and delivered them just before the Russian invasion, much to Moscow's dismay. These drones have been very effective. The way that the Ukrainian armed forces have organized themselves with the anti-tank Javelins and kept their air defenses intact, so Russia cannot for the most part use its air force has been the biggest factor so far in stopping the Russian military. The MiGs, I'm told, Neil, have not necessarily been maintained and would require some work. Remember, Ukraine still has most of its warplanes intact, several squadrons, I'm told. If Poland wants to provide the MiGs to Ukraine, U.S. -- the U.S. will not stand in its way.

There has -- there was concern, because of some reports out of Moscow, some words being stated by a spokesman, a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Moscow, about the concern about the U.S. and Ukraine using biological or chemical weapons. What intelligence officials here in the U.S. have said is, that is an old Russian play to say something that, in fact, they are planning to do. So what those intelligence officials have said is, we need to be on the lookout for this. Remember, the Russians have allowed forces to use chemical weapons in Syria. So there is a great deal of tension right now, as Russian forces face conventional problems on the ground, those tank columns getting blown up. The concern by U.S. officials is that Putin will go to more dramatic means of killing civilians, whether it's bio or chem weapons or using a nuclear weapon, God forbid. He has 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons in his arsenal, and a doctrine that says that you can use them on the battlefield. So that's the concern. There's no evidence right now that any chemical weapons are being moved into Ukraine. But there's also a lot of Russian disinformation about trying to blame the U.S. and Ukraine for having those weapons. That is not true. And that is Russian disinformation."

      "utterance": "Well, if he does, I mean, he's just changed the whole war. I mean, NATO will have to get involved in the war if he's using chemical weapons. I cannot imagine us standing by and letting that happen. After all, we did respond when Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons twice during the Trump administration. We failed to respond during the Biden administration. And I think if he -- for the life of me, I don't know why we're letting Putin put fear in us, when we should be putting fear in Putin by that -- we're not -- we're not moving the fighters into Ukraine. Why? Because we fear Putin may escalate. We should be telling him unequivocally what our concerns are, and drive this thing in the right direction. Certainly, the world is not going to tolerate the use of chemical weapons or nuclear weapons, for that matter. And I cannot fathom the thought that Putin, who is struggling here way beyond anything thing he imagined -- his forces are two weeks in here, and they still haven't taken a major city. And they have -- by anybody's definition now, they're starting to experience heavy casualties. That somehow he would -- he would ignite chemical weapons, and involve NATO in a war that he's struggling with in one country, much less deal with 30 countries who outnumber him four to five to one, makes -- doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I don't know what we're afraid of, to be frank about it, Neil."

He's -- listen, I think Putin -- after all the great work the administration has done, Neil, to get unification with NATO, and that NATO is actually strengthening itself as a result of it, and was displaying the best unity I have seen in 20-plus years, and then we make this lame decision not to give the Ukrainians 24 fighters because, somehow, that is going to escalate the war, I mean, that is Putin putting fear in us. And it's lame, as far as I'm concerned. And I think we have to show a little bit more spine in standing up to this guy. And yes.."

When we're weak like that, when we show that we're intimidated because likely somebody in Russia said that's going to be an act of war if you do something like that, they probably told the Poles that, when we're intimidated like that, what does that really invite? It invites more intimidation and coercion. It puts the -- it makes the situation actually more dangerous, because you he take, what, the next step, possibly chemical weapons, because he thinks NATO won't respond? That's what a weakness sounds like. And it makes the situation more grave."

What do you think?"

    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Putin had that on -- in his mind. He was going to showcase a professionalized military. After crushing Ukraine, he would use the intimidation of that to further his goals. What he's actually showing us here is an organization that is fundamentally flawed. They have leadership issues. They are very centralized. There's no flexibility at the tactical level. People at the senior level of calling all the shots. They have organizational capability problems. And then this is a combined arms fight that they're in. And the basic functions, they're failing at all three. One is, you have to have reconnaissance. Where is the enemy? Send a reconnaissance unit forward to identify where the enemy is, aerial, ground reconnaissance. Not effective. Combined arms main body moving down a road. You see that road there that we all saw? If you're moving down that road with tanks, there is danger area on both sides building. Where is the infantry out protecting those tanks going down the road, if you have to be on the road? I wouldn't want to be on that road to begin with. And then their logistics are all fouled up. They're not protecting their logistics, and they're not timely enough sustain the main body and the reconnaissance units that are forward of them. These are the major functions of a combined arms army on the move, and they are failing at all three of those major functions."

Gas up 38 percent since last year, fuel oil up 43.6 percent since last year, neither one of those figures is fully factoring in the disruption caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine two weeks ago.

These places are membership stores, but they offer a discount to their customers, the Costco that I'm at here selling gas for $4.14. That is well below the national average of $4.32 per gallon. And we're in New Jersey. The state average for regular gas is $4.38. All of that means that people are willing to wait in long lines to get to this gas station. So, taking a look at these lines, Neil, I have been here since 9:00 a.m. this morning. It has never been less than 50 cars waiting to fill up here. We have actually seen three oil tankers come through and refill over the course of the day. People are willing to wait because of that spike that we have really seen. Normally ,if you go to Costco or Sam's Club, you're used to seeing these kind of lines on the weekend. But with the skyrocketing price, people are making getting gas here during the week even a priority."

When I know I'm running a little lower, and I have to make the money last, I will come to Costco, and I will try to get everything here in one shot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALWORTH",
      "utterance": "So, Carlos, who you just heard from, like he said, some -- something has to be cut to make the gas. He was telling me after that that his approach is, he comes here, fills up his gas first, and then whatever he has left in his budget after filling the tank is what he then uses to go inside and buy food. And that's the approach Americans have to take right now; 60 percent of drivers said that they would change their driving habits if the price rose above $4 a gallon. And, well, we are way over that. Some of these drivers here at this Costco have been waiting over 30 minutes to fill up. But it's not a surprise that people are willing to wait, when you consider that gas is up around 60 cents from just a week ago and up a $1.50 from a year ago. Now, you do obviously have to get a membership to be able to afford -- or to be able to buy this gas. I ran the numbers for you though, Neil. So a membership at Costco is $60. If you have a small car, that's about 17 trips to this pump to make up the cost of $60. A lot of the people I spoke to, they get the membership for the bulk deals. Who doesn't love a pound of peanut butter? But they say now this gas benefit is really valuable at this time -- Neil."

In fact, the only reason we got to break in oil prices today was because Vladimir Putin said that he would be more than graciously selling oil to unfriendly countries and fulfilling contracts. I guess that happens when you need cash. You will continue to sell oil. Still, a lot of people don't trust him. If Putin pulls the oil weapon, Neil, we could see these prices go up at least another dollar a gallon. So let's hope and pray that doesn't happen as well."

And I'm afraid that if supplies get cut off from Russia, that's the only way we're going to stop this price increase. There were a lot of steps that the Biden administration could have taken early in their administration to avoid this scenario. They could have opened up the taps, had the Keystone pipeline up and running, instead of discouraging energy production, encouraging energy production. But that hasn't happened. And so now it's almost too late to turn back the clock. It can be done, but we're going to have to change policies immediately to cool off these red hot prices, or I'm afraid that the high prices are going to go up until they break the camel's back."

In Mariupol alone, what we have learned is that they're back to doing it again after the horrors of yesterday and trying to take out this hospital, 18th time we have seen a hospital targeted.

We actually do know and we are fully aware that the Russian army now realizes it cannot really fight against the Ukrainian army, given that the Ukrainian army is -- actually turned out to be so much stronger than the Russian army on the ground. And that is why they have given direct orders to target civilians. That is what we are seeing with the emigration corridors. They have been specifically targeting people trying to escape from -- for -- running for their lives. And those were mainly children and families with children or with older people, disabled people. They were specifically targeting them. I read this report by a man who said that he was trying to escape with his family. And then he saw a bomb going into his direction. And then he saw two of his children up in the air, and then both died. And then his wife was wounded. And she died a couple hours later. And that is what they're doing, that they're specifically doing. They're targeting the civilians. And then this -- yesterday's attack on the hospital, well, we heard this incomprehensible, unthinkable lie on the side of the Russian minister of foreign affairs, Lavrov, claiming that there were some Nazi groups or whatever in that hospital. But I believe the whole world did see the pictures of pregnant women trying to escape from that building after it was bombarded from air by Russians. They're doing it on purpose. They're doing it in order to threaten, and they're doing it with a clear message, which they will continue to be doing that, unless someone is stopping us."

But your fellow Ukrainians are saying that the Russians simply don't keep their word and that their demands are so over the top, for example, that Ukraine must go ahead and surrender to Russian control, that they're bound to go nowhere. Do Ukrainians hope that that posture changes, or they have just given up, that the peace talks are more a mirage than anything else?"

      "speaker": "SOVSUN",
      "utterance": "Well, the peace talks are there. But let's be honest, there is very little room for compromise, because, as the situation is, it's the following. The Russians want us dead, and we want to stay alive. There is no real compromise on those. You can either be dead or alive. There is very little room for debating about that. So, no, we are extremely skeptical about them, potential talks in the future, and particularly because the Russians are putting demands that are just unthinkable. They want us to surrender, which is making no sense, just because, to begin with, we are fighting for our country. It's not possible for someone to say that, oh, you just have to surrender because we have come here and we have bombarded your cities, so now you have to do what we tell you to do. That is not acceptable to us. And that shouldn't be acceptable to the world community overall, actually, and then also, because the Ukrainian army is actually winning on the ground, despite the Russians did make some progress towards the biggest cities, still, for Kyiv or Kharkiv, and, of course, they're holding a blockade of Mariupol. But they're not really able to proceed any further, because the Ukrainian army is actually fighting back very, very hard. And just yesterday evening, we did have a very, well, good evening for the Ukrainian army, because they pushed Russians further on the northeast of Kyiv. So, of course, those talks are there, but the Russians are just -- yes, the demands there they are announcing are unthinkable. And, also, it's -- it makes no sense to make a deal with people who are just liars. Whenever a Russian official is opening up his or her mouth, they are about to tell a lie. So, making deals with people who are just lying all the time is just making no sense."

About 50 percent of Russia's overall combat power from the entire army is already committed to this fight. And, of course, as you know, there's a huge difference between big numbers and quality. And what we're discovering is that Russian armed forces are not nearly as good as we thought they were. Certainly, I overestimated their capability. They don't have the -- they don't demonstrate the experience or training that you would expect from a modern force. And they don't have what we have, the secret sauce, which is sergeants, noncommissioned officers, which enforce discipline, make sure people are taking care of the vehicles. So, what you're seeing are everyday examples of lack of discipline, lack of training, and lack of will. On the other side, Ukrainians have endless heart. And they're defending their homeland.

The Russians have switched their approach to a war of attrition, where they're smashing cities, they're deliberately targeting innocent civilians. And the whole purpose of this, of course, is to not only just wreck Ukraine as a country, but to put millions of refugees on the road, headed towards Europe, towards Western Europe. This places gigantic pressure on the Zelenskyy government, but also on other governments of Europe and on the United States, because people are watching video every day of these horrible scenes of hospitals and kids and pregnant women and that sort of destruction. And the Russians, of course, hope that, at some point, somebody will say, OK, for the love of God, please stop this killing, we will do anything. And I think that's what they're aiming for. Fortunately, the West is sticking together. President Zelenskyy, I think, has inspired the entire globe, with his personal courage and leadership, but it's not just him. For the Russians, they have made a terrible choice. Not only does the whole world -- is the whole world against them, but if you're going to go with an attrition strategy, you have to have unlimited time, unlimited people ,and unlimited resources. They don't have any of those. The sanctions are going to start taking effect here in the coming weeks and months. So they're going to run out of time. They don't have enough ammunition. None of us has enough ammunition. In wartime, you always consume more ammunition than you ever imagined you would, and especially what the Russians are doing now, expending all of this artillery and rockets on cities. It consumes a lot. And they can't replace it. And they have a manpower shortage. They are short of people."

We did hear yesterday that said the friendship with Russia is rock-solid. And we have heard that they have been looking to buy some Russian energy and commodities firms, but, beyond that, very, very little out of Beijing. The significance of that right now with Senator Roy Blunt, who is pressing intelligence officials on what, if anything, they know about China and what it's doing these days. Senator, good to see you. I guess we -- there's an understanding in Russia, between it and China, that, as the world closes off markets for Russian oil, the Chinese are there. That won't make up for nearly all the Russian oil that will be frozen in those markets. But should we sanction China or go after China if it were to do that?"
    },

      "speaker": "SEN. ROY BLUNT (R-MO)",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we have to wait and see on that topic. But what I asked today I asked Ambassador Burns, the head of the CIA, and I maybe followed up with a couple of other questions on that, is, what's China thinking about this new partnership that they have so publicly entered into with Russia? And I think there's every reason to believe, while they're there, they're probably there with some regret. And before it's over, the Russians may have some regret. The last time the Russians were counting on the Chinese, the Chinese drove an incredibly hard bargain. And I think we should anticipate that's likely to happen again. Now, the Chinese are tough bargainers with us, but they're also tough bargainers with anybody they're doing business with, particularly if Russia is in a crisis moment and doesn't have very many other options. And, quickly, the Western world including us, is eliminating a lot of those options that Russians have, while -- as Mike Tobin was just talking about, while the Ukrainian people are fighting back in every way they can think of, in a way that surprised the world. And I'm sure it surprised Vladimir Putin. I also suspect it surprised the Chinese, who should be looking at freedom- loving people in Taiwan right now and wondering what they would do if they're attacked in anything similar to this kind of aggressive way."

And this co-relationship, whatever you want to call it, takes on a very different form, where Russia takes a backseat to China, and is pretty much on the hook to China."

But my guess is that Russia is not going to be nearly as happy with that economic relationship as they might be with the public relationship. And we will see. I think what happened was, one, Putin was watching Ukraine become much more focused on the West after the terrible behavior starting in 2014 with Crimea in the western part -- in the eastern part of the country. Two, I think, after Afghanistan, he thought there was an opportunity here, that we were not the kind of adversary that we might have been in the past. And, three, I think he thought the Chinese would bail him out of sanctions that probably wouldn't approach the sanctions that he's now facing. So, on all three counts, he's turned out to be pretty dramatically wrong. It doesn't mean the Russians won't eventually, for some period of time, be able to prevail in the military fight. But I don't think they're going to be able to prevail in any kind of real conquest of the Ukrainian people. And the Ukrainian people are showing that every minute of every day, led by President Zelenskyy, who has responded in a way that has to be inspiring to the whole world."

Would it be -- would it be tactical nuclear weapons of some kind used in the field? Would it be biological and chemical weapons? You would hope that that would involve the world in a new way.
