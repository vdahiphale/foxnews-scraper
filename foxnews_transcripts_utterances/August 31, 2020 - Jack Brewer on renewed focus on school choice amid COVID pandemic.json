Joe Biden saying that he hoped that he would be able to go to Wisconsin to address the violence after the death of Jacob Blake. He has spoken with Blake's parents and told MSNBC, if I were president, I would be going, but that he didn't want to become part of the problem there.

And it comes after we have seen some polls that show that the tide is turning on how people are looking at these protests. Some of these protests have turned into riots. And take a look at these numbers. Do you approve or disapprove? I'm sorry - do you approve or disapprove of the mass protests that have been held since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } In June, 61 percent approved.

Unfortunately, we lost him a couple years ago, but it's really fitting and nice to finally have a chance to come and see a place where a lot of the stories and things that I was told as a kid of his time in the navy happened.

I'm a retired Delta Airlines captain. And my T28 Trojan I had for seven years is my hobby. And it was made in 1954 a U.S. Navy trainer.

And that follows Governor Evers, the same governor who recently backed down and gave in to the offer from the federal government to come in and help them with the violence there, which seems to have worked so far. Joe Biden saying that he hoped that he would be able to go to Wisconsin to address the violence after the death of Jacob Blake. He has spoken with Blake's parents and told MSNBC, if I were president, I would be going, but that he didn't want to become part of the problem there. So, here now on all of this, Mercedes Schlapp, Senior Adviser to the Trump Campaign, Marie Harf, former State Department spokesperson for the Obama - Biden administration and a Fox News Contributor. Welcome to both of you. Great to have you both with us this evening. So, Marie, obviously, we heard a very strong, forceful change of tone today from Joe Biden. And it comes after we have seen some polls that show that the tide is turning on how people are looking at these protests. Some of these protests have turned into riots. And take a look at these numbers. Do you approve or disapprove? I'm sorry - do you approve or disapprove of the mass protests that have been held since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In June, 61 percent approved. In August, only 48 percent approved. And these are Wisconsin voters. So, is this why we are seeing a very dramatic change in tone from Mr. Biden?"

And he pointed out quite rightly, the President Trump will not condemn all violence. He was asked again tonight at the press briefing at the White House if he would condemn his supporter, a Right-wing activist who murdered two people last week. And he defended him, Martha. And that's the contrast here. Donald Trump refuses to condemn Right-wing violence, and Joe Biden--"

And so, I think what we need to deal with here is the fact that for Joe Biden, it's taken him a long time to even talk about these rights. In fact, he talked about the rights and calling them peaceful protest. And he also talked about the fact attacking our law enforcement, saying that they stoke the fires of division. So, it is truly because Joe Biden listens to these Left-wing agitators that are destroying these cities, not going and talking to the mayor in Portland or the governor in Portland and saying, look, take this federal assistance, deploy the National Guard, ensure that we have peace in our streets. That's not--"

With regard to Kyle Rittenhouse and I spoke just a few minutes ago to Senator Rand Paul, and everybody will hear that interview in just a moment. But he said, I asked him about that case, and we don't know what happened in that case. And I think that's all anybody should be saying at this point about that case, because it's under investigation. We don't know if Kyle Rittenhouse will be found guilty in those murders or not. But what Rand Paul said was, no, you cannot walk down the streets with a rifle as a private citizen in the middle of these situations, what you should do is stay away from these places. So, why did we not hear that from the president?"

He's basically looking at his polls. He's looking at the fact that he has weak leadership on this issue and now deciding to talk about the rioters that shouldn't riot. But again, it was Joe Biden who called these rioters peaceful protesters. These are Left-wing agitators. Their job is to riot. Their job is to loot. Their job is to destroy. And the president has stood on the side of these small business owners, many of them minorities, that they have burned down, burned down."

Joe Biden was clear today, Martha. He condemned all violence. He also said that most cops are very good people and that he could bring people together to talk about this. But Donald Trump every single day on Twitter incites his base and his supporters to take up vigilante justice. We saw him do it all over the last week. He is inciting violence and division every single day. And nothing Joe Biden said today could be called radical. He said, I want to be president for all Americans. I want to talk about racial justice. I want to talk about policing. I know police, most of them are good people, but I condemn violence."

Now, Senator Rand Paul is among many who are demanding answers about who exactly is organizing and supporting these protesters, backing, and writing in an op ed, who are these people? Who paid for their hotel rooms? Who flew them in? Law enforcement needs to look at the funding of violent criminal activity like this, and national Democrats need to confront it. It's organized, it's paid for. It's violent. It is not about black lives or any lives. It's about anarchy and destruction, writes Rand Paul.

      "utterance": "Well, and this is the same thing we ran into and, you know, I have a certain amount of notoriety, but we showed up on the corner and once someone yelled, it's Rand Paul, we've got him trapped. Then it went from a dozen to two dozen to three dozen. The crowd got bigger and bigger, but the crowd also kept pressing in. And we fortunately got to a corner where there were a couple of policemen, but we were just all sort of getting crowded and crowded and crowded, people pushing and shoving. And I really was uncertain whether the police had enough people to actually repel if it became a full-scale attack. And I said to the policeman, they know who I am. You need reinforcements. He radioed for reinforcements. But I think we still stood there for 10 or 15 minutes with the crowd closing in on us. And I firmly believe that the police had not been there. We would have been drugged to the pavement. We would have been kicked and stomped until we were bleeding from our ears like the people in Portland and in other places. This is something that we should stop. And at the very least, you should be arrested for disorderly conduct. You should be arrested for not letting people move. There's got to be a crime here inciting a riot. But I know you can't put these people away forever, but they need to be arrested so we can find out who's funding them, how they're getting there. They're staying in 600 to $1000 a night hotel. They have plane flights to come here. Some of the people we picked out in the footage that were attacking us are from other cities and we can see them in riots in other cities. So, we're now seeing that the people are being flown from Portland to Minneapolis to D.C. for these riots. And it is not your First Amendment to trap people, terrorize them and threaten to kill them and call them all kinds of awful names. That is not your First Amendment right. That is not in the Constitution."

And this video is also made a lot of you know, people watch it a lot as it has been replayed. And then you see her in another video. She also shows up in in your video, and that's just around the block. But it's interesting to me that that these same people are confronting all these different folks. But you've raised a lot of questions here about who's funding them. I don't know what hotel they stayed. And maybe you have done some digging into that. But what are some of the answers to those questions, do you think? Who is funding them?"

We should look at who paid for the hotels. We should subpoena airline records. Now, I'm not talking about randomly. I'm talking about for people who are accused of a crime that we have evidence that they've been committing a crime. And I think it is a crime to incite a riot. It is a crime to threaten people. It's a crime to surround people and tell them they can't move anywhere. This is not a First Amendment. Look, if it were a rally to be against no knock raids, I have a bill called the Breonna Taylor bill, I'm actually for - get it for reforms of this where we don't do no knock raids in the middle of the night, and yet they're attacking me. So, these people are so clueless and such idiots, they're out there for violence and they're out there for mayhem, but they aren't out there for reform. Look, I've been a part of protests my whole life, protest against big government or protests against this. But we go and we have speeches and we talk about it and then we knock on the door and we lobby Congress. But you don't try to kill people. You don't kick people on the head in the street.

So, The Wall Street Journal calling school choice a major issue in the battle for the White House, echoing the president's call that this is the civil rights issue of our time. Jack Brewer says minority parents in America are waking up to this as an issue that is of great importance to their families, to their children. He joins us next."

      "utterance": "At some point, for the sake of our children, the policies must take priority over the personalities. So, because you have an issue with President Trump's tone, you're going to allow Biden and Harris to deny our undeserved black and brown children school choice."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "There has never been a bigger embrace of giving parents the opportunity to choose which school they want to send their children to and making their tax dollars portable to meet their decision, whether it be public or private or religious. Any of those choices. Now, COVID-19 has heightened this issue because a lot of parents are teaching from home and they're becoming better acquainted than ever with what their kids are learning and what they're not being taught in school. So, The Wall Street Journal wrote a very powerful piece on this today. And part of that piece says this, parents are also discovering the woke political bias that passes for education in too many schools. In Philadelphia, a public-school teacher tweeted his concern that conservative parents listening in are my chief concern. School choice is the real civil rights issue of our time, and the GOP deserves credit for making it a marquee part of its 2020 agenda goes on to write The Wall Street Journal editorial board. Joining me now, Jack Brewer, CEO of the Brewer Group, and a former NFL player. Jack, always good to talk to you. Thank you for being here tonight."

And you know, the sad thing about it is that our public schools have just not been able to adequately keep up with the real issues that are facing the kids that go to school there. You look at underserved youth. And you look at places whether it's Detroit or Baltimore. You have proficiency levels for kids and math proficiency levels that are worse than third world countries."

Well, Martha, 71 percent of those dropouts are fatherless. So, these public schools have just not been able to keep up with the fatherlessness crisis that we have going on in our country because they are so liberal and they try to be so forgiving to every segment of the population that they don't put discipline in these kids anymore. Your kids can't go to a public school and have real discipline. Everyone wins. You don't have anyone there that's bridging that gap for these fatherless babies. That is the real issue."

You got to throw more money at the schools. But that's not true because some of these areas that are serving the children the least are spending the most per capita on these students.

That's what we really need to do. We need to bring the paddle back, start bringing discipline back in our schools. And Joe Biden is a scary man and America should be really hesitant to see what he is doing. Because for a person to come and stand against school choice, that's evil."

And I know that during the Obama administration they really cut back a lot on, you know, suspending kids and all of that. That cut way back on it. We did see it makes a difference in terms of discipline in the school. So, always good to hear your opinion, sir."

And what they decided is they do not want the economy shut down. It was a clear flatline there. You could see that big drop. And it's not because they don't care and it's not because they are not invested in the virus. It's because they're concerned about their jobs, the economy, about their kids and their education. It can't just be a shut down. People are really afraid if that happen again. People need to know that there's going to be a plan in place for all those things to continue."

You can see that even though undecided voters aren't exactly like Trump supporters, they do line up just a little bit more within than they did with the Democrats. And here's why. People are really tired of all of the shaming that's happening right now. People are tired of racial injustice. Most people will say that it's enough is enough and we need to do better. But to call ourselves a racist country, to say that if you support Trump, you are a racist, it is something that people simply reject."

They need to get their message out there because right now, they are not defined on what their message is. Only one-third of voters out there say they know what Joe Biden's America looks like. Two-thirds say they know it's not Donald Trump and that's important enough. But one-third of voters out there want to hear more so he is going to make his case and get it out there."

In just 14 days, they worked day and night with state and local police in Georgia. They rescued 39 missing or endangered children. Now safe and sound, thanks to Operation not Forgotten. The minors ranged in age from 3 to 17 years old. Nearly half are believed to be victims of sex trafficking and now dozens of adults are facing related charges. My next guest is helping to place many of those child victims in rehab programs. Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr joins me now. Attorney General Carr, thank you for being here. This is a remarkable operation and I'm glad that you are here tonight. Tell us who these children are. What was their situation?"

This was a great partnership led by the U.S. marshals, the FBI, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, our human trafficking prosecutions unit, and local law enforcement as well rescued 39 children, children that were at risk. Children that have been suspected victims of sex trafficking, exploitation, sexual abuse, physical abuse, had emotional mental health issues. Physical health issues as well. They were at risk. But this is what you get when you have partnerships, people that care. This issue is an important issue. I have yet to meet the person that is pro- human trafficking. So, for us to be able to come together, bring these children, 39 children who will have their lives changed as a result of this operation."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I know your -- the agent said that some of the kids were too afraid to go with the agents at first. And that that can be a sign that they have been abused and that they, you know, are obviously too scared. They don't know if someone is going to help them or hurt them, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARR",

We have an intake facility that Wellspring, which is a nonprofit, helps get those children the wraparound services they need. Because when you think of the average age of a human trafficking victims are 12 to 14-year-old girl it's not just girls. But think of the age that they are in and the vulnerability of that age group. There can be education needs, healthcare needs, all different kind of needs. So, it's important to evaluate and get the help that those victims, those children absolutely need."

And that's why the preparation that went into this operation with our partners, again, the marshals service, our officers, human trafficking prosecutions unit, the GBI, the FBI, the agencies. It was critically important. Because we know they don't take time off. We know they haven't stopped as a result of COVID-19. And that's just another layer of needs that these children have. And I'm just so proud of the role that our team played, this operation played. It was just great to be a part of it."

But even then, I saw the backs of the Japanese as all of the faces of the representatives of (Inaudible) allied nations. TONY VERICELLA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, 75TH WWII COMMEMORATION: The significance of it is just overwhelmingly powerful. Here is also a connection back to September 2nd, 1945 when there were about 800 aircraft flying over Tokyo Bay and over the USS Missouri where the ceremony was really occurring. DARRYLL WONG, 75TH COMMEMORATION COMMITTEE: The enthusiasm of the pilots and the crews that are coming here it took a lot of effort. But they want to make sure that people in a way saw whether some of the bird war that flew out here in the Pacific. DUSTIN MOSHER, OWNER & PILOT OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT: For me personally, my grandfather was a World War II aviator, navy aviator in the last several years of World War II. And of course, flew (Inaudible) is part of his primary training. So, it's really a moving thing to be back here where he was all these years ago. Unfortunately, we lost him a couple years ago, but it's really fitting and nice to finally have a chance to come and see a place where a lot of the stories and things that I was told as a kid of his time in the navy happened.

I'm a retired Delta Airlines captain. And my T28 Trojan I had for seven years is my hobby. And it was made in 1954 a U.S. Navy trainer.
