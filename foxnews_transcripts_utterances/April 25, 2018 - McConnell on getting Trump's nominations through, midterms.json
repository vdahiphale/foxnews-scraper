So, breaking tonight on 'The Story,' the man who cracked the case of the Golden State killer today, making an arrest after searching for that man for more than 40 years. His unbelievable story is live here moments away. But first, 292 nominees are waiting for Senate confirmation and now the logjam may be starting to break. Good evening everybody, I Martha MacCallum and the story is that we expect Mike Pompeo to get his vote for secretary of state tomorrow. The White House wants him on a plane to Brussels on Friday for the NATO meeting. So, they are nudging forward on him and his situation for secretary of state. Two men that helped make that happen are here tonight: one, eagerly; and one, somewhat reluctantly. We've got Leader Mitch McConnell, and then we will also speak to Senator Chris Coons who bought tears to Bob Corker's eyes when he agreed to get Pompeo a thumb's up to get him through the committee. But first, Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry live at the White House with the breaking news from there and the latest on Dr. Ronny Jackson.

He said, he's moving forward on the nomination. Senator Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the Vets' Committee, just released a summary of conversations with 23 current colleagues and former of Jackson, many of them still in uniform who charged misconduct including allegations he repeatedly drinks on duty and has an explosive temper. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); } This new report charging while Jackson had to be on call if the president had a health issue. \"On several occasions, Jackson would reach for the medical bag while intoxicated to show he was in charge. On at least one occasion, Dr. Jackson could not be reached when needed because he was passed out drunk in a hotel room.\" The report also alleging, \"at a Secret Service going away party, Jackson got drunk and wrecked a government vehicle.\" Again, he's denying that, but it comes just hours after Press Secretary Sarah Sanders asserted there's no reason to believe the previous allegations that Jackson had been drinking on the job. She claimed the White House did a good job of vetting this nomination. Republican Jerry Moran, though, says the nominee told him he never had a drink on duty at all, and Moran was blunt today about saying he's not really sure what to believe as Democrats suggest this nomination could be dead. if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) { window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) { Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', ''); }); } else { console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found'); }",

Then in 1979, the same year, Joseph DeAngelo left law enforcement in Northern California, a string of rapes and murders began happening in Southern California.

His unbelievable story is live here moments away. But first, 292 nominees are waiting for Senate confirmation and now the logjam may be starting to break. Good evening everybody, I Martha MacCallum and the story is that we expect Mike Pompeo to get his vote for secretary of state tomorrow. The White House wants him on a plane to Brussels on Friday for the NATO meeting."

Remember, President Trump gave Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson an out yesterday saying if it were him, he'd withdraw rather than take what the president called abuse from politicians about these allegations. Instead, Ronny Jackson decided to double down on his denials and now, tonight is facing a mountain of new allegations. Breaking this hour, Jackson trying to fight back, insisting it should be pretty easy to prove that he did not get drunk and then smash up a taxpayer-funded vehicle as is now being charged. He said, he's moving forward on the nomination. Senator Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the Vets' Committee, just released a summary of conversations with 23 current colleagues and former of Jackson, many of them still in uniform who charged misconduct including allegations he repeatedly drinks on duty and has an explosive temper. This new report charging while Jackson had to be on call if the president had a health issue. \"On several occasions, Jackson would reach for the medical bag while intoxicated to show he was in charge. On at least one occasion, Dr. Jackson could not be reached when needed because he was passed out drunk in a hotel room.\" The report also alleging, \"at a Secret Service going away party, Jackson got drunk and wrecked a government vehicle.\" Again, he's denying that, but it comes just hours after Press Secretary Sarah Sanders asserted there's no reason to believe the previous allegations that Jackson had been drinking on the job. She claimed the White House did a good job of vetting this nomination. Republican Jerry Moran, though, says the nominee told him he never had a drink on duty at all, and Moran was blunt today about saying he's not really sure what to believe as Democrats suggest this nomination could be dead."

Genuine enthusiasm, poised under pressure, incredible work ethic, and follow through. Ronny continues to inspire confidence with the care he provides to me, my family, and my team, continues to promote ahead of his peers.\" Now, White House aides here are particularly upset that Jon Tester, the Democrat -- top Democrat on the committee, came out and claimed that their allegations that the doctor was known as the Candyman for freely dispensing prescription drugs, they note here that on long overseas trip, typically not this White House staffer, but journalists as well, in fact, will be offered sleep aids, for example, to help deal with long overseas trips they say.

He said he would work weekends, he would make people stay weekends, and then that would break the logjam with Democrats and that this 30-hour rule, would probably go out the window pretty quickly."

I've had to file cloture -- that's the device by which you stop debate -- 88 times in the Trump administration, that's more than the last six presidents in the first two years together. So, the Democrats do have an opportunity to slow the process. We're working hard to try to truncate that. For example, we're having the two votes tomorrow because they've decided not to use all of the time that they could have used, and we're continuing to put the pressure on. It's a legitimate complaint."

I want to talk you about the Senate races because there's now increasing concern from Steve Law, who you know well, at American Crossroads; he saying that he believes that we do have a more defensive train to hold. Then, when the cycle started, and targeted Democratic incumbents have been over performing in terms of their early fundraising activity. There are those who would like to see a lot more urgency on the part of Republicans on Capitol Hill when it comes to these midterms. What do you say about that?"

The left turnout in place like the Virginia governor's race, was stunning. So, there's no question, I would say to all of our Republican supporters across the country. We need to be turning out in big numbers this fall because the Democrats are fired up, they want to take the Congress back. We think we have an excellent chance to hold it, but it does require a lot of enthusiasm. The Democrats are fired up, but no question about it, but so are we.

And we were in a place where we'd already the vote on foreign relations, every Republican voted in favor, every Democrat voted against. And Chairman Corker put to the committee the question: are we really going to make Johnny come up here at 11:00 or later tonight and reconvened just to cast exactly the same boat with exactly the same result.

You should be able to speak to your representation without invoking your right to remain silent. And so, it's going to be a bad moment for him, it's going to be a bad moment for the president. It's like being represented by Luca Brasi, you know, it's not a -- they are not good. Having said that, most attorneys would not want their client who's the subject of a very significant criminal investigation to be going into a deposition or any types of proceedings in a defamation case. What's interesting is that Michael Avenatti, who I should say is my former research assistant, has really created quite a mess for Cohen. And in many ways, it's a mess of Cohen's own creation. Cohen has really fallen into every trap that Avenatti has set for him. And it's proven to be his own doing. The problem, I think, for the president is that many of us said -- some of us said a year ago, that he should've severed his ties with Michael Cohen. Cohen, to be as polite as possible, is rather reckless as an attorney. He has hopelessly shattered, I think, the attorney-client privilege that would protect the president.

So, he destroyed in my view the greatest protection he could afford the president. And now, he's sitting in some evidence vault, they're all of his files, including possible recordings.

All of the use of these tweets in these cases was rather surprising and unprecedented.

But now we know the 72- year-old DeAngelo has lived in the Sacramento suburbs for more than 30 years. And while the majority of these rapes and murders were committed, DeAngelo was a police officer in both Central and Northern California. In 1979, he was fired from law enforcement for shoplifting a hammer and a can of dog repellant and never contested his termination apparently to avoid a deeper investigation. In 1976, the suspect was initially dubbed the east area rapist, after a series of sexual assault in East Sacramento that all followed the same pattern, prying open a window, shining a flashlight in the victim's eyes, raping them, and in some cases, later taunting them by calling them on the phone. Then in 1979, the same year, Joseph DeAngelo left law enforcement in Northern California, a string of rapes and murders began happening in Southern California. Police called that suspect the night stalker. In 2001, with advances in forensic technology, investigators found the DNA from crimes committed by the night stalker matched the DNA from the east area rapist. Then, last week, police found their needle in a haystack. Watch."

The motive of why he was doing these crimes -- these horrific crimes, it is unknown at this point in time.
