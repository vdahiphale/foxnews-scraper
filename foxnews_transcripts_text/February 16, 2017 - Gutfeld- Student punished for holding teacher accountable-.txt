Headline: Gutfeld: Student punished for holding teacher accountable?
Sub-headline: In liberal culture, you're only a whistleblower if you blow the whistle on things liberals hate

 
So while campus activists and so-called protesters shut down free speech with threats of violence, at least we know there is some justice in the world. Caleb O'Neill, a student at Orange Coast College, has just been suspended. Was it for torching a dorm or beating of a motorist? No, he filmed a video of a professor comparing Donald Trump's election to terrorism.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

OLGA PEREZ STABLE COX, PROFESSOR: We have been assaulted. It's an act of terrorism. One of the most frightening things for me and most people in my life is that the people committing the assault are among us. It is not some stranger from some other country coming in and attacking our sense of what it means to be an American and the things that we stand for. And that makes it more painful. Our nation is divided as clearly as it was in Civil War times, and my hope is that we will get some good leadership to help us to overcome that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
For recording that, the student has been removed for one semester. He's forced to write an apology, as well as an essay that explains his actions. Now, that's what I call reeducation. He's being punished for precisely what college used to teach you: independent thought. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No word yet on whether the teacher will also write an essay on why she's still allowed to teach.
Anyway, Caleb held the teacher accountable and for that, he's being held accountable. It's another one of those examples in liberal culture where you're only a whistleblower if you're blowing the whistle on things liberals hate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'm sure if the professor was making fun of 50 odd gender pronouns or raised skeptical questions about climate change, the student would be exulted. Instead, by shining a light on an infantile example of academic intolerance, he's given the boot, temporarily.
So remember Caleb's name, and when he graduates, hire him.
