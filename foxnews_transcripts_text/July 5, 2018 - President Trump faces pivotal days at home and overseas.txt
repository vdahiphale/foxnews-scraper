DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Richard Fowler, Jesse Watters is back, and Tyrus. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five." 
Fox News alert, another cabinet shakeup for the Trump administration, EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt has resigned. President Trump tweeting the announcement aboard Air Force One on his way to a campaign rally in Great Falls, Montana, which is coming up in about an hour from now. Of course, we'll have that for you live. John Roberts joins us from the White House with the latest. John, you can't ever take a break, you have to be on your toes at all times at the White House.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS: Your head has got to be on swivel 24/7 here at the White House. This is not a surprise. It's really been a long time coming. What has been a surprise to many, many people is how Scott Pruitt held on to his job as long as he did given the controversy that was swirling around him, 14 different ethics investigations. But in his farewell tweet, Scott Pruitt after his resignation, you can see why he held on because the President really appreciated what he was doing. President Trump tweeting, I accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Within the agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this. The senate confirm deputy at EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will take over on Monday, assume duty as the acting administrator of the EPA. I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Scott Pruitt issued his resignation in a form of a letter to the president. The Administrator Pruitt shared that letter with me. I think the particular excerpt from that letter, the passage from that letter that is important here is Pruitt saying I'm stepping down as administrator of EPA effective as of July 6. It is extremely difficult for me to see serving you in this role, first, because I count it a blessing to be serving you in any capacity, but also because of the transformative work that is occurring. However, the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family are unprecedented, has taken a sizeable toll on all of us.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It was well publicized all of the controversy and scandals that Pruitt has been facing, but there was another one that was facing him which may have been the most important at all. Congressman Ted Lou, as well as Don Baier had sent a letter to the inspector general at the EPA claiming that certain appointments in Scott Pruitt's calendar had been scrubbed from the official record because the meetings were with people that would have, quote, looked bad, in the federal record, and not keeping proper federal records can be considered to be a crime. So that was facing him, as well. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fierce critic of Administrator Pruitt, said Scott Pruitt was the worst administrator in the history of the agency. Congressman Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, simply said it's about time in terms of Scott Pruitt's departure. 
Again, Dana, he held on where so many other people in an administrative capacity would not have been able to, simply because the president thought he was doing a good job. The president during the campaign railed against what he called onerous and duplicative federal regulation that were really handcuffing, he believe, industry from being able to create the sort of economy that President Trump thought was possible, and Pruitt was right there on the front lines of it cutting those regulations, certainly, earned him a lot of enemies in government, at the EPA. In a breakfast that I had with Pruitt a couple of weeks ago, he thought that he was being targeted by people who wanted to see him gone, and today, he is gone. Dana.

PERINO: All right, John, thank you for that. Pruitt's resignation comes at a pivotal time for the White House. We're also learning the President Trump has narrowed down his short list to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. A source telling Fox News, the president and his vetting team are focusing on three possible candidates who are among six he's interviewed. The big decision for the high court nominee is scheduled for Monday night. Meantime, the left is gearing up for a major confirmation battle over the president's pick.

SEN. BEN CARDIN, D-MD.: Clearly, the president is looking at a list prepared by an extreme group that has an agenda that really wants to just ratify the president's policies.

UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, the question is, if they're not able to withstand this onslaught, not able to hold back a justice that would reverse role, what happens? We go to 50 civil war in each of the states, plus the District of Columbia. 
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: If you think about our Supreme Court, it's the crown jewel. I do think that there is a risk that this nomination could move the court in a really dangerous direction.

PERINO: All right. So we have the news about Pruitt resigning, but I really think that that's going to be superseded by the interest in who's going to get the nod to be the president's Supreme Court nominee. Kimberly, let me go to you first because the president I think is figuring out -- OK, I've interviewed these six people. He -- maybe, he has narrowed it down to three, as a source had told Fox News. And then, really, it's just up to him as the decider who he wants and to put up for the Supreme Court. 
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Well, obviously, all the people are incredibly qualified. There this list of 20, and then he added five additional names. And now, they're reporting that Fox News is getting the same that he's narrowed it down to these six that you see there on the screen. Obviously, you know, incredible candidates, all of them could and should be confirmed. But I think the concern is just really down to the numbers. They're all qualified. Who, in fact, will be able to, you know, get the confirmation and who might oppose it, you know, in terms of the concern about -- there's, you know, the two females that might not support, perhaps, like the female justices, or perhaps one of the other ones could be complicated because of Roe v. Wade. So, it may come just down to the vote, and who might be able of those six qualified people to be able to go forward. 
PERINO: It is possible, though, Jesse, that because there's many senate Democrats who are up for re-election in tough states where the president won it by up to 20 points, that those senate Democrats that want to win again will listen to their constituents and decide to vote for them. I could see a scenario where either it doesn't -- the person cannot get the vote, or you get 54 or 55 votes approving this new justice.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Yeah, probably Manchin and Donnelly in South Dakota are going to vote for whoever. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Heitkamp.
WATTERS: Yes, and Heitkamp are going to vote for whoever Trump's puts up there. But my sources at Watters' World are telling me it's down to two, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Barrett. And Kavanaugh has got a great pedigree. He clerked for Kennedy. An influential guy who reaches across the aisle, not in a way, you know, as a swing justice, but someone who uses the force of his personality to persuade other justices. He's a Yale guy, a Bush appointee, 53 years old. He has really strong judicial record on guns, on religious liberty, and on free markets. And he has a long record to look through. He's a constitutionalist and people like that. Right now, he has the inside track, considered the front runner. The Wall Street Journal editorial page endorsed him as top conservatives did, as well.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The one concern about him is he did vote kind of the way Justice Roberts did rule on the Obamacare case. He called it a tax which a lot of conservatives didn't like. But he looks like a shoe-in. But a strong late surge by Amy Barrett, social conservatives, really like her, as well as, you know, constitutional conservatives. She's only 46. And she's got a lengthy. 
PERINO: Not so young.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');

        }
      
WATTERS: Very young.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: And she's got a great record of scholarship that shows her as someone that respects religious liberty, as well as the second amendment. She already went through a confirmation and got through unscathed. And I think the rack on her from the Democrats was, you know, she's dogmatic, she's going to let her Catholic faith beliefs influence her rulings, and she really expertly, kind of, deflected that accusation. But, in terms of strict constitutionalist, an originalist and a textualist, a lot of, you know, very conservative people like her a lot. And she's a mother of seven children and, again, be on the court for a very, very long time.

RICHARD FOWLER, CO-HOST: Right. And I think Kimberly is right. This is going to come down to the two women, the one from Alaska, and one from Maine, Susan Collins and Liza Murkowski, and how they vote. And it's also going to come down to how hard can Chuck Schumer hold this caucus together. And we saw what Mitch McConnell did two years ago to Merrick Garland, where he sort to invoked this Mitch McConnell rule where they hold during an election year. And I think Democrats. 
PERINO: Presidential election year.

FOWLER: Listen, the sound was election year, now they're changing the rules to make it a presidential election rule. But that's cool because Mitch McConnell likes to change the rules for his benefit. 
PERINO: Oh, my God. The whole reasons you're in this position, Richard, because of Harry Reid.

PERINO: No, we're not. 
FOWLER: They're going to invoke the same Mitch McConnell rule. And hopefully, with the two help -- with the help of both Liza Murkowski and Susan Collins, Democrats will hold together. And here's the thing, it's not that we're against having somebody who is conservative. You put up a justice that's similar to Kennedy, I think you will get the 60 votes and you won't have a problem. If you put up somebody who is far to the right similar to Justice Neil Gorsuch, you're going to have a problem with Democrats and with some Republicans. 
PERINO: Somebody like Brett Kavanaugh that.

WATTERS: Talk about anti-Trump extremism, the left going to new lengths to protest the president on Independence Day. An immigration activist arrested for scaling the Statue of Liberty in court this afternoon after being slapped with misdemeanor charges, including trespassing and disorderly conduct. And Hollywood liberal are piling on using the 4th of July to attack Trump instead of celebrating the country. Including, comedian Chelsea Handler tweeting her apology to the world for President Trump. And filmmaker, Michael Moore, urging the resistance to continue their revolts. And those are just two examples. Richard, why can't you guys just love America like the rest of the country? Why do you have to politicize our nation's independence?

FOWLER: I love America. And I think both Chelsea Handler, as well as the filmmaker loves America, as well. I think -- I mean, I think what we're saying is that -- we disagree on policy and we're using the 4th of July to talk about it. And there's reason to disagree in policies. There's 2,000 kids at the border that can't find their parents. Our deficit is at the highest it's ever been since World War II, right? Not to mention the fact at midnight tonight we start a trade war with China. There're reasons for us to protest and be upset where America is going, period. 
WATTERS: What do you think about this whacky woman, Kimberly, that jumps on the Statue of Liberty and causes all sorts of disruption among the police force and the coast guard on our nation's Independence Day. She's got a long track record of doing goofy things and wasting taxpayer money.

GUILFOYLE: Also, dangerous things. There's a public safety risk, too, if she fell, what could happen below. And also, then you have first responders and people risking their life because she's trying to do a political stunt. I think it's very selfish, you know. This is something that the law should not allow because it's a risk. It's not just like holding up a sign or writing an article. It's actual conduct that puts other people's lives at risk. I mean, you just can't do this. I mean, it's disappointing, you know. I don't know. People just trying to get attention. As like you've said, she's got a history of doing this type of thing. I'd be very frustrated if I had to be the one or a family member that had to go to try to rescue this woman, not to mention the taxpayer dollars which she should have to reimburse. 
PERINO: Not only that, but the NYPD on a day like the 4th of July needs to have all eyes and ears and resources trying to protect people who are going to be in large crowds, that's what they should be doing.

TYRUS: Going back to Richard's point, there are some issues and I'm all for citizens expressing their right to protest, stuff like that. But my only critique was -- I just can't keep up with them all. Like, she's scaling the Statue of Liberty to slide down. Then you have Moore is asking for a revolution, which those words, in itself, he's not going to do that, but the people who listen to him and believe him are going to put their bodies on the line. 
PERINO: And get arrested. 
TYRUS: And get arrested. Is he going to bail them out? 
FOWLER: Tyrus, I get that this outrage, but where is the outrage when people like David Duke have rallies in Charlottesville.

FOWLER: But it's the same, but it's my point, so the outrage happens on both sides. There's extremism on both sides that we need to acknowledge, but it doesn't take away from the fact that there're still 2000 kids at the border without their parents, a trade war that starts at midnight.

(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: I actually have. 
PERINO: You're bringing up the family separation policy. And I do think that was a bipartisan concern, the president backed down and changed the policy. There is a problem with the reunification. And instead of talking about that, because of these stunts, and also calling for the abolishment of ICE, now the Democrats once again have given the upper hand back to the Republicans.

TYRUS: I think DNA is good though because there's also case -- we have a little problem, children smuggling, and I can't find little Tony anywhere. Well, sir, he's not really your son. 
FOWLER: Remember, the government promised, according to HHS Secretary Nielsen, we know where all the kids are, we know where their parents are, they're attached to numbers. Clearly, the attachment number sting was a lie. And now we're using DNA tests to find them because we've done such a horrible job under President Trump.

GUILFOYLE: Right.

FOWLER: So how -- does that same argument apply to what happened on Charlottesville? Shouldn't those police officers respond to real crime instead of following around David Duke? 
WATTERS: I think this is a little different than Charlottesville.
FOWLER: No, it's not. Somebody actually died in Charlottesville. It's actually worse what happened in Charlottesville.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
FOWLER: Meanwhile, new poll shows Dems are undecided about a leader for 2020. And let me just say, it is way too early for Dems -- we're supposed to be undecided. Donald Trump was not the leader of the party at this point in time in his career. Kimberly? 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, so no need to hit the panic button, right, for the Democrats? 
FOWLER: No, not at all. 
GUILFOYLE: Well, I mean, there should be cause for concern because they don't have, so far, a candidate that's emerge. They don't have, really, a platform that seems united. There seems to be, really, such a push toward liberal like extremism to the point where you've got theatrics like climbing the Statue of Liberty, you've got calls for, you know, violence, you really don't have a platform agenda. I mean, what is it? You know, don't make the economy great? Like, undo that?

FOWLER: Kimberly, come on. I think our agenda is pretty clear. We want affordable healthcare, we want high quality public education. We wants ends to meet for working family. I think we have a very clear agenda. We think prescription drug costs are too high and we think Republicans are doing nothing about it. 
WATTERS: I think if you guys had it making healthcare affordable and it bombed. 
FOWLER: You guys had two years to fix it and had done nothing. What have you all done? 
WATTERS: But, Richard, if the future of the Democratic Party is socialism, then the Democratic Party has no future. This woman is a bright woman. She's very attractive, and young and energetic. But she shouldn't be the future of the party. She's extreme left. She represents a very small radical base in the Bronx. And now, she's being tapped as some mini- celebrity within the party and her endorsements actually matter. I'm shocked. I would love to see her face someone like Bret Baier, face a tough interview where she actually has to explain -- Watters' World, open invitation, explain her positions and say how she's going to pay for it. I don't know if she has that inside of her yet. But it's a little too young to think.

WATTERS: He doesn't want to abolish ICE. That I know. 
FOWLER: So, you're OK with endorsing a racist?

What we're running in Alabama, what we're running in Missouri, we're going to run different races all across the country just like you guys are doing. 
WATTERS: I wish you best of luck, Richard. 
FOWLER: And we're going to win. 
TYRUS: Point is it's early. It's too early. And number one, if I was part of the Democratic Party and I had dark horse candidate I thought would do some things, I would keep them under wraps too. Do you really want to stick your head out of the rabbit hole this early and have to deal with Donald Trump for the next two years going after you?

GUILFOYLE: Nevertheless.

WATTERS: I do think that, Richard, if she gets too problematic for the Democratic Party, they're going to knee cap her Bernie Sanders style. They're going to rigged it against her because the establishment can't afford to have some sort of lightning rod that's going to divide the party and go against Wall Street. 
FOWLER: I find it hard to believe. 
WATTERS: . and make everybody else look bad.
FOWLER: I think she's going to win and be the next congresswoman from that district. 
WATTERS: I do, too, but not the nominee. 
FOWLER: Dana? 
PERINO: I would say that one big difference -- you make a good point about Corey Stewart, but it's not the exact same -- it was Tom Perez, the head of the DNC, who said she's the future of the party. Ronna McDaniel has not said that Corey Stewart is the future of the Republican Party. 
FOWLER: But the president has tweeted about him. I mean, isn't the president the head of the party? 
PERINO: Well, I don't think that he's tweeted on him since.
FOWLER: He's tweeted about -- primaries saying congrats and look forward to you winning. 
PERINO: I am not for him. 
TYRUS: Somebody probably whisper in his ears and he probably went, oh, damn, never mind. 
PERINO: The other thing is, though, I think that you also see there is an age problem with the Democrats that leadership, Pelosi, Hoyer, and Clyburn, they're collective ages is 234 years. And, you see the restlessness, Tom Perez talks about his daughter and all the Bernie bros -- everybody was like so young. And there is a divide. And I think the grass-roots are angry, they're frustrated, it reminds me a lot of the tea party movement. And so, the establishment Democrats are having to figure out how they can bring in this new, young talent, that still win elections, and that might not be all that easy. 
FOWLER: And I think we're doing it, though. I think if you look -- we're running veterans. We're fronting new faces.
PERINO: No, I know.
FOWLER: . all across the country. And that's why we're going to win this primary. We're going to win back the house pretty easily. 
PERINO: But it makes it hard for the people, like MJ Hager, who has then to defend against somebody like Maxine Waters calling for all of these harassments.
(CROSSTALK)
TYRUS: With all due respect, as long as the economy is swole [SIC] like my arms --
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my God.
TYRUS: -- I don't care who you have running. It's not going to happen. Like the economy -- 
PERINO: Better your arms than my arms. 
TYRUS: And we'll keep it -- as long as you've got good economy, the Republicans are fine. 
FOWLER: I mean, we'll find out at midnight when we start our trade war with China. 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness. That's -- OK.
FOWLER: Coming up, companies are starting to embrace the idea of sleeping on the job. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
TYRUS: You may remember this classic scene from the movie "Office Space." 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Corporate accounts payable, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate accounts payable, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate accounts payable, Nina speaking. Just a moment. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TYRUS: As you can see, thee's distractions in the work place. All those e-mails and phone calls we're bombarded with everyday can put a strain on your productivity and your brain. Research estimates it can reduce your workplace I.Q. by 10 points, the equivalent of losing a night's sleep. 
So how can we get employees in the best mental state? How about a nice nap? A growing number of companies are encouraging sleeping on the job, with high-tech napping pods and rooms to make a more productive work place. 
PERINO: You're not buying this? Very skeptical.
TYRUS: No. I don't believe this for one second. No, there's just too much watching "World Star" and arguing with your girl in Texas, and too many WhatsUp apps and all that kind of stuff and people doing stuff, working on their own careers. Their writers, their acting gigs and all the stuff that I do behind the scenes at "The Greg Gutfeld Show."
So this -- this -- this -- 
GUILFOYLE: That was a great read, though. 
TYRUS: Yes. 
GUILFOYLE: I liked it. You really conveyed sort of your thought process. 
TYRUS: You feel like I captured the art of --
GUILFOYLE: I totally did.
TYRUS: -- embracing taking a nap at work --
PERINO: The tone, you felt it?
TYRUS: -- which most of us who were in our first jobs did nap at work, and that's why we didn't keep our jobs. So I have -- I have issues with this. Like, if you have a security job, you've kind of got to stay awake, right? Or you're watching a nuclear plant, can you take a nap? 
WATTERS: No. Unlike -- unless you're Homer Simpson.
TYRUS: Yes.
WATTERS: He can fall asleep on the job. 
I don't want us to spend money on napping pods. I think that sounds bad. And you can't really do that in the news business. 
GUILFOYLE: Could you imagine?
WATTERS: You've got to stay ahead of the curve. 
GUILFOYLE: Napping now. 
WATTERS: I would want -- I do want kind of like a hot food station here at FOX. Right now we have salad stations, and then they do the sandwich and they put on a hot press. But like, what about a burger or a hot dog or something on the grill? If we could incorporate that instead of the napping pod. 
(CROSSTALK)
TYRUS: So you're going to add -- I'm sorry, you're going to add (UNINTELLIGIBLE) to the argument, which you eat a lot of heavy meat, you go to sleep. So that's wrong. 
WATTERS: No, I don't fall asleep. I perform better when I've had protein. 
TYRUS: I've never heard of that. 
Dana, you're a multitasker, correct?
PERINO: Yes, well, actually, the truth is --
TYRUS: Would you struggle? 
PERINO: I actually believe that it is impossible to multitask. So if you are trying to do several different things at once and you think you're handling it, the truth is, you're really not. 
And the better way to do work is to focus on that one thing, and then maybe get up and, like, make the phone calls or look at Twitter, whatever, but then to come back and focus. Because multitasking is not real. It's not - - it doesn't really happen. 
TYRUS: I know you can multitask. 
FOWLER: I can, but I actually agree with Dana on this. I think the most productive I am, especially when I'm prepping for this, when I'm prepping for "The Five," I call it work block. Where I don't answer my phone and I don't check e-mail. I just prep for the show. 
WATTERS: You prep for the show? 
PERINO: Wow, what's that like? 
FOWLER: Watters, we know -- we know you don't prep for the show. 
WATTERS: This is you prepared? I'd hate to see you unprepared.
FOWLER: You don't prepare because you're --
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Wow. 
TYRUS: Somebody is spicy. Order in the court. 
GUILFOYLE: Throwing a lot of shade.
FOWLER: -- this happening right here. 
WATTERS: I'm kidding. 
TYRUS: Bail me out, K.G.
GUILFOYLE: don't know, we need a lot of help right now with this. Jesse is throwing shade. I don't know. Richard, you seem very prepared. 
PERINO: Like because we didn't grow up with phones, and they're new to us, though. But when you are raising a youngster --
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
PERINO: -- like your son, how do you make sure that he can do his homework without worrying about any sort of social -- not that he's on social media. But -- 
GUILFOYLE: Right, right, right. But he has a schedule. 
PERINO: OK.
GUILFOYLE: Right? And I think it's very good, like much like we train dogs, you know, children. And people respond well to a schedule. 
So he knows, like, when he comes home, his time, like, for a snack, right? He gets to eat something before he does homework. And then after he does his homework, and I've checked it, then he can go ahead and do something that's like recreational, play a game or, you know, go outside, etcetera. It just depends. And he responds to that. Then he eats dinner at a certain time. Then he takes a shower every night. 
WATTERS: How much did the Pavlov dog --
GUILFOYLE: But look at how well he's turned out.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: When he does his homework, his mouth starts watering.
TYRUS: She's guilty (ph). She's Multitasking. 
GUILFOYLE: Then he takes shower. He has an after-dinner healthy snack like sliced apples or something like that, and then he goes to bed at a certain time. 
TYRUS: I need to get my life in order. 
FOWLER: Jesse, that actually might work for you. That might keep you on task. 
TYRUS: We just talked about getting a good night's sleep. Did you get your eight hours in? Supposedly, that will help you be more productive at work. So stop staying up late binge-watching --
GUILFOYLE: Netflix.
TYRUS: Or "The Greg Gutfeld Show." 
PERINO: Or looking at your phone.
TYRUS: Yes, or staring at your phone. Staying up late and not getting enough sleep does affect you in your workplace. 
PERINO: That's true.
TYRUS: You've got to get your eight hours in. 
PERINO: I overheard, on the day off yesterday, on the Fourth of July, I overheard this younger girl. She was probably, like, 21 -- 
TYRUS: You were eavesdropping? 
PERINO: Well, no, she was very loud. 
TYRUS: Oh.
PERINO: But she -- she said that -- it was something like 10 a.m. And they said, "Oh, are you just getting up?" 
And she said, "Well, I need my 10 hours of sleep. I heard it on a podcast." 
WATTERS: Oh, yes. 
GUILFOYLE: That's very good for children, too, to get sleep.
PERINO: That's a lot. 
TYRUS: Yes, if you're 6, ten hours is great. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
TYRUS: But if you're an adult, you get your behind up and get to work. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, but for a child, you pay attention in school. And if you get a good night's rest, and you're on schedule, because a lot of children that suffer from, like, attention deficit disorder or different things or learning differences, it really helps if you have a schedule and you have that structure and get rest. 
TYRUS: So no one here is in favor of naps? 
FOWLER: I'm in favor of the power nap. 
TYRUS: Of course.
GUILFOYLE: No, but not at work. 
TYRUS: One time you could be in the group, you just won't do it. 
FOWLER: No, I will not. 
TYRUS: Very Juan of you. Very Juan of you. 
WATTERS: What's the difference between power nap, though, and a regular nap? 
GUILFOYLE: Power nap is --
TYRUS: Seven minutes.
FOWLER: Twenty to 30 minutes. 
GUILFOYLE: It's shorter in duration. 
FOWLER: A regular nap is 90 minutes? 
PERINO: Thirty minutes?
WATTERS: A regular nap is 90.
PERINO: That's, like, five news cycles in 30 minutes.
GUILFOYLE: Wait, who -- really? 
TYRUS: There's a nap commission. 
GUILFOYLE: I thought there's like a science of -- I don't know. 
FOWLER: The science to have, like, a 30-minute nap so you get all the cycles right. 
PERINO: You know who was a great napper?
TYRUS: What about resting your eyes? What is does that fall under? Because I'm good at that.
PERINO: Margaret Thatcher was an excellent power napper. She could just take, like, two or three minutes, and then she'd be back and ready to go. 
GUILFOYLE: That's amazing.
TYRUS: All right. FOX News alert, President Trump just landed in Great Falls, Montana, ahead of his "Make America Great Again" rally, coming up at the top of the hour. We'll bring it to you live when it happens.
Stay tuned to FOX News. 
There's a guy walking.
GUILFOYLE: Oh, we're talking?
PERINO: Well, it doesn't say --
TYRUS: So power naps.
PERINO: So Jesse, the president just arrived in Montana.
WATTERS: Yes, so big rally tonight, 6 p.m., and I think it's going to be probably another stem winder, which will have the liberals apoplectic. And these rallies, he really connects with the base. Probably FOX News will take it live in full, and CNN will not take it and get destroyed in the ratings. 
FOWLER: Let's talk about the race. 
WATTERS: You're going to see more of the president. 
FOWLER: Let's talk about the facts. 
WATTERS: OK, let me just finish. You're going to see more of the president coming up into the mid-terms on the road, connecting with the audience in these states where they need to flip the Democratic seats. 
FOWLER: Well, the seat is actually going to be -- 
WATTERS: Putting a lot of pressure on these Democrats in these districts.
FOWLER: This -- so this seat is actually going to be very hard to flip. He's -- 
PERINO: All right. I have news. I'm told that -- so apparently, the president did a gaggle with reporters on the plane, and it was a couple days ago that he talked to Scott Pruitt, the now resigned EPA administrator. So the president that this resignation was coming. He was expecting it, and it is effective tomorrow, the sixth of July. 
WATTERS: Well, some of his scandals were a little silly, like one of his scandals, that he made his staff get him snacks. I mean, if anybody's worked for any boss, the boss will sometimes make you get snacks. 
On the other hand, another scandal --
FOWLER: That's not against the law, though. 
WATTERS: OK, Richard, just relax. 
FOWLER: But it's against the law.
WATTERS: Another scandal, he spent $30,000 of taxpayer money on soundproofing his office, not a good look. 
FOWLER: How about the $5,000 on pens and journals? 
WATTERS: Yes, that's a lot of money on pens and journals. 
FOWLER: Or sending his staff to buy a used mattress from the Trump Hotel. 
WATTERS: I'm not going to defend Scott Pruitt's spending. 
FOWLER: But he's part of the Trump swamp.
WATTERS: I will say that it's going to be a smooth transition.
TYRUS: Well, he just got drained, though. That's a good thing, because he just got drained.
FOWLER: Two years. You can take --
WATTERS: His -- his deputy is pretty good, and the Trump administration's environmental policies and conservation policies will still remain the same. 
FOWLER: But I thought Trump -- I mean, I thought Trump, like, sort of ran on the whole idea of draining the swamp, and this guy is the epitome of the swamp. 
WATTERS: Well, he's not there anymore.
GUILFOYLE: He's not there anymore. 
TYRUS: Well, you can take a horse to water, but you can't make him fish. Right?
GUILFOYLE: This -- yes.
TYRUS: Joey Chestnut consumes over 20,000 calories in 10 minutes at this year's Fourth hot dog eating contest. Wow. "Kimberly's Food Court" is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: This is a FOX News alert. President Trump arriving in Montana for a campaign rally. And he's commenting on the resignation of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, saying the White House has been talking about it for a while, and it has been in the works for a couple of days. We're keeping an eye on that. 
But right now, it's time for "Kimberly's Food Court." Yes. 
All right. Well, he is the hot dog eating king once again. You know him, right? Joey Chestnut chowing down a record 74 hot dogs in 10 minutes at the Nathan's Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest at New York's Coney Island boardwalk. It was the 11th time he won the coveted mustard belt. 
God, I wish I had that. 
Meanwhile, in the women's competition, Miki Sudo bested her competition by eating 37 hot dogs in three -- oh, 10 minutes. Well, that is pretty impressive. 
PERINO: Three minutes would have been amazing. 
GUILFOYLE: I think she's -- that's going to be --
PERINO: I can't even watch that.
GUILFOYLE: Can you imagine? I think it's very impressive. It takes a lot of mental discipline to be able to eat that quickly. 
WATTERS: An amazing --
(CROSSTALK)
GUILFOYLE: This is a gorgeous graphic behind you. I just wish you would feast your eyes on this. 
PERINO: That's pretty amazing. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, and you know, as a competitive eater, that I am, I can tell you the preparation that goes in mentally, like, the night before. And you've got to be careful about your diet, what you have before you go into these competitions. 
We all were talking about what would he be, you know, competitive with, if we were going to be in one of these. Obviously, I feel very well-versed to do chicken wings, because I am the reigning champion around these parts. 
PERINO: She is. Don't ever bet against her.
GUILFOYLE: Dana --
PERINO: Always ask her to be on your team. It's -- I've never seen anything like it. She is a competitor of the highest degree. 
GUILFOYLE: Highest order.
PERINO: You'd want her on your team. 
TYRUS: No, I'm not playing. 
PERINO: "I'm not playing"?
TYRUS: I'm not eating that many hot dogs for nobody. I just -- I don't look at it as a real sport.
PERINO: What did you choose if you were to have something? 
TYRUS: Oh, I chose pie, because everyone loves pie. But real quick, I actually did win a food eating contest one time in Laredo, Texas. I beat John Cena in a 72-ounce steak eating contest. 
GUILFOYLE: No way.
TYRUS: Smashed him. 
GUILFOYLE: That's pretty cool.
PERINO: How long did it take? 
TYRUS: It was about -- about 30 minutes. A lot of side bets, but I was people's champion that night. 
GUILFOYLE: You're going to take a sample over there? No. Oh, you have the pie. 
Dana, this was hysterical. 
PERINO: I thought this was pretty funny, that I -- if I were to choose, like, what I could eat to win, I chose M&M's. 
TYRUS: You could eat like three? 
PERINO: No. You could eat a whole bunch of M&M's. If you're going by the number, then I could actually probably win if I did something like that. 
TYRUS: You'd have to use two hands to eat one M&M. 
GUILFOYLE: This is hysterical. It's like, she's, like, cute and little, and like the M&M's are little. 
PERINO: I want to give these -- I'm giving these to Jesse for his office. 
WATTERS: Thank you very much.
GUILFOYLE: He'll eat all of those, for sure. 
Jess, what did you pick? 
WATTERS: I got McNuggets. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes, you love those. 
WATTERS: I was going to get shellfish, but I got scolded one time for doing that. So I went with --
PERINO: Your first week.
WATTERS: Chicken nuggets and barbecue sauce, and I'm ready to take on all challengers. I know I'm the newcomer to the table, but that belt is not secure. That mustard belt, Kimberly --
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
WATTERS: I might be wearing that at the end of the show. 
GUILFOYLE: Are you talking about to compete with me? Because that would be foolish idea. 
WATTERS: Would we have the same food or would we compete nuggets versus wings? How would it go down? 
GUILFOYLE: Well, I think either way, you would lose. 
PERINO: Are we doing this then? Because Richard chose shrimp cocktail. Which is ridiculous.
FOWLER: I did. I chose shrimp. Because --
GUILFOYLE: This is a salad.
PERINO: How are you going to eat that? 
TYRUS: You totally botched this. 
FOWLER: I'm going to still beat y'all. Don't under -- don't underestimate me, America. Don't underestimate me.
PERINO: In the minute or so that we have, should we -- should we have a throwdown? 
WATTERS: I'm just going to start. 
PERINO: Go. 
GUILFOYLE: His are, like, soft. Mine have all the hard part on there. 
PERINO: Who do you think is going to win? 
TYRUS: I don't care. I'm going to eat pie. 
GUILFOYLE: Let them eat pie. Let them eat cake. 
PERINO: What did you say, Mina? 
Oh, one minute. OK, go. 
GUILFOYLE: Dana, you're not doing any of it. 
PERINO: No, I'm not, because I'm emceeing this event. 
TYRUS: She can't. They're way too big for her.
PERINO: Richard might win, because he is, like, throwing down, all that -- 
FOWLER: I'm telling you, shrimp is the way to go.
PERINO: Jesse is kind of disappointing me. 
WATTERS: I don't feel so well.
GUILFOYLE: Look at -- look at, I'm going to win. 
FOWLER: Low calories, people. Low calories. 
TYRUS: It's not even close. 
WATTERS: This was a bad idea. 
PERINO: That's a big bite that you just took out of that pie. 
TYRUS: But I'm taking my time. It's pie. So you know --
PERINO: Wow. She's going to win. 
TYRUS: Yes. It's not even close. 
FOWLER: I'm in the lead here. I only have, like, two shrimps left. 
WATTERS: I underestimated Kimberly. 
PERINO: Yes, I've told you, never, never bet against her.
TYRUS: But you've got to eat all the salad, too, bro. 
FOWLER: No, that's not part of the rules. It is just approaching.
PERINO: It's just approaching. 
WATTERS: Oh, man. I don't feel so good. 
GUILFOYLE: Winner, winner, chicken dinner. 
"One More Thing" up next. 
(MUSIC: WEIRD AL'S "EAT IT")
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
PERINO: President Trump is on his way to a campaign rally in Montana. It's set to start at the top of the hour. Right now, it's time for "One More Thing." I'm going to go first, because I have a special guest.
This is Spike. He's a service puppy for Canine Companions for Independents. He's really into Tyrus's arms. These are dogs that are much-needed. And the producer of "The Daily Briefing," Jen Williams, she's here, over there taking pictures. This is a five-month-old puppy that she is raising. She will take care of him for 18 months and make sure he hits all of his benchmarks, all the training. 
And then after that he goes to more specific training, where he will learn how to open doors, turn on and off lights, and learn how to take care of someone. Jen has had him since he was eight weeks old. And if you go to FOXNews.com/TheDailySpike, you'll learn more about Canine Companions for Independence. That's CCI.org. And then you can apply for a dog or, even better, you can apply to figure out a way to help this organization. A lot of people need dogs. 
And we love Spike. And this is his first time on "The Five." But I think he just wants Tyrus. 
OK, Jesse, you go next. 
WATTERS: Tyrus has a new best friend.
GUILFOYLE: He loves the chicken on him -- my chicken --
WATTERS: Just don't eat my nuggets. All right? 
Next, we have a bouquet gone wrong. You know how the brides throw the bouquet over, and the bridesmaids go nuts? Look at this scene. It was a wedding off Thomas and Deanna Morganthaler. I think we have the footage. And it's pretty wild. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(WOMAN SLIDES ON FLOOR TO CATCH BOUQUET)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Ouch! 
Was that a low bridge, or did she hit her high and someone else went low? 
TYRUS: Down goes Fraser. Down goes --
WATTERS: No one was hurt. And yes, I mean, it's competitive with the bridezillas out there, wannabe bridezillas. But everyone's OK, and happy wedding to the Morganthalers. 
PERINO: Indeed. All right. Kimberly, you're next.
GUILFOYLE: Hi. All right. So this is very cute "One More Thing." And this video shows a Houston police officer dancing with a girl who's in a wheelchair at a party.
PERINO: Aww.
GUILFOYLE: And this is a quinceanera party, and it's very cute. The DJ was working this quinceanera, and he looked up, and he spotted this sweet moment. The officer, Sandy Fernandez, was working as security for the event. He spotted the little girl in the wheelchair, watching everybody else dance. And so he then asked her to dance and spent about three songs twirling her around the dance floor. 
Fernandez said that she smiled the entire time for him. There were no words to describe the incredibly beautiful moment. And this was on the Houston Police Department Facebook page. And it says, "This is what relational policing is about." So far, 54,000 views. 
PERINO: I love that. And now millions more, thanks to you. A great "One More Thing."
All right. Tyrus.
TYRUS: My "One More Thing" is "Greg Vacation News, Featuring Tyrus." 
The news is Greg's been bothering me with e-mails about a viral treat thread that -- while he's enjoying his Hawaiian vacation. For those of you who aren't familiar with the story, basically, a Texas couple asked to switch seats with a woman on a flight so they can sit together. And apparently, love was in the air. And they immediately hit it off, and they started tweeting about their stuff. 
Greg is convinced that this story isn't quite on the up and up and finds it a little suspicious. And which led to some e-mails back and forth.
Meanwhile, I was frantically telling him, "Brah" --
GUILFOYLE: Brah.
TYRUS: "-- you're on vacation."
GUILFOYLE: Right.
TYRUS: "Be on vacation. The world can wait." But you know, Greg is such a visionary warrior for -- 
PERINO: He can't stop. He likes to sniff out -- I thought that story was very sweet. That couple, they meet on the airplane, and then it's, like, romance. I met my husband on an airplane. 
TYRUS: I have my suspicions. I'm going towards hoax. The two people were fitness models looking for work. And the people doing it were actors. I feel like --
PERINO: OK. 
TYRUS: -- we're being hoodwinked and bamboozled. And if not, I would be - - and what if it is real and one of those people were doing something they weren't supposed to be doing. And you're, you know, putting all their business out there. 
GUILFOYLE: You and Greg are skeptics. Dana and I believe in true love.
PERINO: We do. We believe.
GUILFOYLE: We believe in it. 
PERINO: Spike, do you believe in love? 
Richard, you're next. 
FOWLER: All right. So one of my new favorite shows on our sister channel, FX. It's called "Pose." It's set in the 1980s. "Pose" is a dance musical that explores the juxtaposition of the segments of life and society in New York. Making TV history, "Pose" features the largest cast of transgendered actors in a series regular roles, as well as the largest recurring LGBTQ actors ever in a scripted series. 
Trust me, you will love this show. You will laugh, you will cry, you will fall in love with it. Check it out. Big shout out to 21st Century FOX and FX Productions for taking a risk on this. You can catch it every Sunday night at 9 p.m., only on FX, our sister channel. It's pretty epic. 
PERINO: Well, we have a few seconds left, Tyrus. What do you think about your new best friend? 
TYRUS: Oh, man, I'll replace Greg with him in a minute. 
GUILFOYLE: Aww, very sweet.
TYRUS: Greg, if you're watching, stop watching. Stay on vacation. 
GUILFOYLE: What about his selfie? It's pretty funny. 
TYRUS: Yes, I kind of stay off of his social media. I've got to deal with him. I'm more obsessed with yours and all your cool photos and stuff. Like you're really shooting stuff.
PERINO: What do you guys think of Spike? Anybody want to comment on this fabulous -- 
WATTERS: I'm just happy he's slobbering all over Tyrus and not me. 
FOWLER: And folks, during the break, you missed Jesse slobbering, because he almost choked on his chicken nuggets. 
WATTERS: That is true. 
FOWLER: Jesse's a wimp.
WATTERS: That is true. (CROSSTALK)
PERINO: You know what? I have to hand it to Jesse. He was eating those nuggets, and they were cold. 
GUILFOYLE: So were mine. What are the excuses here? 
FOWLER: Wimp. 
GUILFOYLE: What a snowflake.
FOWLER: A snowflake wimp, America.
PERINO: That's it for us. 
FOWLER: There you have it.
PERINO: Stay tuned for President Trump's rally, coming up. "Special Report" is up next. But before you see President Trump, you'll see Bret Baier -- Bret. 
BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS: Thanks, Dana.
