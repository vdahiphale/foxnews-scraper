Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Of course, without any doubt, saving lives, protecting the national security and preventing the spread of Ebola is the highest priority. You know that, I know that. But I know some of you are curious about nurse Nina Pham's dog, Bentley.
I confess, I am. Is the pup going to get Ebola? I have no idea. I suspect not, but I don't know. We do know that he is being taken care of -- I'm glad of that and I know you are, too, because you have all emailed me asking about Bentley. Some of you have even mentioned in your emails that maybe you should not be asking about a dog in a time like this, obviously mindful of the fact that human lives are on the line. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I see nothing wrong with thinking about the dog. We can do both, humans and pets. They are often our best friends. They are innocent, not judgmental. Always wagging their tails when you get home, even if you are late. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It also occurred to me, as I am now thinking about your emails, how different we Americans are from those savages like ISIS and from Boko Haram. They have no regard for human life and behead innocents and meanwhile, we scramble to help those in great need, even little dogs. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.More On This...
