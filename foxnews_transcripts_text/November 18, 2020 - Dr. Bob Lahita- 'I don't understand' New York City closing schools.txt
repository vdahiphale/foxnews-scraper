NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD, and what a confusing world at that.
When it didn't look like it was going to happen, when we got the first read from the mayor of New York City, that, yes, we can stave off this idea of ending all in person classes, then the spike, then the move, and now the total confusion.

It wasn't a huge surprise for parents, because Mayor Bill de Blasio did come out on Friday and warn parents, hundreds of thousands of parents, that this might happen as early as Monday. Well, Monday came and went. Now it's Wednesday, and we have hit that 3 percent infection rate threshold for the city of New York City, which is what the mayor had created as a standard to shut down those in person classrooms.
And here we are on this Wednesday. New York City's public schools will be closed starting tomorrow, and transitioning now to all remote learning through at least the Thanksgiving holiday. Mayor Bill de Blasio did point that out at his announcement today just moments ago. Listen to this.

HASNIE:  The mayor saying that he spoke with the governor this morning about what it would take to reopen the schools.
The governor has urged the mayor to start factoring in the school's infection rate, along with the city's rate, since these spikes are not linked to schools. I believe the schools' positivity rate is only about point 0.19 percent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
So the mayor also announced today that they would be raising the health and safety standards to reopen. They will focus even more on testing. He wants all students to submit test consent forms in, so that they can start testing even more. The school's chancellor also appearing with the mayor this afternoon, telling parents and students, look, that the school is still in session, in session remotely.
He's stressing that this is only temporary, and that the priority is to get students back into the classroom as soon as possible.
And, remember, Neil, this is all happening as the governor warns that more restrictions are coming, and they're coming soon -- Neil.

You have got state leaders like Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat in Minnesota, saying that community spread is now rampant is in his state.
Hospitalizations are setting a record in his state. And because of things like that, you have the trend, particularly in Midwestern states with Democrat governors, of the restrictions coming down hard.

To some up those trends, you have got a lot of restaurant closures, particularly indoor dining, or limited to just carry-out. Fitness centers, workout classes, group workout classes are being closed. Sporting events are being stopped, the exception being pro and college sports.

A lot of fall championships were just stopped altogether. Winter sports are being pushed back. And a restriction that, in practical terms, is going to amount to a request limits family gatherings for Thanksgiving. In Michigan, the restriction is two families or 10 people.

And, by the way, other Republican governors are doing the same thing when it comes to masking, either a full recommendation that everyone in the state wear them or an outright edict to do so in Iowa, in Utah, North Dakota, West Virginia. Others are taking heed to the fact that this has got to go beyond saying it's a good idea to, well, it's the law.
But can you do that? We will get into that a little later.
Meanwhile, the fallout for us all medically.

Doctor, great to have you back.
What do you make of what they're doing in New York City as a result of the spike, not school-related, Doctor, but they have already shut down in person learning? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

DR. BOB LAHITA, ST. JOSEPH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL:  Yes, I don't understand that, Neil, totally, because I have said repeatedly that children really are not affected by this virus. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We know that. And up to the 12th grade, which is the fourth year of high school, we have like a 99.996 survival, because those children, even if they are infected, do not succumb to the disease. And we have always worried about teachers and janitors and other ancillary people who could wear masks, socially distance themselves, surround themselves in fiberglass or whatever else they want to surround themselves with, and be safe.
The more important thing is that the parents are stuck, because they're -- they can't go to work. Most of these people are not having incomes that will allow them to hire a nanny, for example, a nanny, I guess, who would wear a Tyvek suit and perhaps a surgical mask and come to work at their home.

So, it is a real dilemma, Neil.
CAVUTO:  You know, all of this at the same time, Doctor, we're getting word of vaccines that could be at least an emergency use within the next couple of weeks.

        }
      
But the fear is that a lot of this is going to get, that is, the number of cases and everything, get worse before it gets better. Do you agree with that?

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LAHITA:  Yes, I think that's going to be the case.
There are areas where there are extreme spikes, such as was just mentioned, Michigan and Minnesota certainly, and other states in the West like Utah.
So, things are going to get bad, and they are already bad. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
There have been over 7,994 deaths in the state of Michigan, for example.
So, whatever people are doing, they're not doing it correctly. We're suggesting from the beginning mitigation, wear a mask, wash your hands.
Yesterday, I got a report from Britain about gargling with certain kinds of mouthwash. That helps, and wear -- and keeping your social distancing. So, things will get bad, because, when the vaccine does come out, it's going to go to health care workers, so we can cope with this overwhelming surge of patients, which we're seeing.

And it is -- it's an uptick again. We're up to our ears in alligators, as they say, many, many patients, many, many admissions, not enough beds -- Neil.

Dr. Bob Lahita, thank you very much, my friend, for helping us out again, making sense of all of this.

Well, as you know, a number of states, municipalities are curbing on your Thanksgiving gatherings.
In New York and New Jersey, for example, they're limiting it to dinners no more than 10. How they police that is anyone's guess, but it is a widespread development, where at least some in politics are saying, just go slowly or don't cancel Thanksgiving altogether. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');

James Gallagher is among them, the Republican, Yuba City, California, assemblyman.
Assemblyman, thank you for taking the time.
What will be the rules or the orders in your neck of the woods?
JAMES GALLAGHER (R), CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLYMAN:  Well, thank you for having me, Neil. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Well, as you would heard, the governor has really been encouraging people not to have private gatherings, while he has had his own private gathering at the French Laundry, a very fancy restaurant in Napa, encouraging people to scale back on their Thanksgiving. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think a lot of people are cognizant of the increase in cases. And they're going to handle themselves accordingly at their family gatherings and what they decide to do for Thanksgiving.
But what a lot of people can't tolerate is just these shutdown orders that really don't seem to make a whole lot of sense.
CAVUTO:  What I'm wondering is -- I know you're dealing with spikes. I don't know in your exact district, Assemblyman. But I am wondering, what has prompted the eating establishments, the staying at home, limiting how many people you have at home? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think, in parts of the state, you have to wear a mask even in your home and at the dinner. That would probably be good for me, because I wouldn't eat as much.
But, leaving that aside, how are Californians, your constituents reacting to all this?
GALLAGHER:  Well, they have been very frustrated with how this governor -- and, really, this governor has handed out edicts with his select bureaucrats here in California.
And it's shut down mostly small businesses, churches and schools. And as the good doctor just said, it's having a devastating impact on our children. They're having great loss of learning. Mental health amongst our youth has gone up increasingly, exponentially. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, people are really fed up with that. And you're seeing a lot of businesses stay open because they have to, and their employees rely on that
-- on that job. You're seeing a lot of people in my district that are really pushing that we need to keep the schools open, that that's important to us.
And, really, what you're seeing is just people saying, look, these might be the rules, but we are going to move forward as a free people. We can -- we can respond to this. We know the risks. We will follow the best practices, as been emphasized throughout this.
But if -- if these shutdowns were so good, I mean, look at these states, California, Michigan, New York, some of the most restrictive measures out there, and they're all getting a spike in cases. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, if these measures were so good at reducing spread, why are they seeing these spikes in cases? It begs the question.
CAVUTO:  It does.
When you look abroad and see what's happening in places like Germany and Italy and France, where they also had very aggressive steps to ease this, they're experiencing the sharpest spikes of all. And it's led to pretty violent protests, certainly in Germany. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, Assemblyman, thank you very, very much.
In the meantime, I want to get the read now, fair and balanced, from Representative Raul Ruiz, Democrat of the beautiful state of California, also an emergency room physician. So this guy knows of what he speaks.
Very good to have you, sir.
Do you think these latest crackdowns are warranted, as you see them?
REP. RAUL RUIZ (D-CA):  Well, it's very important to understand, Neil.
And, by the way, it's good to be on your show again.
CAVUTO:  Same here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
RUIZ:  It's very important to understand that, when you have a very highly infectious airborne pandemic that can spread like wildfire, if you are reacting to it, then you're about two to four weeks behind, and you're always playing catchup.
So, you have to try to get in front of it. Just like a wildfire, you try to go where you think the wildfire is going to be, you get in front of it, you clear the land, so you can prevent the worst-case scenario.
And that's what Governor Newsom is doing right now. He sees the trend, the rapid spike throughout the country, hospitalization rate, record numbers, as well as transmissions in California. So, he's getting in front of it and creating -- clearing that land in order to prevent the maximum worst-case scenario in our state.
CAVUTO:  But, you know, I was mentioning before with the prior guest, Congressman, that a lot of the states and countries that had some of the strictest policies on the books are experiencing these noticeable spikes.
And I'm wondering if residents have had it, certainly in your district, and knowing that Joe Biden is coming in on January 20, and has talked himself about more sweeping measures, as a possibility, among them a national mandate on masks.
How do you feel about that?
RUIZ:  Well, I think that, first of all, I understand, when you live in an area with rapid rates and high rates of death due to COVID-19 -- the Coachella Valley within Riverside County, and Riverside County within the state, has the highest numbers of transmission and death, second only to L.A. County. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, there are people dying in my neighborhood. And we understand through the science that masks work. States that have mandates that -- with -- that encourage people to wear masks have lower rates of transmission than other states that do not.
And we know, through the science, that the masks block the air droplets from exiting somebody's mouth, especially those that are asymptomatic, and could infect other people.
So, I think that president-elect Joe Biden is going to have the science behind him to really encourage people to do what we know works to reduce the transmission.
And, look, like, we're all in a position where we're COVID-fatigued. We want our students to go back to school. We want our workers to go back to work. We want to celebrate Thanksgiving. And we want to celebrate it safely with our families.
And -- but there -- and there is a right way to do that and there's a wrong way to do that. The wrong way disregards the precautions that our scientists and our doctors are telling us to take, which would only lead to more loss of life and will only hurt our economy and hurt our small businesses even more.
CAVUTO:  Maybe given your medical background as well, your name has popped up as a possible health and human services secretary in a Biden administration.
What do you think of that? Would you be interested in that? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(LAUGHTER)
RUIZ:  You know, I -- right now, I'm very focused on making sure that I can help, with my expertise in public health crisis, disaster response and emergency care, to help our country and my district get through this pandemic, save lives and save our economy.
But if I were to be asked by president-elect Biden to serve in that capacity, I would definitely highly consider it.
CAVUTO:  All right, we will watch it very, very closely.
Congressman, Doctor, thank you very, very much for updating us.
Again, to the congressman's point here, these new stricter measures are going into effect immediately.
Whether people will have the patience to deal with them again, especially at a time when we have got news of two promising vaccines that could be out, at least in emergency use, in a matter of weeks, we will see how that all goes. In Germany, it did not go well. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
At the corner of Wall and Broad, some of these new restrictions, particularly the shutdown of schools for in person training, that sent what was a flat market careening an additional 344 points on the notion that, vaccine or no, it's going to be a while before the artillery comes in.
We will have more after this.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAVUTO:  All right, getting some news out of the Peach State that Georgia state election officials are saying now an audit report should be out by noon tomorrow, on Thursday. That doesn't necessarily mean a full and firm and official vote count, but the next step to that, again, by noon, tomorrow.
In the meantime, the more crucial development in Georgia, at least for the time being, seems to be those twin run-offs. And Republicans are putting a lot of energy, muscle and money and know-how into that.
Haley Barbour could be a sign of that, the Georgia Battleground Fund national co-chair, the former Mississippi governor, the former RNC chair.
If it's a big battle, you bring in the big guns, and he's the big gun. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Governor, very good to have you.
How do these races look? I know polls are relatively tight. Democrats are pouring a lot of money into this. I know Republicans are. How do you think things look right now?
FMR. GOV. HALEY BARBOUR (R-MS):  Well, look, these races are both going to be very, very close.
Senator Perdue did not win the election November 3 only because he did not get a majority. He got 49.7 or 8. His opponent got about 3 percent less, still very close.
But David Perdue got the most votes any statewide Republican candidate in history has ever received. And he's in a run-off. These are going to be close races.
In the other race, if you take the combined Republican candidates vs. the combined Democrat candidates, only 50,000 votes divided that out of five million.
And so Kelly -- Kelly -- Kelly is going to find that she's got to produce every vote, David Perdue has to produce every vote, because there's got to be a big turnout. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Usually, in run-offs...
CAVUTO:  Yes.
BARBOUR:  ... turnouts aren't very big. This will be a huge turnout.
And for both races, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue both are going to have to just run full speed all the way through the finish line. And I hope every Georgian who worries about the integrity of the presidential race there in Georgia will say, well, I'm going to make sure nothing like that can happen on January 5, because we're not going to give Joe Biden a blank check.
And that's what would happen.
CAVUTO:  But, in the meantime, Governor -- but, in the meantime, Governor, a lot of Republicans are worried that a lot of the infighting, particularly with both of the Senate candidates, Republican candidates, calling for the state secretary of state, a Republican, to resign over his handling of his count, and the president very critical of him as well, and then the president not giving up on his own fight right now, for which he has every legal right to pursue, but that that might impact these Senate races, and not in a good way.
Are you worried? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BARBOUR:  Well, I'm worried that people will take it for granted that David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler will -- are just going to be easy, it's not going to be close.
The Democrats have spent millions and millions and millions of dollars in Georgia in the last four years for the governor's race, which they lost by a small margin, and for this year.
Don't kid yourself. It's going to be a very large turnout. And I hope that the Republicans who are mad or disgruntled will take that out on Chuck Schumer and the Democrats, and not give Biden a blank check.
If these two races were somehow to go to the Democrats, then the Democrats would have 50 in the Senate, the Republicans 50, and Vice President Harris would break the tie. That means no filibuster. That means probably D.C.
statehood. It means a Puerto Rican state.
CAVUTO:  But do you think, Governor, that it's wise, it's wise for anyone to be ripping the secretary of state, whatever the reasons, or maybe keep it quiet, because there are bigger proverbial fish to fry, and this is just getting in the way?
BARBOUR:  Well, I don't think it will get in the way if people understand the stakes, that, if you want the Green New Deal, if you want to do away with private health care, if you want to do all the things that Biden and Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer, and Nancy Pelosi have been calling for, for the last couple years, don't stay home. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Go protect your country by electing these two Republicans.
CAVUTO:  Got it.
All right. Well, that was a FOX Alert there. So, you're for the two Republicans then. That's good to know.
(LAUGHTER)
BARBOUR:  Yes.
CAVUTO:  Haley Barbour, seriously, very good seeing you again.
I know you're not getting much sleep through this process, but be well, Haley Barbour, the Georgia Battleground Fund national co-chair, in these crucial, very unusual developments, where you have two Senate races in the same state at the same time.
But it is as close as a tick. The polls do bear that out. So, we will keep an eye on that.
Also keeping an eye on the count that goes on in Georgia, the hand count that goes on in Georgia. We might get an indication of that tomorrow.
But, in the meantime, the president and his campaign team selective about a partial recount in Wisconsin. How likely is that?
The read after this.

CAVUTO:  All right, vaccine help is on the way, at least two of them right now. And they're going to get in precious few hands in the beginning, but it is the start of something.
The former FDA commissioner on why a little can go a long way -- after this.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAVUTO:  Not the whole state of Wisconsin, but a good chunk of it, including Milwaukee, which you're looking at live right now, the Trump campaign committing about $3 million for a partial Wisconsin recount that will include that area.
Andy McCarthy, the former assistant U.S. attorney, on the significance of this.
It's not a whole state, but it's a big chunk of it, where a lot of these ballot irregularities the Trump campaign says originated. Now, the bigger question is whether that changes any votes, but your thoughts on the process they're using?
ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think it's a fair enough Neil.
I mean, the recounts don't typically change more than a couple of hundred votes. And what we're talking about here is the need to change thousands of votes. So I think the prospect for success is slim.
But when you have states that are at this kind of a tight margin, it's perfectly reasonable to seek a recount. I think there's a lot of other things that you could look at that have gone on here that are more questionable than asking for recounts in tight states.
CAVUTO:  Now, I'm just wanting, to your point, this all started in half-a- dozen states, battlegrounds all.
We didn't know that Georgia, for example, would be considered a battleground, but it is what it is. I'm just wondering, at what point -- forget legally -- you start doing the math and you crunch the numbers and you say, all right, this is just not going to work?
MCCARTHY:  Yes.
Well, I already think they have an insurmountable math problem. And it really isn't so much Wisconsin, Neil. It's Pennsylvania. At this point, what's left of the lawsuit that they're bringing in the Middle -- the federal court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania will not have enough votes to overcome what's now, I understand, an 83,000-vote lead for Biden.
So, even if the Trump campaign were to win the claims that they have left in that lawsuit, we're talking about somewhere between a couple of hundred and a few thousand votes, but it won't be near enough to close the gap. And they need to win both Pennsylvania and two other states.
So, at a minimum, you have to win Pennsylvania, and, if you can't, I think it's over.
CAVUTO:  Andy, any prospect of the U.S. Supreme Court getting involved?
Could any of these various legal challenges and questioning votes in the Philadelphia area, partial recounts around Milwaukee and elsewhere, any of that have any chance of bumping up to the highest court in the land?
MCCARTHY:  Yes, I really wish it would, Neil, because it'd be nice to for the Supreme Court to issue a ruling that said that courts and bureaucrats are not allowed to change state law about elections in the run-up to an election. That would be a good thing for the country.
But, at this point, I think the case that's most...
CAVUTO:  What was at stake in Pennsylvania. You're talking about in Pennsylvania, right? Yes.
MCCARTHY:  Yes. Yes.
And -- but the thing is...
CAVUTO:  Right.
MCCARTHY:  ... it'd be nice to straighten that out for the next election.
But we're now talking about -- the further we get into this, the more we see, we're talking about such a sparse number of votes, that it couldn't make a difference, which would be a reason for the court not to take the case.
And then you have a case out in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, also Pennsylvania, Friday of last week, where they basically say, there's no individual right for people to force governments to comply with their own regulations.
CAVUTO:  Right.
MCCARTHY:  You have to have a personalized injury to have a lawsuit.
And a lot of what the campaign is complaining about is that the states didn't comply with their own law, which is going to be very hard to get heard in federal court.
CAVUTO:  We shall see.
Andy McCarthy, thank you very much, my friend. Good seeing you, even under these confusing legal circumstances.
MCCARTHY:  Thanks, Neil.
CAVUTO:  By the way, to Andy's point, we are beginning to get somewhat of a timeline from the White House about when all of this could cease and desist, but some advice from no less than the grandson of Richard Nixon as to when you do call it, how you call it, and how you show the nation you're calling it -- after this.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAVUTO:  All right, there might be a sense of some closure on this.
John Roberts at the White House is learning from some campaign officials that the current trajectory of challenges on this entire campaign and the count that's going on would likely take us to the end of November. In the first week of December, there will likely be some movement toward a conclusion.
Whether it means an outright concession really depends on where they are in all of that.
I had a chance earlier to catch up with the Christopher Nixon Cox. He is the grandson of the former President Richard Nixon, who knew a thing or two about when to concede and when to let the nation move on. He said the president is well within his power to do what he's doing, but, like his granddad, there is a point at saying, this is over.
Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
CHRISTOPHER NIXON COX, GRANDSON OF PRESIDENT NIXON:  Of course, the president has every right and the campaign team has every right, if they believe there's fraud, to challenge it in the courts. That's true.
But I think that there's a very good political reason for, when the time comes, the president to make a gracious transition, if that's what it ends up being. And I think that the 1960 and '68 election provide a very good comparison.
As you mentioned, in 1960, my grandfather lost the election. It was a very close election, especially in the popular vote. It's very close. And there's rampant or allegations of rampant voter fraud in Illinois and potentially in Texas, which could have put my grandfather over the top.
However, when it became clear that there was no path towards winning a court case to prove that, my grandfather did graciously concede. And, of course, that set him up to come back in 1968 and run for president.
Now, I don't know what President Trump's ambitions are. But he certainly has a lot of energy, and certainly seems to want to remain politically active. And four years is not that long away. And, of course, Grover Cleveland is an example of someone who was president, lost...
CAVUTO:  Absolutely.
NIXON COX:  ... and then won again four years later
So, at some point, a gracious transition and concession, along with his allies, staying out in the public eye, and saying, well, maybe we were robbed, but let's come back and win the next time, that could set the president up for a -- for running again in four years, if that's what he wants to do.
And that could set him up very nicely to do that.
CAVUTO:  Your grandfather was very strongly urged to challenge that 1960 election.
We did learn that there was something to the process. He respected the process. And I'm wondering, too, when he won in 1968, and he met with Lyndon Johnson -- now, he hadn't challenged Lyndon Johnson, who decided not to run that year. He had beaten his vice president, Hubert Humphrey.
But the two of them struck up a relationship that lasted for years, and how to work with one another and sort of bounce things off one another.
So, in the modern times, we're kind of used to seeing the outgoing administration work with the incoming administration.
We're not seeing that now. Now, I know there are times when it's tense, with Herbert Hoover and FDR in the same car, and word, legend has it they never said a word to each other. So I understand that there's friction, and that's to be totally understood.
I'm just wondering, if it doesn't happen this time, for whatever reasons -- and you're right. The president has every right to pursue legal recourse of elections that he feels did not go well or to what it should have been in so many of these battleground states.
But at what point should he graciously step aside, if it's not going to change the outcome? Or is he well within his rights, say, I'm not going to go to the inauguration, I'm not going to ride from the White House to the Capitol with the guy I think I actually beat?
NIXON COX:  Well, I think it's such a great symbol of our democracy, going back to the election of 1800, that we do have a peaceful transition of power, and that the symbol of that are the incoming and outgoing president coming together to show that there is a peaceful transition, that I would hope and I actually expect that he would do that.
I think that, at the end of the day, President Trump does care a lot about the country, and that I think he can put aside that personal -- the personal difficulty to do that one last great thing for the country.
And I think, of course, once he's an ex-president, he can say what he wants, he can do what he wants.
(LAUGHTER)
NIXON COX:  And I think, again, having that -- maintaining that symbol will be important for him.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
CAVUTO:  Christopher Nixon Cox, the grandson of Richard M. Nixon, who proves that you can come back, depending on, well, how you come back, I guess.
All right, are we going to see stimulus again? Forget about in a Joe Biden presidency, if it comes to that. How about in a lame-duck session of Congress?
Some growing signals it could happen -- after this.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):  We might lose the hardest-hit small businesses in the homestretch because Democrats have refused, refused to let us continue helping.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  Our bill passed in the middle of May. Since then, people have died because the Republicans in the House and Senate would not sign up to crush the virus.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CAVUTO:  All right, I know that doesn't sound like a deal could be had here, but there is growing talk that, the political stances notwithstanding, that both sides are eager to cobble something regarding coronavirus stimulus, and in the lame-duck session.
It could happen even before president-elect Biden takes office.
Senator Bill Cassidy, Louisiana Republican, with us right now.
Senator, is that doable in your eyes?
SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA):  What's that? What's that, Neil?
CAVUTO:  Is that doable, that a -- you could have a lame-duck session approve a stimulus measure and get it out?
CASSIDY:  Yes, I think so.
I mean, there's enough things that have to be done. The big thing is that I don't think Democrats trust that, if we do a bill, and more is required later, they would be able to get the more required later.
But, if you look at where Republicans are starting, more for the Payroll Protection Plan, vaccines, testing, money for schools, that's a good place to start.
And if you need to add something more later, you can. I, frankly, would like to have some state and local aid in there as well, some banking relief for minority banks, et cetera. There's a lot of common ground.
I'm a big advocate for getting what you can get.
CAVUTO:  I'm wondering, though. Many Republicans have argued, Senator, that there is a lot of stimulus dough that has not yet been put to work, so why add to that?
Are you in that camp, or waiting to see what, let's say, assuming it's a President Biden on January 20, what he does?
CASSIDY:  I am absolutely not in that camp.
And let me give you some examples. We have schools that are again shutting down because of increased rates of coronavirus. Now, you may dispute the logic of closing down elementary schools when those children are unlikely to spread the disease.
But if you could make those schools safer, then they are more likely to have children in them, which is overall helping the economy. It'll take more money for that. It'll take more money for testing. It's been shown now pretty clearly that, if you test regularly an entire population of employees or students, you decrease the incidence of infection, you keep that economy rolling better yet.
We need more money to distribute that vaccine. So, I think there are things that we all agree upon are needed. There are some things that are controversial. We may end up putting those to the side.
Let's get the stuff that we know works. That's just the commonsense thing to do.
CAVUTO:  You know, you're a doctor as well. I always forget that.
But one of the things I have been that people have been concerned about are these spikes in cases. I don't know the latest what's going on in Louisiana, Senator, but they're imposing lots of new restrictions in lots of states. New York City's going to stop in person classes.
What do you think about these measures, some enacted by Republican governors, a half-a-dozen of whom these days are urging, if not demanding masks, and that sort of stuff? All justified in your eyes?
CASSIDY:  So, it really -- it really depends on which one you're talking about, Neil.
There is minimal evidence that children in elementary school going to school spread the infection among the classmates. I read recently there's not a reported case of a student giving the infection to a teacher.
That is so important, because, if you think about disadvantaged children, less likely to have Internet at home, less likely to be computer-savvy, and more likely to have parents who have to work.
So, if we're going to close down an elementary school because somebody thinks there's a high rate of infection and we must do something, but there's no science to it, that's wrong. It's wrong because it's anti- science. It's wrong because it's bad for the children. It's wrong because it's bad for the economy of that family.
So, depending on what you're speaking of, I think, as long as we're science-driven, I may be for it, or I may say, man, that doesn't make sense at all.
CAVUTO:  Got it.
Doctor, Senator, good seeing you again. Glad to see you healthy and well again as well.
CASSIDY:  Thank you, Neil.
CAVUTO:  Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on this.
The former FDA commissioner Mark McClellan on these two promising vaccines.
They are promising, indeed, but they might not get out in the waves that a lot of people hope.
The FDA commissioner on why that might not matter. It's good news just the same.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CAVUTO:  You know, I thought it was just my state of New Jersey maybe overreacting a little bit. But, in Kentucky, listen to some of these new rules.
No more than two families can be inside, not to exceed eight people, so not like the 10 people thing in New Jersey. Funerals and weddings, no more than
25 people. That obviously does not include the deceased. Bars and restaurants are closed for indoor service.
I don't know. I can't make sense of this.
But, fortunately, I know a very smart man who can, former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan.
Mark, when I see these kind of measures being taken, I think in California, too, where they're talking about really restricting indoor activity, even, I believe, wearing a mask inside homes...
DR. MARK MCCLELLAN, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER:  Yes.
CAVUTO:  ... that might help me, if I have to lose weight. If I'm wearing the mask in between bites of a meal, I might just say, what the heck? I will lose a lot of weight. It will be good.
But what do you make of all these measures? They're freaking a lot of people out. And a lot of people say, well, wait a minute, don't we have these vaccines coming our way? Do we really have to go crazy with this?
What do you say?
MCCLELLAN:  Well, good to be back with you, even under these challenging circumstances.
But you're seeing across the country states take more drastic measures because the caseloads for COVID and the growth in cases are getting so high, that it's really threatening health care systems in many places around the country.
So, this is the biggest surge we have had. We knew this was coming. It's winter. People are indoors more, as you said, spending more time together, and they're tired of this.
But the consequence is, we have got a lot more spread all over the country.
So there are steps that governors are taking towards requiring masks inside, requiring smaller groups. I don't think anybody's going to come to your home and tell you have got too many people there.
But I think it's a reminder of just how challenging things are right now, from the standpoint of containing the virus. And while vaccines are coming, we have had great news on vaccines this week again, that's still a few months off.
CAVUTO:  Yes.
MCCLELLAN:  People may start getting the first round of vaccines in a month or so. But that's going to be a limited number, very high-risk individuals, like health care workers, people in nursing homes.
It's going to be some months before there are enough people vaccinated that it really starts having an impact on spread. And, remember, these first vaccines are two doses. So, you have got to get the vaccine, wait 21, 28 days, and then it's some time after that before even you start getting some immunity.
So, this is still a ways off. We have got a brighter months ahead. But the coming weeks are going to be really challenging. That's why you're seeing so many states take these more extreme steps.
CAVUTO:  Yes, I'm just wondering though, Doctor -- and you can help me with this -- that some have argued that it doesn't have to be everybody in the population getting it, far from it, to your point, to health workers have, the most vulnerable, nursing homes, et cetera. I get that.
MCCLELLAN:  Right.
CAVUTO:  But this other talk of that this could develop a herd immunity...
MCCLELLAN:  Herd immunity.
CAVUTO:  ... I mean, do you buy that kind of stuff, that few have it, right, but that, because this is building, it's actually helping for those who don't have it?
What do you make of that?
MCCLELLAN:  It's definitely helping, but it's going to be a gradual process.
It's not like, one day soon, we're going to flip a light switch, and we're going to have enough people suddenly vaccinated that the virus doesn't have anywhere really to go.
What's likely to happen is, in this staged process, gradually, we're going to have more and more people vaccinated. And what that's going to do is probably slow down the spread of the virus. So, it's not going to be as likely for someone who gets close to someone else who's infected to spread it, because they're more likely to have a -- one of them's more likely to have a vaccine and not be infected.
But that's going to be a gradual process. So, even as we start getting vaccinations out, which is going to protect us, we're still going to have to keep wearing masks, still going to have to keep a distance, but it won't be as bad as it is now.
It won't be these surging, really rapid growth in cases. And, hopefully, we will get away from the health care systems and the health care workers being as overwhelmed as they are now all over the country.
CAVUTO:  Yes, they are overwhelmed.
Mark McClellan, thank you very, very much, served as the FDA commissioner, also an economist by training, so those twin skill sets there, not too shabby.
All right, so we are following what's going on in Kentucky and California and New York and New Jersey. But the far more sweeping move is that the nation's largest public school system is closed for in person classes for the time being. This will go through at least Thanksgiving, possibly longer.
It depends on the incidence of positive cases. And, right now, in New York City, there are enough of them to keep at least the schools doing things virtually, much like the rest of us.
