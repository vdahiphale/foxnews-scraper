Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Over the Fourth of July weekend, I went to Alaska to fish with Wounded Warriors and their spouses. They are the guest of Operation Heal our Patriots, a Reverend Franklin Graham and Samaritan's Purse Program.
Now, the program is a helping hand and it's also a gesture of thanks to the troops and to their spouses for all they have done and sacrificed. And the troops and the spouses I met are great. They are very humble. And even with their horrible lifelong and painful injuries, they insist it was an honor to serve our nation. There was fishing and, yes, lots of other fun. Most amazing, though, was how positive these Wounded Warriors and their families are after all they have been through. Sharing this time in the Alaskan wilderness with them was absolutely inspiring. Reverend Graham and Samaritan's Purse, they deserve a lot of credit for giving military couples great weeks all summer long. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And as I fished with the military couples and as I laughed with them and, yes, saw their painful and permanent injuries, I could not help but think, what kind of message do you think it sends to our hero troops, both active and veterans, when our government, meaning President Obama, can't be bothered to help fast-track the case of one Marine imprisoned in Mexico for making a wrong turn? Does that bother you? It does me. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
