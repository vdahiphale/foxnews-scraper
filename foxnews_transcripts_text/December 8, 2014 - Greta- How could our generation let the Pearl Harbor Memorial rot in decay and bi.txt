Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. December 7, 1941, the day of infamy. Japan struck Pearl Harbor, and more than 2,400 Americans were killed. Now 73 years later, a new generation, ours, is doing something actually disgraceful.
I just read about an internal report from the National Park Service, an internal report. It's another way to say they don't want you to know about it. Here is what the report says: the Pearl Harbor Memorial is in decay, not being maintained. For example, peeling paint in the museum - horribly embarrassing. There's so much more, including details about accumulated bird droppings, bird poop or bird -- you know the other word. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I can't believe my generation would allow that, the accumulation of bird droppings on this memorial. It's so insulting to those who died for us. I actually can't believe it. How can we possibly be that disrespectful to those who died at Pearl Harbor? Those 2,400 Americans died, so the rest of us can be free. Is that really the best we can do for their sacrifice? Let it get stained with bird droppings and an internal report? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think it's just awful. Don't tell me we don't have the money. We can find the money. There's plenty spent on government waste around here. Why is it so hard for some to just do the right thing? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
