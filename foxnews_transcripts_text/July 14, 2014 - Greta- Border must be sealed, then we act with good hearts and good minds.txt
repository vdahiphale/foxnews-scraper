Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. Our politicians can act dopey. Think about this. If a pipe freezes in your living room and then bursts, spreading water uncontrollably with great force all over your house, drenching everything, what do you do? Duh. You stop the water. You run down to the basement and turn off the water. Every dimwit knows that. Only a fool would run upstairs and get a pack of towels and throw them on the endless spray of water. That's just plain stupid, right?
Well, that's our border and it's a crisis. Our border has been, and is, bursting for decades. People are flooding the country. Our government has utterly failed us - failed us with that 1986 immigration reform bill and failed us every year since. This crisis is squarely on their shoulders, and it just got worse. It's a humanitarian crisis now involving children. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, that's it. No more happy talk of any kind just to get votes. Americans are onto that phony stuff. Americans now need the problem fixed. We need to fix the root of the cause. The border must be sealed, really sealed. And once that's done, we must act with good hearts and good minds. We need to figure out a way, as a nation, how to deal with people here illegally. Many of them are our friends, our co-workers, or people we might even want to know. The solution should not be about winning. That's petty. But instead, whatever it may be, it should reflect our goodness and our sense of fairness and decency. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's my "Off the Record" tonight.
