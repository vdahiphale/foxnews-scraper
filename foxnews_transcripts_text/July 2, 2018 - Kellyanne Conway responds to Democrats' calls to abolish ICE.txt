JEANINE PIRRO, GUEST HOST: And welcome to "Hannity." I'm Jeanine Pirro, in tonight for Sean. 
In less than one week from tonight, President Trump will announce his pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Early this morning, the president met with four potential candidates and plans to meet with at least two more later this week.

Meanwhile, during an interview with our own Maria Bartiromo, President Trump weighed in on how or if Roe versus Wade will play a role in his decision. Take a look.

MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Are you going to ask your nominees beforehand how they might vote on Roe versus Wade? 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's a big one, and probably not. They're all saying don't do that, you shouldn't do. But I'm putting conservative people on.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
And I'm very proud of Neil Gorsuch, he's been outstanding. His opinions are, you know, so well written, so brilliant. 
And I'm going to try and do something. I like that. But I don't think I will be specific in the questions I'll be asking. And I'm actually told that I shouldn't be.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BARTIROMO: Because on the campaign trail, you said you would leave it to the states.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: Well, maybe someday it will be to the states. You never know how that's going to turn out. That's a very complex question. The Roe v. Wade is probably the one that people are talking about in terms of having an effect. But we'll see what happens. But it could well end up with states at some point.

PIRRO: And joining us with more from the White House on what will be an incredibly important decision is Ed Henry -- Ed.

ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Judge, good to see you. 
And, in fact, what the president is doing is moving very quickly to get through these interviews of potential nominees to the high court because he wants to get the clock ticking so it gets harder and harder for Democrats to justify any obstruction, any delay beyond the midterm elections, what they say they want to do. They want to stall this. 
The president is likely to get his nominee in the end because of the precedent that has been set for just a simple majority. But in that interview with Maria that you mentioned, he made it clear he would not ask any candidate about Roe v. Wade. That is in part aimed at trying to secure yes votes from those two women, pro-choice Republicans, Murkowski and Collins.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

But Collins already indicating this weekend she'll oppose anyone who would vote to change existing law on abortion. Collins says that the White House has told her they're actually expanding the list beyond the original 25 names that the president talked about it on the campaign because of her concerns.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        }
      
But the president runs a risk of upsetting evangelical conservatives who love that list of names. We're hearing though that the president seems to be standing strong and has now the list down to about six. Appellate court judges from the right, Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, Amul Thapar, Joan Larsen, Raymond Kethledge, and Thomas Hardiman. 
We've heard these names before. The president today made clear the list is actually getting smaller.

HENRY: So, given the possible Republican no votes and on top of the fact that Republican John McCain has not been voting because of health, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may need to reel in some Democrats who supported Justice Neil Gorsuch, all of whom have tough re-election battles where the president carried it big. You see them there, Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin.
As for the push by more liberal Democratic senators like Chuck Schumer who say they want to push this beyond the midterms, we checked, and it's interesting. Four of the last eight justices who have been confirmed have been confirmed in midterm election years. So, that argument by Democrats can be difficult, Judge.

Joining us now with reaction is the author of the upcoming book "Why We Fight: Recovering America's Will to Win", Fox News national security strategist, Sebastian Gorka, former Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich, and Fox News contributor, Ari Fleischer.

All right, guys, I want to reference that video that we saw where Michael Moore is calling for a million people to surround the U.S. capitol to prevent Senate vote, that's what it's for, to prevent the vote. And now, they're talking about getting companies to move out of states if Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski don't vote the way they want. 
But the most interesting I thought was Tom Rogers who talked about increasing the number of justices on the court for every conservative justice who is put on.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Is there, I'm going to start with you, Ari, is there any kind of precedent to assume that if a conservative justice dies, that only a conservative can replace him? Or if a swing justice retires, that we've got to put a swing person in there?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, of course not. There isn't. Here's the beauty of our system, judge, why I sleep so well at night. The reason Donald Trump can put whoever he wants on the Supreme Court within reason, and the Senate will confirm it, is because the American people elected Donald Trump and the Republican Senate. 
If the American people had elected a Democratic president and Democratic Senate, the Democrat could have done that. These decisions are fundamentally made by the people. And our system works.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's why Donald Trump is in this position. And when the Democrats talk about going to the extremes they are, a million people around the capitol, now, that's Michael Moore who said that, they're talking about subverting the system so they can save their version of the system. 
That is not democratic. That is as wrong as wrong gets.

DENNIS KUCINICH, FORMER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN: Well, judge, we have to keep in mind that Roe v. Wade is definitely a flash point. You have millions of American women and men who stand with them are not going to be silent if a new Supreme Court appointee favors criminalizing abortion. 
The Burger court in 1973 declared that there's a right to privacy under due process in the 14th Amendment. And I think that anything that goes beyond that balancing and creates an imbalance will cause people to mobilize all over the country. 
PIRRO: Well, and so, Sebastian, I mean, what do you -- Sebastian Gorka, what do you say to that, the concept that, you know, they're going to mobilize? It's not as though any Supreme Court nominee is going to get up there and say, I support Roe v. Wade, or I don't support Roe v. Wade, or I'm going to be an activist or I'm not.

        }
      
Isn't it all going to be based on decisions that have already been written and interpretations of those? 
SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST: You're the judge, you know better than anybody. This is just scare tactics. They've been pulling this out since Bork's nomination in the 1980s. Roe v. Wade, as you said, we don't even know who the president is going to nominate. 
This is the left. They disagree with democracy when it doesn't go their way. And they understand the stakes involved here, Judge.

If we have a conservative justice appointed and then voted in by the Senate, we will inoculate the republic for at least a generation from the lunacy of the left. From the identity politics, the idea is that we don't need immigration from the lunacy of the left, from the identity politics. The idea is that we don't need immigration policed on the border, the idea that you can give everything to everybody for free, the legislating from the bench that we've seen for years now. It will be defended in the Supreme Court by constitutionalists.

PIRRO: (AUDIO GAP) -- ran for office, he said he was going to vote or put conservative justices on the Supreme Court bench, no one should be surprised. We're talking about Heritage and the Federalist Society. 
I mean, I can't imagine that they aren't individuals who are pro-life. But I think the significant point, Ari, is that when a Lindsey Graham gets on television yesterday and he says, yes, I don't have a problem if you're, you know, what your politics are. I just don't want Roe v. Wade to be overturned. That's interesting.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
FLEISCHER: Yes. But, you know, it is really what the senators think about their individual positions is not what's at stake because the Senate positions will cancel each other out. It is the decisions made on the basis of facts presented in a court of law and the justices weigh in. And again, that's the way our system should work. It's not a roll call vote of the United States Senate. 
But what I have noticed in the past, there is a difference between the two parties. There's a litmus test in the Democratic Party. And you heard it all the time, the Democratic primaries, the Democrats always say, I will not nominate anybody who isn't for gay marriage, who isn't for abortion. It is an overt litmus test.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');

        }
      
Republicans typically say that they want somebody with a temperament that is proper for the bench, to hear the cases and to hear them wisely. And Donald Trump has said he'll name conservatives. So, you know, I understand the Democrats have a fear that Roe v. Wade will be overturned and the states will decide it, and it will be allowed somewhere, others places won't.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But they act as if abortion is the only thing the Supreme Court does.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Right.
FLEISCHER: It is the first issue and the only issue so many Democrats talk about. It's so much broader than that and that's why you really do want somebody who is a big thinker and I think that's frankly the list that Donald Trump has put together.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: And, you know, Dennis Kucinich, I mean, there are two women on that list, and I know that, you know, as I said, it's almost as though this is apocalyptic right now for the left. But nominating a woman won't make a darned bit of difference will it for the left? 
KUCINICH: Well, whether it's a man or a woman, and, you know, I certainly would applaud President Trump for considering a woman to be appointed to the court. But whatever the gender of the person, one must be aware that we're at a time of great polarization in this country, and people are very afraid that some basic rights that have been constitutionally protected under the 14th Amendment for example, for the last 45 years, could just be vitiated by a new court. 
So, that's -- you know, we have to realize that's a concern. And what we need to know, I think, Judge, is in a larger country, polity, we need to find ways of depolarizing this whole debate over abortion and start to focus on things like prenatal care, post-natal care, child care, universal health care, living wage, and shift the debate to really show that whatever your position, we can appreciate life. 
PIRRO: But, Dennis, wouldn't you agree that part of the problem is that the left is going crazy in the event that someone is pro-life and is appointed to the bench. I mean, that's what it's about. They're making it an issue. You can sit there and say, it's great, we should worry about childcare.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Sebastian Gorka, I'll go to you. At the end of the day, you've got Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly. I mean, these guys are, and lady, are in a tough spot right now. But let's assume that Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski decide, if -- she's not pro-choice or he's not pro-choice, I'm not interested. What do you think the harm is going to be if these Dems, in the Trump heavy states, vote for this justice? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GORKA: Well, if you look at what's happening, just the last few days and weeks, politically in America, it's as if a Democrat Party don't understand what happened on November 8, 2016. They're doubling down. 
The idea that you have somebody who wants to have no borders on the South, who believes that we have black sites run by ICE, these people want to boycott cruise liners in Alaska? The Dems are so out of touch with America, it's going to be very, very good for the Republicans and the president come November and come 2020. 
PIRRO: There's no question, Ari, that in the end, the president will surely get his way, it's not like there's going to be, you know, the left is going to be able to say we want this person.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
President is going to nominate someone he wants. But to be realistic about it, if this second justice and when this second justice is appointed, we will have a Supreme Court that is conservative, or conservative leaning, without a doubt, for the next generation. 
FLEISCHER: I think conservative leaning. I don't think you can say conservative yet, because I think it's a history of the Supreme Court shows, they have their independent minds that they use. Justice Roberts might turn out to be more moderate than people think. We just don't know. And that why I value intellect, I value temperament as opposed to positions previously taken. 
Times change and I want to see what kinds of minds our justices have. That's the most important thing on the bench. So, a lot of it from both the right and the left, you can be -- you can go too far ballyhooing how far change can go, and especially for an institution like the Supreme Court. We'll see. 
PIRRO: And, Dennis, with respect to the hearing itself, what do you think some of these candidates, or nominees are going through right now? They're meeting with the president, four have met, two more as I understand it are going to be meeting with him. How do you think they communicate to him without him asking the question, how conservative and supportive they would be?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
KUCINICH: I think we have to take the president at his word that he hasn't asked for a litmus test. And I think there'll just be an honest exchange and the president will make his decision based on the interaction I would think, you know, from reports that I've heard from other people who've been appointed. So, we'll see. But you can bet that those whose names are coming up are going to be carefully scrutinized.
And, keep in mind, you know, this nomination is going to go through. We have to keep in mind that Mr. Obama's nomination of Garland was held up for 293 days. And never saw the light of day. So, you know, that's the politics. 
PIRRO: Politics are rough. But in the end, I mean, at least we don't have the filibuster, judicial filibuster, Sebastian Gorka, and it's just right now a majority vote. And if we -- you know, John McCain is not voting, if we lose the two that we might lose, I mean, there are three that may come over. 
Last words, Sebastian Gorka?

        }
      
GORKA: Well, to quote a certain former senator from Illinois, elections have consequences. And so does the fact that now the Republicans have the House and the Senate and these rules are now in place. After the president and his meetings, I know exactly what's happening. 
The president, you know, judge, has a preternatural capacity to read individuals very, very rapidly. He's meeting them. He gets a gut instinct for who they are and I think it's going to be one question. Are they originalists? Do they look at the Constitution as talking about eternal truths?
If he thinks that, then that person is going to the top of the list.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Gentlemen, thanks so much for being with us this evening. 
KUCINICH: Thank you.

PIRRO: Welcome back to "Hannity". 
In their continued push for open borders, many elected Democrats are joining the far left to attack ICE, with some even calling for it to be abolished. Take a look. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)
SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: I think there's no question that we've got to critically reexamine ICE and its role and the way that it's being administered and the work it is doing. We need to probably think about starting from scratch. 
REP. MARK POCAN, D-WIS.: ICE isn't doing what it was created to do, it's being used as his own personal police force, and in those actions, it's actually making us less safe. 
SEN. KRISTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y.: I don't think ICE today is working as intended. I believe --

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GILLIBRAND: I believe that it has become a deportation force. And I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues. And I think you should re-imagine ICE 
REP. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT, D-N.Y.: It's too aggressive and over the top, and I think it's lost its course. So, therefore, we should replace it with something sensible, something practical. They still have to be law enforcement agency but one that's a little bit more humane. 
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS.: We need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our morality and --

PIRRO: During his interview with Maria Bartiromo, President Trump responded to calls to end ICE and even issued a warning for the Democrats.

TRUMP: You know, ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13 and they take them out, because they're much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10. And these are the ones, you get rid of ICE, you're going to have a country that you're going to be afraid to walk out of your house. 
I love that issue if they're going to actually do that. They're seriously talking about that? Because they -- you are going to have a country that is crime ridden, the border patrol, the border patrol agents, ICE, these people are incredible. 
Between Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi and getting rid of ICE and having open borders -- and the biggest thing, you have open borders, all it's going to do is lead to massive, massive crime. That's going to be their platform. Open borders, which equals crime. I think they'll never win another election. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: And yesterday, the president tweeted: The liberal left also known as the Democrats, want to get rid of ICE, who do a fantastic job and want open borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable. Make America great again. 
Joining me now to discuss is counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. 
All right. Good evening, Kellyanne.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I have to tell you something. I just wrote it down again. When they say ICE isn't doing what it was created to do, what do they think ICE was created to do, serve coffee and tea? 
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Well, that's an excellent question that nobody is asking them. I think it's time to tamp down the emotion and go for some of the information. If you quiz most of those people, including elected officials, as to why ICE is created in the first place and response to 9/11, and what it is supposed to be doing. And, by the way, what it does do. 
At the White House, we're working on that exact document, so that people get information. ICE provides so many services that are critical to everyone's security in this country, Jeanine. You know when Kirsten Gillibrand jumping on the abolish ICE train up in New York where she's United States senator, ICE has removed 40 criminal aliens in recent weeks. I mean, she's going against the security of her own people when she calls for this nonsense. 
Cynthia Nixon, an actress who happens to be running for governor against Andrew Cuomo and pulling him to the left, is saying they're a terrorist organization. No, you've got it backwards, they stop terrorists from coming into the country. They also seize thousands of pounds of narcotics, and they get rid of child smugglers, and they detect people who are transnational gang members. 
I mean, the president is putting it this way. It's a binary choice. 
PIRRO: Right.
CONWAY: You're either for open borders and the crime that comes with that, or you're for a sovereign nation that has physical borders and less crime.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And let me tell you one more thing, you see this argument now with the Democrats. You've got some of the older, more senior Democrats saying, well, I don't think abolishing ICE is a good idea. And you got Democrats disingenuously talking about immigration reform. 
When President Trump brought them to the table in the cabinet room for one solid hour in January and all they wanted to talk about was the Dreamers, was DACA. They didn't want to talk about immigration reform. 
The president come on with the 70-point immigration plan and he boiled down to four points. It's been up for a vote in Congress. They're being disingenuous when they say they want to do this. 
PIRRO: Well, clearly. I mean, the president was willing with go with DACA and they weren't. I mean, think about it. When Obama was president and he had the ability and the House and the Senate, he didn't do anything. 
And you know, they want to make it an issue, or so it seems, and never resolve it, so they can say Republicans are against it. But what I don't understand, Kellyanne, it's like saying to people we don't want this police force and immigrants should be able to come in, we don't want to know who they are, what their records are, if they have a record, we just, you know, don't care. 
Do people not understand the impact -- 
CONWAY: You know what, Jeanine --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: -- on the finances here? 
CONWAY: That's right. Well, I think the average American does. I think Americans do understand the impact on their financial security, on their everyday security. 
But also, you've seen Mark Penn was Hillary Clinton's pollster and chief strategist. He came out with the Harvard Harris poll where he asked the question about abolishing ICE. Do you know not abolishing ICE, keeping ICE as it is, got tripartisan support, majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and independents all agreed that abolishing ICE is not a good idea. 
So, these Democrats who are just trying to out-left each other for 2020 having done nothing in 2017 or 2018 that I can point to, they're thinking about 2020. Folks, do something in 2018 that's meaningful. 
So, they're going -- they're saying abolish ICE, but basically, they're -- instead of advise and consent, they're doing obstruct and distract. Instead of abolish ICE, they should be thinking about how to protect our borders. 
And there are a lot of Democrats I think getting very nervous about where the party is truly going. And let's see who's following them leftward off the cliff. 
PIRRO: Well, I think that, you know, when the president said in that recent interview, he said you know what, it's a great issue. If they want to go forward with that, then you and I both know the president has great instincts. He really gets it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He's an outsider president, he made it. Everyone said he wouldn't make it. I mean, he gets it that Americans, in addition to the economy, they want safety and security. And by saying we want open borders, we're going to abolish ICE, we want something, who said they wanted something kinder and they don't want deportation force. 
CONWAY: Right. And let's reimagine ICE, whatever that means. 
Hey, Jeanine, guess what? They say they're for open borders but none of them has the guts to go and foot the bill. They go to the protest. 
They don't go in the well of the Senate. They don't go in the House and introduce bills that say we're going to reimagine borders, we're going to reimagine the fact that Congress made it a crime to enter the country illegally. None of them have the guts to do that. 
PIRRO: Yes. Well -- 
CONWAY: Where's the piece of legislation? 
It's cheap and easy to wave a sign and go scream into a megaphone. It's harder work to come back here to Washington and actually do your job. And you know what, this president, he's on task every single day and he ran successfully on issues like illegal immigration, like having borders and security. And he always talks about the drugs that are pouring in also. He's on top of that as well.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
CONWAY: Of all people, President -- 
PIRRO: It's a huge issue.
CONWAY: You know, President Obama this past weekend -- that's right, President Obama this past weekend told the Democrats, you got to do more than mope. They've gone from hope to mope. 
And they're wondering where he is. Why he is not a stronger voice? Why isn't he speaking up and speaking out in a number of these issues? 
PIRRO: OK.
CONWAY: Other than the $400,000 speeches. 
PIRRO: I want to ask you -- 
CONWAY: So, they're in disarray. We're not paying attention to that. We're just going to get borders -- sovereign nation with borders. 
PIRRO: All right. I want to ask you about Supreme Court nominees. I'm curious, two women in the group. The group is a very small group, maybe, five, maybe seven. What do you think? 
CONWAY: Well, don't forget the list is 25. And that's really the key here. This president has been transparent from the beginning. For two years.
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: But word is that the president is down to five. There may be two. We have Amy Barrett and Joan Larsen. What do you think of them? 
CONWAY: Well, I'm not going to comment on individual jurists. I can tell you that everyone that the president is considering checks all of the boxes for brilliant and capable, a judicial temperament, not putting their personal feelings where the Constitution belongs. 
The law, the judiciary interprets the laws. It does not make the laws. You have too many judges today making things up as they go along. The executive (Inaudible), the legislative branch should be making them. 
But it's the interpretive function of the judiciary that is so important here. This president has said he wants academic and professional credentials. And I think anyone you see on the list are people of great intellect, honorable men and women on the president's list. 
And look, the president put out his list then he added to the list. Jeanine, this man is so transparent and accountable, and such an important decisions. I want to tell you as somebody who spent some time with him today as well in this issue. I just have to tell you, he understands the gravity. As he has said nominating to the Supreme Court is one of the most important things that any president does. 
PIRRO: Of course, of course it is. 
CONWAY: And every -- all of the nominees, all of the justices on the Supreme Court, outlast anyone's presidency of eight years. But in many ways some of these jurists outlast the president who actually nominated them. They understand, he understands that you're talking about 30, 40, 45 years of jurisprudence. And he takes the decision very -- this with great gravity and responsibility. 
Now other people are advising, but it's his decision to make and he's respectful to the United States senators--
(CROSSTALK)
PIRRO: That ultimate without a doubt.
CONWAY: -- on the right and the left, you know, who are advising and consenting as well. 
PIRRO: Well, I have a feeling that the president will probably, as with Gorsuch, get the person on the Supreme Court that he wants. 
Anyway, Kellyanne Conway, good to have you on the show, thank you. 
And coming up, Michelle Malkin, and Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi. And by the way, don't forget to buy a copy of my book on Amazon or Barnes and Noble, "Liars, Leakers and Liberals, the Case Against the anti-Trump Conspiracy." And here I have it, but it's not of the yet. So the question is, is this real or just a cover. What do you think? E-mail me. Go on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. Is it a real book or not? More Hannity after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: Welcome back to Hannity. Some members of America's left are continuing their ongoing assault on the women associated with the Trump administration. The Washington Post Michelle Rubin actually encouraged the left to continue harassing Sarah Sanders. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
JENNIFER RUBIN, CONTRIBUTOR, MSNBC: We're not going to let them go through life unscathed. Sara Huckabee has no right to live a life of no fuss no muss after lying to the press, after inciting against the press. These people should be made uncomfortable, and I think that's a life sentence frankly. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: That's not all. Over the weekend, Michelle Wolf, best known for botching the White House correspondence dinner with attacks again Sarah Sanders, called Ivanka Trump a selection of names some of which are too graphic to air. But here's an example. 
 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICHELLE WOLF, COMEDIAN: Is your nickname herpes because you're not necessarily the most dangerous person in the administration but you're very unpleasant, totally incurable and you always show up when we're about to get (muted). Remember this course is a path to change and Ivanka is the prettiest tumor in the swiftly moving cancer. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: And joining me now with reaction is the host of Michelle Malkin investigates on CR TV, syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin, and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. 
And I should note that it's Jennifer Rubin with Washington Post. All right, now, you know, I thought it was over. I really did. After my show on Saturday night, I said, you know what, they probably just vented. But over the weekend they got worse. We're not going to let this one go unscathed, but needs to be a life sentence. And, of course, Pam, we know what happened to you, and Michelle, both of you have been harassed. Now it's continuing. Pam, what's your take on this? 
PAM BONDI, FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, my take on this is Michelle Wolf does not know Ivanka. I do. She's a loving wife, a remarkable mother, she's great human being. And she's not going to break down. They couldn't get to the president so they think they can get to people around him. 
Ivanka is not going to be broken down by this. But none of us are going to be bullied. But everyone who say these things they need to realize and they know this, Jeanine, just like you, Michelle and I know this, there are people out there who exist who will be emboldened by this to do harm to someone. Something bad is going to happen. And everyone just needs to say stop it, unequivocally, stop. Stop doing this now. 
PIRRO: You know, Michelle, I had some one on my show, and he said well, you know, it's on both sides. I said to him, I said, do me a favor. Tell me where conservative women have taken on a Democrat female whether she's elected or not elected, or spokesperson, give me one example. It's the same on both sides. I don't know that to be the case, do you? 
MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, CRTV: It's not the case. And I've documented the war on conservative women for upwards of 20 years now. It is not, and never has been, Judge Jeanine, the case that conservative women, who very vigorously oppose ideas on the other side go and target the children of people with which we disagree. 
We're not the ones that have forced the other side to have to hire a private security guard to speak on college campuses as I have over the years and so many other female conservatives who are outspoken. 
What this is about is the fact that the c word, the real offensive c word to the left, is conservative. This is about criminalizing and ostracizing female conservatives for being female and conservative. The left considers it an ideological felony to be a woman and a conservative. And even more than that, they think it's a capital offense to be a minority and female and conservative. So that's what this is really about. 
PIRRO: And, Pam, you know, what she says is so true, I mean you were at the movie theater, you know, and I've gone to universities, I've had to have security, I mean, most of my life anyway. But you know, going forward, it doesn't sound like they're doing anything to tamp it down. What should Republican conservative women do? 
BONDI: Well, first of all, you won't be bullied, Michelle won't be bullied, Sarah won't be bullied, Ivanka won't be bullied, I won't be bullied. But the other side has got to stop it. You got to just unequivocally, all of our Democrat friends out there who we all know need to come out and say stop it. Stop it, this isn't right. Someone is going to get hurt. 
And I told you, there was a state rep with her children--
PIRRO: Right.
BONDI: -- children, being screamed at and harassed by the same people that came after me. So this, women attacking women, got to stop. 
PIRRO: You know, Michelle, she's right. But this isn't about civility any more. If we say stop it, don't on, this is that going to stop them? No. Should charges--
(CROSSTALK) 
BONDI: They need to say it. 
MALKIN: Yes, I think that there needs to be -- yes, I think there needs to be legal consequences for people who are inciting violence. And the best thing that we can do is what we're doing. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, turn the table and put the mirror on people who are nothing of the type of self-appointed civility police that they talk about. 
In fact, these are the worst, most vile offenders against civility. And when you have people who think that it is part of proper public discourse to call for giving a quote, unquote, "life sentence" as this loom, Jennifer Rubin, has done against Sarah Sanders simply for doing her job, that has crossed the line. It is beyond the pale. 
And the Washington Post and the owners of the Post should be ashamed that this woman is employed by them as a co-called conservative columnist. That's the biggest joke. 
PIRRO: And you know what, Pam Bondi, you are the attorney general, you're very powerful woman in a state with your own security detail in your own guards. And yet they have no fear going in your face within an inch of your face. 
BONDI: They don't. And that's where people need to realize someone is going to get hurt. And like Michelle said, I mean, the ultimate bullying, this Michelle Wolf woman saying go after their deepest insecurities, really, to say that it's horrible. 
But see we're not going to get in the gutter with them, that's the difference. And Democrats, there are plenty of Democrats out there who do not agree with what's happening and they just need to unequivocally say stop. Stop this. Do not do this. Someone is going to be harmed. 
PIRRO: All right. So good to have you both on tonight. Thanks so much. And still to come, President Trump keeps racking up the accomplishments. And members of the mainstream media are even finding it hard to ignore them. That and more, after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The regulation rollback has been the biggest ever in the history of our country. No president, even during full terms, has cut back anywhere near what I've done and we have more to do. 
Now we are going to have regulation, we're going to have clean water, we're going to have clean air, we are going to have the cleanest water, cleanest air. But we are, we have more regulation cutting to do. But I think I may have had a bigger impact to this point. 
I think ultimately, the tax cuts as they kick in and they kick in, you see the kind of hundreds of billions of dollars brought back into the country already, I think ultimately that's going to be something really special. And you are seeing the result right now. 
If you look at what happened to steel and aluminum, we practically built a new industry in at period of four or five months. It's incredible of what's happening. 
But the thing that I'm focused on now is trade. I have to straighten our trade deals. We're going to make it reciprocal, we're going to make them fair. And I will tell you don't know about this, but every country is calling, every day, saying let's make a deal, let's make a deal. It's going to all work out. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: Welcome back to Hannity. That was President Trump this weekend, in an interview with Maria Bartoromo, highlighting his exceptional record of accomplishments. Even members of the mainstream media can't downplay his success any more. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHUCK TODD, HOST, MSNBC: The announced retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy this week helped to make one political reality clear. Despite his overall unpopularity, President Trump is winning. And the Democrats right now are reeling. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: Joining me now with reaction, Salem radio talk show host Larry Elder, Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt, and GOPAC Chairman David Avella. Guys, did you ever think you would hear Chuck Todd say that Trump is winning and Democrats are reeling? I mean, I couldn't believe it. 
You know what, I'll start with you, Larry Elder, I mean this is, it really is amazing what the president has been able to accomplish, I don't know, how many weeks, someone said 75 weeks, maybe. Go ahead, Larry. 
LARRY ELDER, TALK SHOW HOST, SALEM RADIO: Well, it is amazing, judge. And his assertion, quote, "despite his overall unpopularity?" Close quote. He's more popular than Obama was at this point. I don't think anyone saying that Obama was, quote, "overall unpopular," close quote, during that period of time. 
But they still can't figure out why they won let alone why he's succeeding. And the answer is, Americans broadly like his policies. The economy is doing well. More Americans believe the economy is doing great. They have to believe that in a very long time. The stock market is doing well. The regulations he's cut have been even more severe than he said. He's cut almost four regulations for everyone regulation that we have added. 
The American people broadly believe that the borders need to be secured. Broadly believe that we need to do something about chain migration, about catch and release, about the visa lottery. So overall, Donald Trump policies are hash tag winning. 
PIRRO: OK. So Charlie Hurt, I mean, there's an article here in the Hill that I'm looking at and it says Trump just keeps on confounding his hapless detractors. Your take?
CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's probably safe to say that a lot of people like Chuck Todd are probably tired of winning by this point. 
But I think we did, I think we sort of crossed over a Rubicon over the last couple of weeks, and I think that's the left that Donald Trump really isn't going to get strung up on these bogus Russia charges. Stormy Daniels isn't going to bring down the president. And then as Larry Elder just pointed out, you know, the most alarming thing of all is the fact that the economy is booming, Donald Trump is right, it's the removal of all these regulations that have been, that are setting the economy on fire. 
The American people do agree with Donald Trump despite all of the haranguing by the media, they have agreed that the border should be closed and to have Democrats now arguing to abolish ICE--
PIRRO: It's just crazy. It is crazy.
HURT: -- playing into the president's hands. 
PIRRO: All right. And David Avella, OK. So we got economy, regulations, we got the stock market and the left is going ballistic. They are relentless in assaulting and I can't imagine that normal thinking people are buying it. 
DAVID AVELLA, CHAIRMAN, GOPAC: Well, now that abolishing ICE is the litmus test for Democrats who want to run in 2020. Donald Trump is well on his way to being re-elected and finishing what he started, which is eliminating or reversing every policy President Obama put in place. 
Hence now why Jobs are being created, folks have more money in their pockets, we're working toward securing our border, our military is getting the funding it needs to protect our country. An agenda and a set of accomplishments serve this country well. And ultimately, serve President Trump well for wanting to be re-elected. 
PIRRO: And you know what, Larry Elder, I mean, it is actually stunning where we are right now. Because when you think about the president has not really had all the Republicans supporting him. I mean, it was and it wasn't his stumble but Paul Ryan, and healthcare, Obamacare, and all of the other, you know, starting -- the president realized he's a businessman what he needed to do to get around those establishment Republicans, you know, who are trying to stop him. 
ELDER: Can you imagine where he would be if he didn't have the media against him? There's a book called "Left Turn" written by my friend Tim Groseclose, he's a professor at George Mason, judge, and he said if the media were truly fair and balanced the average state would vote the way Texas does, which is about 8 to 10 in favor of Republican vote. 
And the Democrats are countering this with free tuition, guaranteed jobs for everybody, $15 minimum wage, as was opinted out, getting rid of ICE. I don't think that's a winning message for Americans in the off year, let alone in 2020. They don't know what to do. They are literally unhinged. 
PIRRO: Well, and you know what, Charlie Hurt, we don't have a lot of time, but you know calling for the, what they don't like what say is broken, immigration is broken, ICE is broken. I mean, it is not something that is going to bring them any success, is it? 
HURT: No, absolutely not. The immigration system has been a disaster for decades now under both parties. Donald Trump is the first person who come along who actually actively wants to do something to fix it. The Democrats just want to campaign against it. And this idea that they are going to campaign on abolishing ICE is I think will be their doom. 
PIRRO: It's Crazy. Crazy. David Avella, last word? 
AVELLA: Well, one area the president and Senate Republicans have worked quite well at is getting judges confirmed. Not only the Supreme Court judge and Gorsuch, but also at the district level. And we're going to continue to see that success with whoever President Trump ultimately nominates being on the Supreme Court here before the end of the year. 
PIRRO: Is anyone tired of winning yet? Thank you, gentlemen.
ELDER: Not me. 
PIRRO: And coming up, wait until you hear what disgraced FBI Director James Comey is saying these days about how people view him. Don't go anywhere. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: Welcome back to Hannity. Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey took part in a question-and-answer session over the weekend. And in a rare moment of truth, acknowledged that he is not liked by either side. Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Your Republican colleagues with whom you have these conversations, are they outraged? 
JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: Well, most Republicans don't talk to me anymore. So I have succeeded in making pissing off everyone. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: That will do it for us tonight. But don't forget to buy a copy of my book on Amazon or Barnes & Noble, "Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: A Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy." Thanks for being with us. I don't know if this is real yet because it's not out. So you have to guess. Is it real or just a cover?
I'll be back tomorrow night filling in for Sean. Have a great night. Laura Ingraham is live next.
