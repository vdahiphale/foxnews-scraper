Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Feels like Groundhog Day, doesn't it? One year after Michael Brown's death, more protests that are a constitutionally-protected right, but also now violence. Shooting at police and looting in Ferguson. That's bad. That is not constitutionally-protected. Those are crimes.
Think about it - it just take as few bad apples, criminals like last night, to reignite very deep wounds that we had hoped we were inching towards healing. Peaceful protest, that's a strong sign of a democracy. You can't do that, though, in a lot of countries. Here, it's a cherished right - we all honor it. But think about this, the police, who are called upon to protect that all-important constitutional right, they have rights, too - a right to safety, just like peaceful protesters. Police after doing their job of protecting the protesters and their constitutional right to peaceful protest, they all want to return home to their families and their kids alive. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, we all hope that last night's violence in Ferguson is a fluke, not just the start of another round of violence. But regrettably, it only takes as few criminals to unleash violence and stomp all over those constitutional rights. Those criminals should be arrested and roundly condemned by everyone, not just condemned by some. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
