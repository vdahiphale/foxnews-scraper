Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Thirty-two-year-old Kate Steinle's murder by a man illegally in this country after five deportations and seven felonies is horrifying. And the agony for the family is indescribable. This has sparked a debate for illegals here in the U.S. But as we beg our leaders to fix our broken system - that's their job - I don't want to ignore the thousands of great men, women and children who come here from other countries.
Over the Fourth of July, I was in Alaska, with Reverend Franklin Graham of Samaritan's Purse, for Operation Heal Our Patriots, a program to help severely injured vets and their spouses. I met many heroes, including this man, former Navy combat medic, Wilson Ospina. He has severely injured traumatic brain injury. I asked him why he joined the U.S. military: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PETTY OFFICER WILSON OSPINA, FORMER U.S. NAVY FMF CORPSMAN: I'm a first generation immigrant. My family came in 1984 from Colombia. And I - - after the bombing, I figured it was a good way for me to pay back the opportunity my family had to it set roots in this beautiful country. And that's why I came. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
VAN SUSTEREN: And by bombing, you mean 9/11?
OSPINA: 9/11. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

So as we begin this heated dialogue about immigration, legal and illegal, don't forget the many great immigrants and heroes like Wilson. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
