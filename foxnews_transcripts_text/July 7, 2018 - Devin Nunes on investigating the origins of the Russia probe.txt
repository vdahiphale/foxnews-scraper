JEANINE PIRRO, HOST: Breaking tonight, 48 hours from the pick that could define the future of the Supreme Court. Hello and welcome to "Justice." I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight, and thanks again for making "Justice" number one again last week. What a show on deck. CPAC Chair, Matt Schlapp is here, so is Tomi Lahren and a powerful political panel with David Avella and Chris Hahn. We'll be discussing the President's big decision on the Supreme Court on Monday night and more. 
But first, just how badly were the Feds out to get Donald Trump and where does the House Intelligence Investigation stand now. Joining me to discuss that and more is the Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes. All right, good evening, Congressman.

REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALI., CHAIR OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Judge, great to be with you.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Well, it's great to have you on tonight. Yesterday, you sent yet another letter to Congressman Gowdy and Goodlatte asking that they question individuals openly in this continuing Trump-Russia - alleged Trump-Russia collusion investigation. And now it appears your letter includes up to 42 names, letters, some of them from the executive office of President Obama, as well as the State Department, DOJ and FBI. What is different about your third letter?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NUNES: The third letter is about Fusion GPS and all of the people that are in that realm of Fusion GPS that could have been involved handling the dossier, digging up the dirt and feeding it into the FBI. 
PIRRO: And right now, in terms of this information going to the FBI, it seems that you went from the initial who paid for this dossier? What was it all about? And you seem to have gotten answers to that. We know it was the DNC and Hillary Clinton - the Hillary Clinton campaign - but now the issue seems to be a little more fine-tuned. And that is how did this dossier get from the Clinton campaign and Steele to the FBI? Do you know what the answer to that is?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NUNES: We don't know the answer to that. We think it could have come from many directions, right, so we know that one of John McCain's former staffers did it. We think that many people in the press had this and actually also gave it to the FBI, at the same time Christopher Steele was supposedly working with the FBI. So there's lots of ways that it made it through, so what we are rally asking for, though, is for these 42 people to be interviewed in public. 
I would suggest - I can't control how they do the interviews and conduct the interviews, but I would think that they would want to do more deposition types. So, let the Republicans ask an hour of questions of these witnesses - of the witness at a time and then let the Democrats give them an hour. Have it be televised because these 42 people really help us get to the bottom of was Trump really colluding with Russia or was this an orchestrated effort by the left working with the FBI and DOJ to frame the President and many people involved to dig up dirt to start this investigation. That's why I think it would be helpful to have all this done in public.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Well, clearly in public, but when you talk about a deposition, that is somewhat different than the run-of-the-mill hearing where the right gets up and says, "I'm the greatest guy that ever lived and you are awful." Or the left gets up and says "We're the greatest guys who ever lived and you are awful." You never get answers from these witnesses. It's almost like a circus. It's the same all the time. You think that this deposition would get into more in depth information? Will it allow for the basis of a criminal predicate prosecution in the event that they lie?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NUNES: Yes, and I also believe, Judge, that there is a task force that the Oversight Committee and Judiciary Committee have set up made up of five Republicans and five Democrats. So, let each one have an hour at a time to ask questions of these witnesses so that you don't get the grandstanding, you don't get the political speeches. I think that would be worth a lot more for not only the Congress, but ultimately the American people to understand what information each witness has that's relevant to this matter. 
PIRRO: Okay, and Congressman, one of the things that I find so fascinating is that the House, I believe it was last week, gave the Department of Justice until yesterday to give them information, this House resolution for- or a deadline for DOJ and the FBI to come clean on the beginning of the Trump investigation or as the FBI called it, Operation Hurricane. Do you know, number one, did Congress get any information from the FBI and DOJ, and number two, if they didn't, where are we with this? 
NUNES: Well, as always, we have to pound and pound and pound to get information from DOJ and FBI. They did give us a lot more information last week or expecting more information on Monday, but let me - you mentioned something about crossfire hurricane that we know was opened July 31st. One of the key outstanding questions that we have is, what happened before July 31st.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Okay, but Congressman, excuse me, Congressman, hold on.
NUNES: But they seem to be playing word games. 
PIRRO: Hold on, Congressman, hold on. What I want to know now is if the y don't give you that information and maybe we can pull the Congressman back up, if they don't give you that information, what can you do to the FBI and DOJ? You've given them more deadlines. Now, we had yesterday they were supposed to give us stuff. Now, maybe Monday or Tuesday. This investigation has been going on for a year. At some point, don't you guys feel impotent?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NUNES: Well, look, there is a couple things here. So before July 31st, for a couple of months, we've been really zeroing in on that, and the FBI and DOJ have had plenty of opportunities to tell was happened before July 31st. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: But they haven't. 
NUNES: They have not. They have not. Now, ultimately here, the President of the United States, it's his DOJ and his FBI. And at some point here, he need to gets involved. And look, were there informants used or not?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: No, Congressman, I don't want to go there yet. I don't want to go there yet. Here is the thing. You guys have oversight over the Department of Justice. I know you are intel, I get that. The American people have been watching this circus play out where you guys tell the DOJ and the FBI, we want these records. You then go through the charade. Not you in particular, Congressman, of sending a letter and saying, "We want this by Friday." You don't get it Friday, maybe we'll get it Monday or Tuesday. 
What my viewers want to know, what the American people want to know with all due respect to you, and I don't think anyone has had more pushback than you, and for that I give you tremendous kudos, I really do. But it's almost as though Congress shouldn't even bother at this point. And we can talk about the president, but what do you have in terms of a sanction? Otherwise, you guys should be working on legislation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NUNES: Well, look, ultimately we have the job of oversight. They have to comply with us. They've slowly complied and look, part of what we've uncovered here, let's not forget, it's Congress that's helped uncover the dossier, the dirt, who paid for it. It's just been - look, people are trying to hide this like the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign were trying to hide in conjunction with the FBI, the FBI and DOJ didn't want the American public to know any of this.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, we do have a few outstanding documents that they do need to give us, okay, it's very, very important. So, what steps do we have? Look, we have other steps we can take. We can hold them in contempt, but at the end of the day here, we do need to know what happened before July 31st. That's what we are really trying to get to. If you look at phase three of the investigation like we talked about just a moment ago, having the 42 people come and testify, I think will be very powerful for the Congress and for the American people to have transparency and sunlight in this whole mess. 
PIRRO: Okay, but what we are looking at on that full screen is what the beginning of what the FBI and the DOJ says is the investigation into President Trump. July 31, 2016, then, candidate Trump. If FBI and DOJ right where that middle line is say that's when we began the investigation, and you now find out that a counter-intelligence investigation was started against a Presidential campaign a week after the guy gets the nomination to be Republican candidate for President. And in fact, it's before that, then we have got a counter-intelligence at the level of a third world country.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NUNES: That is correct. So, I think any involvement, even in crossfire hurricane of an informants being paid to go into the Trump campaign is something that - a red line that we've never crossed before, but what could be even worse is if there were informants that were being run into the Trump campaign and their associates before July 31st, which would be even worse.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, this is why at the end of the day, we have to hold these hearings, we have to ask these questions, and ultimately, the President of the United States is going to have to declassify all of this information so the American public knows exactly what the counter-intelligence resources that we have in this country, what were used for. 
PIRRO: Why do you think the president is not declassifying? 
NUNES: I think it is an unprecedented step.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Why do think the President is not declassifying?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NUNES: I don't know. The FISA is very frustrating to me because I think that pieces of the FISA that was gotten on Carter Page, right, that - we have had an ongoing feud about this for many, many months. I think the FISA is totally fraudulent, 100% fraudulent. You have James Comey and others currently at the FBI and DOJ who are defending the FISA which is unbelievable to me. 
So why not the President ought to just solve this once and for all. 
 Declassify - you don't have to expose sources and methods, but most of that FISA, the pertinent parts of it could be declassified. And he could help answer for all of us who was telling the truth. Were they justified to get a FISA warrant on Carter Page or not? I don't think they were and I think the American people have the right to know and the President should declassify.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: All right, Congressman Devin Nunes, we'll see what the President does, although I suspect he's kind of waiting for you guys to use all of your powers, but it would certainly put an end to this ongoing investigation. I want to thank you for all your efforts on behalf of getting out the truth and putting some sunlight into our government. Congressman -Chairman Devin Nunes. Thank you so much. 
NUNES: Thank you, Judge.

        }
      
PIRRO: And by this time on Monday, we should know for sure who President Trump has picked to nominate to Supreme Court. A decision that could have a major impact on this country for decades to come. Joining me now to discuss and more is CPAC Chairman, Matt Schlapp. Good evening, Matt.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MATT SCHLAPP, CPAC CHAIRMAN: Great to be with you, Judge. 
PIRRO: All right, Matt, I am just going to ask you a follow up question to my questioning of Chairman Nunes where he believes that the President at this point should intervene and declassify information because the FBI and the Department of Justice are simply playing games with Congress. And Congress has been pretty impotent up to this point. What do you think? 
SCHLAPP: I like the idea. I think the problem - this whole question about Russian collusion, the Mueller investigation and what happened with all the hanky-panky with the FISA courts, I think the American people deserve just to see the straight facts, but I'm not sure we're going to get it any other way. I am not sure Congress can get it, so I do think it's a fair charge back to the executive branch, make these documents public, the taxpayers should know.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Well, they really should know, but it's been - it seems an ongoing battle where you have someone like Tom Fitton and some other guys who have to go to court to get more than Congress has, which is kind of crazy under freedom of information. However, let's talk about 48 hours from now when the President gets on national television and announces who his pick should be for the United States Supreme Court.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, let me preface all of this with a couple of thoughts. Number one, Ronald Reagan was able to put three judges on the Supreme Court and there are Republican Presidents like Bush Senior who put Souter on who he thought was a conservative and he turns out to be a liberal, and then Junior Bush ends up putting John Roberts on who was the one vote, the deciding vote in Obamacare. Number one, can you ever be sure who you're nominating will be the true conservative, and number two, who do you want? 
SCHLAPP: Great questions. The first question is, is it a good strategy to pick somebody without a track record and hope they turn out be a conservative? Terrible strategy. Fifty percent of the picks to the Supreme Court by Republican Presidents have turned out to not to be very solid when it comes to upholding the Constitution.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's why I like Brett Kavanaugh - Judge Brett Kavanaugh because he has over 300 decisions on every issue under the sun, everybody could read the opinions. You can see where he is. He upholds the Constitution in each and every case and more of his opinions have actually become the basis for Supreme Court decisions, almost 12 times than any other candidate, so he's got the track record and that's what we need.

SENATOR DICK DURBIN, D-ILLINOIS: Do you consider yourself an Orthodox Catholic. 
AMY CONEY BARRETT, CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE: I am a Catholic, Senator Durbin. If you are asking whether I take my faith seriously, and I am a faithful Catholic, I am, although, I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious beliefs would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge.

PIRRO: I played that because it seems that there was at that hearing two years ago, especially not just by Dick Durbin, but Senator Dianne Feinstein, there was a pushback saying that it seems that you're living the dogma of your religion as though her being a Christian is a problem. I think that tees itself up for a certain amount people on her side saying enough of this anti-Christianity stuff. Let's put her on. What do you think?

SCHLAPP: She has such grace to be able to sit there while those bigoted senators make it seem like being a practicing Catholic is a disqualifier to serving on the highest court in the land. It was a disgusting un-American moment, but she had such grace. My only concern with her nomination, and I would support her wholeheartedly if the President picks her, it's just that, once again, she's only been on the Court for a short time, less than a year. We know where she is on a lot of issues. 
PIRRO: She is on the Circuit Court of Appeal.

We've made so many mistakes, Judge. Think about it, 50% of the picks to the Supreme Court by Republican Presidents have been off the mark. We can't afford one mistake. Neil Gorsuch, a fantastic pick.

SCHLAPP: The big differences with Bourke, remember is it took a super majority vote. This is the big difference because of what Harry Reid did, it just takes 50 votes. And we have, as you pointed out with that excellent question, we have Democrats running for reelection in the Senate from red states. And if they vote against Trump's pick for the high court, I am going to make a prediction. They ain't coming back. 
PIRRO: It'll be fascinating, Matt Schlapp. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. 
SCHLAPP: Thank you, Judge. 
PIRRO: All right, and still ahead, meet the man who says he couldn't take being a liberal anymore, so he crossed the aisle. And next, the left's attacks on the right reach out-of-control levels. Tomi Lahren and I discuss are ready to discuss it. It's Tomi time, next on "Justice."

        }
      
Welcome back to "Justice." Last week you'll remember, I spoke with Michelle Malkin and Pam Bondi about some of their experiences with left- wing protesters who confronted and sometimes threatened them in public. Why does this thing keep happening? Joining me now to discuss that and more is Fox News contributor, Tomi Lahren. Tomi, thanks for being here.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Tomi, you experienced your own situation. I have had situations like this as well. And right now, I still have not heard from anyone on the left who says, "Oh, it happens on both sides, it does, it does." Able to identify someone from the right going after someone on the left and saying they don't like their politics, spitting at them, threatening them, telling them to resign and things like that. 
TOMI LAHREN, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS: What the left believes is if you challenge their way of thinking and their world view in an articulate manner, they believe that that's harassment. However, they can go out in public, up to me at a restaurant, at a bar, in a mall and can confront me and say nasty things or throw things at me and to them, it's one and the same. 
But Judge, I've got to tell you, since Maxine Waters came out and she encouraged her followers and her supporters to, I guess, continue the attacks on the right, it has gotten worse. I have seen it in my personal life get worse in the last couple of weeks.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: And Maxine Waters, as crazy and batty as she sounds, I mean, she is creating this movement where people think it's justified. At first it was like "Impeach 45, impeach 45," and people saying, "Yes, yes." And then, it's like, you've got to stop them. You've got to go push back, you've got to apologize. And she never really apologized. 
LAHREN: No, she didn't apologize. And she is actually making it dangerous, especially for young women like myself. I find it funny because many of the people that have been attacked, harassed, assaulted have been conservative women. So, where is the left on this? Where are the feminists that are about female empowerment? Time's up? #MeToo? Where are their voices in this? Because I don't see them coming out to defend conservative women as they should when we are literally being attacked for our beliefs. Where are the feminists? 
PIRRO: They are not going to be there, Tomi, I'll tell you right now. They did it with #grabyourwallet with Ivanka Trump's items where Ivanka Trump is the epitome of a successful woman who has spent her adult career trying to empower other women. I mean, it is a fraud, the whole thing is a fraud. But I want to move on from that, Tomi, to John Brennan tweeting today to President Trump, "You are to governance and politics what Bernie Madoff was to the stock market and investment advice. The two of you share a remarkably unethical ability to deceive and manipulate others. Building Ponzi schemes to aggrandize yourselves. Truth and justice ultimately caught up with Bernie." 
Now, here you have a guy, John Brennan who is the head of the CIA, who as far as I'm concerned in my book that's coming out in less than two weeks, is part of the swamp that created and made up this anti-Trump collusion narrative, still going after the President. They are not afraid of us, but we are always under the gun from them.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
LAHREN: Well of course, and for me what I see is actually just pure bitterness. It's almost like some of these former Obama administration officials, it's almost as if they are jealous that they are not part of a winning administration. I hear time and time again from Hollywood liberals, from former administration officials how terrible this President is, but they give no example of how terrible he is. Terrible for whom? For illegal immigrants? For tariffs? For overregulation? Because for the average American, this President is doing wonderful things and they fail to acknowledge it. I honestly think it's jealousy. 
PIRRO: Well and it's interesting Donald Trump tweeted back, "Thanks to Republican leadership, America is winning AGAIN and America is being respected again over the world because we are finally putting America first." Tomi, I'm going to make a prediction. I believe that although historically, the other party wins in the midterms' first Presidential term, I think it's either going to be extremely close or the President is going to win the midterms with his party. Last few thoughts? 
LAHREN: Oh, I agree because the left is finally showing us who they really are and it's things like what John Brennan is tweeting and it's things like what liberals are doing in the streets to conservatives. All of these things are piling up and I think you're going to see moderates step out and say, again, walk away. We don't want to be a part of that party. I think you're going to see a red wave in November and I think 2020 is going to be even better, so I appreciate that they are finally being honest about their beliefs, their ideology in the way they treat people. It's only going to help us. 
PIRRO: All right, Tomi Lahren, thanks so much for being with us tonight. And a special Fourth of July Hollywood weekend edition of "Street Justice" still ahead, and next, you want fireworks?

Pyongyang slamming new talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling them "regrettable and gangster-like." This despite Pompeo telling reporters that his third visit to the country since April had yielded a great deal of progress. 
Meanwhile, President Trump says he's nearing that big decision on a second Supreme Court nominee to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. The White House telling Fox News that President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence discussed it over dinner in New Jersey yesterday. Sources saying the President has narrowed it down to four candidates: Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge, Amy Coney Barrett and Thomas Hardiman. Mr. Trump is scheduled to announce his decision on Monday. I'm Marianne Rafferty. Now back to.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm going to get one of those little kits and in the middle of the debate when she proclaims that she is of Indian heritage because her mother said she has high cheekbones. That's her only evidence, that her mother said she has high cheek bones. We will take that little kit, and say - but we have to do it gently because we're in the #MeToo generation, so we have to be very gentle and we will very gently take that kit and we will slowly toss it hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm, even though it probably only weighs two ounces.

PIRRO: President Trump as usual having some fun at his latest rally in Montana, throwing down the challenge to the woman who could be one of his challengers in 2020, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Let's bring the panel in, joining me now, radio talk show host, former adviser of Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn and GOPAC Chair, David Avella. All right, guys, thanks for being here. 
DAVID AVELLA, GOPAC CHAIRMAN: Good evening. 
CHRIS HAHN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Thanks, Judge. 
PIRRO: Chris, if Elizabeth Warren does run, I mean, her identifying herself as Native American because she has high cheekbones, I mean a lot of us have high cheek bones, is kind of an empty excuse for saying she is a minority, but then using that to gain a financial advantage with a school, that's not good. 
HAHN: I think the President talking about it on stage over and over again first of all, is the most of uncivilized thing I have seen. I have heard you talk about civility. That's ridiculous what he just did at that rally the other day. As for what she used for school, I don't know what her background is. We don't know what her family history is and I don't think it is going to be relevant. And it also shows that the President keeps talking about her, because he is threatened by her because she is a strong intelligent woman who will be a far better president than this man was, who understands things that he can't possibly comprehend. So, keep on hitting her. All you're doing is raising her profile and she would be a better candidate than you think.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
PIRRO: David Avella, do you think Chris is right when he says that Elizabeth Warren would be far better President than President Trump? 
AVELLA: Of course she wouldn't be. And Chris must have turned down his earpiece because he hasn't listened to what Democrats have said about Republican Presidents every time one gets elected whether that be President Trump, George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan. You hear the same old tired old rhetoric about them being racists, and them being sexist and them being against women and them being against the poor. Though it is worth noting that if you saw the survey results this week, you now have voters saying that it's Republicans who are more for the working class and it's Democrats are for the wealthy and the elite and the business community. 
So, people see through it, and more importantly than those comments about Elizabeth Warren, it's the rest of the president's message that matters, which is we are going to have secure borders.
HAHN: Do you think it's appropriate? 
AVELLA: We are going to have economic security. We are going to have personal security in this country which he started in his first term and is going to continue on his second term. 
PIRRO: Okay, go ahead, Chris. 
HAHN: I mean, David, I mean, I don't think you think it's appropriate for him to continue to call her "Pocahontas."

PIRRO: He didn't call her Pocahontas in that. 
(CROSSTALK) 
AVELLA: Oh, Chris, come on. 
HAHN: He's the president of the United States. 
PIRRO: She's the one, Chris who started it. 
HAHN: Well, you know, the President of the United States continuing to poke at that is just unpresidential, it's uncivilized and it's ridiculous. 
PIRRO: To poke at the fact that she is saying that she was Native American and she can't prove it. What did he do? She is the one who said it, used it for her financial advantage.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
HANH: He doesn't know what she can and cannot prove and it's not for him to decide. 
AVELLA: It is no more absurd than this civic chaos that Maxine Waters and Tom and Tom Steyer and George Soros are all out there pushing as they try to pitch impeachment, but let me say this, Chris's team should continue to promote civic chaos because every time they have done it, in 1968, Republicans won 32 seats; 1984.
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: Hang on, Chris. Chris, hang on. 
AVELLA: Let me finish. In 2004, when the code pink came out, George Bush won 31 states, so Chris, continue pushing civic chaos that will only ensure Republicans pick up seats in the Senate this year and President Trump will be on his way to reelection in 2020. 
PIRRO: Go ahead, Chris. 
HAHN: David, civic chaos was what happened in Charlottesville when a right-wing nut drove his car to a crowd and killed somebody. Civic chaos, people protesting, people standing up, people marching in the street who are agitated by the policies this President has done, that is not civic chaos. That's civic engagement and it's good for America and it's going to show in November, the blue wave is coming, we will both talk about it after the election and I am wrong, have at me, but I will be having at you, my friend.

        }
      
AVELLA: The gentleman this week that had his hat taken off and beverage thrown on him, that's civic chaos, Chris. It may be a smaller amount.
HAHN: That's worth than the woman who died in Charlottesville, right? 
PIRRO: You know what, David?
HAHN: And then the President said there were fine people on both sides there, so let's talk about civic chaos. Let's put it into some perspective. I'm sorry, Alan Dershowitz got disinvited from a barbeque on Martha's Vineyard, but there are people dying because of right-wing violence. 
PIRRO: You know, David, Chris, I appreciate you coming. 
AVELLA: Well, there are people dying because the illegal aliens are coming across the border and killing innocent Americans. 
HAHN: No, no. That's (inaudible), David. You know that's not true.

(CROSSTALK) 
AVELLA: Yes, Chris. 
HAHN: You know that's not true. 
AVELLA: That is true. 
PIRRO: That's true, Chris. 
AVELLA: That is absolutely true. 
HAHN: You know that the crime rate, David, you're smart enough to know that the crime rate.

(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: Chris, stop. Both of stop. Stop right now, Chris. You want to make reference to one killing, he can make reference to a number of Americans who have been killed by illegal aliens. Don't tell him no. 
 Facts are facts. And on this show, the truth is the truth. 
HAHN: Well, he's changing the topic. 
AVELLA: Judge, here is what we know. Here is what we know. Chris didn't write the speech for his old boss Chuck Schumer who said in 2009 that people who come into our country without permission are illegal aliens and illegal aliens shouldn't be treated the same as people who come here legally. The only difference is Chris and his team are now for open borders and it started with Hillary Clinton when she went to Brazil.
HAHN: No, we are not. No, we are not, David. 
AVELLA: When she went to Brazil and told a group of American businessman she was for open borders. 
PIRRO: Hold on Chris, let him finish. Chris, let him finish. She went to Brazil and what?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
AVELLA: And she told them she was looking forward to having open borders between the US and South American countries. 
PIRRO: Okay, that's enough. Chris, go ahead. 
HAHN: That's a complete lie that Chuck Schumer is for open borders. 
PIRRO: He said it. 
HAHN: And that he doesn't believe that we should be - we should have a border and that we should be tough on immigration. 
PIRRO: Chris, are you out of your mind? 
HAHN: We believe in having a process, and we believe that when people.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: All of them want open borders, and they call them illegal aliens. 
HAHN: There were less illegal immigration under Obama than there has been under Trump and that's a fact. Look it up. 
PIRRO: What does that have to with what we are talking about? 
HAHN: Okay, so let's be very, very clear. We believe in a process.
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: We are out of time. Chris Hahn, David Avella - and we can continue this off the record. Good-bye. 
HAHN: We should. 
PIRRO: All right, he left the left behind and he has some very compelling reasons for doing it. My interview with Brandon Straka, the founder of Walkaway is next. 
(VIDEO CLIP STARTS) 
BRANDON STRAKA, FOUNDER, WALKAWAY: Once upon a time, I was a liberal, but liberalism has changed and I will no longer be a part of an ideology or political party that represents everything that contradicts my values of unity, people opportunity, personal empowerment and passion and love. So, I am walking away. And I encourage all of you to do the same. Walk away. 
(VIDEO CLIP ENDS) 
PIRRO: That is Brandon Straka who has created a stir in recent days over his high-profile decision to leave the left behind because of their overzealous rhetoric and violent protests. Earlier I sat down with Brandon to talk about his ask decision and some of the reaction to it. Take a look. 
(VIDEO TAPE STARTS) 
PIRRO: Brandon Straka, thanks so much for joining us tonight. You are a very interesting man, and let me just say that you have been a lifelong liberal, and then you drifted. 
STRAKA: I did. 
PIRRO: What changed? 
STRAKA: Well, I just became more aware as time went on that the identity politics and politically correct culture was getting very out of control, but in terms of me actually switching parties, it was after the election of Donald Trump because I voted for Hillary and I was on Facebook crying, wondering what had gone wrong, what happened to the good people of Middle America, but a friend of mine reached out to me and showed me a YouTube clip which basically a compilation of footage showing all of these different ways in which the media had taken moments out of context in Donald Trump's campaign and spun it and created a narrative that he was a racist, a bigot, a homophobe. 
And in fact, I even saw another video showing black people who had gone to Trump rallies to support him and when CNN showed up, they intentionally cut them out of the shot so it appeared that there were only white people there. 
So, it began to paint a picture for me that the media had been incredibly dishonest about their narrative of who Trump was and who his supporters were. 
PIRRO: So when Trump talks about fake news, you find that to be accurate. 
STRAKA: Well, I didn't use to, but yes, I know it's accurate. 
PIRRO: All right, so were a Democrat, now you have a new movement called #walkaway that you are wearing. Good marketing. 
STRAKA: Thank you. 
PIRRO: And what are you walking from? 
STRAKA: Well, I'm walking away from the Democratic Party and I'm also walking away from the divisive, hateful, and now, I think we're on the brink of almost violent rhetoric that's coming from the left. The complete lack of civility. I mean, the complete lack of being able to sit down and even have a civil discourse about our different political beliefs. I mean, at this point, it's like, if you don't agree with what the left says, it's because you are a Nazi and you're a bigot and they have allowed themselves to become so entitled at this point in their feelings that it's like, if you disagree with them, they're almost at the point now where they cannot serve you in a restaurant or they can commit a violent act against you. 
PIRRO: We are not almost at the point, we are at the point where people who are working in the government, who have - are spending 18 hours a day, most of the ones that I know, working are being thrown out of places and not served. I understand that yesterday something unusual happened to you. 
STRAKA: It did. I was in a camera store in New York City. I was just trying to buy some technical equipment and when I went to make my purchase, the salesperson said to me, "Are you planning to use this equipment for alt-right purposes?" And I sort of laughed and I said "Alt-right?" And he said, "Well, aren't you with the #walkaway campaign?" And I said "Yes, I am." And he said, "I'm sorry, I can't sell to you. I don't support that and I can't sell to you." 
PIRRO: What did you do? 
STRAKEA: I started shaking. I did, I mean, that was the first - I understand that this kind of thing is going to happen to me more going forward, but this was the first time it happened and it took my breath away. Yes, and to be honest with you, I was scared. I mean, these people have my information in their computer. Now I don't know what's going to happen next. 
PIRRO: But, you see, now you are experiencing what Republican and conservatives have been experiencing across the country, whether you are walking down the street in Manhattan, the more visible you become, the more people are going to attack you. I had someone on my show last week and I said, "Give me one example where people on the right have done this to people on the left. Give me just one example," because they say it's both sides. Are you seeing now that's not the case? 
STRAKA: yes, I am seeing that that's not the case. And the other thing that I'm seeing is just how forgiving people on the right are when these things happen. I mean, it's two completely different worlds because people on the left can be so vicious and they can attack so much, but people on the right, even if they disagree with you, they can do it very civilly. 
PIRRO: All right, but you are a very interesting individual. I mean, you are gay, you are a hairstylist. You are an aspiring actor. You live in Manhattan. You have been a Democrat. And now, you are in a position to see some of the lies that have been perpetuated by the left and you are leaving, but what is your mission ultimately? 
STRAKA: Well, I want people to - first of all, I am not even telling people where to go or what to do. What I'm asking is that they start doing their own research. Stop believing everything that they hear just because CNN says it or MSNBC or the "New York Times." Do your own research. Do your own facts and you'll be surprised what you find out, but ultimately, particularly for minorities in America - racial minorities, LGBT people, I want them to become aware that the Democratic Party doesn't actually support them. They are actually using them and they are actually manipulating their fears and concerns to get them to vote the way they want them to vote and behave the way they want them to behave. 
PIRRO: All right. 
STRAKA: I want to empower these people. 
PIRRO: You've made a decision not to even identify the people who didn't want to serve you yesterday, and to that we give you credit. Brandon Straka, thanks so much for being with "Justice" tonight. 
STRAKA: Thank you. 
(VIDEO TAPE ENDS) 
PIRRO: And a very patriotic "Street Justice" is next. I think you're going to love it 
(VIDEO CLIP STARTS) 
PIRRO: It's a holiday weekend and we are still celebrating here at "Justice." So what makes you a proud American? I hit the streets to find out. So, here I am in Manhattan trying to figure out what New Yorkers think about the Fourth of July and what makes them a proud American. What makes you a proud American? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a proud American because we are free. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because we have a right to vote and have a voice in our democracy. 
PIRRO: Your mom and dad gave the smartest answers. Do you want to add anything? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am just glad we're alive. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The right to vote. 
PIRRO: I love this family. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, people that serve in our Army, I love everyone, I love America. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm proud of our history and all of our great accomplishments. Definitely. 
PIRRO: And are you proud of America today? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I am. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The return of patriots that we have seen in the country especially with all the military vets. I've had a lot in my family. 
PIRRO: Do you think we should have a military parade? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I don't see anything wrong with that. 
PIRRO: How come your hat costs $34.00? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know. 
PIRRO: You have got a tag under there and it says $34.99. So you're a proud American because you can pay $34.99 for a cap. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely. Absolutely. 
PIRRO: That's crazy. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It is, but it is what it is. 
PIRRO: It is what it is. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, you know what, the American dream, the fact that we can come here and look at me, I'm from Houston, Texas and I'm all the way up here in New York City. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Freedom in our country. A great president. The Lord Jesus Christ, and watching you. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just being happy, raising a family in a great environment. 
PIRRO: Great country? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Great country. 
PIRRO: What makes you a proud American on this Fourth of July weekend? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I love all the people here. Everyone has got an opinion. I just really appreciate that we can all have discussions. 
PIRRO: But you know why I love your answer, you're a proud American because you like people, you like everybody. That what's we need in this country. Everybody needs a little more loving so to speak. 
(VIDEO CLIP ENDS) 
PIRRO: We'll be right back. Finally, tonight, my new book, "Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy," comes out in just over a week. But you can preorder it now on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. And if you have any questions about anything that we've talked about with the Russia collusion and Strzok and Page and all of that stuff, and Brennan in particular, read my book. We'll explain it all to you. But don't forget to friend me on Facebook, follow me on Twitter and on Instagram @judge_jeanine. I love to read your comments. You never have to miss "Justice." If you can't watch, set your VCR. Thanks for watching. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way.
