MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: It was an honor to be a part of history today to be sure, and to be with you again as always. Bret, thank you so much. Great to be back in New York this evening.
And tonight, stay with us for the story this evening as we await the arrival of President George H.W. Bush's casket at the church in Houston, where he and his family of worshipped for more than 50 years. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

There, he will live repose before he's brought to his final resting place tomorrow at the Bush Presidential Library. His last words on earth, "I love you too." Spoken to his son, George W. Bush who recounted that poignant moment in a very moving and very memorable send-off to his father. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT: When I was told he had minutes to live, I called him. The guy answered the phone said, "I think he can hear you, but he hadn't said anything for most of the day."
I said, "Dad, I love you. And you've been a wonderful father." And the last words he would ever say on earth were, "I love you, too." Dad taught us all, what it means to be a great husband. He married his sweetheart.  He adored her. He laughed and cried with her. He was dedicated to her totally. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In his old age, dad enjoyed watching police show reruns. The volume on high. All the while holdings mom's hand. After mom died, dad was strong.  But all he really wanted to do was hold mom's hand again. So, through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you. A great and noble man. The best father, a son or daughter could have. And in our grief, by the smile knowing that dad is hugging Robin and holding mom's hand again.

But first, Casey Stegall, live at the church where the late president will lie in repose this evening. Casey, good evening to you.
CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Martha, good evening. Boy, I know we've seen it, an awful lot. But it is still hard to see the president stand up there, eulogizing his father and break down. It doesn't matter what side of the political aisle you're on, a lot of people can relate with the loss of a parent.
The motorcade, by the way, that is carrying the 41st President of the United States is on its way to this location back here. In fact, just before we went on the air, we got word that it may be about 10 minutes out or so. And then, we will begin the next and final phase of this tribute and saying goodbye, and this is all about Texans. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And we've talked about this. George H.W. Bush loved this State so incredibly much. And so, he wanted to have services and opportunities for the public here to say their goodbyes. So, we have hundreds and hundreds of people lining up at a remote location at the Second Baptist Church, which is not far from here and they're all going to be shuttled over here where the president will be lying in repose all night long at this church until 6:00 tomorrow morning, and thousands of Houstonians and others are expected to file by and pay their final respects.
This, of course, all on the heels of today's moving state funeral at Washington's National Cathedral, attended by dignitaries and leaders from around the world. But the president knew he wanted Texas -- he wanted this Texas service back here at St. Martin's Episcopal Church where the first family has worshipped for decades.
And one of the pastors who has known them for more than 10 years and was inside the room when the president took his final breath last Friday, he will be presiding over the service tomorrow. Something he says is a big honor. Listen.

RUSSELL LEVENSON, PASTOR OF BUSH FAMILY: We've been here almost 12 years.  And so, yes, to be with him particularly, during this last decade in some of his life. And also Barbara has been a tremendous privilege and honor.

STEGALL: Now, once tomorrow's funeral concludes, there will be one final ride. The former president's casket will be taken to College Station, Texas, aboard this special train. A Union Pacific train 4141. And it will make the trek from Spring, Texas which is a suburb of Houston, and it will travel all the way up to College Station.
And the family will also be onboard that train -- a very special ride. And once they get to College Station, the president will be buried in a private ceremony next to his beloved Barbara, and Martha their daughter Robin as you know, who died of leukemia at a young age.

MACCALLUM: Casey, thank you very much. Joining me now, Anita McBride, White House personnel director under President Bush. And Walker Stapleton, a cousin of President Bush, both attended the services today. Welcome to both of you, Anita and Walker. Thank you so much for being here. It was a very moving day.
WALKER STAPLETON, COUSIN OF PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: Thank you, Martha.

        }
      
MACCALLUM: I think for everyone, and particularly so, for you, very close to this president. Walker, let me start with you as a family member as you watch today. What really stood out to you the most? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
STAPLETON: Well, he would have loved every minute of that service. It was a beautiful service for a beautiful man. And I can tell you, heaven now has the best that Earth has to offer in President Bush.
He had his dear friend, Al Simpson, cracking jokes. He had -- President Bush had a great sense of humor with his family always. I remember boating trips with him where he would dress in a different form of a speedo and take a picture on the bow of the boat each New Year.
He had a great sense of humor, and he loved his friends, and he loved his family. And that came through. His humanity came through in the service.  We honored a great man who served his country for 70 years. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But what made George Bush so special to his family and friends was his humanity. His relatability, his humility, his character, his integrity, his selflessness. That was George H.W. Bush. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

My wife was sitting next to me in the pew, and she said, I'm going to do something 41 would do. I'm going to give you half my stick of gum. He was the type of guy that if he was enjoying a stick of gum or a candy, he would break it in half and give you half. That's he lived his life with the example of treating others as you would want to be treated yourself. And that's what I'm going to miss the most, I think.
I'm going to miss his humanity, I'm going to miss discussions with him about what's important in life. There are some people they had just wish could live forever, because you never stop learning from them, and he was one of those people.

MACCALLUM: Anita, your thoughts as you watched all of this today.
ANITA MCBRIDE, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PERSONNEL DIRECTOR UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH:  Well, Walker stated it all perfectly. And you know, he is one of the lucky many who is a member of President Bush's family. And I'm one of the lucky many, many, many, who are one of his friends. And my husband -- you know, Tim, my husband worked for President Bush and Vice President Bush -- was his personal aide, the body guy, they got very close to him. And the Bush's treated him like a son, and the family was great to him too. And they loved him, so they embraced me when we got married, and our children.  And we felt such a big part of their lives. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And so, it was -- it was hard, of course, today. It was sad, but we were also so uplifted. As Walker said, by the jokes that painted a great picture who George Bush was. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: Yes.
MCBRIDE: And the love, the raw emotion of his son, George W. Bush to deliver the eulogy that he did. The presidential historian Jon Meacham has come to know so much about George Bush and Barbara Bush, through their letters, through their words, through their actions.
And you know told us so much about him. And Brian Mulroney, telling us how the rest of the world, world leaders around the world, how they looked at George Bush as resolute and brave. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I saw all of those things, all of us who worked for him, who know him, the family who adores him. I think all feel -- you know, this good and gracious man was beautifully, beautifully eulogized today. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: I thought it was so moving. In two of the eulogies, they focused in the beginning. Both Brian Mulroney and Jon Meacham, on the 18- year-old President Bush.
MCBRIDE: Yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: Youngman at the time, obviously. As his plane went down in the Pacific. And the lifelong question that he had for himself. Why was I spared? And Jon Meacham, I thought, Walker, so beautifully summed up after his -- at the end of his eulogy, looking at all of you, looking at the family, looking at the friends, and listening to all of the extraordinary elements of his life, and said, this is why. This is why (INAUDIBLE). 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
STAPLETON: He did. He lived his life within -- he lived his life within unbounding graciousness. And I was reflecting in that church today, I was lucky enough to be with 41 the day his mother passed. And I was lucky enough to be with his mother the day he became president of the United States. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And she waited until after his election for president, and after he had lost to pass away, he was still president in January 1993, in the last days of his presidency, really. And I remember talking to him about the importance of family when somebody you love passes on in life.
And he said that, that will -- we will always love them, we will always remember them, will honor them, we'll remember the good times, and they're in a better place now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And he, his whole life was loved. And his last days, when President Bush said his last words to him were, "I love you, too." I was lucky enough and fortunate enough to have those be his last words to me because I talked to him just a couple weeks ago. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And he -- talking to him about the politics. And he said, do your best, and I told him I loved him, and he said, I love you, too. And that's sums up, George --

MACCALLUM: I'm glad that you had that moment. It's -- I just want to -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I just want to show the aerial shot we have right now in Houston.

STAPLETON: Yes.
MACCALLUM: As the motorcade makes its way towards St. Martin Episcopal.  And we just keep an eye on that for just a moment. But I do want to just mention one lighter moment, Anita, what you brought up.
You know, the president had a great sense of humor and he could poke fun at himself, which was mentioned often today. And you told a great story about how the President himself after he lost the election, invited Dana Carvey to the White House to cheer everybody up. Tell us about that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb9', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MCBRIDE: Yes, right. I mean, here's -- you know, the one thing about George H.W. Bush, he always thought about and cared about the other guy.  And here was this very -- you know, difficult election. And he lost, and it hurt. And it hurt the staff too. And we felt so badly. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But he felt he let us down, and he wanted to brighten our spirits. Can you imagine that? And so, he called up Dana Carvey, invited him to come to the White House. And he and his wife slept in the Lincoln Bedroom, and then, the next day, surprised the staff with an East Room rendition of Dana Carvey's George Bush.
And just had everyone laughing. And just really feeling better for a few moments. Because President Bush cared about all of us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: Dana Carvey, said that when anybody works on his impression of President Bush, he said it's somewhere between Mr. Rogers, and trying to be John Wayne.
MCBRIDE: Yes. John Wayne, yes, it's perfect.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: Which I just thought was great. Walker, as we take a look at the motorcade as it makes its way to St. Martin's, tell the story about how you went out for a boat ride with 41. And he had just learned that he was going to be on the ticket as the running mate for Ronald Reagan. And he didn't mention it to you until the end of the ride. What happened? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
STAPLETON: Yes, well, you know, I was actually the perfect age. I was 6 years old, and he hadn't had his oldest grandson George P. who has become a lifelong friend, as well. And so, I was in the right place at the right time. And he called my dad and said I want Walker to come fishing. And my dad, said we'll be over at walkers point in a couple of minutes. He said, "No, no, just Walker. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And so, I got to go fishing with then-Ronald Reagan's day old vice presidential nominee, George H.W. Bush. And I remember coming back, and the coastline was lined with all these homemade signs along the main coastline, and it said, "We love you, George. We love you, Bar." I had no idea what was going on. I just loved this boat because it was really fast.
And I remember, I asked him what was happening and he turned to me, and he said -- he said public service is a great thing to do, and you're a little guy now, but you won't always be. And you should give it a try sometime, Walk. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I never forgot it, it's been an amazing example for me in my life and I'm fortunate enough to be the treasurer of Colorado and to have been the Republican nominee for governor. And I never would have given public service a try if it hadn't been for the influence of George H.W. Bush on my life.
MACCALLUM: Anita, obviously, you know, we talked so much today about all the lives that he touched. But also about the policy that he was able to carry out. Very successful in foreign policy.
MCBRIDE: Right.
MACCALLUM: And perhaps, to be credited with the end of the Cold War -- the peaceful end of the Cold War. I heard an interesting moment when he talked about meeting Gorbachev, initially before President Reagan got to know him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And he came back and he said, "You know, I think this might be someone that we could work with. I think this might be -- there might be a future here." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MCBRIDE: Right.
MACCALLUM: Tell us a little bit about that.
MCBRIDE: And see how great -- you know, as such a loyal vice president and President Reagan trusted him, and he -- Vice President Bush traveled all over the world, meeting with leaders. And, of course, would bring this valuable information and in -- and be a confidant to President Reagan. I mean, that's why they were such an incredibly strong team. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then, you saw -- you know, representatives of these countries that George H.W. Bush stood by. You saw them in the church today. Angela Merkel, representing, you know, a unified Germany that George Bush had so much to do with and then the President of Poland when Vice President Bush, of course, stood with the Polish people and visited when he was vice president as they were on their march towards freedom. And you know, this is the vast experience that this man had already before becoming vice president, before becoming president. That made him just a consistently strong global leader as the world was transforming before our eyes during his time.
MACCALLUM: Just looking at the door --
STAPLETON: And Martha, he also --
MACCALLUM: Go ahead. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
STAPLETON: Yes, he also practiced personal diplomacy better than anybody.  I mean Brian Mulroney talked about it today. He was one of the few world leaders that could keep up with him. (INAUDIBLE) got seasick I remember when he would have him on his boat. And it was a question of what world leader could keep up with his tennis, then a couple hours of fishing, then nine holes of golf.
I remember being with him the morning that Desert Shield turned into Desert Storm and he had King Hussein of Jordan flying to Walker's Point to meet with him and then he had a family barbecue going on the back porch. And he could transition really quickly between dealing with Brent Scowcroft and King Hussein of Jordan are discussing what happened in the Red Sox game last night with his family members. He just had an incredible ability to weave family and personal relationships into the things that he loved most in his life.
MCBRIDE: He is never idle.
MACCALLUM: I think that's an excellent point. It's a great point. Let me bring in Brit Hume, Fox News Channel Senior Policy Analysts who I had the pleasure of being with earlier today. And Brit, you, of course, were inside having followed this president and been a friend -- have a friendship with him all of these years. You know, this -- we're seeing the circle sort of completed here geographically. He began in Texas, passed away in Texas, and of course, after having spent the summer in Kennebunkport, something he very much wanted to do, D.C. in the middle of this journey and now he is coming back home. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: You know Martha, I was thinking -- I was as -- I was in that church today among that huge throng that was attended. This man lived all over the place. You know, he was born in Massachusetts, grew up partly in Connecticut, moved to Texas, spent time in New York at the U.N., spent time here as Vice President, spent time in Beijing.
This guy was -- everywhere he went, he had this gift for friendship, this knack, because people when you -- when politicians reach out to you, you're glad they're friendly, most of them are and they like people and that's all fine. He had a special way about him. And you sense the genuineness in his -- in his friendliness and people liked it, people loved it. And you saw signs of that today in this -- in this enormous throng that was in that -- in that Cathedral.
That Cathedral is kind of old stomping grounds for me because I went to school on those grounds and I have almost never seen it so full. It was really, really packed. And now he returns to this huge Episcopal Church, a beautiful Church in Houston where he was -- where he worshiped for so many years. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: Yes, it's a great point. Yes, I think it's extraordinary. I don't think too many of us can say we have 3,200 friends that will -- that will pack the Cathedral in Washington D.C., but he certainly did. And you really got that feeling there that this was you know, that this was not a business funeral. These were friends, dear friends who he had known his whole life from all around the globe.
Brit, when you and I spoke earlier, I know you were especially moved by the music that was played today at the National Cathedral and I think -- do we have a little bit of that sound in the control room? Let's play that, Brit, and I want to get your thoughts on that.
MACCALLUM: I don't think you're human if you don't -- if that doesn't get you. The soaring eternal -- the Eternal Father Strong To Save, it's the Navy Hymn, Brit.
HUME: That was -- that was -- Martha, that's the final stanza of the Navy him whose first words are eternal father strong to save and the rest of that first stanza is whose hand has bound the -- amid the mighty ocean deep its own appointed limits keep, who's bound is bound the reckless raise, its own appointed -- amid the mighty ocean deep its own opponent limits keep, o hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. I sort of stumble over that.
I've known that hymn and heard it all my life. Appropriate for him of course because he was a Navy man, and as we all now have heard for several days, he was the youngest Navy pilot ever when he enlisted before going to college. He could have ducked it, he could have, but he didn't. He listed. Serb was shot down. We nearly lost him.
And I was so touched today when Jon Meacham was talking about you know, that he Bush, Bush 41 had often wondered why he was saved. You know, his crewmates were lost when the plane was shot down. And after you hear what he did in his life and what he did with his life, one had the sense that Providence was at work in saving him that day to do all that he did before his life ended.
MACCALLUM: Yes. And his son said this is why you were spared when he looked out at that church and he looked back on his life. And now we see the motorcade carrying the hearse of Bush 41 is now pulling up in front of St. Martin's Episcopal in Houston. This will begin the whole next chapter of this recognition and it will be Texas style. It will be big. There will be people lining the avenues throughout Houston. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I'm speaking with Karl Rove earlier. He was you know, loving his home state and boasting that in Texas the turnout was just going to be so enormous and so beautiful and such an outpouring of affection for this man who as you say, Brit, was a son of Greenwich, Connecticut, went to Greenwich Country Day School and over. But this is where he considered home and where he raised his family and where he chose to strike out as young man and start his life on his own. Anita, some thoughts as we see the hearse pull up here and we wait for the next stage.
MCBRIDE: Well, I think you know he was just a great citizen wherever he lived, to every community that he was a part of. You know, he embraced that community and he was so active and so was Mrs. Bush of course. And in turn, all their neighbors adored them. And they were fixtures everywhere in town. And you know even today when I heard at one of the eulogies the mentioned that I had forgotten even being a young staffer in the White House how much they enjoyed all of the sites here in Washington too, the theaters that they frequented, restaurants that they went to. I mean, they were a part of the community and they were every single place that they lived.
MACCALLUM: And faith obviously such a big part of his life hard.
MCBRIDE: Faith in his life.
MACCALLUM: And we look at these beautiful altar servers with the cross standing next to his hearse as we wait for the moment when they will carry the hearse inside. He will lie in repose over the course of tonight and into tomorrow morning and yet another respectful military guard arriving now to greet this coffin, the pallbearers for this stage of this funeral.  Let's just watch this for a moment
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: mark time, bearers, halt! Center face! (INAUDIBLE) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END VIDEOTAPE)
MACCALLUM: I was listening -- just a quick thought here. I was listening to something over the weekend and it was a campaign ad from his early run for the Senate in Texas and they were doing an interview with George Bush and his lovely wife Barbara and they talked about how you know, the young family had come to Texas to begin their lives together and were you know, active members at St. Martin's Episcopal in Houston, Texas and you know, just sort of a wonderful, wholesome kind of old-style campaign ad and that was the kind of thing that was important to voters.
They wanted to know that you went to church, that you took your family there, and that was you know very much a part of the Bush's life in this -- in their home in Houston as they started out. The President ran for Senate unsuccessfully, then became a Congressman, then ran for Senator again, and then they put Lloyd Bentsen up against him. It was sort of a moderate in Texas and he lost that too. And Richard Nixon had encouraged him to run at that point and that didn't work out. So he brought him to New York and appointed him as the U.N. Ambassador.
And that was you know, began that sort of foreign policy New York stage that led to the ambassadorship in China. So this is really where the political chapter of George Bush's life began after he you know, got into the oil business when he arrived in Texas as a very young man. And as has been pointed out, they lived in a very, very modest home in Texas.
And George W. Bush pointed out today that they shared a bathroom in the hallway with a mother and you know, a younger woman I guess who was -- who were ladies of the night. And he said, you know, my dad always respected them and you know, we all lived together in this really tiny house and just quite a different set of circumstances from the way he grew up and just clearly a sign that he was you know, he wanted to make their own way in the world.
So, Brit, as we watched this moment, we're just sort of in a pause right now. You know, any thoughts you have on the Texas part of George Bush's life?
HUME: Well think of that Parrish down there, Martha, St. Martin's Episcopal in Houston. The church you see there now is relatively new and built since long after he worshiped there originally. It is -- it is the single largest Episcopal congregation in the country as far as I know and it isn't -- and it was, of course, today the at this Cathedral with all the grand ease of the National Episcopal Church in attendance, it was the rector of St. Martin's who delivered the homily and a very fine homily it was. There you get a sense of the grandeur of that church now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think no doubt contributed to by the fact that this was the President Bush's church. And I think we've come to learn, Martha, in these few days as we've heard people reflecting on him just how central to his life his faith was. He didn't make a lot of noise about it or talk about it very much and he is you know, he subsequently expressed some regret about that.  But I think that to Christians across this country and perhaps farther, his faith and the way he lived it and his life become an inspiration made more so by what we've learned about it just in these recent days.
MACCALLUM: Absolutely. And I think of Saint Anne's Church which is on this beautiful little promontory in Kennebunkport, Maine and it has an outdoor summer church with pews that just look right over the water and an altar where the -- where the minister stands to give the service and it's just a beautiful place and also a deep spiritual place for the Bush family as well. And now we see the casket in the hands of the pallbearers as we begin this procession into St. Martin's this evening. We'll listen in.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Present arms. With faith in Jesus Christ we receive the body of our brother George for burial.
Let's pray with confidence to God, the giver of life that he will raise him to the perfection and the company of saints. Deliver your servant George, sovereign Lord, Christ from all evil and set him free from every bond so he may rest with all your saints in the eternal habitations.
Where with the father and the Holy Spirit you live and reign. One God, now and forever. Amen.
Let us also pray for all who mourn that may cast their care on God and know the consolation of his love.
Almighty God, look with pity on the sorrow of your servants for whom we pray. Remember them, lord, in mercy, nourish them with patience, comfort them with a sense of your goodness. Lift up your countenance upon them and give them peace through Jesus Christ, our lord. Amen.

MACCALLUM: Walker? Thank you, Anita. Walker?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, Martha, I was down in that church in April with Bret and Anita when we said goodbye as a family to Barbara Bush, the love of George Bush's life. And I remember how much time he took to stand in front of her casket when she was lying in repose and to shake hands of all the people that came through.
And as your cameras watch who comes to the church over the next 12 hours you will see people from all walks of life. Because George Bush honored people from all walks of life. Whether they be in the coat room, the mail room or at his dinner table.
And he treated them all with dignity and respect and he nurtured his relationships for many of those people through his voracious letter writing. And I think there is no greater tribute to George H.W. Bush than the rings of Houstonians who will come through that door from all walks of life in the next couple of hours to pay tribute to his life.
MACCALLUM: You make a great point. I know that you pointed out earlier, Walker, that President Bush gave the eulogy at Woodrow Willoughby's funeral. He was the elevator--

MACCALLUM: -- the elevator man at the White House. And that was important for him to do.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly. And as Anita can tell you, I was in the White House just a few days before he left. It was like somebody had died because he treated every member of the White House staff like a member of their family. He went and eulogized a White House elevator operator who most people didn't pay the time of day to. But George Bush did. And he treated him like a family member.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And 30 members of that household staffer there today at that funeral to honor him.
MACCALLUM: Brit, a final thought as we watch what is getting close to the final chapter of this extraordinary day.
BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, it's hard to add much to the sights and the sounds, Martha and to the fine words of your other guests. But I would say this, Christians everywhere await meeting their maker. In the hope that they will be greeted with the words from scripture "well done, good and faithful service."
And George H.W. Bush as we discussed it didn't talk a lot about his faith but I think it's fair to say he certainly lived it and embodied its values. And I certainly am confident that those words are waiting for him.
MACCALLUM: Thank you very much to all of you. As the priest said today to pray and sometimes with words.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Casket down. Bearers, up.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To my right, raise. Forward, march.  RUSSELL LEVENSON, PRIEST, ST. MARTIN'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH: My everlasting God, we yield unto thee, the most high praise and hearty thanks to the wonderful grace and virtue declared in all thy saints who have been the choice vessels of thy grace and thy light of world and several generations.
Some beseeching me to give us grace or follow the example of their steadfastness in thy faith and obedience to thy Holy Commandments that the day of the general resurrection, we with all of those who are the mystical body of thy son may be set on his right hand and hear his most joyful voice, come ye, blessed of my father, and inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
Grant this, father, for the sake of thy son Jesus Christ, our only mediator and advocate. Amen.
MACCALLUM: Prayers tonight from the Reverend Dr. Russell Levenson who gave a wonderful homily today at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., has now traveled home with George Herbert Walker Bush to St. Martin's Episcopal in Houston and prayed over his casket this evening. As it lies in repose throughout the rest of this evening.
We will take a quick break. I want to thank Brit Hume and Anita McBride and Walker Stapleton for their wonderful contributions to our coverage this evening. And we will be right back after this.

MACCALLUM: Day of mourning in the United States of America. And President George H.W. Bush will be laid to rest tomorrow at the - his Presidential Library in Houston. And in keeping with tradition, he will be outfitted with a special pair of socks which was something that he enjoyed doing throughout the course of his later years in particular. These socks pay homage to his service in the navy during World War II.
My next guest sent Bush 41 a special pair of socks earlier this year. And you can imagine his surprise when the president tweeted back, quote, "Yesterday, I was inspired by my friend, John Cronin to wear these beauties from at John's Crazy Socks marking World Down Syndrome Day. Great socks, supporting a wonderful cause."
And the two became pen pals. The president even wearing John's Crazy Socks to his beloved wife's funeral. You see the books all over them because that was very important to Barbara Bush. So, here now welcoming back to the Story, our good friend John Cronin, with his dad Mark, the cofounders of the John's Crazy Socks. Hi, John, thank you so much for coming back.
JOHN CRONIN, CO-FOUNDER, JOHN'S CRAZY SOCKS: Hi.
MACCALLUM: And I know you have been traveling a lot and you were in the rotunda last night. Why was it important to you to go pay your respects to the president?
CRONIN: Yesterday, we went to see. I wanted to give back. I think it's a great idea because--
(CROSSTALK)
MARK CRONIN, CO-FOUNDER, JOHN'S CRAZY SOCKS: What did you say about President Bush, right? He said he was your friend.
J. CRONIN: I said he was my friend.
M. CRONIN: And you wanted to pay your respects, right?
J. CRONIN: Right.
M. CRONIN: Did you feel good doing that?
J. CRONIN: I feel good a little bit. I feel a little sad.
MACCALLUM: Yes.
J. CRONIN: I feel a little sad that he passed.
MACCALLUM: We all do, John.
J. CRONIN: I want to cry. He is my hero. He is my (Inaudible).
M. CRONIN: Right.
MACCALLUM: Can I share what you wrote in the book when you were there? I'll put it on the screen.
J. CRONIN: Sure.
MACCALLUM: You said to the Bush family -- "Thank you very much. I sent the president socks. When he wore them, it made me very happy. I hope my socks made him very happy. I am going to miss him very much. And he is a very good guy." And there is the note you wrote up there on the screen. That was a really nice note you wrote, John.
M. CRONIN: Well, you know what? You made him happy when he wore your socks, right?
J. CRONIN: Right.
M. CRONIN: How did you feel when he sent you socks?
J. CRONIN: It made me feel really happy. He made my day. I want to show him how much I appreciate that he wore my socks.
M. CRONIN: You know, he is one of the most powerful men in the world who reached out to touch my son. It's an amazing thing. And they had a lot in common.
President Bush started his career as a wildcat or as an entrepreneur. John is an entrepreneur. They both love socks. But they both had something else. President Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act which changed the world for so many. And it made possible the education John got. And many of the opportunities.
And without that act, there would be no John's Crazy Socks. So that was pretty special. And you advocate all the time for people with different abilities, too, right?
J. CRONIN: I do.
M. CRONIN: How many times have you testified before Congress?
J. CRONIN: I testified five times -- six times!
M. CRONIN: You have been down there six times but you testified twice this year, right?
J. CRONIN: Right.
M. CRONIN: What did you tell Congress? What are people ready to do?
J. CRONIN: Are you ready, willing and able to work.
M. CRONIN: Ready, willing and able to work, right?
J. CRONIN: Right.
M. CRONIN: And you make that happen.
J. CRONIN: I make it happen. I want to say. I want to let people know I have down syndrome. And down syndrome it never held me back. (Inaudible) I am never ashamed. I want to -- I want the world to see I have a feeling, I have a way.
M. CRONIN: And what you can do, right.
J. CRONIN: And what I want to do.
M. CRONIN: We built--
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: I don't think of--
M. CRONIN: -- we built a business that makes that happen, right? We have 35, we have been able to create 35 jobs, 18 of those are held by people with differing abilities. It keeps showing the world what's possible.
MACCALLUM: You guys do great work. And I can't think of a better tribute to President Bush. And I know that you have some socks that you made for him. Can you show those to us?
J. CRONIN: Sure.
M. CRONIN: What I don't we show these? These are brand new.
J. CRONIN: Yes.
M. CRONIN: These are our President George H.W. Bush tribute socks. And $2 from them, all the proceeds from them, are going to the Barbara Bush Family Literacy foundation. She was the love of his life. And we already--
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: Those are beautiful.
M. CRONIN: We have the books the socks that he wore and they both raised money for the Barbara Bush Family Literacy Foundation.
MACCALLUM: What does it say on the bottom of those socks?
M. CRONIN: It says, "W know what works. Freedom works. We know what's right. Freedom is right." Pretty good, right, John?
J. CRONIN: Pretty good.
MACCALLUM: John, I know that you are a little sad today. I think the whole country is a little sad. That's why it's a national day of mourning. But I do want to tell everybody because I follow you on Instagram. And every time your face pops up, you make me happy.
Every time I see you, it makes me really happy. And it just reminds me of that nothing should hold any of us back. All of the great possibilities and what you have done with your life and your business is something that you should be really, really proud of.
M. CRONIN: What's our mission, pal?
J. CRONIN: Our mission is spread happiness.
MACCALLUM: It's working. It's working!
J. CRONIN: I'm so happy right now! I'm glad I did this.
MACCALLUM: Thank you so much.
J. CRONIN: I love it. And I love my dad. Dad, I love you.
M. CRONIN: I know, buddy. You are my man.
MACCALLUM: Thank you guys for coming back. Come back again, OK.
M. CRONIN: Thank you very much.
MACCALLUM: Don't be strangers. Good to see you both. Great work. And we love your socks.
M. CRONIN: We brought some for you.
MACCALLUM: We will be right back with more. Thank you. These are so cool, John.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: Well, the funeral today brought together presidents and political foes past and president. Take a look at the moment that President Trump took his seat from my coverage live earlier this morning.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MACCALLUM: You just have to wonder if the lesson of the life of President Bush, the 41st president of the United States leaves an impression on our political process, whether it's for 24 hours or whether it lasts longer than that, the lessons of his life are so potent and his own ability to put aside his differences with people who he had run against.
You know, Bob Dole, he ran against the nomination twice. They became dear, dear friends. And you can't look at this front row and the divisiveness that we have in this country today without a moment, I think, of hopefulness.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
MACCALLUM: I just thought that was extraordinary. And here it is again. And Hillary just sort of staring straight ahead. So, was that a snub? A lot of people said it was.
Let's see what Jesse Watters, host of Watters World, and co-host of The Five thought about that moment today. Hell, Jesse.
JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi, Martha.
MACCALLUM: So, what did you make of, talk about intrapersonal dynamics. There was a lot going on there.
WATTERS: Yes. There was a lot to look at, I mean, one guy shredding the other guy's legacy, the other guy wiretapped the other guy. The row before, you know, have dossier getting thrown around. It's ugly.
And think about some of the things they've said about each other. I mean, you are a foreign-born terrorist sympathizer. You are a mentally ill trader. Hey, you are a rapist. Horrible things. Yet, they sat next to each other. I thought it was fine. I didn't see any snubs. It's a somber moment. They are in the front row. What, are they going to reach across?
MACCALLUM: I mean, look at Hillary, you know, she just look straight ahead. She flew a nod there. You know, I mean, for one thing they can't reach across the entire aisle and shake everyone's hand.
WATTERS: Right.
MACCALLUM: And this also just to remind people at home this was a moment, you know, before it was kind of jovial and people were chatting, but this was not that moment. Everyone was seated and ready for it to begin.
WATTERS: Yes.
MACCALLUM: So, they are focused.
WATTERS: Right.
MACCALLUM: Then they brought the president in.
WATTERS: And you are supposed to sit there and look straight ahead. You're not supposed to take any other attention away. If you think about it, she acknowledged, Melania, didn't really acknowledge President Trump. I mean, she wants to be president. Donald Trump said, if you were president he would lock her up. So, there's--
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: Yes. That makes things a little awkward.
WATTERS: -- some bad blood there but I didn't think that it needed to be manufactured to such an extent this is a controversy. I think everybody sat there politely and paid their respects to a higher power.
MACCALLUM: Go back, let's put the video one more time. Because what I looked at the second time around is, I like watching Marilyn Quayle, she's like, this is going to be interesting.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: She's like, get the popcorn out.
MACCALLUM: This is going to be interesting. And then I don't know if you can see but Dick Cheney was in the background. He also was watching the whole thing. Is he like, I'm removed now? I don't really need to worry about this stuff anymore. But he watched every, every single--
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Yes. And he's got his eyes on everything. Who knows what Cheney is up to.
MACCALLUM: But it's always extraordinary to see a collection of our nation's presidents all in that front row today. It was quite something.
WATTERS: Very special.
MACCALLUM: From beginning to end. Jesse, thank you.
WATTERS: Thank you, Martha.
MACCALLUM: For spending the evening with me. It's great to have you with us as always on a Wednesday. That is "The Story" for tonight. We'll be back here tomorrow night. Tucker Carlson is up next in Washington, D.C. Good night, everybody.
