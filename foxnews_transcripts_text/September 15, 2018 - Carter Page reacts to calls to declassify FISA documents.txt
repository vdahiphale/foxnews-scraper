JEANINE PIRRO, HOST: Hello and welcome to "Justice," I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. First, I just want to take a moment to say our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of and affected by tropical storm Florence, including my sister and her husband who live just outside of Wilmington. To everyone, please stay safe. 
We'll have an update on the storm at the bottom of the hour. And as always, a big thanks to all of you for once again making "Justice" number one last weekend and for making "Liars, Leakers & Liberals" continue to stay on that old New York Times bestsellers list. We have a big show on deck for you tonight with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Governor Mike Huckabee, Tom Fitton, Carter Page to name just a few of the great guests that we have standing by.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But first, my open. Tonight is more than an open. It's who I am. It's what I know and what I did for over three decades. As a prosecutor, a superior court judge as well as elected district attorney. The way it works is you are innocent until you are proven guilty. Clear, unambiguous words etched in stone. Why would anyone ignore this truth, especially the ranking Democrat on Senate Judiciary, Senator Dianne Feinstein, is stunning. But you shouldn't be surprised. The left is committed to the removal of a duly elected president, the destruction of our system of capitalism, and now an all-out assault on our system of justice.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
To them you are guilty - guilty until proven innocent. But no one in all the years I've spent in courtrooms has ever been able to prove a negative. So forget the time-honored notion like due process, probable cause, beyond a reasonable doubt or a jury of your peers. Today, unsupported, uncorroborated, untested words, not facts are sufficient to convict not just in the court of public opinion, but in the esteemed hallowed halls of the United States Senate.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Forget the right to counsel, the ability to defend yourself, the right confront your accuser or even cross-examine your accuser. Truth in this scheme is nothing more than collateral damage if a Republican is on the receiving end of an anonymous allegation. 
So Dianne, let me see if I get this. Another Democrat, a congresswoman from California, no less, forwards a July letter to you containing a completely unsubstantiated claim that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while in high school tried to force himself on another high school student almost 40, I said 40 years ago.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Kavanaugh for anyone who even cares has categorically and unequivocally denied the allegation. So why are we just hearing being this now? Dianne, when you get the letter, what do you do to make sure it's real? That the person is even real? Given the left's penchant to buy fake dossiers, make up facts and collude with the media to sabotage even the President of the United States, forgive me if I think it's all hogwash. Okay, you say quote, "The individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further. And I honored have that decision." 
Dianne, you honored that decision. Did you even speak to this alleged person? Did you meet with her, talk with her, interview her? Did you ask her to meet with others? Did you ask why she said nothing for almost 40 years? And Dianne, why would you wait to even send it to the FBI? Is it because nothing in you and your pack of demon rats, that's what I said, demon rats, aka, Democrats bag of tricks was working against Kavanaugh. Nothing was working that you were doing beginning with Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and every unhinged lunatic you could find.

PIRRO: Then, Dianne, you've been sitting on this letter for almost two months. You let Brett Kavanaugh go through days of Senate hearings, meeting with Senators, answered then additional 263 pages of 1,300 follow- up written questions, and now, you want to character assassinate this man who has undergone six FBI full field investigations where no such allegation resembling this anonymous nonsense has ever surfaced?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Dianne, as a Ranking Member of the committee interviewing Kavanaugh, how could you possibly let a moment pass without addressing the issue when Kavanaugh was right in front of you and would have had the opportunity to respond? What were you thinking? Are you stupid? Why would you let it go? Let me tell you why you let it go, Dianne. Because even you didn't believe it. What other reason could there be?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

 Now, I know about women who have been sexually assaulted and the kind of pain they go through. It is different from other crimes. It lingers and rears its head throughout their lives. I have prosecuted on their behalf for decades. One of the ways that we establish their credibility is with how recent their complaint is. A recent outcry is enormously powerful. An anonymous one almost 40 years later, not so much, Dianne. But silence? I guess, I shouldn't be surprised. You bozos in Congress actually had a fund of taxpayers' money, our money, to pay congressional staffers who were victims of sexual misconduct by your coworkers. 
It's a fund that even you as a woman, a powerful senator kept quiet about. Whose side are you on? Does it depend on the politics? Does it depend on the politics of the accused? Your audacity to destroy and try to destroy a man with impeccable credentials, harm his family and shift the burden of proof to the accused by alleging one of the most of heinous allegations imaginable shows your complete disregard for truth, justice and the American way. 
That's my open. Do you think Dianne Feinstein is a liar, leaker or liberal? Or all three? There is only one way to find out. My new book, New York Times number one bestseller, "Liars, Leakers, & Liberals: The Case against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy." All right, joining me now with reaction to my open, and to discuss the vital issue of conservative censorship, House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy. Chairman, thank you very much for being with us.

Now, who needs a Constitution or a system of justice when after all of these months, after Brett Kavanaugh has been in the public eye and under scrutiny, and Dianne Feinstein at the 11th hour says, "Hey, I've got this anonymous letter almost 40 years ago. He sexually abused somebody, but we are not going to - we didn't bring it up until just now." What took them so long?

REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, R-CA, HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Well, you make a great point, Judge, that she waited until after the hearing. Think about all of that time, but this wasn't the only hearing this judge has gone through. Remember, he has done all the background checks by working in the White House. He has been appointed a judge so he had to go through there as well. It's never came up and why would they wait until after. 
But also remember, Senator Feinstein, her own body person, her driver, we found out worked for the Chinese government, and we didn't find that out for a couple of years later. So remember what we're dealing with here. This is politics. This is how far this country has split apart. Whereas they would print just as the New York Times an anonymous letter without a name. So now, they are going forward with this. This is the wrong thing to do by the wrong person.

MCCARTHY: I mean, time and time again, they embarrass themselves. And this is not where we're going. We have three separate branches of government. Judge Kavanaugh has been through every scrutiny there possibly has been. I though the way he handled himself with all the uprising, the number of people that would try to break it up and get arrested just to be on television, he had a mind which I think I want somebody on a judge like that. Understands the Constitution and kept his head and answered the questions.

PIRRO: You know, it really is shameful, but I guess, they shouldn't be surprised given what they are doing to even the president. But I want to move on to something that is incredibly important and I want to continue to talk about going forward after tonight. 
And that is the Google Twitter, Facebook and what has been going on. You are at the tip of the spear in Congress as it relates to getting Google to come before you and answer some questions. Why and how far are you getting? 
MCCARTHY: Understand this, Judge. I actually am the founder with another Congressman, Patrick McHenry on the innovation initiative. I believe in technology and I come from California. But I do not like bias toward conservatives. So this is something we have been working on, sometime we got the CEO of Twitter who came before us. Where I give Jack credit, where he did admit that they did shadow-banned conservatives, where he came out ...

PIRRO: Explain what you mean to my viewers - sorry, Kevin, Kevin. Kevin, sorry, explain to my viewers what you mean by shadow-ban. 
MCCARTHY: Shadow banning is they went through conservative on Twitter, puts some information out long before they won't even know it's not going to all the followers. People don't see it. So it's just not - people aren't seeing it on the Twitter feed. Now trace of this from Facebook, this is a problem I had, too, what they did to Prager University. They banned when they talked about baseball or Israel.

But the real concern I have today that I've put out last week was Google. I mean, your viewers have to understand, 90% of all searches go through Google. When you go through that second page of the information, 95% drop off. They control the information that we are seeing on the internet. When you see the video that came forward ...

PIRRO: And Congressman, that is the day after Donald Trump was elected. There is proof positive if we have more time that they hate conservatives, they hate Donald Trump. Can any conservatives feel safe on Facebook and Twitter and should they get information from Google? 
MCCARTHY: That's exactly what we are working towards, to stop the bias because there's other concerns I have as well. You have what they call the silent donation where they work to actually get certain people to the polls to find out that they wanted Hillary to vote what we saw there.

But what's even more disturbing as an American, not just as a conservative as I am, Google stopped working with the US military, but they work with Russia and China, and it just came out ,you know what they are doing in China? They created a search engine for them so that the Chinese government can spy on the people using and you know the words they are searching for? Human rights. Student protests. But they won't work with the US government? But they work with Russia to take down things that dealt with Putin. 
PIRRO: Amazing. 
MCCARTHY: That is what is wrong. The bias has got to stop. Remember when Google started? Remember what their motto was? They said, do no evil.

And joining me now to discuss the latest in the never ending Mueller witch hunt, Judicial Watch President, Tom Fitton. One of the only men in DC who can actually get answers for the American people. Tom, I'm tired of always giving you kudos. 
TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: I'm not tired of it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: We are so proud of you, Tom. But listen, now, the latest that we have is that with the leaking. We've got the Strzok and the Page e-mails. Clearly, they are in a situation where they are intentionally trying to leak. They now say, "Don't believe your lying eyes. We were trying to stop the leaks," and they then actually pat each other on the back when they get negative stories about the President or Carter Page. Tell us what the latest is.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
FITTON: They talk about the media leak strategy and they are saying the media leak strategy is to stop media leaks, which obviously, doesn't make any sense. And there is news reports out this weekend saying that the leak of the dossier, which they are talking about over unclassified systems. By the way, the dossier at the time was classified according to the FBI and DOJ.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They say the leak of the dossier in the beginning of the Trump administration to CNN and Buzzfeed, they said, "Well, maybe we can use this as a pretext to go out and interview people." 
So this leak strategy, it looks like, that they know it was happening. It was either coming out of their sister agencies, the FBI has acknowledged to be involved in stories. And of course, they knew that Christopher Steele was leaking information and Fusion GPS was leaking information. They didn't tell the FISA courts any of that.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So they were spying on President Trump through Spygate. They were taking up the Trump organizations and the Trump campaign's phone records. They were targeting Carter Page with an illegal FISA warrant, targeting the Trump campaign, Trump with an illegal FISA warrant, through this Page warrant. And it's all part of that strategy was the leak of all that classified investigative activity to the media to make Trump look bad. 
I was laughing because this Google video, you could have had the same video be run by the videotape at the FBI. That was the reaction of the FBI to the Trump victory and we see what they tried to do and the resulting investigation is this Mueller special counsel operations. 
PIRRO: It's sick. It's sick. The whole thing is sick. And by the way, we have Carter Page coming up as the next guest. But what I find so incredible is that when this stuff is leaked, they actually come out, Peter Strzok, just like he did at the hearings, he says, his lawyer comes out and says, "Oh, no, they were investigating leaks and they wanted to stop them." 
But we now know that they are text messages to each other about congratulating each other. That they are getting articles written and the strategy is working is consistent with the articles coming out. What is coming next? How much worse is it going to get, Tom?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
FITTON: These are text messages that they found that supposedly had been deleted. So they are e-mails that no one really has seen. They are slow walking the release of e-mails to Judicial Watch separately. There is the rest of that FISA application that the President by all accounts is prepare to declassify, it's just a matter of when, not if.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It is getting worse in terms of the underlying corruption and my view is the President needs to stop it either through executive authority on his own or seek some sort of court action to stop this Mueller investigation. You know Judge, if all the cops involved in a prosecution before you were doing this type of corruption, what would you tell the prosecutors? Get your case out of here and investigate the investigator. 
PIRRO: I would absolutely do that. Anyway, Tom Fitton, thank you so much and everyone, the word is the declassification may happen soon. Anyway, Governor Mike Huckabee is still ahead, but next is President Trump ready to declassify documents that could shed explosive new light on the plot to frame him in the Russia investigation? I talk live next with one of the key figures in the Mueller investigation from the very beginning. Carter Page. He's here with us. Don't miss it. 
Developing tonight, President Trump looks poised to finally declassify previously redacted sections of FISA applications against former Trump campaign associate, Carter Page. Joining me now with his very unique perspective on all of this including the Mueller investigation motivation behind it, former Trump campaign associate, Carter Page himself.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Your first visit on "Justice," Carter, we are delighted to have you on. And so, I want to start and move very quickly through this. You have been through so much. We now know that liars and leaks and the liberals in the DOJ as well as the Department of the Justice want to frame Donald Trump in order to impeach him. 
Do you wake up at night and say, "This is a huge thing that's going on, how am in the middle of this?" 
CARTER PAGE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATE: It's like I often say, Judge Jeanine, it's not about me, it's about fixing the disaster that this has created for our country. 
PIRRO: Well, how are you so tough?

PAGE: I have incredible support from people that have been doing a lot of work, including Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch. People in Congress like Chairman Nunes and Chairman Grassley that have been doing so much to try to get the truth out there, and you know, you and your team at Fox. It's been incredible. 
PIRRO: All right, well, let me ask you this. Do you ever wonder why it was so easy for them to accuse you? And by the way, this has been going on for years. You are still walking around. But do you ever worry? If they were going to frame the President, maybe they will frame me, too? 
PAGE: Certainly, they would definitely try. And actually, Congressman Nunes - sorry, Congressman Schiff is constantly throwing out words about me, testifying incorrectly in front of Congress, et cetera. It's so preposterous. 
PIRRO: All right, now, you know, Paul Manafort is put in solitary confinement 23 hours a day in an effort that I believe without a doubt was to break him. And right now, we realize that, you know, they will do anything to break someone in order to get at this President. But the Strzok and the Page texts now make it very clear that they were leaking information about a FISA warrant involving you that no one in this country has ever seen in a newspaper before. Should these guys go to jail?

PAGE: Judge Jeanine, it's funny. When I was - Devlin Barrett from The Washington Post had a report about me having various interviews with the FBI in March of 2017. The following months, they kept having these various leaks which you are referring to, and I actually told them similar to what Mr. Manafort's attorney said yesterday. He had a lot of security threats in various - he's concerned about his safety. That's exactly what I told the FBI that month as well. 
It's really a terrible shame that instead of thinking about safety of Americans, they are concerned about political agendas. So, it's really disgraceful. 
PIRRO: But it's interesting, I see your tweet from today. You say with you, too, have suffered death threats, Carter.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

PAGE: Absolutely. I alerted to the FBI to this in march. And sure enough, you know, as you correctly allude to, liars, leakers and liberals. The following month after I spent over 10 hours as was illegally disclosed to The Washington Post later in the year. Sure enough, I actually had additional death threats after that came out. 
PIRRO: I'm so sorry, Carter Page. Anyway, thank you so much for being with us. Keep the faith. Hang on. The truth comes out. 
PAGE: Absolutely. 
PIRRO: A war of nasty words between the President and the former Secretary of State over Iran. We'll hash it out next with the panel - Dan Bongino and Chris Hahn ready to go at it when "Justice" rolls on. You don't want to miss those two. 
ROBERT GRAY, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from "America's News Headquarters," I'm Robert Gray. President Trump tweeting his condolences for the victims of Florence, tweeting, "Five deaths have been recorded thus far with regard to Hurricane Florence. Deepest sympathies and warmth go out to the families and friends of the victims. May God be with them." 
Meanwhile officials have raised the death toll to 11 as Florence continues slamming the Carolinas with torrential rains and life threatening storm surge. Thousands have been forced from their homes and many don't know when they can get back to survey the damage. Crews rushed to rescue people trapped by fast-moving floodwaters that are expected to worsen over the weekend. Some areas have already been hit with up to two feet of rain and forecasters predict another foot and a half is likely to fall over the weekend. I'm Robert Gray. Now back to the judge.

JOHN KERRY, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: He really is a rare combination of an 8-year-old boy - I mean, he's got the maturity of an 8-year-old boy with the insecurity of a teenage girl. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
PIRRO: That's President Obama's former Secretary of State responding to the president tweeting this earlier, "John Kerry had an illegal meetings with the very hostile Iranian regime, which can only serve to undercut our great work to the detriments of the American people. He told them to wait out the Trump administration. Was he registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act? Bad." 
My panel is ready to battle it out. NRA TV contributor, Dan Bongino and former aide to Chuck Schumer, radio show host, Chris Hahn join me. All right guys, here's the deal. So you've got John Kerry having meetings with the Foreign Minister of Iran, Mohammad Javad Zarif about the Iranian deal because he knows the President is going to can it. And three times they meet. Why isn't this a violation of the Logan Act which prohibits an unauthorized American citizen from negotiating with a foreign government? Chris Hahn? 
CHRIS HAHN, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Because he wasn't negotiating. I've got to ask the President, did he get together with John Kerry in an attempt to sell more books? Because he has done more for John Kerry's book sales than John Kerry would have had done by going on every show around the country. 
PIRRO: Okay, let's talk about the Logan Act ... 
HAHN: Okay. I'm ready, let's talk about it.

PIRRO: It prohibits an unauthorized American citizen from negotiating with a foreign government. What's he doing with the Prime Minister of Iran? Go ahead, Dan. 
DAN BONGINO, NRA TV CONRTIBUTOR: Yes, I don't know what Chris is talking about again. Listen, the Logan Act is crap, okay. The Logan Act is garbage. It is. It is crap. No one has been successfully prosecuted using the Logan Act in the history of the United States. Here's the problem, Judge, the Logan Act was the predicate for going after Lieutenant General Mike Flynn when Sally Yates was the Deputy Attorney General. 
So Chris cannot have it both ways. Pin him down on an answer right now. Either the Logan Act is crap like you just said and he will fully renounce and apologize to General Mike Flynn for this nonsense or he is a total hypocrite ... 
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: All right, Chris, explain it. 
HAHN: Let me explain, because I am an attorney. Mike Flynn was negotiating policy. John Kerry met with a former colleagues on the sidelines of a world event. And he said what do I do about Trump, and he said, wait him out. That is different ...

PIRRO: Wait a minute. He met in Munich. He met him in - in addition to Munich, he met him in Norway. He meets him at the UN, he even admits that he's talking to him about salvaging the Iran deal. That is negotiating with a foreign power. 
HAHN: He was not negotiating. 
PIRRO: What was he doing? Just chatting? 
HAHN: He's not ... 
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: Is this like Loretta Lynch on the tarmac when he started ... 
HAHN: Look, they are chatting, just like you and I when we go to parties, people want to talk politics with us. People want to talk diplomacy ...

PIRRO: I am not the Secretary of State and you are not a Prime Minister. He negotiated the deal, go ahead, Dan, hit it. 
BONGINO: Judge, again, this why people cannot stand liberals. I don't mind Democrats. It's liberals like Chris. Did you see the way he just snaked his way out of that? John Kerry did exactly what the definition of what negotiation would be. He was involved in a dispute with the United States over the Iran deal. He was unauthorized. He went overseas and he told the Iranians, an enemy of the United States, what to do to battle back against the Trump administration. In other words - what does Chris say, that wasn't negotiation. 
(CROSSTALK) 
HAHN: I saw a polar bear the other day, I told him to wait it out. 
PIRRO: Oh, please. Stop making jokes. Let me ask you a question ... 
HAHN: Go ahead. 
PIRRO: Why would Kerry be so invested in this Iran deal? Is he invested?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
HAHN: Yes, of course, he's invested. He's the one who got it together. 
PIRRO: He would violate the Logan Act and the Foreign Agents Relations Act. By the way, which I guess, it doesn't apply to Democrats, and only Republicans. 
(CROSSTALK) 
HAHN: I think the President would do a good service by not making this a big deal and maybe calling Kerry and getting some advice on what these Iranians are really doing. 
PIRRO: But we don't need Kerry to - go ahead, Dan. 
BONGINO: Get John Kerry's advice. Chris, did you miss the election? Where your whole crew got their butts booted out of office. What the hell do we want this guy's advice for? Wait, wait. Time out. Chris, shut it. This is the same guy we are supposed to take advice on tax policy from John Kerry who parks his boat in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes. 
PIRRO: And not only that, you want to talk boats - you want to talk about swift boat with John Kerry?

HAHN: Oh, now that's a low blow, Judge. 
PIRRO: That's not a low blow. That's appropriate. 
HAHN: No. 
PIRRO: He's got a low blow, who is he to negotiate? And by the way, you know what I read, I read this guy, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif is the best man reports are at the wedding of John Kerry's daughter. What is the connection here? What is this? Why were they so desperate to make this deal with a country that is determined to destroy us? 
HAHN: I think they wanted to stop them from getting a nuclear bomb. 
PIRRO: Oh, really, did that work? 
HAHN: Well, I think it did.

PIRRO: I'll stay out of it. Dan, go ahead. 
BONGINO: Judge, they put them on a pathway to a nuclear bomb. These people - did you miss the press conference by Netanyahu when the Israeli - the brave Israeli spies took out a treasure trove of documents? Literally showing how the Iranians are still building this bomb? Chris, do you even watch this channel? Do you watch the news ever? 
PIRRO: And what about Natanz and Fordow when they were spinning the centrifuges while they were negotiating with us and not even telling us they were spinning the centrifuges. I mean, they like. They lie. They want to kill us. 
HAHN: Hey, look, I think that the Iranians have to be watched closely and I think ... 
PIRRO: We don't have the ability under the monitoring. We cannot monitor the development, their nuclear development, we are not in the pact. 
HAHN: Look, we pulled out of the pact. 
PIRRO: We didn't pull out of the pact. Now, we're talking ...

        }
      
HAHN: All right, look, it was better than no pact. 
PIRRO: All right, go ahead, Dan, last word. You know I'm ... 
(CROSSTALK) 
BONGINO: When we inspected the Iranian military facilities where they're most likely to build the bomb, we have to ask them their permission first and they provide like a guide for us. I'm sure they are going to bring us right to the nuclear bomb. 
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: I've got to go. Dan Bongino, Chris Hahn, why does it always end this way? Michael Moore's dire prediction for the 2020 election. Get ready to have a good laugh. Governor Mike Huckabee joins me next with that and more of the most of outrageous things that we heard this week. You don't want to miss it. I can't wait to hear what the governor has to say myself. 
Welcome back to "Justice." Liars, leakers and liberals like Michael Moore trying to ramp up fake fear in America once again. Take a listen. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Who is your choice? Who do you think will beat Trump? 
MICHAEL MOORE, AMERICAN FILM MAKER: The honest answer to that is I don't even know if we are going to get to 2020 as a democracy. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
PIRRO: Really? Joining me now with reaction to that and so much more, former Arkansas Governor, and Fox News contributor, Mike Huckabee. What's he talking about? He doesn't even know if we are going to get there. What does that mean? 
MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSASA GOVERNOR: You know, he may be right. It's rare for me to agree with Michael Moore, but here's why. Democrats refuse to accept election results. If you think about it, back in 2000, the previous Republican President, they didn't accept the election results. They said George Bush was not legitimate. 
PIRRO: Went to the Supreme Court. 
HUCKABEE: They have done the same thing with Donald Trump. The one thing that we can't survive as a country is when either side refuses to accept an election as the will of the voters. And Democrats do not accept election results unless they win and then they not only accept it, but they use an election like a bulldozer to run over everybody and instead of following the law, they just make it up as they go. 
PIRRO: And you know what is so amazing, Governor, do you remember when Hillary Clinton or one of them came out and said, we've got to make sure that Donald Trump accepts the results, accept the results - when they thought she was going to win. They were so worried he wouldn't accept it. That's because that's in their playbook, but anyway, let's go to right now we have got what is it - Obama at an Ohio rally. Take a listen to this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So just remember that when you hear these folks bragging about this economic miracle. Just remember when it started. Just remember when the ball got rolling. We spent eight years pushing that boulder up the hill, we finally get to the top. It starts rolling down the hill. And then, these folks come in and say, "Look at what we're doing." This man didn't even break a sweat. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
PIRRO: Wow. Go ahead governor. 
HUCKABEE: Oh, I never knew how humble President Obama was because he never bragged about his great economic miracle when he was in office. He never talked about the jobs, the deregulation. He never talked about the record unemployment for minorities, and now suddenly, after Donald Trump delivers on the very things he said he would do, it was all because President Obama had laid all of the groundwork. This is incredible. I've never seen anything quite like it. 
But the one thing I will remind you, do you remember when President Trump, then candidate, was talking about what the economy was going to look under him, President Obama said, that's not going to happen, it would take a miracle and he just completely poohed the idea. 
Well, the President, President Trump promised it, delivered it, and now suddenly Barack Obama grabs the baton and jumps in front of the parade and says I was leading it all the time. 
PIRRO: Well, it is pretty stunning, and I remember when he said, you know, carrier - these jobs are never coming back. It's also pathetic, but anyway, I want to go to another outrageous comment, that is I think we have it here, Kavanaugh, interesting that Kavanaugh went to an all boys school and he had 65 women vouching for him. And Debra Messing had said, "Brett Kavanaugh went to an all boys school. How quickly you can get 65 names. It's almost as though you knew about the accusations of sexual assault and tried to hide it, but they prepared with the names just in case." 
So Debra Messing and then Chelsea Handler all say that because he went to an all boys school he most probably assaulted a woman as Dianne Feinstein came out and delivered this anonymous letter at the 11th hour that I did my open on tonight. Talk about that Governor. 
HUCKABEE: Well, the big difference, Judge is that 65 woman signed their names to it. They are willing to be accountable for it. The one person who is unknown and completely anonymous with really some pretty sketchy accusations, we don't know who it is. We have no idea. 
But I'll tell you something we have learned from all of this. If Judge Kavanaugh teaches and coaches girls' basketball and then he goes and he gives women record numbers of jobs, then he's a potential sexual predator. If he doesn't, he's a sexist. But I'll tell you the one thing that that t he left would love him for, if he would wear a dress and hang out in women's restrooms. That would be the one thing that they would certainly applaud and say, "He's fit for the court." 
PIRRO: Governor Mike Huckabee, thanks so much. And conservatives silenced by social media, we're talking more about it, next. 
The attempt to silence conservatives on social media, on Google and so on, we talked to Congressman McCarthy about it earlier and it's a critical issue that we are going to expose here on "Justice." Now, my next guest had a controversial experience this week with Twitter and he's here to tell us about it, Center for Immigration Studies, Executive Director Mark Krikorian. All right, Mark, tell us what happened. 
MARK KRIKORIAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES: We tried to promote some tweets. This is a paid ad. Some were accepted, some of them weren't. The ones that were rejected had the words, illegal aliens or criminal alien in them. They weren't controversial otherwise, and so we wanted to know what was up? Was that reason? They told us it was because of hateful content. 
And so only when we started to make a fuss and Fox News and "The Hill" and some other people called up Twitter, the reporters called them up, only then did they back off and said, "Oh, sorry, it was all a mistake. We didn't mean to do any of that.: I don't believe it. 
PIRRO: Well, look, you know what the problem is, Mark, so many people are having content banned or not included or things - I talked to someone today who said she had something up on Google two years ago, it was up, and now it's down. She said, she can't find it. So what's happening is, they are now changing our lexicon - the dictionary. And if hate speech, the word illegal alien is hate speech, why does Title 8 of the USC include the words criminal alien, unauthorized alien - I mean, these are words that are in our statutes, in our laws, passed by Congress and they now are comfortable taking it out. 
But I'm telling you, Mark, this is the beginning of their attempt to not only control our First Amendment free speech, but to stop us from speaking. This is where Europe is. What can we do about this, Mark? 
KRIKORIAN: All we can do is we've got to push back all the time. This happened to us a few months ago with a couple of these tweets. We kind of let it slide. That was a mistake. Everybody needs to push back every time this happens and make a fuss about it because when you turn the lights on, the cockroaches scatter. When you focus attention on their attempt to manipulate language, they will back off, at least that's our experience. 
PIRRO: Okay, and you know what is interesting is that this week, the Dalai Lama, something that he said caught my attention. I was blown away. I read it twice. You know he talked about Europe being for the Europeans and refugees should go home and rebuild. What's your reaction to what many perceive as a controversial statement and a statement that but for the Dalai Lama, I guarantee would have been expunged as hate content. 
KRIKORIAN: Well, the whole point to refugees is you protect them while there is a war or something going on so that they can go home and rebuild. Of course, that's what they should be doing. A lot of the Syrians now want to be going home. Lebanon wants to send them home, UN doesn't want them to go home. That's just not the way refugees is supposed to work. 
PIRRO: Well, and you know what, when you think about it, Mark, I mean, with these refugees, I mean, they are used to a climate. They are used to a particular language. They are used to their fellow countrymen and their food. If you live in Syria, I can't manage that living in New York is the way to go. 
But anyway, Mark Krikorian, thanks so much for being here. Keep up the fight. We're going t o stay on this, Mark. 
KRIKORIAN: Thank you. 
PIRRO: All right, and we'll be right back. 
Finally tonight, do you have your copy of my new book, "Liars, Leakers & Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy." There is going to be a test next week. You know it's the number one "New York Times" best seller. You can a copy at Amazon and Barnes & Noble - right now, go right now. 
And remember, you never have to miss "Justice." If you can't, just set your DVR. Now, of you can watch, set your DVR not if you can't miss it - anyway - by the way, and now, for sure, our thoughts and prayers will continue to be with everyone affected by tropical storm Florence. Please, stay tuned and stay safe. Fox will keep you updated on what is going on there. 
Finally, next week I want to talk about Google, Facebook and what is going on with social media, how it interplays place with the Antifa, hate speech and the left attempt to shut down our free speech and our rights. 
Thanks for watching. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way. "The Greg Gutfeld Show" is coming up. I will see you next Saturday night right here.
