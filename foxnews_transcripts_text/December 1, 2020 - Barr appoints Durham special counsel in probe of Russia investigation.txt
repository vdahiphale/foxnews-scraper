BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hello, Greg. Salty Dana undercontrol tonight. Thank you.Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, we're following two big stories. We're learning detailsof how the federal government plans to distribute the coronavirus vaccineonce it's approved and it's expected to be approved in just days.We're also getting information tonight ought to be a big change coming inthe quarantine guidelines from the CDC. We'll explain all that withcomplete coverage shortly.But we begin with a statement from the attorney general, the President'sAttorney General stating that he nor the Department of Justice have seenevidence of widespread voter fraud that "could have affected a differentoutcome in the election". This puts him obviously in direct conflict withhis boss. The A.G. left the White House just about an hour ago.Chief White House correspondent John Roberts starts us off tonight livefrom the North Lawn. Good evening, John.JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera):Bret, good evening to you. Earlier this fall, the Attorney General BillBarr had proclaimed that mass mail-in voting would be ripe for fraud andabuse.But today, he chafed against a similar claim from President Trump saying,he had seen nothing so far that would overturn the results of the election.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS (voice over): It was a declaration that drew a sharp response fromthe Trump campaign. Attorney General Bill Barr telling the AssociatedPress, to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affecteda different outcome in the election.The president's attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis firing back, withall due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn't been any semblance ofa Department of Justice investigation. We have gathered ample evidence ofillegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined.Some of that evidence was brought forward by Republican lawmakers at ahearing in Michigan today, allegations that a truckload of fraudulentballots was rolled up to a voting center.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can you tell me what it is specifically that you sawthat came in?MICHAEL DUBIEL, MICHIGAN WITNESS: And it looked like there was maybe 60boxes of those ballots, and in each one of those sleeves or boxes orwhatever, there could have been hundreds of ballots. So, we're thinkingmaybe several thousand, tens of thousands. I'm not sure of the exactnumber.ROBERTS: But the Attorney General dismissed the idea of widespread fraudtelling the A.P., most claims of fraud are very particularized to aparticular set of circumstances or actors or conduct. They are not systemicallegations.In Wisconsin, the Trump campaign is alleging more than 221,000 absenteeballots were improperly filed. Petitioning the state Supreme Court towithdraw certification of the election results. So far, Wisconsin SupremeCourt has refused to take up any of the Trump campaigns petitions.The Senate Minority Leader today suggesting Barr may be on the endangeredspecies list.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): I guess he's the next one to be fired since henow too says there's no fraud.ROBERTS: The president's insistence that the election was stolen from himhas been a powerful fundraiser. Sources telling Fox News that since theelection, the president has raised about $170 million for the legal battleand his new leadership pack Save America.But in Georgia today, state officials admonishing President Trump to turndown the rhetoric against election workers and state officials.GABRIEL STERLING, GEORGIA ELECTION OFFICIAL: Stop inspiring people tocommit potential acts of violence. Someone's going to get hurt. Someone'sgoing to get shot. Someone's going to get killed. And it's not right.ROBERTS: The president also pushing the envelope on launching the firstcoronavirus vaccines. FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn summoned to theWhite House today, under pressure to minimize the amount of time to approvethe vaccines for emergency use.KAYLEIGH MCENANY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Everyone wants to seeAmerican life saves from Dr. Stephen Hahn to this president. But thispresident will never apologize for putting the fire under these agencies tosay yes, we want to save vaccine, absolutely. We also want a fast onebecause lives are at stake.ROBERTS: In a statement to Fox News, the commissioner resisting thepressure, saying, let me be clear, our career scientists have to make thedecision and they will take the time that's needed to make the right callon this important decision.Next Tuesday, President Trump plans to bring together governors, executivesfrom the pharmaceutical industry, pharmacies and shipping services to geteveryone on the same page about vaccine distribution.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS (on camera): And some other news with the Attorney General today,Bill Barr taking steps to make sure that the probe into the origins of theTrump campaign Russia investigation don't die on inauguration day. BillBarr appointing John Durham to be special counsel, meaning that his workwill continue well into the next administration, Bret.BAIER: Hi John, a lot of Trump supporters were expecting the Durham reportabout that to come out before the election. Now, this provides what? Anextra layer of protection in a Biden presidency?ROBERTS: An extra layer of protection for the investigation. Also anindication that John Durham's work while we thought that it might be readybefore the election, still has a long way to go before he's through.BAIER: All right, John, thank you.Also breaking tonight, the first indications of how the federal governmentwill decide who gets the corona vaccine first, and when you and your familywill be eligible. Senior correspondent Laura Ingle reports tonight from NewYork. Good evening, Laura.LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening. Youknow, the CDC has been focusing all day long on how they will prioritizewho they deem to be the most vulnerable to COVID-19 exposure, illness anddeath. And the vote happening just moments ago, the 13 to one vote didapprove frontline health care workers and the elderly and long-term carefacilities as the recommended groups to be the first in line.Now, there are approximately 21 million health care workers and roughlythree million long term care facility residents in the United States.And while a significant amount of data was shared in the meeting today, onething was made clear on the virtual call, the mission is urgent.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. BETH BELL, ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES: This is aparticularly difficult time in the United States. I just noted that sincewe're averaging one COVID death per minute in the United States right now.In the time it takes us to have this ACIP meeting, 180 people will havedied from COVID-19. So we are acting, I guess, none too soon.INGLE (voice over): The CDC's Advisory Committee which is made up of votingmembers and several other vaccine experts determined the Phase 1a groupwhich includes hospitals, long term care facilities, EMS and pharmaciesalong with home health care workers and public health officials will rollup their sleeves first. Now, the concern by the one person who voted no wasabout the safety of the vaccine for those in long term care facilities.DR. HELEN KEIPP TALBOT, ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES: Myconcern is there is less reactive generosity, which also means of lessimmunogenicity.Two, I do not feel like our safety network for long term-care facilities isstrong enough yet. I think there's some work that needs to be done.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGLE (on camera): Once the recommendations are sent to CDC director, Dr.Robert Redfield, those recommendations are then going to be sent to stateswhich will eventually be in charge of distributing the vaccine.And aside from FDA approval, the next benchmark for the vaccine will bethis Friday. That is the deadline for states to submit their requests fordoses and where they will be shipped to, Bret.BAIER: Laura, thank you.As we told you at the top of the program, the CDC will decrease quarantinetime following exposure to the coronavirus. This as state and localgovernments across the country are imposing new and tougher restrictionstonight, but in many places the very people ordering citizens to complywith the rules are themselves breaking those rules.National correspondent William La Jeunesse shows us tonight from LosAngeles. Good evening, William.WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):Well Bret, you know, typically a patient sees symptoms in the first fivedays after exposure. What the CDC is saying here is they're reducing that14-day quarantine period to only seven days for those who get a negativetest or 10 days for those who have not been tested at all.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LA JEUNESSE (voice over): As one holiday receives and another approaches,health officials fear the worst.DR. LAURA FORMAN, EMERGENCY MEDICINE SPECIALIST: Our hospitals can nolonger safely take care of the patients.LA JEUNESSE: Daily U.S. fatalities are on track to exceed 2,200 a day,higher than last spring.SYLVESTER TURNER (D), MAYOR OF HOUSTON: The last resort that we have aslocal officials at least within my arsenal, is to impose a curfew that willjust shut it down.LA JEUNESSE: State and local officials are at a loss as the virusaccelerates and COVID fatigue divides residents.ALEX JORDAN, CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT OWNER: The county has their own ideas ofright and wrong and I've just not -- I'm not just agreeing with it.LA JEUNESSE: This restaurant in California defied orders to shut down.JEN CALLANAN, DINER: I'm tired of people telling us what to do. I worryabout it, yes, but it doesn't rule my life.LA JEUNESSE: Hypocrisy doesn't help say protesters outside the home of L.A.Democratic supervisor Sheila Kuehl who called outdoor dining dangerous andvoted to ban it. Then went out to eat hours before the ban took effect.SHEILA KUEHL, FORMER MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE: Well, I eathere all the time.LA JEUNESSE: In Denver, Democratic Mayor Michael Hancock told people toavoid traveling for Thanksgiving, then hopped a flight to Mississippi.In Alaska, a Governor's aide urged people to "Party like it was New Year'sEve." hours before anchorage plan to close bars and restaurants.MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO, CHEF: Sends the message that we're getting directionfrom people that aren't really believing in the decisions that they'remaking.LA JEUNESSE: Last week, the U.S. recorded more than 200,000 new cases in asingle day. Yesterday, 16 states saw record hospitalizations. Dr. AnthonyFauci expects more.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: So many states are at the brink of being overrun with regard totheir capability of taking care of people in a proper way, particularly inintensive care.(END VIDEO CLIP)LA JEUNESSE (on camera): Now, at Ohio, four GOP lawmakers filed impeachmentarticles Monday against Republican Governor Mike DeWine for requiring masksand closing some businesses. DeWine who is popular, dismiss that efforttoday as a foolish distraction, Bret.BAIER: William, thank you.We are getting our first in-person look at the Biden administrationeconomic team tonight. We're also learning more about the president-elect'srecent injury. Correspondent Peter Doocy reports tonight from Wilmington,Delaware.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Joe Biden showedoff his new boot today.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How's your foot?JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: Good, glad to be back.DOOCY: And stood on hairline fractures in his foot for the duration of hisremarks, which urged Congress to act on a COVID relief bill before he movesback to D.C.BIDEN: Any package passed in a lame-duck session is likely to be, at best,just a start.DOOCY: That would take cooperation with Mitch McConnell, but --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Have you spoken to McConnell McConnell Mr. President-elect?BIDEN: I did.DOOCY: McConnell isn't sold on a new bipartisan proposal and Biden isstaying out of negotiations.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you support the $500 billion stimulus proposal,sir?BIDEN: We've heard about it, we'll take a look in on it tonight.DOOCY: A massive COVID-19 relief package is on the way if treasurysecretary pick Janet Yellen gets her way.JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY NOMINEE: It's an American tragedy andit's essential that we move with urgency. An action will produce a self-reinforcing downturn, causing yet more devastation.DOOCY: But first, this new economic team needs to be confirmed.BIDEN: I hope those outstanding -- these outstanding nominees will receivea prompt hearing.DOOCY: Republican leaders won't commit to any hearing or vote for NeeraTanden, Biden's choice for director at the Office of Management and Budget.NEERA TANDEN, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET DIRECTOR NOMINEE: Budgets arenot abstractions, they're a reflection of our values.DOOCY: Elizabeth Warren didn't get the job she wanted, treasury secretary.But Biden is assuring progressives her influences in there in his pick fordeputy treasury secretary.BIDEN: Well, I don't know. I'll tell you what, Senator Warren really likesyou.DOOCY: Another historic pick had Biden thinking of show tunes.BIDEN: We might have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda who wrote the musical aboutthe first Secretary Treasury Hamilton to write another musical about thefirst woman Secretary of the Treasury Yellen. So that's what I'm working onright now, Janet.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): The transition team tells us tonight that AttorneyGeneral Bill Barr's big reveal, no evidence of widespread fraud to changeelection results just confirms what they have known for weeks that Bidenwon. They have already started naming members to an Inaugural Committee andwe're told they are planning on a traditional, safe, inclusive ceremony onthe west front of the Capitol 50 days from now, Bret.BAIER: Peter Doocy in Wilmington. Peter, thanks.One of Biden's most controversial selection so far is his pick for theOffice of Management and Budget. Correspondent Mark Meredith examines whyNeera Tanden is causing such an uproar on both sides of the aisle.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: For director of Office of Management and Budget, I nominate NeeraTanden.MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Neera Tanden isno stranger to Washington politics as a former Hillary Clinton adviser andleader of the left leaning Center for American Progress. She's wellestablished in Democratic circles, but she's also made enemies on CapitolHill.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If you want to make sure this nutjob Tandendoesn't become the director of the Budget in charge of the Office ofManagement and Budget, then make sure we win in Georgia.MEREDITH: Senator Lindsey Graham is among those GOP senators feeling uneasyover her forthcoming nomination. Ohio Senator Rob Portman is openlyquestioning her judgment after Tanden spent years harshly criticizingsenators on Twitter. Top Democrats are shrugging it off.SCHUMER: Honestly, the hypocrisy is astounding. If Republicans areconcerned about criticism on Twitter, their complaints are better directedat President Trump.MEREDITH: But some Democrats are outraged with the president-elect's pick.Bernie Sanders former campaign press secretary tweeting "Eeverything toxicabout the corporate Democratic Party is embodied in Neera Tanden."Tanden has faced multiple controversies before. She criticized Biden as apotential candidate in 2015 in private e-mails leaked by WikiLeaks.In 2017, days before President Trump's inauguration, Tanden responded to aTrump tweet alleging Russia hacked voting machines, writing "Russians didenough damage to affect more than 70,000 votes in three states."In 2018, BuzzFeed reported she faced criticism over how she handled sexualharassment claims within the organization she led. But despite the growinglist of potential scandals, the president-elect says he stands by his pick.BIDEN: She believes what I believe. A budget should reflect our values.(END VIDEO CLIP)MEREDITH (on camera): If confirmed, Tanden would be the first woman ofcolor to lead the Office of Management the Budget. She says after growingup on food stamps and public housing, she is honored to potentially lead adepartment that ensures programs like those get the funding they need.Bret.BAIER: Mark, thank you.Former Trump campaign manager, Brad Parscale says the decision to removehim from his job was a major blow to the president. Parscale talked withMartha MacCallum for tonight's edition of "THE STORY."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRAD PARSCALE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Jared and I never gotsideways on a concept. That's why we are such a strong team for all thattime. And I think the worst thing to ever do is to break us two up. I thinkthat was a decision that will go down. If the president loses, mean downthe worst decision.MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Do you believe that if you andJared had remained in charge, the president would have won? Right?(INAUDIBLE).PARSCALE: I don't know if -- I don't know if he still -- I'm not sayingthat he can still win this. I think he wins by -- he wins easy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: You can see the entire expanded interview tonight at 7:00 p.m. rightafter SPECIAL REPORT.Up next, Congress goes back to the drawing board to try to come up with acoronavirus relief package before heading home for the holidays.First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight.

There's also a new proposal from the Senate, but with justa handful of days left in this current congressional work period, time isof the essence.Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel takes a look tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Bipartisan lawmakers are trying to break gridlock by proposing a$908 billion COVID emergency relief framework, designed to provide helpthrough the first quarter of next year.SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): It would be stupidity on steroids if Congress leftfor Christmas without doing an interim package as a bridge.EMANUEL: Some key provisions are $160 billion for state, local, and tribalgovernments, a major item for Democrats $180 billion for additionalunemployment insurance. $288 billion to support small businesses, $16billion for vaccine development and distribution.

But the investigation covers what istermed, a secret lobbying scheme involving individuals acting as lobbyiststo senior White House officials without complying with regulations.DOJ officials are said courting to this document to have e-mailcommunications of all of this breaking story. We will follow it all.Meantime, Republicans are flooding Georgia with cash, and operatives in therunoff -- to next -- runoff to next month's Senate runoffs that willdetermine the balance of power in the Senate chamber.Correspondent Steve Harrigan has the startling numbers tonight fromAtlanta.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Money andmanpower moving to Georgia at unprecedented levels ahead of two JanuarySenate runoffs.

DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): The Senate has to be held so that we don't see areversal of the things and the gains that we made over the past four years,especially legislatively. And that's the legislative agenda that has to betaken into account.HARRIGAN: Despite all the cash, both sides say a socially distance groundgame could be the key to victory.OSSOFF: We're going to get outspent on the air, but we're going to out-hustle on the ground.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're just canvassing your neighborhood to make sureeverybody knows about the Senate runoff race.HARRIGAN: President Trump comes to Georgia Saturday to campaign for DavidPerdue and Kelly Loeffler.

Bret?BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  We'll follow it. Steve, thank you.Overseas now, another major Iranian figure is dead tonight. Just days afterthe assassination of a top scientist, a powerful military commander waskilled by an airstrike in Syria. This comes at a time of intense pressureon the Iranian regime. State Department correspondent Rich Edson tells uswhat it means tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Defiance and promises of revenge,Iran's parliament is pushing to boot international weapons inspectors andescalate uranium production days after Iran claimed Israeli assassinskilled the country's top nuclear scientist.SAEED KHATIBZADEH, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY (through translator):  Iran hasstated before as our definite policy will independently give a matchingresponse to those who ordered and committed this with maximum pain forthose who did this.EDSON:  Iran faces increasing pressure from its adversaries. An airstrikethis weekend along that Iraqi-Syrian border that reportedly killed acommander in Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, and growing pressure fromthe outgoing Trump administration. Officials say they will advance theirmaximum pressure operation against Iran until the handoff next month to theBiden team. Part of the campaign against Iran, strengthen the relationshipbetween American allies.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We'd like to get that rift solved. I think there's apossibility for it.EDSON:  President Trump's senior advisor Jared Kushner and other currentand former U.S. officials are traveling to Saudi Arabia and Qatar.Administration officials say their goal is to try end a rift thatintensified in 2017 and led the Saudis and three of its allies to cut offdiplomatic and economic relations with Qatar. The U.S. has its largestmilitary presence in the region at an airbase in Qatar. Saudi Arabia is akey American ally in the confrontation with Iran, and Kushner's visit isalso an opportunity to discuss U.S.-Saudi strategy after the assassinationof the Iranian nuclear scientist.(END VIDEO TAPE)EDSON (on camera):  The Trump administration is also pushing more Arabgovernments to recognize Israel, and could try on this trip to convinceSaudi Arabia and Qatar to join the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain inofficially establishing diplomatic ties with the Israeli government. Bret?BAIER:  Rich Edson at the State Department. Rich, thanks.Up next, the panel on the attorney general's statement that there was notwidespread fraud during the election, and his other action about JohnDurham.First, way beyond our borders tonight, one story. The Chinese governmentsays a robot probe has landed on the moon. The Chinese probe will try tocollect four-and-a-half pounds of material from the moon's surface andbring it back to the earth. The battle for space, just one story beyond theborders tonight. We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Attorney General Bill Barr leaving the White House today. He wasthere for about two hours after an interview with the Associated Press inwhich he said, quote, "To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale thatcould have affected a different outcome in the election. There has been oneassertion that would be systemic fraud, and that would be to claim thatmachines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And theDHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far we haven't seen anything tosubstantiate that. There's a growing tendency to use criminal justicesystem as a default fix-all, and people don't like something, they want theDepartment of Justice to investigate. Most claims of fraud are veryparticularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct.They are not systemic allegations, and those have to be run down, they arebeing run down. Some have been broad and potentially cover a few thousandvotes. They have been followed up on."Quickly, the Trump legal team responded, saying "With all due respect tothe attorney general, there hasn't been any semblance of the DOJinvestigation. We have gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in atleast six states, and it goes on."With that, let's bring in our panel, Charles Lane, opinion writer for "TheWashington Post," Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at "The Federalist," andJonah Goldberg, editor in chief of "The Dispatch."Jonah, the attorney general making clear where he stands obviously ahead ofthis meeting, that was planned, we should point out, before his interviewwith the Associated Press.JONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes. I think it's long past time toput a fork in this whole thing. The people are very mad at Barr, mad at himfor basically telling the truth, which is, yes, there is evidence ofirregularities, there's evidence of individual, as he would put it,particularized cases. But even if granted all of the allegations and all ofthe cases, including everything that the Trump team has said in court, eventhough they never say fraud in court, by the way, it still wouldn't amountto overturning the Electoral College.And it has become a farce. Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani are submittingpaperwork to courts that is going to get them in trouble. And Barrrecognizes this, I think, and he is saying what everybody actually knows,is that the election wasn't stolen, and it's time to move on.BAIER:  In this statement, the Trump team says we have got many witnessesswearing under oath they say crimes being committed in connection withvoter fraud. This Michigan hearing today tracks with other hearings we sawin Arizona and also in Pennsylvania. Take a listen to what they weretalking about today, Mollie.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LANA THEIS, (R) MICHIGAN STATE SENATE:  Can you tell me what it isspecifically that you saw that came in? Were you outside and you watchedthe truck and you watched them unload, or were you inside and watched thembring in the ballots? What was your --MICHAEL DUBIEL, MICHIGAN WITNESS:  I was inside the TCS Center, and Iwatched them bring ballots in on carts, boxes of ballots. The council thatwas there, we were all trying to take a rough estimate, and it looked likethere was maybe 60 boxes of those ballots, and in each one of those sleevesof boxes or whatever, there could have been hundreds of ballots. So we arethinking may be several thousand, tens of thousands. I'm not sure the exactnumber.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  So these hearings are going on, and these witnesses are testifyingin these different states. But you have the attorney general saying the DOJand the DHS have looked into it. We have seen Chris Krebs with CISA saywhat he said, that he thinks it's a very secure election overall. Mollie,how is one to interpret all of this?MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST":  I think you have tolook at what Attorney General Barr said very specifically. He didn't saythere was no fraud, which is how people are talking about it now. He saidthat to date he has not seen evidence of widespread fraud that wouldoverturn the election. And I think that is a very reasonable statement tomake.He did say they are looking into claims that could affect thousands ofvotes. You have a New York election that came down to 12 votes, acongressional election, an Iowa election that's down to six votes. So ifthey are talking about thousands of votes when you have actual elections in2020 that came down to just six or 12 votes, it's important that thesethings be looked into. And they do take time to be looked into. You havehearings going on right now.There have been a lot of crazy conspiracy theories put out there about whathappened in this election -- BAIER:  A lot.HEMINGWAY:  -- but one of them, and it's a pretty significant one is thatthere was no fraud in this election. That's something that "The New YorkTimes" claims. There is evidence of fraud across the country and a systemthat was put in place to enable that level of fraud, whether that's nosignature matches or not checking for signature matches, destroyingenvelopes, not auditing logs, not doing I.D. checks, ballot harvesting, notallowing oversight. These are things that are important. And these areimportant not just for this election but for all elections going forward.And it's something that Republican voters care very deeply about that mail-in balloting and all the abuse and fraud that that enables not become anorm in how we do elections going forward, but be an aberration fromelections that really have integrity and can be counted on to undergird therepublic itself.BAIER:  Yes, and I think there are a lot of Republicans talking about thatas well. But there's also Republican governors coming under fire from thepresident, including his ally, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, who signed theArizona state certification, the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, thesecretary of state in Georgia, also a Republican, and the person runningthe Georgia election.I mentioned Chris Krebs earlier, and he is the guy that was on "60 Minutes"and oversaw the DHS effort on the computerized effort to try to keep thevote safe, Chuck. And he came under fire by Joe diGenova on the legal team.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE DIGENOVA, TRUMP CAMPAIGN ATTORNEY:  Mail-in balloting is inherentlycorrupt, and this election proved it. This was not a coincidence. This wasall planned, and anybody who thinks that this election went well, like thatidiot, Krebs, that guy is a class A moron. He should be drawn andquartered, taken out at dawn and shot.GABRIEL STERLING, GEORGIA ELECTION OFFICIAL:  Mr. President, you have notcondemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemnedthis language or these actions. You need to step up and say this, stopinspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone is going toget hurt, someone is going to get shot, someone is going to get killed. Andit's not right.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  DiGenova, Chuck, came out and said he was being sarcastic in thecomment. There's a lot of pushback to it. We're in a different place now.CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, "WASHINGTON POST":  I thought those commentsfrom that Georgia election official who defines himself on his Twitter feedas conservative were gutsy and totally on point, that the fever that isbeing whipped up around these utterly phony allegations that the electionwas stolen, these allegations being whipped up by the president of theUnited States, have gone way too far, and they are fueling an atmospherethat could lead to something very unfortunate.I just want to go back to the point about Bill Barr. He has, I think,passed a test that a lot of Republicans are flunking, namely are you goingto look at this piece of paper that's white and say it's black? Are yougoing to call the sky blue or are you going to say the sky is green? Thisis a basic issue of facts and truth that I think Barr, probably concernedfor his own legacy, decided he had to speak up and distance himself fromthis craziness.And the president now going to Georgia is being warned, we've had itearlier on the program, by people in his own party that by pursuing this,apparently to raise money for a PAC, by pursuing this may even bediscouraging his own party. It's an amazing mail-in ballot system that's socrooked, it only steals the presidential election, but helps flip more thana dozen seats to the Republicans in the House. It just doesn't make sense,Bret.BAIER:  Right, he raised $170 million so far, the president has.Jonah, quickly, you also had Barr saying that he has appointed John Durham,the special prosecutor continuing that investigation. We expected theDurham report about the origins of the Russian investigation to come outbefore the election. It didn't. But this means it likely continues, andthey have something going on there.GOLDBERG:  Yes, it's very unlikely that Barr would have done this if hedidn't think it was going to yield something fruitful. And I think Barr didthe right thing by not announcing it and pulling a Jim Comey and throwingthe election into chaos by announcing it before the election. So as policydictates, he kept it secret. My suspicion is that this is actually going toaffect some of Biden's appointment decisions. You are not sure you wantspecial counsel investigation touching people within the Bidenadministration, as least as little as possible. So that may be bad news forSally Yates, but we'll see.BAIER:  That's right, Sally Yates is up, potentially, for A.G. And it woulda similar Jeff Sessions situation. She obviously signed some of thosedocuments. Mollie, quickly.HEMINGWAY:  Yes, we just remember that when Mueller was appointed, so manypeople in Washington, D.C., said that if Trump so much as looked in thewrong direction of Mueller that that would be grounds for impeachment. Youhad Republicans and Democrats all voting to protect the Mueller probe. Theyshould do the same with this special counsel, and people should be askedwhether they will allow this to proceed as they are nominated forpositions. And also there should be an assistance that they comply as fullyas the Trump administration complied fully with the Mueller probe.BAIER:  All right, panel, stand by. Next up, deciding who gets thecoronavirus vaccine first, and other changes, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Right now, the full Congress shouldcome together and pass a robust package for relief to address these urgentneeds. But any package passed in a lame duck session is likely to be, atbest, just a start.MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I've been in discussionswith the secretary of treasury and the president's chief of staff to try toascertain what the president would actually sign into law. And I think wehave a sense of what that is.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  There are three different efforts tonight ongoing to try to get aCOVID stimulus package across the finish line in Congress. One of them wasintroduced today by moderate senators, nine of them, Democrats andRepublicans. They may have increased power in this new structure in thenext Congress because of the numbers. And it's $908 billion. Will that getacross the finish line? We'll see. We're back with the panel. Chuck, thereis some optimism on Capitol Hill, perhaps a little bit, considering whatthe Senate majority leader said.LANE:  Yes, Lucy has yanked this football away many times before. It'sinteresting that they targeted $908 billion, staying under the magic $1trillion mark and a lot of Republicans in the Senate are worried about.They are also reprogramming about $450 billion that Steve Mnuchin recoveredfrom fed programs, thinking in a way they are spending less in the way ofnew money.The country really needs another shot of assistance now, particularly smallbusiness, as we head into this winter with a lot of restrictions based onCOVID. And if the president wants something to do other than complain aboutfraud, one thing he might do is engage on this and really help MitchMcConnell and the Democrats get to yes.BAIER:  Meantime, the FDA working on the approval process. And there isalso talk about who gets the vaccine first. The other thing we learnedtoday, Mollie, is that the CDC is recommending quarantine be brought backto 10 days if you come in contact with somebody with COVID, seven days ifyou get a negative test. Those are big changes.HEMINGWAY:  It is big change and public health experts have been changing alot of their guidance over the course of many months. It's unfortunate thatthey said things like it's OK to do a BLM protest, but you can't have afuneral for your relative or send your kids to school because it reallyeroded public trust, and we really need it as we have this vaccine rollout.So I hope they communicate it well. You think back to 1958 when they caredabout how the vaccine was rolled out for that Asian flu when PresidentEisenhower volunteered, or was given the shot to show that it was say. The1958 Naval Academy football team took it at that time. So they need tothink through how to roll it out, in addition to who gets it first.BAIER:  Yes. Jonah?GOLDBERG:  I think the fact that the medical professionals and essentiallyfirst responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are getting it first is a goodsign, but at least the medical establishment rather than public healthestablishment is willing to put their skin in the game, as it were, which Ithink is necessary, because I think Mollie is right. There has been a lotof lost credibility on both the left and the right trying to turn thispandemic into a culture war thing on top of all the hypocrisy from publicofficials.But at the end of the day, it would just be nice if this could be done. I'mnot a big believer to get politics out of government, and I don't usuallytalk about let's not politicize this, but let's not politicize this. Let'sjust get it to the first responders, the medical professionals, and thepeople who are most vulnerable to this thing, and get this damn thingbehind us.BAIER:  The biggest change this week was Tony Fauci saying school should beback, and that just has changed. And I think that there's still a lot ofquestions about who is going to be open and who's not. Panel, thank you somuch.When we come back, battling back to brighter days.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, the brighter side of things and the fightingspirit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you ready for this moment?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes!UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you sure?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes!(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Six-year-old Adriano (ph) was diagnosed with a rare bone conditionwhen he was just 15 months old. After a long fight, Adriano rang the bellat the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles to mark the last treatment. Thatsound really one of the most beautiful sounds, especially for anxiousparents.And this was a moment two-and-a-half months in the making. Eileen Shoemakerfinally home after a long battle with coronavirus which included two weekson a ventilator. The 73-year-old returned to her family in Florida withhugs and a big smile. Congratulations.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.
