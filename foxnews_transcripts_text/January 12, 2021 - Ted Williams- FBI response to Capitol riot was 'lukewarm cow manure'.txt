(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MICHAEL SHERWIN, ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA:  The scopeand scale of this investigation and these cases are really unprecedented,not only in FBI history, but probably DOJ history, in which essentially theCapitol grounds outside and inside are essentially a crime scene, and ascale in which we have literally thousands of potential witnesses and ascenario in which we're going to have, I believe, hundreds of criminalcases.(END VIDEO CLIP)NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  And it's just gotten started, bigger than wethought, more involved than we thought, much more worrisome than wethought, an investigation where the crime scene is indeed the United StatesCapitol.And more than 100,000 video and pictures have already been received astips. Growing concerns not only about what happened last week, but whatcould happen next week.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD, and aconfusing and scary world, the way it was portrayed by the JusticeDepartment and the FBI chronicling what it called a war that was planned onthe nation's Capitol.The very latest from David Spunt at the Justice Department on where westand -- David.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, there are plenty of questionsfor law enforcement officials, both local and federal, about, what did lawenforcement know and when did those members of law enforcement know thatinformation?A Washington Post report out this afternoon says the FBI in Norfolk gavesome information about an online threat using the words war and other typesof violence and sent that to officials here in Washington, D.C.Officials held a news conference just about an hour ago. You saw part ofthat. But last week, those officials said there were no specific knownthreats before that melee, that chaos in and outside of Capitol Hill lastweek.But let's bring you up to date on where the FBI is right now. As youmentioned, more than 100,000 images they are sifting through that wasbrought together by the public. They're also looking and identified atleast 170 people, Neil. They have charged 70 people so far.Investigators are looking at that media. Authorities say they're makingprogress with identifications.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHERWIN:  It's not going to be solved within the coming weeks. It's notgoing to be solved within the coming months. This is going to be a long-term investigation.And rest assured the Bureau, the Department of Justice, all of U.S.attorneys across the United States that are assisting these investigations,everyone is in for the long haul.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT:  And that was Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in D.C.He also said to those who trespassed the Capitol and lit off those pipebombs, "We will find you, no matter how long it takes."Today, the FBI also looking at the potential of putting some of thoseinvolved in those riots on the no-fly list. No final decisions have beenmade, but the possibility is there, according to authorities, the ideacoming for many people, but most notably Senate Minority Leader ChuckSchumer.We want to show you, Neil, some new video today of the National Guard inWashington, D.C. The Guard will have a heavy president over the next week,even more so now that there is an internal FBI memo warning that therewon't just be protests across the country, but armed protests slated notjust at this Capitol Building here in Washington, D.C., but capitolbuildings across all 50 states, including the Capitol Building in Olympia,Washington.Authorities say that they're showing up in large numbers to send a publicmessage that things will be under control. Neil, the Department of HomelandSecurity has already started calling this a special national securityevent. That designation began yesterday, not typically just a few daysbefore the inauguration, as in others years, but that's going on right now.FBI officials -- we cannot put up this number enough. If you haveinformation, 1-800-CALL-FBI, 1-800-225-5324 -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, David Spunt, thank you very, very much.An unusual letter, meantime, written by the joint commanders who make upthe Joint Chiefs of Staff in a message to our troops.And I start -- quote -- "The American people have trusted the armed forcesof the United States to protect them and our Constitution for almost 250years. As we have done throughout our history, the U.S. military will obeylawful orders from civilian leadership, support civil authorities toprotect lives and property, ensuring public safety, in accordance with thelaw. To our men and women deployed and at home safeguarding our country,stay ready. Keep your eyes on the horizon and remain focused on themission. We honor your continued service in the defense of every American."Now to Ted Williams, a former D.C. police detective, with the sort ofreaction, certainly by our joint commanders, who are ready for anything andeverything and want to make sure men and women in the armed forces are aswell.Ted, what do you make of all this?TED WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Neil, what I initially make of it is -- and good afternoon to you -- is that somebody dropped the ball.And it looks to me like the FBI initially dropped the ball, because theygot information from their Norfolk field office on January 5, and it readlike this.They had -- the FBI in Norfolk received an Internet transmission that saidthis: "Congress need to hear, breaking glass, doors being kicked in, andblood from Black Lives Matter and Pantifa slave soldiers being spilled. Getviolent. Stop calling this a march or rally or a protest. Go there readyfor war. We get our president, or we die."That information was given to the Norfolk field office. And that shouldhave been conveyed to the Washington or FBI field office, and somethingshould have been done.And when I listened to this press conference this afternoon, they werebeing more reactive about what took place than proactive about what isgoing to take place here in the near future -- Neil.CAVUTO:  You know what's kind of interesting, Ted, is that was not relayedfrom that Norfolk office to officials in Washington, certainly not to theCapitol Police.I'm not aware of the chain of command and how it would. To try to giveevery possible benefit of doubt to authorities there, there are marches anddemonstrations in Washington you make an appointment with almost like youwould picking up a flash pass at Disney.But there was certainly early signals that this was going to be big, thiscrowd was going to be angry, and there were members included. Theoverwhelming majority might have been peaceful and didn't mean to do andhave anything to do with this storming of the Capitol itself, but there arethose in that crowd with a very different intent, and they weretelegraphing their preparations for authorities to see, if they only tookthe time to see it and hear it.WILLIAMS:  Well, you just said it, if they only took the time.This is one reason why I'm calling him for a complete investigation. And Ithink president-elect Biden have to appoint a commission to look into this.Our house, the people's house, was attacked, Neil. And we are thelaughingstock of America. Everyone thought that America was secure when itcame to its federal government agencies.And they have now found out just unsecure we are in this country. It's anembarrassment.CAVUTO:  But this intelligence, apparently, Ted, if I was reading theseguys correctly, this was kind of outlined that they might, in fact, stormthe Capitol, the interior of the Capitol.But, somehow, that word did not get to the right people at the right time.And by the time we found out about it, they were out of time and it wasbedlam. Where did the slip-up, you think, occur?WILLIAMS:  You're absolutely right.CAVUTO:  Or was it just a compounded event?WILLIAMS:  No, no, I think that this was a gathering storm.And this storm has been gathering for some time, because, as you know, onthe 20th, we have the inauguration coming on. There is a group called anational special security event, a group that the Secret Service put inplace. And they have partners from all over the country, law enforcementpartners, as well as the military partners, as well as the National Guard,all coming to Washington to make sure that there's a peaceful transition ofgovernment.But somebody dropped the ball here. Five people died. Or you had apresident who was still in a state of denial about his responsibilities inregards to this, are all blaming it on an illegal election, when, in fact,it was him that incited this right.And so there are heads that really needs to be -- to roll, but there needsto be, Neil, a complete and thorough investigation of this matter. And whatwe heard today from the FBI was just lukewarm cow manure.CAVUTO:  Well, in the meantime, the whole Capitol is a crime scene, butthat crime scene is going to be the venue for the swearing-in of the nextpresident of the United States.Do you think it's safe?WILLIAMS:  Well, I think it'd be a safe now, and it will be safe with allof these various entities coming in, meaning the National Guard and thestate and local police officers from all over the country.But the sad commentary is that the west side of the White House, where theswearing-in takes place, is one of the areas that was breached. And it's anembarrassment.Now we're finding out that -- internally, that some police officers mayvery well have been involved in this. They have put some of them onsuspension. They have -- and they're looking and conducting aninvestigation to try to determine who was involved in this, who knew what,when.And that's significant and important, Neil, as we go forward.CAVUTO:  You are right, my friend.Ted Williams, thank you very, very much. We will be monitoring it very,very closely.You have heard, in the meantime, as Ted was wrapping up here, how socialmedia has gone after anyone with any allegiances to Donald Trump or thosewho were behind the effort to overturn the election, but now setting itssights on, of all people, Ron Paul, a frequent critic of Donald Trump?Incredible. The big tech battle that has now ensnared no less than theformer presidential candidate and long-serving Congressman Ron Paul, who'shere -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, they're already going it the big tech censorship.And the president has railed against it, moves by the likes of Twitter,Facebook and a host of other social media players silencing what they sayis simply conservative thought. Others are saying, at least on behalf ofthe companies, violent thought that comes out of those sympathetic to thepresident or any cause he espouses.Susan Li with the financial fallout -- Susan.SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Neil.So, tough week so far for Twitter and Facebook, after both social mediasites banned President Trump. So, how much was Trump worth to the socialmedia giants? Well, if you look at Facebook, the company has lost over $45billion in market cap so far this week, while smaller Twitter has lost $3.5billion the week's first two days.Wall Street is concerned over future user growth and engagement on Twitterafter the president's suspension. Mr. Trump's 88 million followers wasroughly 40 percent of the number of daily active users that visit thesocial media site each and every day.Meantime, we have Twitter competitor Parler still having trouble gettingback online after being shut down by Amazon Web Services and kicked off theApple and Google app stores over the weekend.Parler's CEO says that he's even getting personal threats.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN MATZE, CEO, PARLER:  I have seen a lot of people say that this isscary. But I have also seen a lot of people who are participating in thefive minutes of hate and kind of egging it on and cheering. And it'sdisgusting, people threatening my life.I can't go home tonight.(END VIDEO CLIP)LI:  And just this morning, we have the CEO of the world's biggest companyweighing in on the Capitol Hill violence.Apple CEO Tim Cook was just asked if President Trump should be heldaccountable.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  I think no one is above the law. I mean, that's agreat thing about our country, and we're a rule of law country. I thinkeveryone that had a part in it needs to be held accountable.(END VIDEO CLIP)LI:  Not just Tim Cook.Some of America's other biggest companies, including Walmart, which justcrossed the tape, now says that they will pause political donations inlight of last week's events -- Neil.CAVUTO:  All right, Susan, thank you very much, Susan Li.Well, after responding rather critically to Twitter shutting out thepresident of the United States, Ron Paul found himself suddenly locked outof his own Facebook page.They have tried to patch up the differences right now. We're going to getinto Facebook's explanation for what happened.But, in the meantime, the former congressman, presidential candidate joinsus right now, Ron Paul.Congressman, good to have you.What happened here exactly?FMR. REP. RON PAUL (R-TX):  Yes.(LAUGHTER)PAUL:  I don't know.Yesterday, we did our usual program. It's a form of reaching out to thepeople to promote the liberty philosophy, which I have been doing everyweek since 1956, and never missed it.But, yesterday, the report went out, and all of a sudden said, you haveoverstepped the bounds. You have violated community standards. I'm baffledby that. I didn't know we had community standards that we had to follow.And they said, no, you have been locked out of your Facebook. And Ithought, well, why would they do that? I follow a policy and philosophy ofnonviolence and peace.And, oh, yes, but this -- you're dangerous. You may be supportingterrorism. But the explanation was, I wasn't following the communitystandards, and we have warned you several times, which was not true. And,therefore, we are temporarily -- I don't know what the word was, but itturned out it was temporary, but that I'd be locked out of my program untilthey let me know something else.So, in the meantime...CAVUTO:  I don't know what it was you were saying.They said later on that -- they said later on, Congressman: "While therewere never any restrictions on Ron Paul's page, we restricted oneadministration's ability to post by mistake. We have corrected that error."But I don't understand what the error was.PAUL:  I don't either.And they never told me what it was. And I would -- if they're looking forerrors, as a noninterventionist in all forms of activity in the government,let me tell you, I know a lot of people that I think are involved in thingsthat they shouldn't be doing.So, this whole thing is a little bit bizarre. And I really wonder about it,because when you think of it, you know, I'm not -- why could I be a threat?Neil, you have known me for a long time. And I don't threaten people. And Ihave a philosophy of nonviolence, nonintervention and nonviolence. And, allof a sudden, I am a threat and they start using words when they talk aboutlocking down these programs that is a form of terrorism and all of theseother things.There's a lot of...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  The irony is, Congressman -- to your point, the irony is, you havebeen critical of the president. Even though your son, Rand Paul, ranagainst him, had his moments, he rallied to support the president, didn'tsupport this opposition to the electoral vote effort.But your case has been a little different, because you have been quitecritical of the president.Do you think it was your criticism in a separate issue about Twittersilencing the president or taking him off that somehow ignited -- I don'teven understand -- these algorithms or whatever might trigger a responselike the one you got?PAUL:  Yes. No, I really don't think so.I think that there's a lot of confusion on what they are doing. I don't --I think -- these people that run these social media network, I figurethey're very smart and very rich and know what's going on.But they don't have the vaguest idea what I'm talking about. And yet itseems to be that, even though I have no clout -- I'm not even running foroffice or anything. But I -- we -- it's almost like, we better be carefulwith him, because, even if they can take you off and put you back on, andeven before even that happened, we have been intimidated.I mean, we're cautious. We don't act as if we have freedom of speech andFirst Amendment protection, because we knew that. And then, right now, fora very pragmatic reason, we get our message of liberty out this way.And for some reason, they saw that as a threat. But I have -- I have beentaught and I have come to understand that, sometimes, if you tell thetruth, it is a threat to people. They just don't want to hear it, because Ican't be...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  Has this ever happened in the past to you, Congressman? Has thisever occurred to you before?PAUL:  No.Well, no, it's never been. I mean, I always thought it was a possibility,even though I didn't understand social networks and that thing.CAVUTO:  Yes.PAUL:  I understood my message.And -- but, as we went on, and I had staff tell me that, someday, you'renot going to be able to broadcast. And I said, well, I sure hope there'ssome alternative. And I think -- I said, libertarians are pretty smart, andthey're into technology. Maybe they will devise a system that will becompetitive.But it doesn't look like they will even permit even a hint ofcompetitiveness to the ordinary social media.CAVUTO:  Congressman, the president says he is not to blame for anythingthat happened last week, he didn't light any candle, that this wassomething that just developed.Do you think that he bears some responsibility for this?PAUL:  Oh, yes, I think a lot of people bear some responsibility.But I think -- I think it's blown way out of proportion.CAVUTO:  Does the president? Does the president, Congressman?PAUL:  Well, I just -- I just think, sometimes, policies lead to this.You say, who's responsible for it? A former president and our currentpresident have endorsed the principle that, on occasion, we can useassassination of American citizen. And when I think of that, and going towar without declaration, we're not dealing with the real issue that's goingon.It's the issue of big government, and it's authoritarian, and it'scontrolled by outsiders and people who think they have some control andthink elections are really significant.No, it's people who are pulling the strings behind it.CAVUTO:  All right.PAUL:  But that is so conspiratorial.If I was on my Internet, I might have my program struck, that there couldbe people conniving to run things out of the ordinary. So, I just don'tthink that the president thought that I had -- anything to do with me.I think social media had something to do with me. But I -- it's sort of --it's sort of amazing why they would bother.CAVUTO:  Yes.PAUL:  But I just think that there's a lot of information out there.But, to me, we're missing the entire thing. When you look at all theauthoritarianism and terrorism and spending and problem, it's very, verybipartisan. And this whole idea that, in the last three days, it's beenturned around, and they probably say the president had a -- had apopularity rate of 70 or 80 percent or 60 percent.And now it's down to 2 percent. That's how powerful this situation is.CAVUTO:  Yes.PAUL:  And I think that it's way overdone and it's a real shame.And I think we have lost our way. I don't think -- these people who areshouting defend the Constitution, and this -- protect First Amendment, andall this shouting, especially the people that are on -- on the president'sback, I think there's a lot of talk there.And they're missing the boat, because the way I, as a noninterventionist,see it, that is the whole business of most everybody in Washington. Andthat is to be an aggressive interventionist in our personal lives, spyingon us all the time, in our economic lives. They tax us to death. Theyinflate us to death. They transfer wealth from the poor and the middleclass to the rich.They go to war without declarations. And, if they're not -- they're notdealing with enough. If you want to really deal with some problem, that'swhat they need to deal with. But it's almost like a distraction.Oh, let's talk about how we can do something really unique. We have neverimpeached a president twice. Now, that's historic. So we got to go for it,and racing. It's like a race to the final -- to save the country, if we canonly impeach the president twice.CAVUTO:  And that race is on. And that race is on.PAUL:  Yes.He has -- he has a problem, there's no doubt. And I -- you stated I havecome out in opposition to the president.CAVUTO:  All right.PAUL:  And I do at times. But it's 50/50.Half the time, when he does -- when he wants to bring troops home, I'mshouting, bring them home, bring home. When he wants to send themsomeplace, I say, that's not...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO:  No, you're very fair and -- you're a very fair and balancedcritic, although I'm going to -- I will tell you, Congressman, I'm going towatch you a lot more closely, knowing that you're potentially a big threat.So, I'm keeping my eye on you.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO:  Ron Paul, thank you very much.PAUL:  Oh, yes. I'm a...CAVUTO:  What an...PAUL:  Sure thing. Nice to be with you.CAVUTO:  What an incredible saga here.All right, 85 years young, Ron Paul caught up in the middle of what seemedto be a nonsensical storm that had nothing, nothing at all to do with him.And this push for impeachment, to which he alluded, that's going to happentomorrow, a single count on instigating essentially violence against theAmerican people. That's it, one and done. Or is it?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, after last week, just call it a sign of the times, U.S.House makers who will be screened -- will be screened when they enter theHouse chamber tomorrow for an historic second impeachment vote against thepresident of the United States.That's coming from the acting sergeant at arms.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  All right, Republican senator Rob Portman has a message for thepresident, calling on the president to urged supporters to refrain from anyviolence, says the president will bear responsibility if he does not, andany additional violence were to occur.No response yet from the president of the United States. We will keep youposted on that.Also keeping you posted on tomorrow's historic day in the House, wherethey're screening with metal detectors all lawmakers coming in for thathistoric vote on whether to try to impeach the president of the UnitedStates yet again, this time on a single article, that is, instigatingviolence against the American people.Kevin Corke in the middle of all of that in Washington.Hey, Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Neil, good to be withyou.Now, this is either political revenge run amok or it is just deserts forinciting ostensibly an insurrection at the Capitol. It all depends on yourperspective. But one thing is certain. Republicans simply want to move onand get next to the next administration.Let me share part of a letter from Kevin McCarthy. Of course, he is the GOPleader in the House, this to his fellow RepublicansHe said this: "Personally, I continue to believe that an impeachment atthis time would have the opposite effect of bringing our country together,when we need to get America back on a path towards unity and civility."Well, the president echoing that response, but in a very sharper tone.Listen here.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For Nancy Pelosi and ChuckSchumer to continue on this path, I think it's causing tremendous danger toour country, and it's causing tremendous anger. I want no violence.(END VIDEO CLIP)CORKE: "I want no violence" is what the president said today.Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats both in the House and the Senateremain convinced that he's got to go, and right now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  Donald Trump should not holdoffice one day longer. And what we saw in his statements today is proof-positive of that, if you needed any further proof, which I didn't.(END VIDEO CLIP)CORKE:  But do keep this in mind, my friend.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he doesn'tanticipate having the Senate do anything, even though Chuck Schumer says heand the Senate majority leader could work together to get something donewith respect to a vote. McConnell's made it clear he's not going to do anysuch thing.So, the real question is, will it all matter at the end of the day? We willfind out together as we watch history unfold here in the nation's capital -- but for now, back to you.CAVUTO:  All right, interesting times, my friend, Kevin Corke in the middleof all of that.Of course, this House vote tomorrow, that single article, that thepresident's remarks endangered Americans, that's really the gist of it, isthat enough, especially if they don't even have time to get to the Senate?And then there's this talk, as Kevin alluded, about pursuing this into aBiden administration, in other words, going to impeach a former president.How does that work?Jim Trusty joins us, a former DOJ prosecutor.Jim, how does that work? It would be unprecedented, would it not?JAMES TRUSTY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Pretty much.I mean, look, there are those that read the Constitution to say that it'sin present tense, that you have to be presently in office to be subject toeither removal or disqualification. And that obviously would mean there's ahard deadline coming up on the 20th.But there is some precedent in the role of impeachment. The secretary ofwar in 1876 was about to be impeached, resigned, thinking, hey, that willend it. And, instead, he still got impeached, and he had a trial in theSenate, again, after he had left the high office. And in the trial in theSenate, they acquitted.So I suppose you will have some people pointing to 1876 and saying, this isa perfect replay of what happened back then, where you can still haveconsequences like disqualification after the person has actually leftoffice.CAVUTO:  But does the Senate or the House, for that matter, have any powerafter the fact to prevent someone from running for office again?I mean, it -- that seems a stretch to me, but please explain that.TRUSTY:  Well, I think it's a stretch too, but the language is not all thatclear from the Constitution.The language basically says that the impeached person faces either removal-- removal and disqualification. So, it's that question of kind of tense.Can you be outside of your office and still be disqualified in the future?There's not much there in terms of precedent.It does seem like a stretch.CAVUTO:  So, are you a convicted criminal, in that sense, and, just likeyou can be banned from voting in some states, you can be banned fromrunning for office in some states?I mean, is that what they're hoping to do? And does that have to be in theactual article of impeachment?TRUSTY:  Right. It's a rough parallel to collect the collateralconsequences we see for having a felony conviction.And it is in the article of impeachment. At least the draft that I readincluded the phrase of disqualification. So, that very much seemed to bethe intent. I have fundamental problems with the whole article in terms ofboth sufficiency of the evidence, the lack of evidence, or the time togather evidence, and the whole concept of having a snap impeachment.I think that's antithetical to what we really want in our constitutionaldeliberation. We don't want to have these snap decisions, when -- nobody ina criminal trial, a criminal case, would be going to trial and beingconvicted seven or eight days after the event, for good reason.So I think we're in that same kind of perilous territory here.CAVUTO:  Do you get a sense, when Rob Portman was saying, Jim, that thepresident will be accountable if there's more violence, and he doesn't urgehis supporters to disavow it and not be violent?And the reason why I'm mentioning it in this context with where they go onimpeachment, if there's another act that he could have prevented -- well,that's how they see it -- that that's even more grist for the mill? What doyou think?TRUSTY:  I mean, it seems like a clever political box, not a legal one.It's basically suggesting, on a morality level or a political level, thatthe president controls everyone out there that supports him, and that ifyou have some lunatic fringe that does anything wrong from this pointforward, that they have somehow closed the noose around him forculpability.I don't think that's the way our criminal justice system normally works.But politics is a different thing altogether. So, to me, it's a littleoverly optimistic by Portman, not really designed to protect the community,more to somehow assert that there's a viable impeachment case against thispresident, when the language of inciting insurrection is just not met bywhat he did.CAVUTO:  Jim Trusty, thank you very, very much. Confusing times, my friend,confusing times.Jim Trusty, the former DOJ prosecutor,.Speaking of this whole back-and-forth on impeachment, this is coming fromThe New York Times, that Mitch McConnell has told associates that hebelieves the president did indeed commit impeachable offenses and that he'spleased that Democrats are moving to impeach him.Now, he's had his differences with the president and disagreed and spokeout against the president and sympathetic followers' challenge to theElectoral College vote, but this is a leap beyond that to say that theactions the president took last week were and are indeed impeachable, asDemocrats have argued.Remember, he's the same man who said that the soonest the Senate could takeup these impeachment matters would be January 19, the day before Joe Bidenis sworn in as president.Nevertheless, The New York Times reporting that he finds that what theDemocrats are doing, moving to impeach him, that's a good thing; he'spleased.We will have more after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  Call it the grand old pile-on, a who's-who list of Fortune 100companies announcing that they are stiffing Republicans, particularly thosecandidates and those sympathetic to questioning the Electoral College vote.The list has grown to include the likes of Hallmark Cards and Amazon,American Express, AT&T, Best Buy, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Airbnb. I couldgo on and on. We have got a list of just some of the premier names.We have also got Tom Donohue, the guy who heads the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce.Boy, Tom, those are some pretty stunning names saying some pretty stunningthings to Republicans. What are we to make of that?TOM DONOHUE, PRESIDENT & CEO, U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE:  Well, I -- my ownview is, it is a reaction to the activities of the recent week.And all of us know that one of the reasons we were making statements is,the media has been calling us about all of that. And we understand whythose companies are doing it. We would join them in suggesting that thechallenges that we all face now require the full attention of the newgovernment.And, at the same time, what happened last week, particularly in the role ofthe president, it was -- it was really unacceptable. And he did, itappeared to us, stir up whatever was happening. He invited them all totown.And -- but we do believe that it's the responsibility, the vice president,the Cabinet and the Congress to decide whether to do the 25th Amendment oran impeachment. And they should do so judiciously, because we have got twothings we have to do together. We have to resolve this problem, and we haveto have a smooth transition to a new -- a new government.And you and I have been around this town long enough. This is a complicatedissue.CAVUTO:  Do you think the president should resign? A lot of evenRepublicans have advised that.DONOHUE:  Oh, yes, and there are people advising me to say that.That's not our role. Our role, and we -- today was our State of AmericanBusiness. We have laid out a plan...CAVUTO:  Right.DONOHUE:  ... how to continue to help with the pandemic, to continue todrive economic growth in the part of the economy that's really moving, andto take steps as soon as we can, which will require some improvement in thepandemic, to get at the other part of the economy, airplanes, hotels,events, restaurants, all that.CAVUTO:  Well, you're looking at the big picture, Tom.But I am curious. Mitch McConnell is in this New York Times piece, in whichhe talks about the president having indeed committed impeachable offenses,and that he welcomes what Democrats are doing.What do you think of that?DONOHUE:  You know, we put this statement out today because we're not MitchMcConnell. Our job is to represent the American business community here andabroad, and to work and support our government.And I do believe what we said. I think that some of the things thathappened were fundamentally wrong and unacceptable. And I think theCongress has got to figure out how to do this without overstepping itsposition and without screwing up the new administration coming in that hasto get very busy on a lot of stuff.I think that most of the companies are trying to be measured. They're notsaying we're going to stop giving money to anybody. They're looking at asmall group of people.What we're adding to it, from our perspective, is, we're going to see whathappened, because some people were pushed along. We're going to see whathappened before, what happens at the inauguration and all of thisconversation of problems around the country.CAVUTO:  All right.DONOHUE:  And we're not going to be giving any money away for a good periodof time. And we will make our decisions when we have the benefit of allthat information.Some people have to make them right away. We have the benefit of saying wewere never -- we worked with this White House, but we supported some thingsand opposed others, and we had a very balanced relationship.CAVUTO:  All right, Tom, we will see what happens.Tom Donohue.DONOHUE:  Yes.CAVUTO:  Meanwhile, we're talking about this impeachment prospect of whereit goes.U.S. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina is against this. He says: "Animpeachment vote will only lead to more hate and deeply fractured nation. Ioppose impeaching President Trump."Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  So many vaccines out there, so few getting into Americans' arms,and a lot of governors have been criticized for the slow mo of this wholephenomenon.Charlie Gasparino reports on two in particular -- Charlie.CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Well, yes, New York andNew Jersey, Governor Cuomo and Governor Murphy, respectively.But, Neil, this is not just a local problem. I'm talking -- I have beentalking to traders, investors, economists over the last couple days aboutthe slow rollout. And what they are really worried about is that thisthing, the slow rollout, not getting that herd immunity that we need by theearly spring to keep the economy going is not going to happen, it's notgoing to happen until much later in the summer.And if that does happen, there is a very real possibility, according toinvestors and economists, that we can hit a double-dip recession, and maybesomething worse. I mean, this is the scenario, restaurants not opening,many more -- many more closed down for good.They default on loans. Banks have to take massive write-downs. That's thetype of vicious circle that we're talking about if we don't achieve herdimmunity by some time in this spring, or maybe early summer.If that does happen, forget about recession. You could have something closeto a depression if you don't -- if we -- barring any sort of fiscalresponse from the government. So, this is -- we are getting into very, veryscary territory, if governors don't get this out widely.And, again, New York, New Jersey are big states. They carry a big load interms of the national economy. But I'm telling you, it's not just them.It's across the board. And the bungled rollout by the big states is goingto impact the national economy as well.So, things should be better in 2021. You and I spoke about that a lot. Butunless this vaccine gets out there and we get herd immunity, we could beheading through some difficult economic times, according to people I speakto -- Neil, back to you.CAVUTO:  Charlie Gasparino.We told you, meantime, a little earlier about companies abandoningRepublicans. One of their biggest benefactors just passed away.How do you resume business as usual when a giant is gone?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO:  There's an old line on Wall Street that says that billionairesbecome billionaires because they zig when others zag.So, when this rags-to-riches casino mogul story named Sheldon Adelson haddecided to pursue casinos as an avocation, and then decided to build andexpand in Las Vegas in an area that a lot of people thought was alreadyspent and already done, and he poured more money into still new building,including in 1999 with something called the Venetian, and there weregondolas and something that you find in Italy, a lot of people said, you'renot. You're going to lose hand over fist.He didn't. He passed away 87 years young, but not before leaving animprint, not only the casino industry, but on politics as we know it,including optimism about right making might, including opening up in LasVegas a spanking new pricey hotel back in 2010, and then, earlier, in 1999,when I caught up with him for the first time on that expansion.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SHELDON ADELSON, CHAIRMAN, LAS VEGAS SANDS CORP.:  At the high end of themarket, I think there's lots of room.I think it's a little crowded at the budget end of the market, but, at thehigh end of the market, I think that the Bellagio led the way, and we'refollowing them.CAVUTO:  Yes. But, I mean, the Bellagio is no small facility. Neither willbe Mandalay Bay You could argue Circus Circus obviously competing inbetween that realm, a lot of these multiroom hotels that all have to befilled. Will they?ADELSON:  Well, what happens is that growth begets tourism and, of course,tourism begets growth.So it's been proven over the last couple of decades that, every timethere's a spate of new growth or new properties coming online, that thevisitor volume rises -- rises commensurately.CAVUTO:  You have had a pretty stellar track record in how you have amassedyour own fortune. And I think one industry analyst had likened you toDonald Trump without the debt, but with the shi-shi tastes. Is that true?ADELSON:  Well, first of all, he's taller than I am. Secondly, he's got alot more hair.(LAUGHTER)ADELSON:  And, no, I don't really like to be compared to other people.I'm just a garden variety, plain vanilla kind of entrepreneur.For Obama to come in here, almost hypocritically come in and say, I loveVegas, and then leave here, and then dump on us and vilify us and doeverything he can to prevent people from coming to Vegas, people don't likeit here.We're a city of two million people. This is not just the Strip. When youdrive a block away from the Strip, then you don't even know the Strip isthere. So -- but we are dependent upon tourism. We're dependent uponconventions.And when somebody did -- somebody denigrates conventions, particularly thepresident of the United States, and encourages financial firms, automobilefirms, governmental agencies from coming here, nobody understands thereason why.(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO:  Zigging while they're zagging, the man who said Las Vegas wouldbecome a destination for conventions, when everyone laughed, and it did,said that Donald Trump had a very good chance of becoming president, andthen he did.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC.
