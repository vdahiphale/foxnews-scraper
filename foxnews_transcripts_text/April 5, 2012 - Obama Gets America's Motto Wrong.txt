Catch Phrase
Members of a bipartisan group of lawmakers called the Congressional Prayer Caucus want to make sure President Obama knows the country's national motto. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Forty-one Republicans and one of the five Democrats from the caucus sent a letter to the president asking him to correct a mistake he made during a speech last month in Jakarta, Indonesia when he said -- quote -- "In the United States, our motto is E Pluribus Unum -- out of many, one." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The lawmakers point out the official national motto -- approved by Congress in 1956 -- is "In God We Trust." The letter calls it -- quote -- "a disservice to the people you represent." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Caucus leaders also point out President Obama's omission of the word "creator" on more than one occasion when quoting from the Declaration of Independence.

Outgoing South Carolina Republican Governor Mark Sanford is crediting the scandal over an extramarital affair with creating a political climate that helped him govern.
Sanford told a local TV station that when his relationship with a woman from Argentina became public everything changed -- quote -- "I think that a lot of people at times would push against certain things based on their fear that my political star was climbing. If they did that it would help me get to wherever it was they thought I was going. What became abundantly clear was the supposed stars on the rainbow weren't there and I think we were able to debate the issue at hand." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

And finally, Egypt is trying to figure out why there has been a surge in shark attacks in the Red Sea. One conspiracy theory blames neighboring Israel's Mossad spy agency.
A regional governor remarked -- quote -- "What is being said about the Mossad throwing the deadly shark (in the sea) to hit tourism in Egypt is not out of the question, but it needs time to confirm."
The Jerusalem Post reports Israeli officials said the claims were too ludicrous to comment on.
