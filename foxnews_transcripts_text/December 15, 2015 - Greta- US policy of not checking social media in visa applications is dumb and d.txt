Let's all go "Off the Record." Well, there is no way to sweet talk this one. It is just plain dumb, and worse, dangerous. The U.S. reportedly has a policy of not checking the social media activity of applicants for visas who want to come here and have big red flags on their visa applications like coming from dangerous nations where many hate us, or like Tashfeen Malik, who put phony information or visa application. If those aren't big clues, I don't know what is. So, why would you not check their social media? It's insane not to.
Social media is where ISIS does its recruiting. Everyone knows that. Here is from last night's "Off the Record": 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
VAN SUSTEREN: Everyone knows ISIS uses social media as recruiting tool and if you don't know it, it was said, November 16th by President Obama; December 3rd by Secretary Carter; November 17th Secretary Kerry; December 8th, Secretary Johnson; November 18th, the president's Homeland Security advisor, Lisa Montague; July 23rd FBI Director Comey; November 19th, State Department Spokesperson John Kirby. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

I don't get it. Social media is the low hanging fruit, the first place to look to see if someone is an ISIS recruiter making jihadist threats. Yet our government reportedly has this dangerous policy against checking social media. Incredible, isn't it? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We might not be able to catch every terrorist this way, but our chance of catching a terrorist like Tashfeen Malik, who killed 14 innocents drop to zero when we stick our heads in the sand and  won't even look at the obvious.
Yes, dumb, very dumb and worse, dangerous - and as we've seen, deadly. That's my Off-the-Record comment tonight.
