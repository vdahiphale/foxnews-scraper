SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Welcome to “Hannity.”
A lot of breaking news tonight. The 2020 presidential election is officially gearing up and the Democratic Party, they are imploding. Radical extreme far left socialists have now taken over any and any Democratic who doesn't fall in line and support this radical extreme left agenda. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This left-wing vision, if you will, you get thrown down the curb by Ocasio- Cortez. You have a group now, and all of America needs to see this, hyper- partisan freshmen lawmakers. They are now leading the way. They set the agenda. Nancy Pelosi is afraid of all of those freshmen. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, the list is led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Now, according to a report from "The Washington Post," she warned her fellow Democratic lawmakers not to vote with Republicans or she's going to put them on a list to be primaried in the next election. Welcome to Congress. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, no surprise there, political intimidation is always a key component of socialism. Now, after all, she needs as much support as she can get for this insane Green New Deal which vows to totally reshape America by putting an end to all fossil fuels, combustion engines, nuclear energy, airplanes, and yes, cows because of flatulence and CO2 gases.
It also promises to provide everything is free. You don't have to worry another day in your life. Free government healthy food, free day care for your kids, free housing, free college education. Forget about K-through- 12, free universal health care, free, free. But pro-choice Democrats, they are going to allow -- not allow you to have your private plane anymore. Forget choice. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You get guarantee vacations. You get universal guaranteed income, a guaranteed retirement, even people unwilling to work. But like any other socialist, Ocasio-Cortez, she's really just interested in improving her own quality of life and redistributing the wealth among those in her own inner circle.
Look at this, according to a brand-new bombshell FEC complaint, Ocasio- Cortez's chief of staff is now accused of illegally moving nearly a million dollars in campaign contributions to his own private companies, and in doing so, that money could be shielded from all election related reporting. In other words, Ocasio-Cortez under fire tonight, her chief of staff could have used those donations for anything without reporting it, including maybe big payments to themselves, their family, their friends. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, we already know based on a separate FEC complaint that Ocasio-Cortez's boyfriend, well, he was funneled thousands of dollars from a political action committee set up by this very same chief of staff. But really, who can blame him for taking the money? After all, it's incredibly expensive to keep up with the jet-setting lifestyle of the freshman socialist congresswoman. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Last night, we first showed you how Ocasio-Cortez, who wants to ban all air travel, but she herself loves flying on airplanes between New York and D.C. Now, there's something called Amtrak. It goes pretty much every hour on the hour between D.C. and New York.
And she chooses not to do that. In fact, she chooses to take a plane three times more -- three times more travelers themselves choose Amtrak between the two cities. Not Ocasio-Cortez, she prefers the convenience of flying, especially since you, we, the American people are picking up the bill. It costs more to fly.
Now, Fox News producer caught up with Ocasio-Cortez that she was getting off a flight in D.C. today. We asked her about her travel preferences, recent FEC complaints and much more. Take a look.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

HANNITY: She has learned how to duck questions pretty quickly.
Now, I thought the world was going to end in 12 years if we didn't make all these drastic sacrifices and changes right now. That's right. Socialist, it's always do as I say, not as I do. That's why she has no problem taking planes over trains, why she prefers that caravan, the gas guzzler, and that service over public transportation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's why Ocasio-Cortez probably doesn't want you to know that her very own mother left the great state of New York because of its incredibly high taxes. It's why Bernie and Hillary and Joe Biden and Al Gore, they all take private jets and we catch them all the time. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
And get this, even though a climate change apocalypse is on the horizon, recycling -- well, that's just way too much work than Ocasio-Cortez is willing to put in. The hypocrisy is just rampant. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OCASIO-CORTEZ: I can be upset that I get ten plastic bags at the grocery store and then have to toss out my plastic bags because the recycling program in the area is tough and that's OK. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');

        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Oh, that's OK. If she thinks recycling plastic bags is tough, how does she expect you, the American people -- you have to rebuild all of your houses within ten years? You're going to get rid of your gas-powered cars. You're going to have to stop eating red meat and flying in airplanes.
Remember, Ocasio-Cortez fought hard to block Amazon from building their headquarters in New York City. That would have been 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 jobs for New Yorkers. Why? Because of their evil capitalist ways. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now after so much bad press she is backtracking, her chief of staff is reportedly saying that Amazon's 25,000 jobs might be welcomed in the city, probably too late, under the right conditions, how generous.
And keep in mind, socialism, that's only one component of what is now this radical extreme Democratic socialist party and their agenda. In fact, as we were pointing out last night, many of the same far left lawmakers pushing socialist policies were also spreading vile, hateful, rabid anti- Semitic views all throughout the halls of Congress. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Look at Minnesota Congresswoman Omar, once again facing more backlash after yet another anti-Semitic comment on Twitter. First, she proclaims that Israel was evil and hypnotizing the world and then she suggested support for Israel was just because of Jewish money or, as she put it, all about the Benjamins. And most recently, she pushed the longtime anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that her colleagues support Israel because they have a dual allegiance to the country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, for the second time, the House of Representatives has been forced to pass a resolution reminding some Democrats that anti-Semitism is bad and will not be tolerated. Well, that's not stopping Congresswoman Cortez from defending her anti-Semitic colleague on Twitter writing, quote: We called resolutions on sexist statements, a good chunk of Congress will be gone. Jump to the nuclear option every single time? Leaves the room or some corrective action? I'm asking everybody that we practice calling in before calling out.
So, I guess socialist, you know, sort of a feather stick together. Birds of a feather? Even when one of them is absolutely obsessed with hating the world's only Jewish state, our closest ally in the region, the only democracy in the region, Israel?
And meanwhile, far left anti-Semitic bigot and self-proclaimed women's rights leader, Linda Sarsour, backing up her radical friends on Capitol Hill, slamming Speaker Pelosi's decision to put forth a resolution against anti-Semitism, calling the speaker, quote, a typical white feminist upholding the patriarchy doing the work of power white men. Wow. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And you know what? Nancy Pelosi is afraid to take a stand because that freshman group, they can unseat her pretty quickly. And while some congressional Democrats focus on hating Israel and bizarre socialist eco- state, well, Congresswoman Maxine Waters is back and she's sticking to her own longtime favorite of session, impeaching 45. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And yesterday, she renewed these new fantasies on Twitter, writing that, quote, impeachment is the only answer. Socialism, anti-Semitism, impeachment, unprecedented 24/7, 365 investigations, eight committees into all things Donald Trump, an investigation in search of a crime, any crime, 24/7 abuse of power, try to bloodied, bludgeon the president politically, impeach him. If they can't impeach him, death by a thousand cuts.
It is a very scary picture inside this new radical Democratic Party. And as the 2020 primary season kicks into high gear, it has become very clear that it will be a contest to see who can present the single most radical, most extreme, most socialist vision for America's future.

HANNITY: Remember, if Hillary didn't cheat, that nomination would have gone to Bernie Sanders.
And while Biden is on the fence deciding whether or not he's going to run, Hillary, wow, huge announcement. She won't try it a third time.
And that's not stopping her allies from rehashing old wounds with Sanders in 2016. This intramural Democratic battle is real. Remember last week, former Clinton aide referred to Sanders as, quote, his royal majesty, King Bernie Sanders.

It's prompting a former Sanders campaign aide to call the Clinton camp, quote, some of the biggest A-holes in American politics. So, showing no signs of stopping.
And as Clinton allies are continuing to snipe at Sanders, well, one former advisor recently tweeting that only half of Bernie's donors were, quote, named Vladimir. Wow.

Now even President Trump weighing in. He's getting on the fun: Crooked Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020, rules out a third bid for the White House. Aw shucks, does that mean I will get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed.
And even without Hillary Clinton, 2020 is shaping up to be a very, very toxic year for the Democrats. Now, their issues are much larger than any of this infighting. This is where it gets serious. The Democrats biggest problem is they are pushing the most radical agenda of any party in this country's history.

By the way, before birth, up to birth, during birth, after birth abortions, that is called infanticide. That is a child living alone outside the womb. That would be called murder. That's the party of the Democrats now, the party telling you it might be reckless to have kids like Ocasio-Cortez? The party that wants to take away all private health care insurance. They want to socialize, nationalize health care.

Now, they are talking about legalizing drugs and prostitution, that's gaining momentum among the 2020 candidates. Reparation is now back by many candidates like Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren. Many are supporting this top marginal tax rate of 70 percent. By the way, after you pay her 70 percent, you get to keep maybe 30, maybe not depending on what state you live in.

Well, if you save some money, then Elizabeth Warren once a wealth tax on top of it. She wants another bite of the Apple. And then, by the way, when you die in the United States of America you've got to pay to die. If you have any money left in your bank account, guess what? They are going to take 40 percent of that. If you live in New York they will take another 10 percent.
And, by the way, so they can take care of people that are unwilling to work and of course pay for child care and retirement and government food and health care and college. They are going to illuminate fossil fuels, gas and oil. They're going to destroy the lifeblood of our economy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

They're going to get rid of planes, mandate you rebuild your home. Who's paying for that? The estimates now are as high as $94 trillion in ten years, that's their proposal.
Pushing open borders. Remember Bozo O'Rourke actually wants to tear down the border walls, preventing any of us from being safe and secure. That would leave all of us defenseless against cartels and drug traffickers and human traffickers of young women into prostitution, gangs that make this country totally defenseless. The 90 percent of heroine that comes through our southern border, now it gets through even more easily.
And don't forget free everything. Health care, college, child care, vacations, free healthy government food. It's a party that is totally fueled by the desire to run your life, take your hard-earned money, give it to someone else and use it to buy power and votes for themselves as they live the lap of luxury.
A party committed to destroying the single greatest, best economic system that has let more people out of poverty, that has created more wealth and prosperity. That has created more opportunity than any other economic system in history of man. The Democratic Party with no plan to make your life better -- more safe, more secure, more prosperous for not only you, but for your children and your grandchildren.

They are fueled too by a rage, hate, and obsession with victimhood and identity politics, entitlement, pushing doom and gloom day and night, climate hysteria, indoctrinating your kids into believing the world is ending in 12 years. Just to push the socialist agenda. A party fueled by what can only be described as psychotic, literally unhinged, rage and hatred every second, minute, hour of every day against the duly elected president.

They are not even trying to hide it. Just today, we learned that Shifty Adam Schiff hired former MSNBC legal analyst, collusion experience theorist Daniel Goldman to lead his new witch hunt against the president in the House Intel Committee. Forget the Mueller report, that's not working out the way we want, we will rewrite it.
As "The Daily Caller" points out, Goldman has already been caught asserting faceless Russia hysteria. Look at the screen.
He was promoting a phony Steele dossier, the debunked Steele dossier, even debunked by Michael Cohen, who never went to Prague. And there were no hookers and Donald Trump spat in Moscow. They weren't there.

Now, we have more evidence, endless fishing expeditions have nothing to do with the truth, everything to do with making every working day a public trial against the president. Look at this, even David Axelrod has more sense than this. Former chief strategist for Obama agreeing, writing on Twitter that the Democrats wide-ranging investigations to easily play into the witch hunt meme.
Look at that. He's right. And that's because the Democrats are engaging in a witch hunt.
All right. Here with reaction as we now are looking at two very distinct paths for the future.

Because, Dan, the problem is, look, they just now have -- we've got 100 Democrats now supporting this insanity that would eliminate cows, cars, engine and oil and gas and airplanes. I mean, they are serious and then I'm looking at OK, now they've pledged not to work for the American people 24/7, all it is, is there going to cast the widest net, bring in all these people, cost them a fortune in legal fees because they want to destroy Trump.
They are not working to serve the people in their districts, so the American people at large.
DAN BONGINO, CONTRIBUTOR: No, they are not.
But, Geraldo, can I just play something you said there, I know you are better -- you can't seriously be claiming that people are going after some of these ideas with Ms. Cortez because of her minority status as a woman. I hope you're not saying that. I have on this network many times, you can check the tapes, check the YouTube's, whatever, congratulations, she did a great job.

RIVERA: That is the fuel of youth, Dan.
BONGINO: What if Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was promoting fascism? Would you say she had a heart?
RIVERA: Of course not, but she's not. She's not --

You know what? This is the hypocrisy. Liberals are only generous with other people's money, Geraldo.
If they want -- look at Nancy Pelosi, we sent our cameras to her district, we saw homeless people, feces and needles everywhere and she is a multi- multimillionaire. Why can't she build a homeless shelter so they can shower and get treatment of the drug addicts?
RIVERA: I'm not here to speak in favor of Nancy Pelosi. I don't know what she does with her private money, I don't know what charities she supports or does not support. All I know is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez represents an ideal to many youngsters that you mock, but really have to be more generous. Now that we know what works, the president knows what works.
You know, the economy, just saw the new surveys up. If the Democrats, the grown-ups -- I don't mean to be demeaning to her, but if the old guard of the Democratic Party --

RIVERA: I think the same thing I think about Stormy Daniels. I think that there is no intent there. This is a very complex Federal Election Commission laws, very complicated. I don't think there's any larcenous intent.
HANNITY: The eight committees that are not serving the American people, that are just looking to bludgeon Trump and cast a wide net and investigate anything because I guess Mueller is not giving them what they want.
BONGINO: Well, it will be the death of the Democrat Party and I wish Geraldo would stop saying that this is some kind of generous system. People in Venezuela are eating out of garbage trucks, Sean. The footage has been on our network. You had the Univision anchor who had actual --

All right. Directly ahead, President Trump says Democrats are guilty of presidential harassment. Judge Jeanine and Alan Dershowitz answer that question. In other words, have we criminalized vertical different differences? Democrats allowed to abuse their power with investigations when they don't even know what they are investigating? Straight ahead.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: They got 81 letters. There was no collusion. That was a hoax. There was no anything. And they want to do that instead of getting legislation passed.

Earlier today, he continued on Twitter. He wrote, quote: Now that they realize the only collusion with Russia was done by crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, Nadler, Schiff and the Dem heads of committees have now gone stone cold crazy. Eighty-one letters sent to innocent people to harass them. They won't get anything done for our country.
The greatest overreach in the history of our country. Dems are obstructing justice. They will not get anything done. A big fat fishing expedition desperately in search of a crime when in fact the real crimes is what the Dems are doing and have done.
The president, as I said last night, he is correct but that means nothing to the Democrats. They love a good anti-Trump never ending witch hunt.
Just listen to what Congressman Jerrold Nadler who over the weekend declared him guilty before even starting the investigation said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JERRY NADLER, D-N.Y.: We have to -- you had two years of sustained attacks by the administration of the nature that we haven't seen probably a century or more against the free press, against the courts, against the law enforcement administration, against freedom of speech. We have to make sure as to what is true and what is not true and maybe come up with legislative limits on power or maybe do other things. But we have to make sure that this is not a dictatorship and that the rule of law is respected.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Reminds me of the old Stalinist mantra, show me the man, I'll find you the crime. All of this suddenly surrounding a duly elected president of the United States, all under the banner of "Protecting Democracy". These investigations have nothing to do with protecting you, we the American people, instead they really only care about imposing their own "Hate Trump" agenda.
Here now with reaction Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz is with us. He wrote the introduction to The Constitution and will write an introduction to the Mueller Report when it is released, that's news. And also the author of "Liars, Leakers, and Liberals", #1 bestseller. The host of Justice, Judge Jeanine Pirro.
I didn't know that Professor, #1, how did that come about? More importantly, "Show me the crime, and I'll show you the man". Eight Committees, they don't even have anything specific they're looking at. You have talked about criminalizing political differences. This is worse than I've ever seen it.
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL EMERITUS PROFESSOR: Well, it's not worse than I've ever seen it. I lived through McCarthy period when Congress --
HANNITY: This is McCarthyism.
DERSHOWITZ: -- misused its oversight function to go after people, some innocent, some guilty. Look, Congress has a legitimate oversight function to perform, but it has to make sure it doesn't go too far. It can't use that oversight function, which is really designed to help get legislation in order to really prevent a President from finishing out his terms enacting, and they're interfering with the executive branch, if they do.
So a balance has to be struck between legitimate function of Congress to investigate. The framers didn't intend for Congress to become yet another prosecutorial branch, yet another investigative branch. They are supposed to pass laws and so it seems to me these investigations look like they're going too far.
HANNITY: Are you or have you ever been a supporter of Donald Trump? There is no reason to initiate eight Committees, the widest net I've ever seen, because it appears they're not getting Robert Mueller -- the big promise of Robert Mueller that they've been pushing for two years.
JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO, "JUSTICE" HOST: Well, Sean, they're already setting that up. I mean, Nadler has pretty much said, we don't care what Mueller is going to say, we're going to do our own investigation.
Look, the bottom-line, is that this Committee does have the right to look at a lot of things, but -- which is going to backfire, because the American people understand that the economy is doing well, that they've got jobs and on and on.
And these Dems have been have been having a hissy fit since Hilary lost her crown. They boycotted the inauguration. Then they wanted to impeach him. Then they brought in a Special Counsel and alleged collusion. Now they've got Committees that will for the next two years do nothing but investigate and aggravate Donald Trump and everyone close to him, Sean, in an attempt to alienate him from the people who are closest to him.
And here's the bottom-line, Trump's numbers are 48 percent in polls and 93 percent among Republicans. Congress is at 13 percent. The American people get it. Congress should be doing its job and not doing nothing but a trashing Donald Trump.
HANNITY: I know we have some political differences, Professor, but let's put them aside for a second. If this is their commitment for the next two years, rather than laying out an agenda for peace and safety and security and an economic growth and prosperity for Americans, and they support this -- you don't support this New Green Deal, you're too intelligent to support anything that insane.
But a 100 Democrats in Washington do. Then they're going to spend all the rest of their time looking for a crime and wasting all the time doing that. I don't think this is a good thing politically for Democrats.
DERSHOWITZ: No, I don't either. And in fact there is some legal recourse. If you go back to the cases in the 1950s, the courts sometimes did say, look, Congress you've gone too far. This is not within your legitimate function.
And so if I were one of the people who got a letter or a subpoena, I would at least think about the possibility of bringing a lawsuit and suggesting that Congress is abusing its oversight function.
As far as the environment is concerned, I'm a strong supporter of the environment, but we need a balanced environmental concerns --
HANNITY: We got to be -- we get rid of oil, and airplanes and cows -- we need cows. I like to eat steak.
DERSHOWITZ: -- people. Obviously, that's true.
HANNITY: I will buy you a steak Professor. Last word.
PIRRO: And look, what they are looking to do with this Green New Deal is they want to control what you eat, and we're getting bits and pieces out of it. We know they want to take planes out of the sky, and we have to build - - rebuild our homes.
But when AOC said last week -- at the end of the week she said, "Look, I'm not saying everyone has to be a vegan, but you don't need to eat hamburgers three times a day, folks let's get real". They want to control everything that we do.
And I find it shocking that they say that that they need to investigate the President, not for a crime, but for anything. And as prosecutors, we learn you investigate a crime, not a man.
HANNITY: All right. When we come back, Dems gearing up -- literally they are proposing to eliminate all private health care. It's not a joke. I'm serious. They want to nationalize the entire health care industry and they're saying so. We'll explain what this would mean for you and your family "A Hannity investigation"
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Democrats in Congress continue pushing their socialist agenda on you, the American people, and endless investigation, doesn't stop with the New Green Deal. Now over a 100 House Democrats are supporting -- get this a radical new health care proposal.
It would ban all private insurance coverage, which means the government takeover of the entire health care industry, the Medicare-for-all, good luck with that. In other words socialism. You won't be allowed to, let's see, have your own private plan. Every socialism with this promise is a free, free, free and then they're going to tax some people to death to pay for everything.
Joining us now Washington Times Columnist, Monica Crowley, Former Obama Economic Advisor Austan Goolsbee. Keep your doctor, keep your plan and pay less. That really worked out when millions lost their doctors plans and everybody paid more now.
Here's the thing, I thought you liberals were Pro-Choice. So why is Kamala Harris and other 2020 candidates and a 100 Democrats -- Austan, why if you're Pro-Choice -- are you going to force Americans into a system that I have no faith in, maybe you do. And if I want my -- 187 million Americans then would -- I guess, it would be illegal to have your own private health insurance.
AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER OBAMA ECONOMIC ADVISOR: Sean --
HANNITY: Austan.
GOOLSBEE: -- you're talking about Bernie Sanders plan.
HANNITY: That's supported by Kamala Harris and 100 Democrats in Congress, yes, that plan.
GOOLSBEE: It's only been endorsed by two of the 20 Democratic presidential candidates. The Medicare-for-All that is give everyone the choice to buy into Medicare is supported by 70 percent,80 percent Americans --
HANNITY: It's not a choice. She said -- they said --
GOOLSBEE: -- including 52 percent of Republics.
HANNITY: -- private health insurance. Listen, pay close attention, I'm telling you what they said. Monica?
MONICA CROWLEY, WASHINGTON TIMES COLUMNIST: Look, the point of all of this is government power and control. It's not even about health care, that's just the pretext for what they talk about in order to seize more control over all of our lives.
Remember back when they were debating Obamacare. Senator Tom Harkin, Nancy Pelosi, they all described it as a "Starter Home", because the ultimate it always was single-payer. Now they have rebranded single-payer as Medicare- for-All.
And what they've done over the last several years -- I just wrote a column about this in The Washington Times -- is acclimate the public to the most extreme of their objectives, which is single-payer or it is the Green New Deal.
It's achievability in the moment is not the point. The point is to get the public accustomed to it, so that they can achieve a piecemeal. And before you know it, all of a sudden you've got to single payer.
HANNITY: Well, I mean, do you support the renew deal, Austan? I mean, I would think you want to keep airplanes and cars and I think you --
GOOLSBEE: Look, I do. I said that --
HANNITY: -- probably I don't think we can guarantee everything is for free. And I think you probably agree that a 70 percent top marginal tax rate is bad.
GOOLSBEE: Wait a minute. Now you're piling it all in there.
HANNITY: -- and then you want to keep cow. Wait a minute, I know you eat cows. I bought you a cow. I bought you dinner.
GOOLSBEE: A, we're going to have to decide are we going to bet on the next election again, are we going to bet dinner. What you can't taking the most extreme case and trying to portray it like that's the median or that's what everyone thinks. And the next thing you're going to be telling me --
HANNITY: A 100 of your side do, that's a lot.
GOOLSBEE: Your employers gives you two weeks of free pay vacation and that's the beginning of socialism, that's what Brezhnev used to take and that's going to be --
HANNITY: A 70 percent tax, Monica?
GOOLSBEE: -- and that's we're going to be Stalin's purges. They're paying them not to work. They're going on vacation.
HANNITY: It says that even if you're unwilling to work, it's in the paper they put out.
CROWLEY: Look, and now the Democratic Party --
GOOLSBEE: That was a unbinding resolution by somebody that's not a presidential candidate. Sean, so, why do you keep bringing that up?
CROWLEY: But it doesn't matter. Austan, it doesn't matter. What we are talking about here is the fact that the Democratic Party now openly embraces socialism, right? So we've had this encroaching socialism. Barack Obama dressed it up pretty well. Bernie Sanders was out there in 2016.
Now you have AOC and you have a 100 of these members of Congress openly embracing this. This is about radical wealth redistribution. It's about government power and control. And as Vladimir Lenin once said, Sean, "The goal of socialism is communism".
HANNITY: Thank you both for being with us. And by the way Austan, you may want to invest in cows. In ten years from now, it might be worth a lot money.
GOOLSBEE: Are we betting?
HANNITY: Frozen beef, it could be worth a fortune. All right. When we come back a serious shocking report about the FBI, just breaking this hour, John Solomon, Sara Carter, they have the details. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. So the "Hate Trump Media Mob" is trying to distract you with the Dems' never-ending investigation. The real scandals are right under the media's nose. They've missed it for two years.
But The Hill's John Solomon has an explosive piece in The Hill showing how a top FBI counterintelligence official looked the other way despite all the red flags about star-crossed Trump hating lovers Page and Strzok.
Fox News Contributor, Investigative Reporter, Sara Carter, also out with a new report detailing how the Democrats House Judiciary probe is simply searching for a crime to punish Trump and the Americans who voted for him.
They both join us now. First Sara, let's get you. In search of a crime means abuse of power, because you just don't cast the wide net and say, "Oh, let's see if this doesn't work, if we don't have collusion, we'll investigate this, this, this, and this, maybe something will stick one day.
SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM VISITING FELLOW: Sean, it goes against everything that we stand for our justice system entirely.
If you think about this, where's the due process? Where is the due process for President Trump, for the 81 people now that they're throwing this wide net out, and for the American people who voted for the President, who have literally been held hostage for two years by the Democrats as they continue to search for a crime?
There is something drastically wrong here and I don't think people actually realize how damaging and how dangerous this is. When I hear Alan Dershowitz, he is a voice of reason. I think to myself, this is what they used to think. The libertarians, the Democrats, they used to fight against this abuse of power.
What we've seen Sean, and you've listed it out, and we've talked about this over and over again, a weaponization of the intelligence community, the unmasking of Americans. I mean, all see these issues that are so --
HANNITY: FISA abuse, dossier abuse.
CARTER: -- FISA abuse, that's right. And the
HANNITY: Yes. All right, let me bring in John.
CARTER: That's right. And the spread -- and the leaking of classified information.
HANNITY: All right. John, you could -- you can add the comments of -- obviously, the security issues that were ignored in your column, which I think are important, we had two things that are happening simultaneously. One we expect the Mueller report.
JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT: Right
HANNITY: Two, what will the new Attorney General do? Will he do the right thing starting with Hillary Clinton on doubt?
SOLOMON: It's a great question, right, and we're just going to have to wait and see. The Mueller report is going to come out. I feel very confident it will not find any criminal conduct against the President, based on my reporting.
HANNITY: No collusion, no obstruction.
SOLOMON: And that will trigger the opportunity -- that's correct. That's what my understanding is. We'll see -- let's see, when it comes out. Let's judge it by the facts. But if that happens, then the first thing we know is that we saw the weaponization of the criminal justice system and the counterintelligence system against Donald Trump.
And now you're going to see that sort of criminalization, weaponization of the congressional oversight process to try to keep this narrative going, so that's one thing the President has to deal with.
The second thing is, does the Justice Department now say, "OK, Mueller is done, let's take a look at the Strzoks and the McCabes and the Pages, and all these people that were involved in this and do we hold them accountable?
The IG report will come in on FISA abuses. That will inform us a lot. The President has the ability without being accused of obstruction of declassifying the documents --
HANNITY: Oh, that's all coming, I have no doubt.
SOLOMON: All that information allows --
HANNITY: Yes.
SOLOMON: Yes, there is no doubt in my mind. Now let's just take the column, just for one second, just think about what Bill Barr could look at in this circumstance. 20 years ago we had one of the worst spy scandals in American history. Robert Hanssen spied for the Russians, went undetected for 20 years.
The After-Action Report said the biggest problem the FBI had was a failure to confront its own people about suspected bad behavior. What happens, two employees come forward and say, "We think there's an affair going on by Pete Strzok and Lisa Page". And rather than confront them directly, they shove to the side. They don't take that security risk seriously.
Even though they said that -- everyone understood it was a security risk, no one wanted to ask the hard questions. We didn't learn much in the FBI over 20 years from the Hanssen scandal. Those are the sort of things that Bill Barr, the Inspector General, the Senate Judiciary Committee can all look.
HANNITY: All alright, Sara, you get the last word.
CARTER: Well, I think the most important thing is that Attorney General Barr investigate that we wait for Michael Horowitz's report and that we bring people to justice who've abused the system.
Sean, if we don't do this, then what are we? What do we stand on? How can we guarantee that at the next administration this won't happen? We can't. As Americans, we have to demand that, and I hope that President Trump declassifies those documents.
HANNITY: Hope, Barr does his job, and John I hope is right, we'll see. I'm not sure I trust Mueller's team, never have. When we come back, you're going to meet the tech millionaire, the one who helped Ocasio-Cortez literally into becoming the leader of the Democratic Party.
Trace Gallagher, Full Report, "Villain of the Day", and your mails, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. "Villain of the Day", Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez and her own Chief of Staff appear to be in hot water. Our own Trace Gallagher has the very latest on the tech millionaire behind AOC.
Trace, we have former people in FEC saying, "This could be go to jail stuff".
TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR: Yes. And Sean, on his Twitter bio, Saikat Chakrabarti calls himself "CoS to AOC" or Chief of Staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Chakrabarti is a Harvard educated computer engineer, who before he started working with one of the nation's most famous socialists, did very well as a capitalist, reportedly making tens of millions of dollars in Silicon Valley startups.
From there he shifted to activism where he founded an organization to help launch Left-wing candidates into Congress. Chakrabarti reportedly owns homes in Maryland and New York's trendy West Village. He makes $80,000 working for Ocasio-Cortez, which is well below the income level that mandates filing disclosure forms for outside income.
And for months, he flew under the radar until a conservative watchdog group filed a complaint to the FEC accusing Chakrabarti and Ocasio-Cortez of violating campaign finance laws by funneling nearly $1 million dollars of donations into political action committees.
The complaint states they were trying to illegally dodge laws aimed at tracking campaign expenditures. Today Ocasio-Cortez told Fox News, "No, no, there is no violation". Sean?
HANNITY: And time will tell. All right, Trace Gallagher, hypocrisy abounds. All right now for viewer mail. One viewer writes us, "Today's Democrats have gone completely off the rails. As a registered Democrat most of my life I am ashamed for the party and the direction its leaders have taken it".
Another writes, "Thanks Sean for all you do, in spite of your haters." Thank you, there's quite a few, actually they listed pretty long -- most of them in the "Hate Trump Media", amazing. But, thankfully, I have support from people like you and you make this program possible, that's the bottom- line.
And I'm missing that chip, that's most people care what other people think, it's gone. It's long gone. It disappeared years ago.
All right. That's all the time we have left this evening. Remember, we thank you for being with us, and we will never be the destroy-Trump media, the hate-Trump media mob. Let not your heart be troubled, because Laura Ingraham standing by in our nation's capital to take it away
