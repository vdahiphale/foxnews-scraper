DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Lisa Boothe, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five."
President Trump is in the U.K. and already making waves holding a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. The president downplaying the fallout of a controversial interview he gave to British newspaper, The Sun, where he accused May of wreaking Brexit and killing off any chance of a vital U.S. trade deal.

 DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I didn't criticize the prime minister. I have a lot of respect for the prime minister. And unfortunately, there was a story that was done, which was, you know, generally fine, but it didn't put in what I said about the prime minister and I've said tremendous things. It's called fake news. She's going to make a decision as to what she's going to do. The only thing I ask of Teresa is that we make sure we can trade, that we don't have any restrictions because we want to trade with the U.K., and the U.K. wants to trade with us.

I mean, you see the same terror attacks that I do. I know it's politically not necessarily correct to say that, but I'll say it and I'll say it loud. And I think they better watch themselves.

 PERINO: Greg, you lived in the U.K. Let's start with London. It was amazing to me that that many people have the day off to just hang out and. 
GUTFELD: On a Friday afternoon. The interesting thing, number one, is the balloon has absolutely no effect because Trump is actually bigger than the balloon. I mean, he actually is as a phenomenon, wherever he goes, has a greater impact than anything there. So he is the number one story in England. He's the biggest thing in England. He's bigger than Big Ben. I want to make a metaphor and analogy if I may to my friends in England, I live there, I'm an Anglo file, I love the music. In the 1970's, music was plagued by soft rock and progressive rock. Things like Air Supply, and Genesis, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Just really boring ponders music. Pop a song to a 15 minute drum solos. Then in 1976, the Ramones, the Ramones from New York, Queens. Queen went to England and played, and what happened? Destroyed that whole scene, and all these punk bands started, the Clash, the Daman, the Sex Pistols. Thousands of new band happened. Sound familiar? Donald Trump is the Ramones of politics. What he's done is what punk did to music, Trump is doing to the entire political scene. He's a brutal, blunt, game-changing, but he's elementally true. You may not like punk rock but the messages in the songs were truth. They were 3 minutes, 2 minutes of truth. That's what you're seeing. This is the first punk-rock president. 
PERINO: Is that the metaphor you said was going to blow our minds?

        }
      
GUTFELD: Yes. In fact, I got it from a buddy of mine. My buddy Paul. He emailed me last night, said, you know, he's a punk-rock president, and I go yes. 
PERINO: Punk-rock president. I mean, I like the country music president, too. 
GUTFELD: You had one, it's G.W. Bush.

        }
      
(LAUGHTER)

 PERINO: Rage against the machine, is true. You want to carry this metaphor forward? 
BOOTHE: I will, because I was actually thinking of something similar, because everyone focuses on the way President Trump says things, but the way he says it makes you focus on what he's saying. For instance, if President Trump hadn't said that Germany was held captive by Russia, we wouldn't be talking about something like the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is important because it does, in fact, give Russia leverage over Germany and other European nations. So it's something important, especially at a time, you know, when we're all talking about Russia aggression and we're looking at putting sanctions on Russia, sort of undercuts that narrative and that objective if they're funneling money to Russia through the pipeline. But we wouldn't be talking about it if he didn't say it that way. Or you look at immigration, all you have to do is look at the Paris attackers, the ease that they're able to get around Europe, go back to Syria, come back, hiding in places like Mozambique which are the epiphany of a failure of integration of immigration policy and lack of assimilation. So, I mean, he says these things at the face that seems outlandish, but would we be talking about the substance if he didn't say it that way?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
PERINO: I don't know, actually, maybe, maybe not. I do -- I was just thinking though about the -- the Theresa May comment, Jesse. So he gave the interview to The Sun. They released the audio. He said it was fake, but I do think that he actually -- maybe felt a little bad that she felt slighted in her own paper while he was there. 
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: I think he did feel bad, he felt a human emotion that is possible with this president. And lot of people thinks he's just this maniacal robot that doesn't care about people's feelings. But the way he was, kind of, over the top praising her as this strong, decisive ally that is a big winner.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(CROSSTALK)

 PERINO: And it might work out in her favor because now we're going to get a trade deal looks like.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Exactly. I remember when President Obama said that, you know, if you guys do Brexit, you know, we're going to get in the back of the line on the trade. He's done the opposite and he's reached his arm across the Atlantic and offered an olive branch there. I thought meeting the queen was the bigger thing today, just the visual that was pumped into the world. And when we see this on television, people enjoy the spectacle of it, they like the red and the colors, and she's in the blue and the president's trying to walk like this, and it's just very formal, and it shows how the president was respected. I know the president personally enjoys that kind of pomp and circumstance. He enjoys the respect them rolling out the red carpet. But it really solidified the special relationship. Today, you also saw the image of him holding Theresa May's hand. And then they had tea with the queen. And he probably gave him a big boost of adrenaline at the end of this. At the end of it, when you look at it, the European countries did make commitments to boost their defense spending. And NATO is invigorated, I believe, and more focused on the task at hand, and on confronting Russia. So, I think at the end of the day, the trip to Europe was positive. And we've had great economic news this week, Strzok humiliated himself. 
PERINO: We're going to get to all that, Jesse. Oh, my gosh.

WILLIAMS: But Trump said that, in fact, these immigrants are tearing the fabric of Europe and London apart. And he goes after the mayor. And by the way, Jesse, he said that he loves Theresa May. You know what? He's the one that gave the interview. It's not like somebody forced him to talk to The Sun Newspaper. He gave an interview that was hostile toward a leader he was about to sit down. He created the chaos. He created the situation.

WILLIAMS: It could, but.
PERINO: It put him a little bit on the defensive, and it put him in a position of being quite amiable. And so, because she was gracious, she said, oh, no problem, it's fine, like very British, you know, stiff up he lip, no problem. She's going to walk away with possibly getting a trade deal. Earlier in the week her government was falling apart.

But I will say, he goes over there, he stirs the pot, then he tries to un-stir the pot. Again, he is, you know, the be-all of the whole story. But, to me, you can't get over the fact that, one, 100,000 people in the streets of London? I mean, forget the crying babies.

 PERINO: Let me get Greg in here. The London protest -- as I saw Benjamin Hall, earlier, reporting at the 2 o'clock hour, was that they were really campaigning against capitalism. 
GUTFELD: No, it's true. A lot of this -- this is what happens with left wing protesters, it's becomes a grab bag of everything. You saw women dressed up as characters from the Handmaid's Tale, which is the fictional miniseries about a misogynistic dystopia where women are forced into sexual slavery. Now, I doubt any of those women dressed up as those Handmaids ever did anything about the mass rape in England.

But to Juan's point, everybody hates his style, everybody hates his style, that's why he's punk rock. But the New York Times even had to admit today, was it today's paper?

WILLIAMS: Right. So he's playing to an American base, when he brings up immigration issue he's trying to stir that up here. I think he talks about terrorism. There's no truth -- are you kidding? Europe -- I mean, what did Theresa May say as she was standing there next to him? Immigration has been great for Great Britain, that's what she said. 

 PERINO: But, Juan, all of it -- from Germany to Denmark to Sweden to all of these populace are rising up because of. 
WILLIAMS: Correct. So I think he's playing to a populace, nationalist sentiment that he would like to excite here at home for the midterms. But that is not -- it's not the case that you are breaking apart Europe, and the fabric is being torn, and that the mayor of London is responsible for all those terrorism. I hope he says that with Vladimir Putin.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I would call it the witch hunt. I would call it the rigged witch hunt after watching some of the little clips. I didn't get to watch too much because I'm here. It's a different time zone to put it mildly. But after watching the people, that man that was testifying yesterday, I call it the rigged witch hunt.

The president's comments came just moments before Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian officers for election meddling. As you know, yesterday's hearing was contentious, ugly and fiery, and Republicans and Democrats still going at it.

 WATTERS: Meanwhile, former FBI attorney, Lisa Page, meeting with congressional investigators behind closed doors after initially defying a subpoena to answer questions about her text message exchanges trashing Trump. All right, Greg, the dust has settled after yesterday's hearing. Now how do you feel about it? 
GUTFELD: Everyone -- I know people are going to get mad, everyone there was obnoxious, everybody on both sides. What bothered me were the self- appointed white knights of the Democrats rushing to defend Strzok as if he was a princess stuck in high dungeon. Then there was the Republicans showboating to a point where they actually turned him into Oliver North. But, first you had the Democrats offering Strzok more cover than an oversized straw hat. And then you had the Republicans constantly trying to pull off the oversized straw hat. It drove me crazy. But the thing is, the point of this whole hearing is there's nothing you're going to get out of talking to Strzok, because accusing somebody of bias in 2016 is like accusing someone of being high at Woodstock. We were all biased. I know I was. I mean, we've had some serious fights here. Everybody had strong feelings. And I know you're going to say, but he was an FBI agent, he's in charge of investigation, but you can't prove that his bias affected that. You can believe it, I believe it, but I can't prove it.
WATTERS: Very difficult to prove.

So, the key point yesterday was let's -- from the Republican perspective, let's prove that this man was so biased that the entire investigation into Trump is, in fact, useless, that you can't honestly judge what happened if the Russian interference and potential collusion because of Peter Strzok's behavior. In fact, what it revealed, if you want a news headline from yesterday, was there was no such plot to undermine Trump. That he could have come out with news about the Russian investigation, he didn't do it.

Hillary Clinton was under a criminal investigation because there was enough evidence of potential wrongdoing to have a criminal investigation by the FBI. The Russia investigation was a counter intelligence investigation, largely looking at a foreign power, potentially involved in, or elections, two entirely different things. Again, Comey told President Trump when he was first elected, three different times, he wasn't under investigation. So, no, those aren't two of the same things. 
WILLIAMS: Correct.

WILLIAMS: Let me respond to you. What you have now is a situation where Mike Flynn and others in the Trump campaign, in fact, have either plead guilty, or today as we saw in terms of the indictment, you see people who are reaching out. Now, Rod Rosenstein today said nobody on the American side may have been aware of the efforts by these Russians. But what you have, Lisa, is today with the indictment, I think it was 12 today, you have 13 indicted in February, it's clear there was Russian interference ongoing. And the effort by people like.
BOOTHE: The point is, Hillary Clinton was the subject of criminal investigation is different. 
WILLIAMS: No, it's not.
BOOTHE: Yes, it is.
WILLIAMS: Because it was an ongoing investigation being run by the FBI. And guess who was in charge? Peter Strzok. But the big point for me is, here you get President Trump today, saying, oh, I guess I'll bring it up with Putin on Monday. But there was no Perry -- there's not going to be any Perry Mason moment. 
WATTERS: All right. Let's get someone else in here. To your point, Juan-- I mean, at that point in the Hillary deal, she had already set up a private server against the law, and then shredded all the emails. So there was, obviously.

WILLIAMS: No, you bring this up. So why don't you go back to -- all you want to do is talk about Hillary Clinton because you don't want to talk about.
(CROSSTALK)

 WILLIAMS: You want to talk about Hillary Clinton. But what strikes me is, if you look at those Strzok e-mails, I'm amazed. Strzok's going after Eric Holder. He's going after Chelsea Clinton. He's going after the Democrats. And yet, for one comment about Donald Trump. 
WATTERS: There's more than one, Juan.

WILLIAMS: Oh, my. The P.C. police at it again, this time in the cowboy state. A new marketing slogan at the University of Wyoming, which says, quote, the world needs more cowboys, end quote. Well, it's getting a backlash. The phrase sparking outrage from some faculty and Native American groups, they claim it's sexist and racist because it excludes women and people of color. The university defending the slogan saying their cowboys are diverse. We now go to our local cowgirl, Dana Perino. 
PERINO: Well, yeah, this is ridiculous. So, my dad went to University of Wyoming, proud cowboy. Liz Cheney's daughter, I don't know if that's allowed -- am I allowed to say that? But, anyway, she just got into the school and she's going to be on the rodeo team which is very exciting. I do like it that the board of trustees unanimously rejected this nonsense, that I do think this is proof that the world actually does need more cowboys because it's preposterous. And, the other thing is, when you are a part of a school, they say the world needs more cowboys, or they say where did you go to school, what was the mascot? 
WATTERS: The bantams. 
PERINO: The bantams. OK. Were there male bantams and female bantam? I mean, it's just the bantams. So you are a cowboy if you go to the school, that's what it is. 
WILLIAMS: Well, actually.
PERINO: Like the wolverines. 
WILLIAMS: . they had a good response, which was that they like the idea that if people respond to cowboys as John Wayne and the Marlboro man, you know, white males, that they would be surprised if they opened up and realized that, hey, there're women, there're people of color, Native Americans, blacks, et cetera. And that the contrast then would say, hey, there's a different reality to the University of Wyoming. Do you think that sells, Jesse?

        }
      
WATTERS: I think it sells, but I think it's simpler when you just say this is a place for cowboys. That why slogans work. You don't say this is the place where there's cowboys, cowgirls, minority cowboys, cowpersons and Indians. That's just can't even fit on a brochure. I also don't understand, like, you can't say Indians can't be a mascot and cowboys can't be a mascot. What does that leave you? Who else was on the prairie? 
PERINO: Laura Ingalls. 
WATTERS: You have to have something. I just think people are soft in this country. And if you get offended or can't handle the mascot at the university you go to, you're weak. And you're not going to cut it in the real world. 
WILLIAMS: Is that right? 
WATTERS: Yeah, it's right. 
(CROSSTALK)

 BOOTHE: Everybody can be a cowboy -- it's just so stupid. And my broader concern, as you've mentioned, the weakness of society because we're not building future generations of leaders. I mean, what General Mattis is or walking around college campuses when you're taught to not be able to tolerate people with different opinions, different races, you shut people down that, you know, look at life in a different way than you. How do you ever going to go out into the real world and face reality? Or even -- how are we breeding the next generation of leaders when everyone is so soft and weak. 
WILLIAMS: Wait a second, so here's the contrary thought. The contrary thought would be you don't want a slogan that makes people feel excluded. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

BOOTHE: Oh, Juan. You can be a cowboy. I can be a cowboy. Jesse is a cowboy. Dana is a cowboy.
WATTERS: You know it excludes all the people that aren't in the university. That's the deal. When you have a mascot at the university, you rally around the mascot. 
WILLIAMS: Well, I'm all for it, Greg. 
GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Very -- it's an easy solution. You change the name to bovine administrator. How does that work? 
I would be -- that is, to me -- I came up with that today. 
Are you sure this story wasn't concocted in an underwater lab by Brian Kilmeade and Steve Doocy for "FOX & Friends"? Because this is the absolute perfect epitome of the outrage story. And actually, it's true, and it comes down to a simple equation that we're running into now every single day. 
Do you change everything in life to satisfy a tiny, tiny block of people who are only demanding these changes for an exercise in domination? Right? Because you know that changing "cowboy" to "bovine administrator" is not going to improve your life as an activist or a social justice warrior. It's not actually going to do anything to your life.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

So this is about pure attention-seeking behavior. So you're sniffing constantly for some kind of vulnerability where you can say, "Aha! You are an oppressor. You must change now!" And that's what this is about. 
WATTERS: And it's never going to be good enough. 
GUTFELD: Yes, and more people have to be like this college and say, 
 "We're willing to risk the slings and arrows of an angry, tiny percentage of people. Grow up."
By the way, what -- 
DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: It was unanimous. 
GUTFELD: Yes, yes. That means everyone, by the way.

PERINO: Great, well, knock yourselves out. There's lots of colleges.
WILLIAMS: They don't want -- they don't want people coming from other parts of the country to say, "Oh --" 
PERINO: If you're going to go -- if you're applying to the University of Wyoming, I'm pretty sure you know what you're getting.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Oh, no, no, the people that think about this do have huge problems. It's called identity politics, and it's destroying their careers and futures.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
GUTFELD: And they're coming after people who are useful and productive in society. We have to worry about this. 
WILLIAMS: Yes, yes, yes.
GUTFELD: Everybody -- people are losing their jobs --
WILLIAMS: OK.
GUTFELD: -- because they step on the wrong little land mine. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, no, I think the identity politics worry here is the exact opposite, that you can have a broader identity for the cowboy, which is what I think some people here are saying, than simply the Marlboro man. And people wanted to do that. I don't see anything wrong --
PERINO: Monday we'll talk about the Marlboro man.
WILLIAMS: OK. Outrage -- yes, more outrage for you -- after Forbes calls reality TV star Kylie Jenner one of America's richest -- and this is the controversial part -- self-made woman. That's next, for your fun on "The Five." 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BOOTHE: Welcome back. Is this what self-made looks like? Backlash is brewing after the latest Forbes cover, touting reality TV star Kylie Jenner as, quote, "set to be to be the youngest-ever self-made billionaire." Some are crying foul, claiming she's obviously had help from her famous family, the Kardashian-Jenner clan. 
Dictionary.com even got in on it, tweeting, "Self-made means having succeeded in life unaided." And one Twitter user writes, "Calling Kylie Jenner a self- made billionaire is like claiming you made soup from scratch because you opened a can and reheated it." 
All right. Everybody loves a good pull-yourself-up-from-the-boot-straps story. But Greg, is Kylie Jenner self-made?
GUTFELD: I don't know -- I don't know if that's the problem. I think this should be -- the big problem -- the big message here is that she owns what she does. And this is something that I -- you know, everybody should be thinking about when they're young. Even if you're in your 30s or your 40s, you still have four to five decades left on this planet. You should own something. If it doesn't grow, you had the pleasure of owning it. And if it does grow, you can get rich. 
She's aspirational for so many young people to turn your hobby or your love into an occupation because you have the Internet. You can open up a store front. If you have -- if you're interested in a certain product or thing, you can make it your own. And if you don't make any money it's still your hobby. But if you make money, you make money. 
So I think this is -- I think a lot of people are, you know, making fun of her. I think it's kind of -- it's pretty cool. She's majoring -- she majored in herself. She's the CEO of her own person. 
PERINO: Yes.
BOOTHE: And, Dana, so -- OK, so three years, she's made $900 million. 
 That's a lot of money. She owns 100 percent of the business. 
GUTFELD: Exactly. 
BOOTHE: Does not own -- if this criticism fair? 
PERINO: Not necessarily. I think a little bit of it is probably jealousy. And of course -- like, it would be even more impressive if she had been born with zero.
GUTFELD: Right.
PERINO: And her parents never helped her, and she didn't have famous sisters and stuff. 
But I think in today's world, I mean, how many people -- like, my dad helped me find, like, a summer job at a place where I worked in an office, and I worked my way up. How many people that you interview today it's because your friend's daughter really needs a job and then something -- Everybody is helping somebody else out. She just happened to make a lot of money that way. 
BOOTHE: Well, and Jesse, the Fat Jewish -- that's his name -- from Instagram, just so people say that, he's -- he's starting a GoFundMe page to raise the additional $100 million. It's obviously a joke and to get attention, and it's working. 
But, Jesse, what do you make of all this? 
WATTERS: Well, I'm self-made. I mean --
GUTFELD: Yes, you are. 
WATTERS: Think about it. I started as a production assistant here. 
BOOTHE: Yes, actually, that's true.
WATTERS: And now I'm on "The Five." So I didn't have any help from anybody. People tried to keep me down. 
GUTFELD: No. No, no, no. Yes. 
WATTERS: No, listen, she's really attractive, that's the key. She had a sister who got famous for you know what. And then she capitalized on that. She's got a famous name, famous family. She's obviously got business savvy, because these product lines, or the makeup lines, whatever it is, are incredible. And people admire her. 
So I have a lot of respect for her. And, you know, if she wants to share some of that fortune, I'm all here.
GUTFELD: Yes. I could see that pairing.
PERINO: Juan, this is (UNINTELLIGIBLE) for you.
BOOTHE: Juan, I'm sure you follow the Jenner-Kardashian group. What do you think of all of this? 
WILLIAMS: I think it's hilarious. I mean, first of all, maybe you guys can answer a question for me. Why are these people famous other than.
BOOTHE: I don't think you don't want to us to get into that. 
WILLIAMS: I mean, I don't have any idea. But I think that then somebody comes out with anything. It didn't have to be cosmetics. It could have been clothing.
WATTERS: Right.
WILLIAMS: It could have been cars. I don't know. And then everybody sells it on the basis of the name. So to somehow give her credit I don't understand Forbes. Because I read Forbes. I think it's a serious magazine. 
But to say self-made, I think, boy, talk about privileged. That's privileged. That's family wealth connection. And a mom who is an absolute shark when it comes to business. So, I don't -- I mean, I think maybe you should have put the mother on the cover not her. 
PERINO: I'm sure she probably had been.
WATTERS: Good point. 
BOOTHE: Well, and the mom, I guess, made -- has made $17 million already off of the makeup line. 
But you know, Jesse, if someone else's name was on the cover and they used the term "self-made" in the same reference -- 
WATTERS: No, I think whoever said it was jealousy. People want to hate her, because she looks really good on Instagram. I mean, she photographs really well. She's got tons of fans online. And all these young women want to be here and look like her. And she's done really well --
WILLIAMS: That's the bad news. 
WATTERS: -- selling that look.
GUTFELD: No, the good -- this is --
WILLIAMS: That's the bad news.
GUTFELD: -- telling people what to do with -- you don't to have go to college, all right? There are other options in this world. 
WILLIAMS: Yes.
GUTFELD: And social media and the Internet, as bad as they are, is offering opportunities for people to say, "You know what? I'm going to -- I like doing X, so I'm going to concentrate on X. And in fact, I don't need to go to college." I think this is inspirational. 
WILLIAMS: Oh, no, I think it's destructive, if that's the lesson. Because I think the odds still are, in America, get the college degree. 
GUTFELD: Yes, and have tons -- have tons of college debt. The average 21- year-old is in total debt. She could pay off their debt. 
WATTERS: LeBron didn't go to college, and he's worth, what --
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Become a basketball player.
WILLIAMS: You know, can you or I play basketball like LeBron?
WATTERS: No, and we don't look like her. 
PERINO: Lisa, power through. 
BOOTHE: We've got to go. Thank you, Dana, for saying that. 
All right. Up next the segment that you will love, "Fan Mail Friday" on "The Five." Stay tuned.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(POLKA MUSIC)
GUTFELD: Yes, we're going to polka through the summer. I'm back from vacation, tanned, rejuvenated and ready for some "Fan Mail Friday." 
OK. Ooh, this is a good one from @French12871. That's his actual name. Interesting, isn't it, Twitter? "What annoys you the most when you are flying" -- Jesse. 
PERINO: Wow, I have a lot. 
GUTFELD: I know. That's why you're going last. 
WATTERS: I don't like not flying first class. It's hard to go from first class and then go back to coach. You have to admit that's true. 
BOOTHE: Back with the peasants? 
WATTERS: You know, I don't like when people kick the back of my seat. You know, I don't like when the bathroom is occupied and I have to go. I mean, there's a lot I don't like. 
GUTFELD: I know.
WATTERS: It can go on forever. 
GUTFELD: Juan.
WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, just from the start, I don't like the lines. So the security lines, especially, like if it's holiday and you get a lot of people who aren't regular fliers. And they just stand there, like, they want to argue about "Why do I have to take off my jewelry?" 
And you think, "Lady, shut up." 
And then -- but I -- you know, like night I went to the Mets game, and they have a clear line there now. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: You just get in. And I like, I think that people should use it. 
GUTFELD: Yes, but then if more people will use it, then you'd need another clear line. 
WILLIAMS: Right.
PERINO: Clearer. 
GUTFELD: Clear-plus. 
BOOTHE: You know when lines aren't bad? I was at Newark Airport and waiting in line, and Chris Hemsworth was right in front of me in the line, from "Thor."
GUTFELD: Yes.
BOOTHE: Very handsome. And then the line was -- didn't matter. 
GUTFELD: You know what that -- you know what you just told me? You told me that even Chris Hemsworth has to wait in line.
WATTERS: They're just like us.
GUTFELD: They're just like us. 
BOOTHE: Go ahead. I didn't want to take Dana's.
PERINO: OK. I'm going to go with when someone is playing their headphones louder than they should, and you can kind of hear their music but not really? 
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Super annoying.
Anybody who is eating things like sunflower seeds on a plane, absolutely not. That's absolutely bad form. 
And also, the other thing that annoys me -- and some people can't help it -- but the shaking of the leg up and down. 
GUTFELD: That's me. 
PERINO: Because you're trying to read your book or do something. And the only thing you can see out of the corner of your eye is somebody's leg going like this. It dries me insane.
GUTFELD: Thank God it's a leg. They will tell you, know what I hate? I'm going to tell you what I hate; I'm going to tell you what happened to me flying back from vacation. 
One, I don't like people taking off their shoes and socks. 
PERINO: Disgusting. 
GUTFELD: Your feet are the least attractive part of your body. Also, OK, so I get -- I'm going on the plane with my wife, and we're not seated together, but we're seated in the same row. And so, I wait -- I wait for the guy to come and sit next to me and I go, "Hey, do you mind if -- do you mind if" -- I said, "Would you like a window seat so I could sit with my wife?" 
And he said, "No, I'm OK." And he sat down. 
And I look at Elena, and I go, "I'm sorry." And she goes and sits down. 
Then he goes, "Hey, I just want to let you know, huge fan of 'The Five.' I watch the show -- I watch the show every day."
WATTERS: Oh, my God.
GUTFELD: "I love the show." 
And I'm going, "What a great fan." Actually, I kind of respect that. All right. 
BOOTHE: I think the take-away is everyone is really easy to travel with. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: I'm not. I have very high standards. 
WILLIAMS: You know what, though? Let me just throw something out. I thought of something worse, which is when they make you sit on the tarmac for three or four hours. 
GUTFELD: That's awful. That's panicky. That's like being stuck in an elevator, a giant horizontal elevator with 300 strangers with their socks off. 
All right. Facebook question from Michael W.: "Baseball players have walkout music for when they walk out to the plate when they bat. What would your walkout song be when walking on the set?" 
WATTERS: "Boys of Summer." I love that song. God, I love that song.
PERINO: That's your answer to everything. 
GUTFELD: Everything. I know. "Who do you hang out with?" "Boys of Summer." 
BOOTHE: It's nice to have a gander (ph) response.
GUTFELD: All comes down to boys. 
BOOTHE: I would do -- I would steal from the president and do "You Can't Always Get What You Want." I just think it -- I did it, actually, at a conference one time, because I just think it's hilarious that so many people dislike him, and he walks out -- 
WATTERS: I want to change mine. I want mine to be "Hail to the Chief." 
WILLIAMS: While you're in first class? 
GUTFELD: Juan. Juan.
WILLIAMS: I think, like, "Eye of the Tiger," or I like Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative." I just think that's a cool song.
WATTERS: Nice. 
GUTFELD: Terrible person, though. 
PERINO: It just takes me back to when I was in third grade, and Josh Williams asked who high favorite band was, and I said REO Speedwagon, and he made so much fun of me, as if that was not a cool answer. 
GUTFELD: What's his name? 
PERINO: Josh Williams. 
GUTFELD: I bet he's nobody now. And he probably watches you. 
PERINO: He had an AC/DC shirt. 
GUTFELD: Well, then he was probably pretty cool. 
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Maybe he was right. There's no comparison between AC/DC and REO Speedwagon. 
PERINO: I know. He thought I was kind of lame. I don't know.
GUTFELD: Well, now that he runs Goldman Sachs, I guess -- 
PERINO: How about "You've Got to Know When to Hold 'em"? 
GUTFELD: That's a good laundry song. 
I would say coming out, I would do the theme to "Shaft." All right.
Oh, OK, I'll be quick. "What's your funniest blooper," Dana? 
PERINO: Here, when I got bleeped one time, because we were come -- Eric Holder was saying something in a sound bite, and I didn't know we were coming back to air.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: And I was saying something quite derogatory about the comment, and I got caught and I got bleeped. Like somebody else who used to be on this show. Only two people have ever been bleeped on this show. 
GUTFELD: And you're one of them. 
BOOTHE: And you were one of them?
PERINO: Yes. 
WATTERS: This was off camera. I walked into a glass door today, bashed my head. You have to pull the security footage. 
WILLIAMS: But you now, life is full of bloopers if that's a blooper.
GUTFELD: Yes, yes. 
BOOTHE: It's like every day. 
GUTFELD: We meant TV, Juan. What's -- any blooper? 
WILLIAMS: I don't know. I mean, I say stupid things all the time. You know.
PERINO: You know what? Your fans are going to agree with that. 
GUTFELD: Lisa, any mistakes recently? 
BOOTHE: Well, like you try to say something and you forget, and then it's just silence. 
WATTERS: I mean, did you hear her in the A-block?
WILLIAMS: Hey, hey, slow down. She's a guest.
GUTFELD: All right, all right. Mine was when I did a segment on "Red Eye" about circus peanuts. And that's all I'm going to say, because I didn't say it that way. 
"One More Thing," up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: It's time now for "One More Thing." That was like the best commercial break in a long time. 
GUTFELD: That doesn't help people.
PERINO: My "One More Thing" is guess what? It's this.
GUTFELD: Guess what?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MUSIC)
GRAPHIC: Dana's Corny Jokes
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: "Dana's Corny Joke of the Day." I've got to get my ear piece in here. Have you heard about the latest pirate movie? 
BOOTHE: No. 
PERINO: Have you heard about the latest pirate movie?
WATTERS: Rated arrr!
PERINO: Yes. 
BOOTHE: I love that Jesse gets it. 
WATTERS: I never get those.
GUTFELD: Nicely done.
PERINO: What does the dune say to the ocean? What did the dune say to the ocean?
GUTFELD: When are you coming over? 
PERINO: He said, "How you dune?" 
WATTERS: That's good. 
PERINO: Did I do it right? OK, I tried.
What did the fish do during summer break? What did the fish do during summer break? 
GUTFELD: Pick up gills? 
PERINO: Nothing, they're always in school. 
GUTFELD: Oh! 
PERINO: Which letter is the coolest? 
GUTFELD: Now I'm doing the alphabet.
PERINO: Which letter is the coolest? Iced T. 
And my last one: why did I stop searching for shellfish on the beach? Why did I stop searching for shellfish on the beach?
GUTFELD: You got crabby? You got crabs? 
BOOTHE: These are pretty hard.
PERINO: I pulled a mussel. 
WATTERS: That was good.
PERINO: All right, Greg.
GUTFELD: I liked "you got crabs" better. 
BOOTHE: No.
GUTFELD: Never mind. "The Greg Gutfeld Show," Saturday, 10 p.m. I've got Charles Hurt.
PERINO: I love him.
GUTFELD: He's on every single show today. 
PERINO: He's searing seersucker, by the way. 
GUTFELD: Well, not tonight. Joe Mackey -- it's actually tomorrow night, 10 p.m. Kat Timpf, Tyrus, great show. 
Also my book tour starts. My book tour starts, I'll be beginning in August 4 in Texas. I'll be in Texas for a couple of days. I'll be New York, and I'll be in New Jersey. And where else will I be? I'll be in California. But I know you're going to love this, August 25, The Villages. 
PERINO: The Villages! 
GUTFELD: The Villages.
PERINO: Awesome. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: All right. Jesse.
WATTERS: All right. Donald Trump meets the queen. Antifa clashes with ICE. And out-of-control road rage and surveillance video. "Watters' World," 8 p.m. Saturday night. I have the ladies, Diamond and Silk, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Katie Pavlich, and Jillian Mele makes her "Watters' World" debut. Check it out.
PERINO: All right. Juan Williams. 
WILLIAMS: Well, one Arizona woman very lucky to be alive after she became trapped in her car, which plunged into a canal off a highway in Mesa. At first the rescuers in the water attempting to see if anyone is alive in the submerged vehicle. She then indicates no one's survived, but in a flash he sees or feels some movement. He then throws his keys to the shore and dives under the water. 
WATTERS: Oh, my God!
WILLIAMS: The firefighter emerges with the woman in his arms. 
PERINO: Wow.
WILLIAMS: Firefighters pulled the two onto land --
PERINO: Oh, bless her heart.
WILLIAMS: -- and the woman in her 50s gasped for air. She's expected to be OK. 
Man, I've got to tell you, she better thank her lucky stars. That was an amazing rescue. Hats off to the fireman and everybody involved. 
PERINO: All right. Lisa. 
BOOTHE: Very scary.
Well, GOP candidate Katie Arrington is back on the campaign trail. She, of course, got into a terrible car accident where the driver of a vehicle who was intoxicated sadly passed away. She damaged her vertebrae, lost her small intestine, lost her -- or most of her small intestine, lost her right colon, but she's back on the campaign trail. She says, "If anyone does not believe in God, look at me." Also, kudos to the Democratic candidate, who largely stayed off the campaign trail. That was a class act, and it's good to know that there are some classy people in politics.
PERINO: She's tough. And watch out. She's going to be a competitor. 
You have another question? 
GUTFELD: Yes. This is Friday the 13th. What is your biggest superstition, Dana? 
PERINO: Pass, I'm going to come back to it. 
GUTFELD: This isn't a game show? 
WATTERS: I don't walk under ladders. 
GUTFELD: Really? I have to do.
PERINO: That's also for safety. 
GUTFELD: Juan.
WILLIAMS: I guess I pick up pennies. 
GUTFELD: Really? You do?
PERINO: Yes. OK.
BOOTHE: I don't know if it's -- I pray before every show. I don't think that's a superstition. 
PERINO: Wow. Maybe I should try. 
WILLIAMS: You should imagine what I have to do. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable? 
PERINO: Greg, you have something? 
GUTFELD: I don't believe in superstitions. 
PERINO: I say a wish if the clock is at 11:11. 
GUTFELD: I don't like superstitions. I'm very superstitious about that. 
PERINO: I'm not superstitious in any way. Nor sentimental. Really, kind of -- I have no feelings.
GUTFELD: You're a cold person. 
PERINO: That's a fun week. That's it for us. We'll see you on Monday. "Special Report" is up next. Here's a superstitious guy. Just kidding.
