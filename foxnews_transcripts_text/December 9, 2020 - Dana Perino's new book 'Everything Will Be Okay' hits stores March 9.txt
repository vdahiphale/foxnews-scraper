JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters, alongwith Greg Gutfeld, Dana Perino, Geraldo Rivera, and Judge Jeanine Pirro.It's 5:00 in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. An explosive developmentin the Hunter Biden saga, the president-elect's son says his tax affairsare under federal investigation.And according to a brand-new report, the Justice Department paused thisprobe into Hunter's taxes in the months prior to the presidential election.The Biden transition releasing a statement from Hunter that reads in part,quote "I take this matter very seriously, but I am confident that aprofessional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that Ihandled my affairs legally and appropriately.Including with the benefit of professional tax advisors." And the Biden-Harris transition saying President-Elect Biden is deeply proud of his son,who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personalattacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger. All right, JudgeJeanine, let's start with you.This kind of jives with the reporting that we did before the election thatthere was indeed an active investigation into Hunter Biden. Now, Hunter hasconfirmed it. What say you?JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Well, what I say is that this can't possiblybe simply a tax investigation without expanding into some of the moreinternational accumulation of monies that Hunter Biden collected, forexample, when he went to China and got the $1.5 billion from a -- theChinese Communist Party-connected bank, as well as the money that he got inUkraine.And I understand it's Romania and a few other places. So I think that --two things, that it's got to expand beyond just this country, number one.And I think, number two, the idea of a Special Counsel is certainly veryinteresting, because it's going to be very difficult for any United Statesattorney who is working ultimately if Joe Biden, you know, takes thepresidency and the electors decide on December 14 to investigate thepresident's son.And I think also that they can say this has nothing to do with that laptop,but I know full well that tax investigations involve every piece of paperyou have ever touched, every purchase you have ever made, every airlineticket. There is nothing that is out-of-bounds for these investigators. Andit all has to be looked at completely and totally.And this is a guy, you know, to say the believes that everything is inorder, it sounds crazy because he is so out of it. He left his laptop atthe, you know, at a repair facility and forgot it.WATTERS:  Yeah. Geraldo, I would assume that the judge is right. This isn'ta simple turbo tax mistake. Like, he uploaded his taxes onto the internetand didn't carry the one. This is a guy who that's doing dozens ofinternational business deals for decades through wire transfers. I canimagine that there are a lot of things to look at here by federalinvestigators.GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS HOST:  At the very least, Hunter Biden is aparasite who has been sucking the blood off his father's official duties.It's never, as Jeanine -- as Judge Jeanine says very accurately. It isnever just a tax matter. He is a hot mess. Attacks -- probes like this arelike a malignancy. They are a cancer that grows and grows and grows untilit infiltrates every aspect of every shady deal he ever did.It is, to me, ironic that like the Trump administration, the Bidenadministration is beginning under these awful circumstances now. This --the shadow, the dark shadow of his son's troubles will definitely take theluster off a lot of the -- the beginning of the Biden presidency. He is inreal trouble. You know, hearing stories about Chinese business peopleleaving jewels under the pillow in his hotel and other undeclared incomelike that.You know, it's going to be big and bad for Hunter. It's going to embarrassthe president-elect. And this will taint, I think, the beginning of the46th president's term in office. This is a very big deal. I'm glad thefather still loves the son because this son is a screw up. He's been ascrew up his whole life. He's cut corners.He's taken money that he didn't earn from coast-to-coast, from continent tocontinent. And now, it seems the, you know, chicken has come home to roostthere, Jesse. PIRRO:  Indeed.WATTERS:  Yeah. It could be an awkward dinner at the Biden household overChristmas vacation, Greg. How do you think the media is going to begin tocover this new development with Hunter and his father?GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  They won't. You know, it's funny. It's likeHunter is a walking episode of Law and Order. I mean, you've got sex,you've got drugs, you've got strippers, you've got videotape, you've gotmystery people coming in and out. It's amazing, though, how the media findsHunter beneath them, and I mean that figuratively, not literally.Although, it could be possible with Hunter, you never know. Can I say this,though? I will say this for the 5:00 audience. Payback is a pregnant dog,because that's what you're going to see right now. You are going to seepayback in every shape. And, you know what, I'm not a vengeful person. ButMueller spent two years and $32 million chasing something that didn't takeplace.Involving a country whose GDP was roughly that of Texas, right? Russia wasnothing compared to China. China's economy, arguably, is now bigger thanours, and they are ruthless. They have concentration camps going right now.They have got our tech giants. They have got our professional sports teams.They've got entertainers and politicians already defending them.And why is that? It should raise your concerns that China -- China is sohappy that Joe Biden is coming in, and that is not good news for America.When your number one adversary on this planet is ecstatic that you have anew team captain and the new team captain is Joe Biden, that's kind ofscary. So I think that the Judge is right that this isn't really -- thisisn't about taxes.We've got to look into these relationships that Hunter had with China,trying to get about $10 million in exchange for making introductions, whichI assume was Joe Biden, who was the big guy. We're talking -- I mean, thisadministration is already compromised. They're more compromised than apreacher after a four day bender in Vegas with Jesse.WATTERS:  Oh, just threw my name in there like that at the end. I did notsee that coming.GUTFELD:  Yes.WATTERS:  Dana Perino, it does look like China is now going to dog theBiden administration probably worse than Russia, you know, substantively,because it does look like there is a lot more material there. How do youthink Joe Biden will handle something like this? He can't fire theprosecutor, can he?DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST:  Well, actually, I'm curious about that,because every president has the ability to fire the U.S. attorneys. Mostpresidents do fire all the U.S. attorneys, and then you appoint new U.S.attorneys to that position. Now, some U.S. attorneys do stay on. I don't --we don't know enough about this. This investigation apparently started backin 2018, I believe.So it depends on if it was a career public official that was handling this.That's going to be very dicey. And if I were the incoming Bidenadministration, I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole. But Jesse, doyou know who is the most happy person right now about this Hunter Bidennews? Congressman Eric Swalwell.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  Oh, we are going to get to Swalwell in a second.PERINO:  It all leads back to China. But you know, sometimes --(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  But in a way, those, Dana -- yes, I agree. But in a way, thosetwo stories are very connected, because they both involve the same country,the same kind of --(CROSSTALK)PERINO:  Yes. But if you're Eric Swalwell, you would much prefer for, youknow, for the incoming president's son to be the one getting the headlines24 hours after you are getting the headlines.PIRRO:  Jesse, can I say one thing? All the -- most incoming presidentsrequest all of the U.S. attorneys to hand in their resignations. And whatBill Barr tried to do by claiming that Special Counsel for John Durham, Imean, Special Counsel can be dismissed in a second by the sitting attorneygeneral, so don't be confident that this thing will be covered up, either.GUTFELD:  But the media is going to cheer. The media is going to cheer whenhe --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA:  This is different. This is different.  When it's all about notpaying your taxes, at the very least, you are in a big jam.(CROSSTALK)PIRRO:  -- that's supposed to be a big one.WATTERS:  And we are still waiting on that.(CROSSTALK)WATTERS:  More on another explosive story that we just mentioned, asuspected Chinese spy allegedly cozied up to a number of politicians,including California Democratic Congressman, Eric Swalwell.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)RIVERA:  China, China, China. This other blockbuster story rocking CapitolHill, a Democratic member of Congress possibly compromised by a Chinesespy, a woman. Lawmakers demanding answers, Congressman Eric Swalwell, atthe center of what could be a massive scandal for his ties to this Chinesespy. She really worked for their spy agency, targeting him and otherDemocrats.Sometimes using sex to influencing these American politicians. CongressmanSwalwell not only denying any wrongdoing, he's trying to blame PresidentTrump for this story coming out.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA):  The wrongdoing here, Jim, is that at the sametime this story was being leaked out, is the time that I was working onimpeachment on the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. And if thisis a country where people who criticize the president are going to have lawenforcement information weaponized against them.That is not a country that any of us want to live in, and I hope that it isinvestigated who leaked this information.(END VIDEO TAPE)RIVERA (on camera):  Who leaked the information? How about what you did?House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is not buying Swalwell's  explanationof being entrapped. H wants Swalwell well off the House IntelligenceCommittee. So I want to go -- Dana Perino, you are a very nice person.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  These are Chinese spiesthat go down to the level of a mayor. They court and help a city councilcouncil member become a Congressman. This Congressman now gets in the HouseIntel Committee. Why is he still on the Intel Committee? Why is he still amember of Congress Did Adam Schiff know, as chairman of that committee,that he had this problem?(END VIDEO TAPE)RIVERA (on camera):  Ahead, Democrats admit putting politics over people,I'll get right to that. But Dana, here's a quote from Chris Wray, the FBIDirector. China is engaged in a highly sophisticated, malign foreigninfluenced campaign. They are using, you know, Fang-Fang, this woman to --who entrapped, she had sex with a couple of mayors.I never liked fall -- Swalwell, because he's such a smarmy person. But doeshe have any juice when he says that this is all them trying to get himbecause he went after Trump for impeachment?PERINO:  Well, first of all, they had 48 hours to actually, like, come upwith a better excuse than Trump campaign or somebody in the Trumpadministration is leaking this to hurt me. I just, logically, think ifsomebody were going to leak this, they would have done it duringimpeachment, and not only during impeachment but what was happening just afew months before that. Does anyone remember?Eric Swalwell threw his hat in the ring to run for president. And so thisinformation, I would imagine, was going to come out at some point. Like, if-- is he that blind to how this all works, that he thinks that he could runfor president and this information wouldn't come out? Now, whether the --like, for Speaker Pelosi or Adam Schiff.If they knew about this and didn't care and put him on the Intel Committeeinstead of putting him on the Rules Committee or something like that, wheremay be his past wouldn't have come up, that would be one thing. I thinkthat this is just extremely problematic. Again, he's lucky that HunterBiden is taking the headlines right now.But we haven't seen the end of this story, and I don't think that it'sgoing to cut it for him to blame leaks on the Trump administration.RIVERA:  I totally agree with that. Greg, I know how paranoid you are aboutChina but, you know, that doesn't make you wrong. I think China, China,China, they're trying everything, whether it's the honeypot or jewels underthe pillow. They will do anything to get influence. How scary is it, Greg?GUTFELD:  First off, her name is Fang-Fang. That should've tipped you offabout sinking her teeth into you. Although, I think the she's the realvictim if she has to hoop up with Swalwell. But think about this. WhileSwalwell walked (ph) Trump for raising concerns about China, China, heknew, was compromising him. So why did Swalwell do this?Why did Swalwell push the Russian hysteria story? Because he wanted to getit away from him, so he was actually pushing a lot of this stuff. That's myopinion. But now, this is really important. Now, you see why Trump was sodespised by the media, politicians, academia, the tech giants. He stoodbetween them and China.He was the first to call out this threat and he had to go. So this isanother weird thing that Trump was right. He called them out, and he wasdemonized for it early on. People mocked him when he said China, China,China. And again, where are all the Woodward and Bernsteins? They were toobusy cataloging tweets to do their job.We -- this is actually a massive story. You have compromised Americans. Youhave them defending China. And now, you have China ecstatic that Joe is inthe White House. seems to me that would be something good for somebody towin a Pulitzer for, instead of just chasing tweets.RIVERA:  I think you're -- you know -- it's a fanciful notion that thepress will work as hard to investigate the Biden family as they did towreck the Trump family. But Judge Jeanine, you have a situation here withChina, really is this malignancy now. And I have nothing against --obviously, this isn't about Chinese people. This is about the CommunistParty that runs the richest nation on Earth right now, Judge.PIRRO:  Well, you know, the hypocrisy of it all just makes me crazy. Youknow, Eric Swalwell, who's is complaining about Donald Trump and all this,that Trump is a Russian asset and a Putin puppet, he gets a warning. Hegets the FBI to tell him, look, Fang-Fang, Feng-Feng, whatever her name is,you know, she is part of a communist Chinese intelligence group.The president, they try to impeach him. You know, the president's kids getinvestigated. I want Swalwell investigated. I want to know what he said.What did she tell him? And I don't want him to get away with some stupidanswer, like, I can't engage in this story right now because it may involveclassified information, hogwash.The Trump's were put through hell for four years. This is real. The Russiacollusion delusion was a delusion. China with the culture centers wasinfiltrating people in this country, they are a danger to this country, asHunter, and they accessed people with egos like Swalwell who think he canbe the president of the United States.That's who they are giving money to. And that's who they are playing withor were sleeping with, whatever.RIVERA:  Whatever. Jesse, what about him being the real Manchuriancandidate?WATTERS:  Yeah, I don't buy that. I don't think he is a Chinese agent. Ijust think he's a fool. I mean, the guy had a Chinese spy put an interninto his congressional office. Do you know the things you can access at acongressional office? I interned with Joe Lieberman in college. I hadaccess to lots of stuff I shouldn't have had access to, God knows what theyfound.But I'm going to be fair to him and a little respect. But when someonesays, did you sleep with a spy, and your answer is it's classified. Youprobably slept with the spy. Maybe he's a little shaky because the spyslept with a couple other politicians, but it's humiliating. And the factthat they put a compromised guy open to blackmail on the House IntelCommittee.Could you imagine if Devin Nunes was sleeping with a Russian spy and theGOP knew about it and had him running House Intel? That's crazy. The onlything I don't understand is, and Judge hit on this perfectly, how come theFBI didn't frame Swalwell for colluding with the Chinese? How come --(CROSSTALK)RIVERA:  I want to see what his dossier -- what does his dossier look like,a real dossier. You know, they made that Russia thing last for three and ahalf years and tried to destroy Trump. Now, they have this, this isgigantic. Democrats admit that they put politics over people, holding upthe stimulus aid while Americans were suffering. Greg's got a scathingmonologue, we are told, right after this. Don't miss it.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD:  First, she spilled the beans.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)NANCY PELOSI, HOUSE SPEAKER:  This is -- has simplicity. It's what we'vehad in our bills, but that's OK now because we have a new president.(END VIDEO TAPE)GUTFELD (on camera):  Then Bernie backed it up.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  The Democrats walked away from that bill because they wanted to$.2 trillion, and they walked away from $1.8 trillion. Was that a mistake? UNKNOWN:  That's what I'm saying.(END VIDEO TAPE)GUTFELD (on camera):  Now, this Dick.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNKNOWN:  there was some exuberance involved because an election coming,and they were both betting one another in trying to find some commonground. They didn't reach that point, but to return to those pre-electiondays and sentiments, political sentiments, is very difficult.(END VIDEO TAPE)GUTFELD (on camera):  That's Dick Durbin. So the party of rich libs admitsthey turned down massive COVID relief that would help you because anelection was near. They knew if it kept Americans in pain, that wouldTrump, and therefore help Biden. And they try to throw the scent off byaccusing Trump of the very same sins that they were committing.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)PELOSI:  You're in a full-blown economic and health catastrophe. And it'samazing to see the patience the GOP has for other people's suffering.UNKNOWN:  Our efforts to pass another emergency relief bill through theSenate have been stalled until now for one reason, the Republican leaderhas refused to compromise.PELOSI:  Every single one of those deaths is important to us. We carrythose people in our hearts, and they should be carrying them on theirconscience.(END VIDEO TAPE)GUTFELD (on camera):  Ghouls. It was them who actually hurt you to helpthemselves. Just like any toxic ideology, it's politics before people.Because if you want an omelette, sometimes you've got to break a few eggs,except those eggs are actually people. It's evil, but it's a pattern amongleftists. I mean, first, they lied about lawlessness to help their cause.Remember these bozos?(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Democratic cities are in chaos right now. Is thiswhat you want from Joe Biden? And they're going to take your country awayand they're taking down the statues --CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Crime is rising, they're going to defund police.LEMON: Crime is rising. Oh, my gosh.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Then they routed against the vaccine undermining trust to helptheir cause.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: I trust vaccines, I trustthe scientists, but I don't trust Donald Trump.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE-PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: The doctors tellus that we should take it. I'll be the first in line to take it.Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us I should take it -- that we shouldtake it, I'm not taking it.GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): The Trump administration is rolling out thevaccination plan and I believe it's flawed.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: In some, they sacrifice lawn order, then undermine scientificefforts during a pandemic, and now delayed urgent help all for politics.People died, lives destroyed, homes wrecked so the political could complainabout the least political man on earth. The Press played sidekick pushinglies to help the Democrats stall relief. And now in December, you see wasjust another media hoax.The media didn't mind. They weren't losing their jobs. One smart mantweeted this contrast. Trump got impeached for allegedly withholdingUkraine aid for political reasons. The Dems withheld Coronavirus aid forAmerican citizens for political reasons. One fake tail captured the pressesthe virus spread; the other real crime deliberately ignored until it's toolate.It makes you wonder how much of your suffering the left could be cool withjust to win. Remember how happy CNN was about the new guy?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LEMON: It was very normal, very safe, very sedate, and it was welcomingnews. It was good to watch.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: It's amazing what the media will do to you for a full belly and alittle peace of mind. So, Judge, it's interesting to me how matter of factevery Democrat is about this. You know, oh yes, we stalled because they'rehaving that -- they're not even bothering to hide it.PIRRO: Right. Well, they don't have to hide it because their plan is soall-encompassing that they've got the answers to everything. They all talkin lockstep. They all agree with each other. They circle the wagons. Andthere's nothing that we can do, including talking about the truth like youdefund the police and crime goes up, you know, or if you don't givestimulus money or COVID money, you know, people are going to die. But youknow, they'll blame republicans anyway.I mean, the sad part about all this is when the media is connected to thelying left, then we've got a message out there that kind of permeateseveryone, especially the low, you know, low depth voter. And as far as I'mconcerned, it's disgusting. And that's why 74 million people voted forDonald Trump.And you know, you tell me 80 million people voted for Joe Biden. I mean,people know what's going on. No cities are burning right now. There's noBlack Lives Matter protests out there right now. You know who did that.They did it in a way to threaten you. They extorted you. If you don't giveus power, we won't give you peace. Now, we gave them power and they'rehappy.GUTFELD: So, Geraldo has President Trump called you yet? Is he still nottalking to you?RIVERA: Let me just -- in a very, very serious note, at the end of thismonth on the 31st, the expanded support for jobless ends, the nationwideeviction ban expires, and the emergency paid sick leave -- sick leave --emergency paid sick leave also expires.The people, the working people of this country are in financial peril. Andwhen you look at why this was done, why this happened, why Nancy Pelositurned down $1.8 trillion. And now she's begging for half of that, lessthan half of that? I think that this is really a story of monumentalproportions, Greg.GUTFELD: I agree. You know, Dana, I remember during this whole battle, youwere -- you weren't screaming, but you were pointing out who was doing thestalling. Every time people were trying to blame the Republicans, you'regoing no, no, no, it's this, it's this, it's this, and nobody -- no one inthe media listened.PERINO: And yesterday, Mitch McConnell actually gave up a huge thing.Remember, Greg, initially and you and I talked about this, that he wantedliability protections for small businesses so that they could keep open andkeep, you know, paying their employees and not be ruined by frivolouslawsuits.But the Democrats absolutely said no way. The trial lawyers, they love thatstuff. And then on the Democratic side, they really want state local moneyregardless of, you know, need. But McConnell said yesterday was, tell youwhat, strip up all that out. Both state and local money, strip outliability protection. Let's just get money directly to the people who needit. So, we called their bluff and guess what happened? They're like, ohyes, no. We're not for that. We can't do that.I thought your monologue should be played on a loop at a place like at thefood pantry lines, where you have people who have never had to ask forcharity in their lives. And now they have to be in a line waiting to see ifthey can get some help. And they can't worry about politics. They don'thave time for that. Their lives are too busy trying to figure out a way tosurvive. We have to do better than this. And Congress should not go homewithout getting this done.GUTFELD: Yes. You know, Jesse, you still have the media claiming Trumpkilled thousands and that he has blood on his hands. While all this wasgoing on, they get a free -- they get a free pass.WATTERS: Yes. Like your friend, Scott Adams, Greg. I too remember whenwithholding aid for political purposes was an impeachable offense. So, ifit's a high crime in Ukraine, then it's a higher crime in the United Statesof America. Where's the media by the way?Do you remember the debt ceiling situation? John Boehner was called aterrorist because people couldn't go camping in a national park. Now, theycan't leave their house. They can't go out to eat. They can't cross statelines. And they call Nancy Pelosi brilliant. The cornerstone of theDemocrat political philosophy is paying people not to work only during apandemic. Does that make any sense?So, the one time when we should be doing that, the only reason theDemocrats didn't do it was because Donald Trump agreed with it. So, rightnow I am taking their compassion card that they play, and I'm taking itback, and I'm putting it in our deck because we care.GUTFELD: Yes, especially you, Jesse. No one cares as much as you do.WATTERS: I do.GUTFELD: Yes. All right, coming up next, pressure building Joe Biden tobuild the most progressive cabinet ever. Why his problems with the far-leftjust got worse?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PIRRO: Joe Biden causing even more controversy with his Cabinet picks. Hisnominee for Defense Secretary Retired General Lloyd Austin is facingopposition from both sides of the political aisle. And that comes as thefar-left attempts to twist Biden's arm to have the most progressive cabinetever.All right, let me start with you, Greg. Does the fact that the socialistsare really ramping up the criticism? I mean, this Lloyd Austin would be thenation's first Black Secretary of Defense. Is Biden focusing more ondiversity or qualifications?GUTFELD: He'll do anything the loudest voice tells him to do. What'shilarious about progressivism is that the selling point of progressivism iswe're not that progressive, right. It's like selling left-wing ideas is howa waiter sells fish at a restaurant. Oh, you'll love it. It doesn't smellor taste fishy at all. That's exactly how -- you know -- you know yourideology sucks when you're telling people, oh, it's not really like that atall. Defunding the police isn't really defending the police, even though itkind of is.PIRRO: OK. All right, got it. All right, Jesse. Does being Black make itimpossible for people to vote against Lloyd Austin?WATTERS: Judge, I don't see color. You know, that's why race isn't an issuefor me. I look at the content of the character most importantly. ButGeneral Austin, I mean, he'd totally wrap me into a pretzel, so I'm notgoing to say anything bad. But in all seriousness, he oversaw the Mideastfrom 2010 to 2016. Not a great stretch there. That would be like coachingthe Jets for the last six years and asking for a contract extension. Sorry,we're going to look elsewhere.Instead of you know, looking at voting blocs who he should reward forhelping him get elected, I have a few nominees who I think played aninstrumental role. Maybe he could nominate these people for a cabinet post.How about Jack Dorsey? Well, how about Jeff Zucker? How about the AttorneyGeneral of Pennsylvania? I think those people played a pretty critical roleand should be richly rewarded for what they did to help Joe.PIRRO: All right, Geraldo, what say you to that?RIVERA: Lloyd Austin is a -- is a good soldier with a good reputation. TheGIs that I've spoken to liked him very much. He did oversee, you know, allof Afghanistan as commander of CENTCOM. He commanded -- the first black manto command a fighting division and in combat. That counts. You know, themilitary is almost half people of color. It's about time.He's the first and I think that that's a big, big plus. And to blameGeneral Austin for what happened with ISIS, you know, I think that thatreally is scapegoating in the -- in a grotesque way.GUTFELD: So, who do you blame?PIRRO: All right, Dana, what do you think about the comment that ISISwasn't that big a deal?RIVERA: Who, me? I think that -- oh, I'm sorry.PERINO: Well, obviously, it was. It was the first thing that General Mattisdid -- General Mattis, the first order of business was helping PresidentTrump defeat ISIS. I also think that Javier Becerra from California as HHSSecretary is becoming a big issue even down in Georgia for these runoffelections because socialized medicine doesn't go over so well down there.PIRRO: All right, everybody, we did it. And the "FASTEST SEVEN" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: Welcome back. Time for a little fun, and we deserve some fun,right? So, sorry, guys, but this is backed up by science. A new study findswomen are better at multitasking than men. Judge, how is this news? Didn'twe all know this?PIRRO: We all knew that. That's why women -- that's why women have beenable to have kids run the house, cook the meals, and go to work, and thentake care of the kids, wash them, put them to bed, and the men just comehome and put their feet up. I mean, we all know that.But look, in this test, honestly, in this test they showed -- they showedall the women are able to not just go on a treadmill that these infraredcameras on them, but then they would ask them these tricky language tests,and all the women were -- beat the men, all of them except that the womanwas over 60.And the men were like (INAUDIBLE). They couldn't do the tricky languagetests while they were on the treadmill and it's no shock. Thank you, Dana.PERINO: No shock. Geraldo, do you want to agree or disagree?RIVERA: Oh, no, I totally agree. You know, I have three daughters and mywife, they are -- they're like volcanoes -- not volcanoes. They're liketornadoes, swirling energy, constantly doing this and doing that, you know,have this screen open, that screen open on the phone, going someplace. Youknow, it's a -- it's breathtaking. I admire it. I salute it. It's not me. Ilove when I can just focus on one thing, but I love them.PERINO: So, you want to make sure Erica is not angry at you tonight forsure. That's what we have figured out here. Greg, do you want to debunkthis study?GUTFELD: Yes, I want to bunk it and I also want to throw up. Look, OK,first of all, imagine if the -- imagine if the -- no, listened to mebecause you will understand this. Imagine if the findings were reversed,that men are better at multitasking. You can't imagine it because thosefindings would not be released, right? They would never publish them.And if they didn't publish them, do you think a show like THE FIVE or anyshow would actually cover it? No, because then you can't do this "Didn't weall know this? Of course, women are better than that." All right. So, let'sassume -- let's assume that these findings are true. You want the reality,the reason why it's true? You're going to have to look at evolutionarybiology.The fact that childbearing and rearing creates multitasking talent, so theyare the gatherer in the hunter and gatherer. Meanwhile, the man has to besingularly focused on one thing, which is finding food through hunting andthen protecting that bounty from other people, right? So, they had -- theycannot multitask. They can only do one thing, whereas women have to doother things.So, you can have this evolutionary biology origin behind this which isgoing to make it all even more sexist for the modern PC culture.PERINO: Jesse, I'll give you the final word.WATTERS: Well, I was going to ask you to virtually hold my hand, Dana, butGreg already said exactly what I was going to say. It was that the men areso focused on killing the woolly mammoth with a spear and the women areback in the village doing what Jeanine said, the cooking, the cleaning, andthe child raising. That's evolutionary biology.PERINO: Well, I think that we solved everything as we always do on THEFIVE. "ONE MORE THING" is up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: Before we get to "ONE MORE THING," more breaking news on HunterBiden. A source tells Fox News that Hunter Biden is a subject or target ofa grand jury investigation, but the President-Elect Joe Biden is not asubject of any grand jury investigation at this time. Dana Perino will leadus off.PERINO: All right, "ONE MORE THING" it is. OK, so it's been a few years,but I'm excited to announce it. I have a new book coming out on March 9th,and it is called Everything Will Be OK: Life Lessons for Young Women from aFormer Young Woman, which is me. I would be the former young woman.It's career life advice, everything all in one. My goal is to hopefully,hopefully, lower the anxiety level of people and give them a little bit ofa push. It's kind of tough as well. It demands personal responsibility andgood decision making. So, I'm excited about that. It comes up March 9th.And tonight at 6:30 p.m. Eastern, I'll do a Q&A on my Facebook page to tellyou a little bit more about it. So, I hope you'll check it out.WATTERS: All right, so the book is just for women. Guys are not allowed toread this book. We should not even open the book at all.PERINO: Actually, Peter -- actually, Peter thinks that every guy shouldread this book so that he can understand that he will never reallyunderstand women.WATTERS: OK, because we're not good at multitasking either, so we can onlyread the book. We can't do anything else while we read the book.PERINO: You can read the book while you're on the subway.WATTERS: OK, I don't take that anymore. Trust me. Before we get started,congratulations to Pete Hegseth whose new book Modern Warrior is now on thetop 10 of The New York Times bestseller list for the second week in a row.Congrats, Pete. Number eight in print sales, number seven in combined printand ebook sales. Way to go.Now, we have Jesse's Robot News. Very good. Look at those little robots.All right, so we know Jordan is the best basketball player of all time.Now, he's the greatest golf course owner. Look what they dial up instead ofthe golf cart girl.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a drone bringing our drinks. You got to bekidding me.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: So, they're not having people drive around and give you drinksbecause of the Coronavirus. So, they'll just drone you a case of beer outin the course. That is the greatest idea he has ever had. And he's had alot of good ideas. Greg Gutfeld, who also has some good ideas, you are upnow.GUTFELD: Well, actually, you know what, I want to throw an audible here. Ihave -- I just wanted to announce that I also have a new book. It's calledEverything Sucks And Will Not Get Better. And it is not for women, but it'salso not for men either. It's for non-binary woodland nymphs, which is avery small target audience, but they are big Gutfeld fans.But I want to say congratulations to Dana. The book cover looks beautiful.I don't understand why you would put a former young woman in your -- inyour deck because you're young at heart, which is what they say to reallyold people.WATTERS: What a beautiful endorsement. Geraldo, you're up.RIVERA: Dana is one of the most impressive and pleasant people I know. I'msure the book is great. This month marks nine years since the last convoy.I was honored to be on the last convoy leaving Iraq driving into Kuwait. Itwas a tumultuous time. We were deployed where we were assigned 11 times toIraq 11 more to Afghanistan. Anyway, it's --WATTERS: Thank God you survived that convoy.RIVERA: I can't believe it. It's so long ago, nine years ago.WATTERS: And thank God you survived the show. Thank you, Geraldo.RIVERA: Yes. This is --WATTERS: Sorry Jeanine.PIRRO: Bye.WATTERS: "SPECIAL REPORT" is up next with Bret.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
