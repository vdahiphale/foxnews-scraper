Will the U.S. policy on China change? And what's at stake?Joining me right now is the director of national intelligence, JohnRatcliffe.Director, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for beinghere.JOHN RATCLIFFE, U.S. DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  Hi, Maria. Goodmorning.BARTIROMO:  You wrote an incredible op-ed in The Wall Street Journal thisweek that we are going to get to.But let's start with the COVID threat and what took place in 2020 as aresult of China unleashing this virus on the world, causing change for theelection in 2020 for America. What happened?RATCLIFFE:  Well, Maria, you talked about the op-ed earlier this week inThe Wall Street Journal. It really was more of an intelligence piece. Itwas an intelligence briefing to the American people about our greatestnational security threat, China, how they're threatening us economically,militarily, technologically.And you just highlighted one of the ways that shows how China is a threat.And that's this COVID-19 pandemic that the Chinese Communist Party, whenthey knew about its transmissibility, allowed it to go from China to therest of the world.They intentionally and deliberately downplayed it in their country,pressured World Health Organizations, and allowed it to spread to the restof the world. And that didn't just have the effect of wrecking the globaleconomy. It didn't just have the effect of killing millions of people,including hundreds of thousands of Americans. It also had grave politicalconsequences.Here in the United States, the pandemic influenced a lot about how peoplevoted, but also how they had to vote. As a result of the pandemic, we sawstate legislatures as little as 90 days before the election adopting newvoting procedures. Essentially, we had universal mail-in balloting acrossthis country in a way that we hadn't seen before.And to that point, almost 73 percent of the American people this year votedbefore Election Day, a good percentage of those by mail. That's about an 80percent increase over anything we have ever seen before.So, it's little wonder that we see what's happening around the country as aresult of that, with mail-in balloting and all of the questions and thequestions that are being raised in lawsuits and by everyday Americans aboutwhat happened in the election.BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, it's interesting, because, when you put the Chinaimpact on one side, and then you put the Democrat impact on the other side,it's pretty extraordinary, because, when Nancy Pelosi first won themajority in 2019, her HR-1, her number one issue -- she talked a lot abouthealth care.She talked a lot about income in equality, a lot about a lot of things,but, actually, her priority number one, HR-1, was election reform. And thatincluded wanting mail-in ballots, wanting voting early, all of these thingsthat actually took place.I just -- I just throw that out. I know that's not why you're here to talkthis morning.RATCLIFFE:  But the pandemic created the opportunity to do those types ofthings.And what you saw was lawmakers in states across the country adjusting tothe pandemic, saying, we have to vote differently in this country becauseof the pandemic. And we saw that. And, as a result, it's little wonder,when you have procedures adopted as little as 90 days before the election,that there's so much question and controversy.BARTIROMO:  Yes. I want to ask you...RATCLIFFE:  And, again, the result of China and the pandemic.BARTIROMO:  You see more intelligence than anybody, have access to moreintelligence than anybody except the president.So, I want to get your take on the intelligence around this election,before we go deeper into China.Chris Krebs, the former director of cybersecurity and infrastructuresecurity, director, said that this was the most secure election ever.Meanwhile, we see massive videos of witness testimony, of ballots beingtaken out of suitcases, of ballots being put in the machine multiple times.What is your reaction to what the former CISA director said oncybersecurity?RATCLIFFE:  Well, I don't know how you can compare this election to anyother, because it's unlike any election we have ever had and hopefully willnever have again.Republicans and Democrats agreed a long time ago that universal mail-inballoting was a bad idea. A lot of people think we had to do it because ofthe pandemic, but we have seen the results of this.Now, I think one of the things that we did well this election wasaddressing problems from foreign interference, influence campaigns fromother countries that we saw in 2016.But people need to understand that's different than election fraud issues,the things that you're talking about, Maria, things like postal driverssaying they took 200,000-plus ballots from New York to Pennsylvania, tensof thousands of ballots supposedly mailed in, but no folds or creases inthem, more votes than ballots issued in places.These -- people pulling out suitcases and video evidence of that, withquestionable explanations for that. Those are issues of election fraud thatneed to be investigated. And there's a lot of them. And it's not just oneperson or one group of people. It's across the country.And it's little wonder, because we have procedures that we haven't hadbefore. And so this is what the court system is for. This is why thesequestions are being raised. And, again, I hope we don't have an electionwhere we have to utilize these procedures that everyone has agreed are notsecure.BARTIROMO:  So, I mean, do we know if there was any foreign interference inthis election? I know that you have said in the past you don't haveevidence of any state-run campaign, but does that mean that there was noforeign election interference?And, by the way, you just said these answers can be -- can happen prettyquickly. Yes, what about those four people pulling suitcases out fromunderneath the table in Georgia? Has the FBI questioned those people? Imean, this is how we're going to get an answer, right? Do you know of anFBI investigation taking place right now?RATCLIFFE:  Well, first, again, when we talk about election security, youhave to understand that, from the intelligence community perspective, wedid identify foreign efforts to interfere or influence the elections.We see social media campaigns. I think we did a good job of identifyingthose people. Remember, I held a press conference to warn the Americanpeople. That served the deterrent effect that we wanted it to.But, again, that's different than election fraud, which is a domestic lawenforcement issue. And to your point, Maria, that's something that is thesoul jurisdiction of the FBI, the Department of Justice, with theDepartment of Homeland Security.To answer your question, I assume that the FBI is being looking at all ofthose things. The answers to a lot of these questions, we should be able toget them pretty quickly. Bring in the people that are on those videos.Bring in the postal truck driver. Bring in poll watchers and workers andask if all of these irregularities and aberrations and all of thesequestions about fraud -- we ought to be able to get answers to those.And I would hope that the leadership at the FBI and at the Department ofJustice would speak to those things directly to the American people,because there is a lack of confidence out there. There are a lot of peoplein this country that don't think that the votes were counted fairly, thatthe processes at the state and local level weren't administered fairly. Andthey deserve that accounting.BARTIROMO:  So, does anybody think that the FBI will bring anybody intoquestion?You did an investigation, a darn good one, throughout 2017 and 2018 aboutwhat the FBI and the CIA did to take down candidate Trump and worked withHillary Clinton. Does anybody believe the FBI is actually going to bringthese people in to question them to find out what they were doing with thesuitcases and ballots? Do you think so?RATCLIFFE:  Well, I mean, I guess, respectfully, I can only do one job at atime. And, as director of national intelligence, that's not my role andresponsibility.I have great confidence in our law enforcement authorities. I really do.But I think they -- to the extent that they are doing the things that theyare supposed to be doing, they ought to provide some, I think, morevisibility to the American people about that, because there are so manyquestions.And folks like you, Maria, that don't see that that's happening, theydeserve an explanation to know that those types of investigations aretaking place.BARTIROMO:  Yes.All right, you know what, Director? I want to take a short break.I want to go deeper into the China threat. Also want to get your take onhow China is trying to bribe and blackmail U.S. lawmakers, and then getyour take on a potential incoming new administration and whether or notthey recognize the threat of China, all that as we continue on "SundayMorning Futures" with Director John Ratcliffe.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.We're back with the director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe.And, Director, you wrote an incredible op-ed this week in The Wall StreetJournal detailing China and why China can actually potentially takeaway theAmerican dream.I know they have been stealing intellectual property for decades. Walkthrough some of the things that China is doing right now, Director.RATCLIFFE:  Yes, again, Maria that, again, was not an opinion piece.It's really -- it's what the intelligence shows. And I guess what I wouldsay to folks is, the election is over. People have voted. Let's all behonest about China, because there was a lot of politicizing ofintelligence, people saying that Russia was a greater national securitythreat.Listen, Russia is a threat. They are to be taken seriously. They have thelargest nuclear weapon stockpile from the Soviet era still left over. Butwhen you look at the top 10 economies in the world, the United States isnumber one. China is number two. Russia is not on the list. Italy, Braziland the state of Texas all have larger economies than Russia.So, China, and China alone, is the greatest national security threat thatwe face. And we see them growing their military. We see them economically,as you talk about, stealing through intellectual property, stealing throughcyber-warfare, stealing from our universities, stealing medical research,all to gain information, which they know is what you need to dominatetechnologically.So, China is not a good actor internationally. We need to call them out forwhat they are, not what they pretend to be.And, again, going back to COVID, it's a perfect example of showing they'renot a good international actor. They're intent on dominating the entireworld, not just the United States. And the intelligence tells us that.BARTIROMO:  And, you know...RATCLIFFE:  So, from my unique vantage point, I want to make sure that theAmerican people are warned about this threat, because it's clear.BARTIROMO:  One thing that really struck me is that U.S. intelligence showsthat China has conducted human testing on military power.The U.S. intelligence shows that China's conducting human testing onmembers of the People's Liberation Army, in hopes of developing soldierswith biologically enhanced capabilities. There are just no ethicalboundaries to this.In other words, they want to create new humans that can handle extremeweather, handle chemical attacks. Is that right?RATCLIFFE:  So, one of the things I did in this piece was to work hard totry and get information declassified to a level that I could talk about.And one of the things you just mentioned, it's called gene editing. It'saltering DNA. And it's one of the things our intelligence shows that Chinais doing. They have got a -- the PRC, the People's Republic of China, hastwo million strong in its military. And it's trying to make them strongerthrough gene editing.And that's just one of the ways that China is trying to essentiallydominate the planet and set the rules and the world order. And why it's soimportant and people need to understand is, this is an authoritarianregime. It doesn't care about people's individual rights. We have seen whatthey have done to the Uyghurs. We have seen what they have done in HongKong.It's about putting the state first. And that is the exact opposite of whathas always made America great. Individual liberties, freedoms, freeenterprise, those things are all at stake if China dominates.BARTIROMO:  In fact, Jimmy Lai, who is a media tycoon, is now sitting injail, because China took him in, detained him. And now the word is, he'sgoing to be there until his trial, April 2021.We had him on "Mornings With Maria" over at FOX Business last week. Andit's really a disgusting story, what's happening to Jimmy Lai.But I want to get your take on Joe Biden naming a Cabinet and expectingthat he is going to have a national security team. And here are his Obamaera picks. And I want your take on whether or not they agree with you andunderstand the threat.We have got Jake Sullivan for NSA. He sent classified e-mails to HillaryClinton's server. He hyped the Russiagate hoax, co-authored the essaycalling China an essential U.S. partner.Antony Blinken for secretary of state, named in Senator Johnson's report,was in contact with Hunter Biden and his Burisma Holdings colleagues in theUkraine impeachment drama.Alejandro Mayorkas for DHS found to have sold green cards to Chinesenationals on behalf of Democratic donors. And then there's Neera Tanden forbudget director. She played a role in promoting the debunked Trump-Russiaclaims and the dossier. And, of course, Avril Haines, who wants your job asDNI, is the former deputy of John Brennan and Susan Rice, who were deeplyinvolved, we understand, John Brennan was, in the Russia hoax.So, does a potential incoming Biden administration agree with this aboutChina, and will they change policy?RATCLIFFE:  Well, these election issues, we will see who is in what seatsand whether there is a Biden administration.But the point of what I have done here and how I have addressed this andwhy it's different for a director of national intelligence to take thisapproach is, I want to make sure that the American people are clear on thethreats, so that they can hold -- whoever holds these important nationalsecurity positions is held accountable, so that the things that the Trumpadministration has done so successfully that is different than any otheradministration has done before, sanctions against China, tariffs relatingto China, holding them accountable on the world stage, calling outcompanies like Huawei and ZTE that are veneers for the Chinese CommunistParty in a way that they can obtain information.All of those things are holding China accountable for who they really are,and letting the world know who China really is. That has to continue,regardless of who holds these very important national security positions.BARTIROMO:  Yes.RATCLIFFE:  And that's why I'm going about this the way that I am.BARTIROMO:  The Trump administration has been tough on China, there's nodoubt, whether it's sanctions, tariffs, prosecutions, a string ofindictments this year.I want to take a break and then get your take on what the Chinese CommunistParty is doing to Congress, blackmail and bribery.Then we will talk about Bill Barr and a Senate about-face. After 19 months,we still haven't heard from John Durham.We will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Well, welcome back.I'm back with the director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe.And, Director, you have said that the Chinese Communist Party is trying touse blackmail, covert influence to target members of Congress. Can you tellus more?RATCLIFFE:  I can.So, one of the things I worked hard to get at a declassified level to beable to talk about was some of the information that I see every morning asthe director of national intelligence. I look at threat streams.And one of the things I look at is what the called Gates information, orGates Procedures. And it's intelligence that we have where foreign actorsand states are targeting members of Congress to influence them, throughblackmail on derogatory information or through bribery, for overt andcovert influence.And, as I looked at it, it was so overwhelming related to China that I hada look at the numbers. And what we have learned is that China engages inthat activity at a level six times greater than Russia, 12 times greaterthan Iran. It's a massive influence campaign.And, really, what it's intended to do, Maria, is to influence members ofCongress to make sure that they're passing laws that are favorable forChina and not passing laws that are anti-China. And they have beensuccessful.So, I briefed members of Congress on this. It was so disturbing that I madea special trip to Capitol Hill to make sure that they're aware of thatinformation. And now I'm making the American people aware of thatinformation.BARTIROMO:  Well, is that why we hear Senator Dianne Feinstein praisingChina as a respectable nation? Is that why we see Joe Lieberman now alobbyist for ZTE, former Congressman Ed Royce, formerly an outspoken criticof Vietnam's Communist Party, now lobbying for Tencent?Do these folks not understand that China is trying to replace the UnitedStates as the number one superpower, sir? Real quick, because I want to geton to the next subject.RATCLIFFE:  Well, I think what we see is why China does so well under U.S.laws is because U.S. laws have been influenced by the actions that theyhave taken.And the American people need to be aware of that and hold their electedleaders accountable with regard to legislation that would impact China.BARTIROMO:  Well, let me move on.Speaking of threats and bullying, who got to Bill Barr? I have got to askyou your thoughts on where we are here with A.G. Bill Barr and John Durham.It seems like it's an about-face. We were expecting a real investigationinto what took place and why Crossfire Hurricane, the investigation intoDonald Trump, still has no accountability.Can you give us some sunlight on that?RATCLIFFE:  Well, from my position in the intelligence community, one ofthe things that -- you know, Maria, that I spent a lot of time on thisissue as a member of Congress before I game the DNI.But one of the things I wanted to look at was, from the intelligencecommunity perspective, was there any intelligence at all, anything tosupport the opening of Crossfire Hurricane?And from the position that I'm in now, I'm able to tell everyoneunequivocally there wasn't. And you don't have to take my word for it. Theother officials from the Obama/Biden administration have said so as well.One of my predecessors, James Clapper, has admitted that he never sawintelligence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. I declassifieddocuments to show that not only that was the case, but that also there wasintelligence that showed those Trump-Russia collusion allegations werecreated by the Democratic Party, particularly the Hillary Clinton campaign.And that's kind of where the trail goes cold. So, you know, thatinformation was properly sent, I will say, by the intelligence community. Ideclassified the counterintelligence investigational -- or operational leadsent to Jim Comey and Peter Strzok at the FBI to look into thoseallegations.But those are documents that are the providence of the Department ofJustice and the FBI. And that's what John Durham is looking at. I thought,like you, Maria, that there was going to be an interim report before theelection. I think that there should have been.But the election is over, so it's not political anymore. I think theAmerican people should know what's happening in a two-year investigationinto this. And I hope that that report will be forthcoming.I will say this, Maria. The special counsel obligations, whether JohnDurham is a U.S. attorney, special U.S. attorney or special counsel, it's amatter of semantics. The American people deserve a full accounting. But thespecial counsel regulations not only require a final report. They allow forinterim reports.So I'd like to see an interim report that talks about this, from the angleof someone that has not only the intelligence community documents that Ihave, but the law enforcement documents that show there was no properpredicate for Crossfire Hurricane, because there certainly wasn't any givenby the intelligence community to the FBI before this illegal spying began.And, by the way, it is illegal spying. The current FBI director hasadmitted that.BARTIROMO:  If he doesn't come out with a report to indicate what tookplace, will a potential Biden administration shut him down? Will JohnDurham get shut down?RATCLIFFE:  Well, they have indicated that they plan to do that, or somehave. Chairman Schiff has indicated he thinks that the Durham investigationshould end, which is exactly why an interim report would be appropriate.It would show whether or not there's a good-faith basis to continue. Itwould protect the work that's been done. So, I would encourage mycolleagues over at the Department of Justice and at the FBI and, inparticular, now special counsel Durham to consider doing that, so that theAmerican people can get the full accounting that they deserve.Look, it's not a question anymore whether or not there was illegal spying.This idea that there was -- it was -- that there was not FISA abuse and itwas a bunch of nonsense, look, someone is going to prison over that. It'sjust a question now of how wide and how deep it was.And I know John Durham has been investigating that. And I'm confident, andI have said that, based on what I have seen, I think there should beadditional indictments. I'm not backing off of that.But he's the prosecutor.BARTIROMO:  OK.RATCLIFFE:  I'd like to hear from them -- from him in an interim report.And I think the American people would agree with me.BARTIROMO:  Director, it's great to have you.RATCLIFFE:  You bet.BARTIROMO:  The American people trust you. You have done an incredible jobon all of this.Thank you, sir.RATCLIFFE:  Good to be with you, Maria.BARTIROMO:  The director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe.We will be right back.And we're looking at what Rudy Giuliani is calling the smoking gun of theelection 2020, Rudy Giuliani on the surveillance video he says couldoverturn the results.He's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.This week, dozens of witnesses testified at five separate election fraudhearings in four different states. Their allegations range from bogus andbackdated ballots to tabulation errors and voter intimidation.Here is a sampling of testimonies from Michigan on Wednesday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Instead of discarding, they were just rescanning,rescanning, rescanning, counting ballots nine to 10 times, counting votesnine to 10 times.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So, they were counting the same ballot, the same votenine or 10 times?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, sir.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  From these duplicate ballots that I observed, none ofthem were for Trump, none of them. And from the other two shifts or tworounds that we did earlier, only one ballot that I witnessed from aduplicate was for Trump.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  When I asked one lady, where did you get trained, shesaid, trained for what, because they didn't know what they were there for.The only job I could tell there was to block the GOP people fromchallenging or intimidate them and get them out.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO:  President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani crisscrossed thecountry this week, presenting evidence in Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia.He joins us now this morning.Good morning, Rudy. Good to see you today.RUDY GIULIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  Good morning, Maria.Good to see you.BARTIROMO:  What a week you had and all of that testimony, pretty explosivecommentary coming out of those witnesses.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO:  Rudy, give us a status check. You have challenged these sixswing states. Where are we in each of these states?GIULIANI:  Well, I think, Georgia, we're probably the furthest along.Georgia, of course, had the bombshell evidence of the tape recording of theelection center, with everyone chased out about 2:00 in the morning, lockeddown, five people left. Luckily, the cameras were on. They didn't know it.And then they took ballots out hidden under a table all day. And then theyspent the rest of the night counting the secret ballots, and, clearly,secret, phony ballots, in which they excluded all Republicans, allDemocrats, all law enforcement.And I think that ended up being about 148,000 to 7,000, 148,000 for Biden,7,000 for Trump. But you get a pretty good idea of how they cheated.Georgia also has numerous situations where ballots weren't inspected,ballots were backdated, dead people voting, people from out of statevoting, illegal immigrants voting. There are enough illegal immigrants thatvoted that would change the course of the election.They can't balance the number of ballots they have against the number ofballots that were returned by about 11,000 or 12,000. That alone wouldoverturn the election. So, the state legislature there has discussed it.And they actually have started a petition to hold their own session, whichthey're allowed to do under the Constitution. They're the first legislationto do this now. This is a constitutional role that the founding fathersgave to our legislatures. They're the ones who are supposed to select thepresident, not the governors, not the board of elections.They're the ones who have the constitutional obligation to decide on theelectors. So, in Georgia, they are going to do that. Michigan isconsidering the same thing, and they're not quite far -- as far along, butthey are drafting something right now, and so is Arizona.So those three are three in which they could very well end up in front ofthe legislature to decide who the electors are. Wisconsin has a lawsuitwhere Wisconsin has a very strict absentee ballot. And it basically says,if you don't have an application for the ballot, the ballot doesn't count.And there are some 50,000 or 60,000 ballots without applications. Theywould have to be thrown out. And that would change the election.BARTIROMO:  So...GIULIANI:  So, that's where we are right now.BARTIROMO:  ... you said that you found -- you say you found serious issueswith processing of ballots, absentee ballots, in Wisconsin?GIULIANI:  Oh, of course, yes.I mean, what you had in Wisconsin is the same thing that you had everyplace else, except they have this additional law where you have to have anapplication. They excluded Republican poll watchers from watching absenteeballots being counted and mail-in ballots being counted.They excluded Republican poll watchers from the polls. They engaged inbackdating ballots. Several witnesses testified to how they were trained tobackdate ballots. They have registered people who weren't registered underdifferent names.Each one of them has, in one degree or another, almost the same pattern ofactivity, one a little bit more than others. This was a pattern that wasset by somebody in Washington, because everybody else carried it outexactly in the same way. And they did it in the crooked cities.They didn't do it everywhere. They did it in Philadelphia and Pittsburghand Detroit, in Milwaukee, in Atlanta. That's -- they went to places wherethere's a lot of corruption and the courts are not exactly the fairest.Let's put it that way.BARTIROMO:  So, you think somebody in Washington directed this and directedthe big cities in the big swing states to do these tweaks, whether it isthe processing of ballots incorrectly or harvesting ballots, et cetera.Who did this? I mean, that would suggest this is organized, developed. Whois in charge? Who directed this, then?GIULIANI:  I have no idea. I mean, I don't know who was in charge of it.All I can tell you is, it looks like a very well-planned, very well-executed situation. For example, at the same time at 3:30 in the morning onthe night of the election, right after the election, a truck pulled intothe back of the center in Detroit and delivered 100,000 phony ballots. Thatall got counted for Biden.At the very same time in Atlanta, they threw the people out of the center.They closed the doors. They went under the counter and brought out about70,000 or 80,000 ballots and counted those phony ballots, some of themcounting six and seven times. All that's on tape.Happened at the same time in two different places. Can't tell me thatwasn't part of a pattern.BARTIROMO:  That's unbelievable.Rudy, this is pretty extraordinary. And, obviously, these are very, veryserious charges. How come the media does not report that you have thisevidence? I mean, we're looking at the videos of people pulling ballots outfrom under a table. We're looking at the affidavits that you arepresenting.And yet, I mean, The Wall Street Journal this morning, the title, "TrumpUses Rally For Georgia Senate Candidates to Push Unsupported Claims ofVoting Fraud."And we're looking at video right now of the people in Georgia, which youjust referred to, that, at 2:00 in the morning, they said, everybody, clearout the room. And yet you have got four individuals here that are pullingsuitcases out from under a table.Why is it that the media continues to report that there's unsupportedevidence here, when every day you're out talking about these situations?GIULIANI:  Maria, I wish I knew the answer to that.Part of it is bias. Part of it is corruption. Part of it's laziness. Partof it is just inexplicable. How you can say this is unsupported...BARTIROMO:  Well...GIULIANI:  ... when there are now tape after tape after tape -- there aretapes of those same women taking USB drives and getting information out ofthe machines illegally.Those were played yesterday in Georgia. And nobody bothers to play that. Imean, there are 1,000 affidavits, 1,000 affidavits. This is a massive fraudall throughout the country. There are 1,000 affidavits of people whoobserved a fraudulent act.BARTIROMO:  It sounds like you're -- yes. It sounds like you're counting onthe state legislatures to recognize this.What about the Supreme Court? I know that Congressman Mike Kelly's suit hasreached Justice Alito. Tell us where that stands and when we might getreaction or rulings from the Supreme Court in -- with regard to thePennsylvania case.GIULIANI:  Well, I think the Pennsylvania case probably is a week away frombeing put together and argued.I don't know when it'll get decided. That case challenges the definitionsand the changes in the definitions that Pennsylvania made in its law, inthe way that it applied it, in the way it denied constitutional rights. Ithink it's a very good case.If any of these state legislatures change the electors based on their ownanalysis, of course, that'll be taken to the Supreme Court. And the SupremeCourt will have to decide if it was done reasonably, rationally, orarbitrarily. That's the standard.The state legislature can make a choice of electors, but it has to be basedon substantial reasons of corruption, irregularities. In each case, eachone of these legislatures has more than enough of that to sustain a SupremeCourt challenge.BARTIROMO:  Rudy, also, in terms of where this happens next, I want to getyour take on where we go from here and your timing.Do you believe you are getting heard? Do you believe that you still have apath to victory?GIULIANI:  We do.We're getting heard in the state legislatures. And once they make adecision, we will get heard in the Supreme Court. We're not getting heardin the public, except for occasional shows like yours, a few others, a fewinterviews that we do, and social media.No, it's outrageous the amount of blackout that's been put on this.BARTIROMO:  Yes.GIULIANI:  I thought, when that tape came out, I thought that would be likea -- my goodness, look at this. People are stealing votes right in front ofus.BARTIROMO:  Well, you called it -- you called it a smoking gun.By the way, we just heard from John Ratcliffe, director of nationalintelligence. And he said it's very easy to figure out what went on withthose four individuals. Let the FBI bring those four individuals in and askthem, what were you doing with the suitcases under the table?Have those people been questioned by the FBI?GIULIANI:  No.(LAUGHTER)BARTIROMO:  We will get an answer right away, right?GIULIANI:  Not that I know of. Not that I know of.Not only that. Those people were involved in taking USBs, takinginformation out of machines. They have a little history. I mean, it's notjust that. They are involved in two or three other acts of voter fraud.And the FBI is nowhere to be found. I don't understand it.BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.Rudy -- Rudy, it's good to see you this morning. Of course, we willcontinue following this incredibly extraordinary moment in time, thiscontested election.Rudy Giuliani.Coming up: outside legal analysis on whether Trump does have a path tovictory, what role the Supreme Court could play in the homestretch.Legal scholars Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr will weigh in right afterthis.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.We just heard from President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani on his 2020election challenges.Joining me right now with independent analysis are Judge Ken Starr, formerindependent counsel and FOX News contributor, and legal scholar and host ofthe wildly popular podcast "The Dershow" Alan Dershowitz.Gentlemen, it's good to see you both. Thank you so much for being here.KEN STARR, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you, Maria.BARTIROMO:  I want to get your take on what we heard from Rudy Giuliani.And let me just say one thing that really struck me. Rudy just said, thiswas a pattern that was set by somebody in Washington, because everybodyelse carried it out exactly the same way. They did it in the crookedcities. That's what Rudy Giuliani said.Look at that, as well as anything else that struck you from my conversationwith former prosecutor Giuliani.Alan Dershowitz, kick us off.ALAN DERSHOWITZ, ATTORNEY:  There certainly is probable cause forinvestigating and looking further.Giuliani has made very serious accusations. The question is, whichinstitution is designed, constitutionally, to look into it? Is it the statelegislature? Is it the courts? Is the clock running in such a way thatthere won't be time to look into this?I have proposed, for the future, at least, the creation of a vote integritypanel, VIP, that would consist of former justices, judges, neutral,nonpartisan, that any complaint about an election, either before theelection, during the election, or after the election, could go to thisgroup which could then look into it, because we know the media doesn't giveit a fair shake.And we know that everybody else is partisan. The American public wants toknow, is Giuliani correct or isn't he correct? I don't know whether we willfind that out in time for the meeting of the Electoral College votes.BARTIROMO:  Ken Starr?STARR:  Hi, Maria. And hi, Alan.DERSHOWITZ:  Hi.STARR:  The prediction of Jimmy Carter and James Baker in 2000 and theircommission has come true, and it is a bit of a nightmare.They warned, after taking a very careful study, this bipartisan commissionwarned that absentee voting, mail-in voting is a huge potential for fraud.And that's what we have heard from Rudy.So, what do we now do about it? I think, to be honest, we're running out oftime, because the Electoral College meets on December 14.BARTIROMO:  Yes.STARR:  So it's going to take an extraordinary action by legislatures andso forth.And Rudy has rightly pointed to the legislatures, because therein lies theultimate, other than the Supreme Court of the United States, ability tohave an effect on the just concluded election.DERSHOWITZ:  Right.BARTIROMO:  Stay with us.I want to ask you about Wisconsin and Georgia. These are the two that theythink they have real success.We are going to take a break and come back with Ken Starr and AlanDershowitz.Back in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  We are back with legal scholars Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr.And, Ken, a moment ago, you said it is the state legislatures that you'rewatching. The Trump team seems to think the most promising results here arein Georgia and Wisconsin. Your reaction?STARR:  I think -- yes.I think the Georgia legislature, at least that committee, seemed to bereally troubled by the evidence, not just the video, but the other evidenceof irregularities and the like.In Wisconsin, the use of the drop boxes, that could have been innovation,that were unmanned, in violation of state law, huge problem in terms ofpotential fraud.BARTIROMO:  Alan, you said earlier about the Supreme Court and thePennsylvania state we're watching, but also that we need evidence.Do you feel that Giuliani has been presenting evidence with all of thesevideos and these witness testimonies?DERSHOWITZ:  Yes.BARTIROMO:  You said he's got 1,000 affidavits.DERSHOWITZ:  Yes, these are retail evidence that have to be determined tobe true by cross-examination and witnesses.The core constitutional question that Ken correctly pointed to is, clearly,state legislatures have the power before the voters vote to pick theelectors. The unanswered constitutional question is, do they have thepower, state legislatures, to pick electors after the voters vote if theyconclude that the voters' count has been in some way fraudulent or wrong?That is a constitutional question we don't not answer to. And the SupremeCourt may get to decide that question if a state legislature decides todetermine who the electors should be and changes the electors from Biden toTrump.That will be the key constitutional question.BARTIROMO:  And do you think that the Supreme Court would rule that it wasunconstitutional to widen the vote, have people vote before Election Dayafter 8:00 on Election Day? Would those votes be null and void, even in theface of a pandemic?DERSHOWITZ:  I think so.I think that there's a 5-4 vote now in the Supreme Court. And Justice Alitoseemed to suggest that that would cancel out the votes in Pennsylvania thatwere received after the close of Election Day. Whether that's right orwrong, that's the way I predict the Supreme Court would decide the case, ifit decided to take the case.BARTIROMO:  All right, great talking to you both, Ken Starr and AlanDershowitz. Please come back soon.Thank you so much, gentlemen.That'll do it for us.I will be back tomorrow morning on FOX Business.
