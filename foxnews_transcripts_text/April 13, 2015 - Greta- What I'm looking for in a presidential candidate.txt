'Off the Record,' 4/13/15: I'm not looking for a candidate that can say the meanest things or make up the biggest lies about their opponents. I'm looking for a leader - a real leader

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I don't care who you vote for. That is so just your business. But I do have a thought about Campaign 2016 and those poisonous negative ads - basically obnoxious conduct by adults that we would never condone by children. Adult politicians saying the worst things about each other and then, of course, we're all guilty - we all watch.
And I don't know about you, but I'm not looking for the candidate who can say the meanest thing, make up the biggest lie about their opponent or smear the opponent even if that opponent might deserve it. I'm looking for a real leader. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Admit it, real leaders are way too busy looking at problems, ways to solve those problems, to sit around dreaming up something rotten to say about another in a video or negative ad. And face it, if you don't have a record of success, you don't have any ideas, the only way to win is to knock the other guy down. You know that's wrong because we have so many problems that demand American leadership, from the barbarism of ISIS and chaos in the Middle East and jobs and health care right back here at home. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, who are you going to vote for? Someone who strings flashy words and video together to trash-talk another or someone who, as my 8th grade nun said, has seriousness of purpose? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
As an aside, that same nun said I lacked seriousness of purpose. But I eventually grew up. That's my "Off the Record" tonight.
