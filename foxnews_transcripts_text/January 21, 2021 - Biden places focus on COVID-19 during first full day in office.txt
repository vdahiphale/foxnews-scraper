NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): You don't say to a president do whatever you wantin the last months of your administration. You're going to get a jet -- geta jail card free.EMANUEL: Minnesota Democrat Senator Amy Klobuchar says the Senate couldhandle nominations and that trial with a simple agreement.SEN.

You could have the impeachment trial inthe afternoon.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations.EMANUEL: The Senate last night confirmed Avril Haines to be Director ofNational Intelligence with an 84 to 10 vote.SCHUMER: We can and should confirm the Secretaries of Defense, State,Homeland Security and Treasury without much delay.EMANUEL: Transportation Secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg was on the hotseat today confronted by Texas Senator Ted Cruz about President Bidencanceling the Keystone XL pipeline and an estimated 11,000 jobs.SEN.

Mike, thanks.EMANUEL: You bet.BAIER: On his first full day in office, President Biden is prioritizing hisnumber one item on his agenda, the coronavirus pandemic. The presidentsigned a number of executive orders today aimed at ramping up testing andvaccinations and workplace safety rules.He's also trying to show concrete differences between his approach and thatof his predecessor. We're already getting a heat of that from Dr. AnthonyFauci who calls working for the new president, liberating.White House Correspondent Peter Doocy has the story tonight live from theNorth Lawn. Good evening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. President Bidenlikes to talk a lot about how COVID-19 and mask wearing are not politicalissues. But a key part of his response team will also lead PresidentTrump's response, Dr. Anthony Fauci, just made some very politicalobservations about Biden versus Trump.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: One of the new things in this administration is if you don't havethe answer, don't guess. Just say you don't know the answer.The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what theevidence, what the science is, and know that's it. Let the science speak.It is somewhat of a liberating feeling.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: Fauci was standing by as President Biden signed 10 more executiveorders that makes 27 orders or actions in just a day and a half and moreare coming especially related to COVID relief.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our national strategies iscomprehensive, it's based on science, not politics.DOOCY: (Voice-over): Now that he's President, Joe Biden is going to throwthe book at COVID-19.BIDEN: Its 198 pages.DOOCY: And getting FEMA involved in the response may sound familiar.BIDEN: This is a model we use to respond to hurricanes Hurricane Sandy,which I was deeply involved with.DOOCY: Biden plans to use the Defense Production Act to spin up materialsto make vaccines but he admits he can't stop the spread alone.BIDEN: Asking the American people to mask up for the first 100 days, thenext 99 days.DOOCY: Although Biden did not adhere to an executive order he signedyesterday, mandating masks on federal lands when he spoke at the LincolnMemorial on federal land.BIDEN: I will give my all to you. DOOCY: Why weren't President Biden and all members of the Biden familymasks at all times on federal lands last night if he signed an executiveorder that mandates masks on federal lands at all?JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He was celebrating an evening of ahistoric day in our country.DOOCY: President Biden has long claimed Republicans will have an epiphanyand jump at the chance to work with him. The Republican leader of theSenate has seen early moves on immigration and climate change. And now:MCCONNELL: The president can and should refocus his administration oncreating good paying American jobs, not sacrificing our people'slivelihoods to liberal symbolism.DOOCY: President Biden isn't changing everything, though, he plans to keepChristopher Wray as FBI director.PSAKI: There are some people. Christopher Wray as an example, I'll justbring him back up who will continue to serve in his role.DOOCY: And he didn't like the idea that he might not be thinking bigenough.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've set the goal at a hundred million vaccines. Isthat high enough? Shouldn't you set the bar higher? That's basically wherethe U.S. is right now.BIDEN: When I announced, you all said it's not possible. Come on, give me abreak, man. Good start. (INAUDIBLE)(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: To get on that track, this country needs to vaccinate 1 millionpeople per day and in the State Dining Room, Dr. Anthony Fauci got therebefore Biden, so I asked him how far away are we from the 1 million a day.And he said, starting now, you're going to see that, Bret.BAIER: Peter Doocy live in the North Lawn. Peter, thank you.Two Florida men are facing charges taking part in the Capitol riot earlierthis month. One of them, Joseph Biggs who's a self-described organizer forthe group known as Proud Boys.

Goodevening, Chad.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret.Well, Democratic Tennessee Representative Steve Cohen says he saw somethingsuspicious here at the Capitol around the first of the year. He saw LaurenBoebert, the freshman Republican Congresswoman from Colorado leading a tourafter hours. He then wondered if that may have been connected to theCapitol riot. This is a charge that Boebert denies.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-CO): It's just absolutely disgusting and baseless.It just shows their hypocrisy on full display.PERGRAM (voice-over): Boebert says it was a tour for family members, herkids, as well as aunts and uncles. It was just before she was sworn in as anew member on January 3rd.The former Senate Sergeant at Arms Drew Willison says the Capitol is linedwith cameras to track movements inside and if someone was up to no good,authorities could tell.DREW WILLISON, FORMER SENATE SERGEANT AT ARMS: It's a fully loaded chargeto accuse a different member of an act of treachery of that sort, even ifit's speculative. So, it is a day that most of them celebrate.So, it wouldn't be all of that unusual for people to be giving a relativelyinformal tour of the -- of the building on a day like that.PERGRAM: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, "There is no question that therewere members in this body who gave aid and comfort to those who disputedthe election result."But when pressed by Fox if she had info that lawmakers helped the rioters,the speaker had none.PELOSI: Everything has to be based on evidence and that remains to be seen.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM: Now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi along with the House MinorityLeader Kevin McCarthy, they indicate that if it's found that members wereinvolved in the riot, there should be consequences.Also, tonight, we've learned that a coalition of seven Democratic senatorsare referring Republican Missouri Senator Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz of Texasto the Ethics Committee. They contested the Pennsylvania and Arizonaelectoral college results.

BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): While it may to some be a symbolic change, weremove the word alien from the immigration code and replace it with non-citizen. No longer will we dehumanize the undocumented.TURNER: Some of President Biden's first official acts at 1600 PennsylvaniaAvenue included signing multiple executive actions reversing the Trumpera's key policies.This includes orders to stop construction of the southern border wall,reversal of the so-called Muslim travel ban and moves to protect thechildren of undocumented immigrants.BIDEN: We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.TURNER: The Department of Homeland Security also announcing a hundred daypause on deportations for thousands of non-citizens beginning Friday.PSAKI: This pause will allow the administration to review and resetenforcement policies and ensure that resources are dedicated to the mostpressing challenges.TURNER: But some Republicans are striking a completely different tone,claiming the new Biden policies will add up to catastrophe for Americans.SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): We're going to have illegal aliens taking jobs fromAmericans at a time when we still have 10 million Americans out of work.That is a radical far left policy that the American people don't want.TURNER: Some Trump Homeland Security officials are panicking.TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, ICE: (INAUDIBLE) if you've been in thiscountry since before November 1st of 2020, you are not to be removed, whichmeans you're going to be in this country legally, convicted of childmolestation, convicted a rape, and you won't be removed.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER: Now, the big-ticket item is a draft bill the Biden team droppedyesterday that includes a pathway to citizenship for 11 million peoplecurrently in the United States undocumented known as dreamers.Now, under this legislation, each one of those people would be on a path tofull-fledged citizenship in less than eight years, Bret.BAIER: Gillian, thank you.TURNER: You bet.BAIER: The main theme for President Biden's inauguration speech Wednesdaywas unity. But there are already major questions tonight about whether thepresident and his supporters are ready to back up those words with actions.Correspondent David Spunt takes a look tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A direct call from thenew commander-in-chief of an intensely divided nation.Just hours later, antigovernment protesters, some claiming to be tied toAntifa trashed parts of Portland, Seattle and Denver despite thepresident's call for calm.Some Republicans are dismayed President Biden has not publicly opposedimpeachment for his predecessor.REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): It looks to me like it's a continuation of thepersonal animus. Maybe it's a continuation of this idea that you want tocancel President Trump's presidency, remove him from the history books.SPUNT: Big tech put a muzzle on the former president. His supporters sayit's unfair and there's a double standard.More than 500 professionals in the publishing industry signed a letter withthe phrase: No book deals for traitors. Senator Josh Hawley lost a dealwith Simon & Schuster following the Capitol riots.THOMAS SPENCE, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REGNERY PUBLISHING: My company,Regnery Publishing, picked the book up very quickly after Simon cancelledit. And Simon & Schuster has given us a publicity campaign that, you know,we couldn't have paid for.SPUNT: This as summer hinting Trump supporters need some serious changes.KATIE COURIC, PUBLISHER, WAKE-UP CALL: How are we going to really almostdeprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump.RONNA MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Not only didthey win, they are determined to punish and degrade and call half of thiscountry racist while their candidate that they supported is out there withthis unity message ringing a bell, the actions are not matching.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT: But tonight, a Republican Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie TaylorGreene, a freshman congresswoman is moving to impeach President Biden onhis first day on the job. The measure is likely to go nowhere, Bret.President Biden's team says that he doesn't hold grudges and he will workjust as hard for those people that liked him as those who don't, Bret.BAIER: David, thank you.Up next, why did Amazon wait until the Biden inauguration day to offer amajor hand in the vaccination effort?

Amazon dropped Parler January10th, four days after the Capitol riot.The judge says Parler failed to show it was likely to prevail on the meritsof its claims, or that the public interest supported a preliminaryinjunction requiring the restoration of service.Late this afternoon, Parler's chief operating officer said the companywelcomes a call by a Democratic Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney to havethe FBI conduct a robust examination of its policies and actions.We're learning new details tonight about the offer from Amazon to help withthe vaccination effort, and in particular, the timing of the outreach. Thiscomes amid serious issues about the availability of the vaccine itself.Correspondent David Lee Miller has our update tonight from New York.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As states expandeligibility for the coronavirus vaccine, supplies in many states aredwindling.In West Virginia, nearly the entire allocation for the first of therequired two doses has been used up.In Ohio where the death toll has surpassed 10,000, Governor Mike DeWinesays the problem isn't the lack of infrastructure but lack of vaccine.In New York City, vaccination centers are being temporarily shut downbecause there isn't enough to go around. 23,000 vaccination appointmentshave been canceled.DAVID HANSON, TEACHER: I got a call on Monday from Lincoln Hospital where Iwas supposed to get the vaccination saying hey, we ran out of vaccines.We're sorry.MILLER: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was seeking approval to usevaccine that has been set aside for a second dose in order to inoculate asmany people now and then replenish supplies.MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY): I think it makes a lot more sense, give peoplethe first dose, use that to supply or reserve to give people first dose andthen get back filled with future shipments.MILLER: Contributing to the shortage, thousands of doses across the countryhave been wasted. Either because they expired or were not properlyrefrigerated.Technology giant Amazon is offering to help the Biden administration reachits goal of vaccinating 100 million people in 100 days.A letter from CEO Dave Clark sent to President Biden reads in part "We areprepared to leverage our operations, information technology, communicationcapabilities and expertise to assist your administration's vaccinationefforts."Senator Lindsey Graham question why no such explicit offer of help was madeto the Trump administration.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I think what Amazon's doing is prettydisgusting if in fact they could have helped the Trump administration andthey chose not to because they don't like him. That's not a good moment forthe Amazon company.MILLER: In a tweet this afternoon, Amazon said "Actually, we didn't wait.We offered the Trump administration assistance on vaccines, built new toolsfor researchers and public health authorities, engaged Operation Warp Speedon logistics and advised on testing and flew in PPE from China when Americaneeded it most.(END VIDEO CLIP)MILLER: Amazon is not the only company in the fight against the virus.

Some are taking a page from theirliberal opponents and applying it to the gun issue.National Correspondent William La Jeunesse tonight from Los Angeles on theconcept of Second Amendment sanctuaries.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)BIDEN: We won't stop until we beat the NRA.WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):President Biden's plan to rewrite America's gun laws, makes gun ownersnervous.BIDEN: I'll do everything in my power in office or out of office to getthose assault weapons off the street which I've done once already. And toget those clips that have multiple bullets in them not for sale.BIASIUCCI: If the feds want to come in and start taking people down forhaving a high capacity magazine, we're not going to have any part in that.LA JEUNESSE: State Rep. Leo Biasiucci wants to make Arizona a SecondAmendment sanctuary state. Banning the use of state money or manpower toenforce any federal law or regulation that violates the right to bear arms.BIASIUCCI: This bill is saying they can do what they want in D.C. but we'renot going to have our law enforcement spend resources to help them arrestlaw abiding citizens who are -- who are gun owners.LA JEUNESSE: Four states in more than 400 mostly red cities and townspassed measures declaring themselves gun sanctuaries.

The decision comes just days after the NRAfiled for bankruptcy protection and said it planned to reincorporate in themore gun friendly court in Texas after 150 years in New York.President Biden is already making moves to reverse the Trump foreignpolicy. One of the biggest changes is to rejoin the Paris ClimateAgreement, abandoned by his predecessor. Correspondent Benjamin Hall hasdetails tonight from London.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President Biden has been a regularfixture on the world stage for decades. Allies and enemies alike know himwell, and each is now trying to predict his foreign policy agenda. He beganyesterday by making his globalist intentions very clear, signing anexecutive action to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. This has delightedinternational allies, but critics claim it will greatly burden America'senergy producers with expensive regulations while giving subsidies to othercountries.President Biden also rejoined the World Health Organization, which has beenaccused of kowtowing to China, with a Trump administration holdover makingthe announcement.FAUCI: The United States also intends to fulfill its financial obligationsto the organization.HALL: In another stroke of the pen, and despite pushback from Canada,President Biden reversed another Trump policy and canceled the Keystone XLpipeline, putting at risk 11,000 jobs. But when it comes to biggergeopolitical threats, President Biden's policies are less clear. He hassaid he intends to rejoin the Iran deal to the disappointment of MiddleEast allies. But it's not clear whether he will renegotiate first. Hispress secretary was somewhat vague.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The United States should seek tolengthen and strengthen nuclear constraints on Iran.HALL: In terms of China, President Biden has said he favors working withallies to contain them, while his Director of National Intelligence theU.S. should be tougher, without specifying.AVRIL HAINES, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: China is a challenge toour security, to our prosperity, to our values across a range of issues,and I do support an aggressive stance.(END VIDEO TAPE)HALL: President Biden has effectively said he wants to be tougher onadversaries, but at the same time he wants cooperation from them. Findingthat balance may, frankly, be a very difficult thing to do. Bret?BAIER: Benjamin Hall in London. Benjamin, thanks.Some other stories from beyond our borders tonight. The Bidenadministration proposes a five-year extension of the new START Treaty,limiting the number of U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. Thetreaty is set to expire in February. It's the last remaining agreementconstraining the U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons.Twin suicide bombings ripped through a busy market in Baghdad today,killing at least 32 people, wounding dozens. The rare suicide bombing hitthe commercial area of the Iraqi capital amid heightened political tensionsover planned early elections and a severe economic crisis.The Vatican's criminal tribunal convicts the former head of the Vaticanbank and his lawyer of embezzling millions of dollars in proceeds from thesales of Holy See owned real estate. The defendants were sentenced tonearly nine years in prison.Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. Up next, thepanel on President Biden and his swift moves to undo many of the Trumpadministration's policies.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FAUCI: It is very clear that there were things that were said, be itregarding things like hydroxychloroquine and other things like that, thatreally was uncomfortable because they were not based on scientific fact. Ican tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation ofcontradicting the president, so it was really something that you didn'tfeel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be anyrepercussions about it. The idea that you can get up here and talk aboutwant you know, what the evidence, what the science is, and know that's it.Let the science speak. It is somewhat of a liberating feeling.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Dr. Anthony Fauci today talking at the White House, something theysay he will do frequently in the coming days about the situation. This asthe new president, President Joe Biden, continues to sign a series ofexecutive orders today, really doing most with COVID, but he will continueto sign executive orders, really undoing a lot of the Trump administrationpolicies.Let's bring in our panel, Jason Riley, "Wall Street Journal" columnist,senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, Susan Page, Washington bureauchief at "USA Today," and Ben Domenech, publisher of "The Federalist."Susan, what about this? Surprised to hear Dr. Anthony Fauci open up likethat? Clearly, he is going to be back in the briefing room giving hisfeelings on the situation.SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, "USA TODAY": He was a happy man heretoday, wasn't he? I was surprised he was willing to go so far in describinghow much more comfortable he is with this administration than with the lastadministration. He did do the Trump administration one favor, though. Hedisputed a story that was out there today that said that the Biden peoplehad to go back to scratch in terms of the vaccine distribution plan. Hesaid no, there are some elements of the Trump vaccine distribution planthat are good, although there are other things that he thought didn't workso well.But he clearly is someone who is more comfortable with this particularadministration and it's an attitude toward science than he was with theprevious one.BAIER: Ben, here's Jen Psaki on the plan that they have on COVID and whatthey're looking towards.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The Trump administration was given36 million doses when they were in office for 38 days. They administered atotal of about 17 million shots. That about less than 500,000 shots a day.What we are proposing is to double that to about 1 million shots per day.And we have outlined this goal and objective in coordination andconsultation with our health and medical experts. So it is ambitious. It'ssomething that we feel is bold and was called that certainly at the time,and we're working overtime to help to achieve it, try to achieve it.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: That is their priority right now, Ben.BEN DOMENECH, "THE FEDERALIST": First off, Jen Psaki is being a bitdisingenuous there when she talked about this rollout. Obviously, this is asituation where we got the vaccine much earlier than a lot of commentatorsthought we ever would. And it's really incumbent upon these various stateleaders to take up the process of administering these doses, making surethey get to the people in need. And we've seen that the rollout has beenvery uneven. Compare West Virginia to the rest of America, and it's noteven close in terms of the level of achievement that you've had.And to circle back to Susan's point, I'm surprised that you're surprisedthat Anthony Fauci is willing to wear his emotions on his sleeve like this.I don't think that he has been exactly a shrinking violet when it comes totalking to the press. But I would rewind this a little bit to say I stillbelieve that Anthony Fauci has been one of the most inconsistent people interms of what he's advocated for during this entire process. And when yougo back to what he was saying in the spring regarding keeping publicschools closed, I still believe that's one of the signature moments in thiswhole process that could have gone in a very different way if you had haddifferent people in the room. We see the rest of the western world keepingschools open this entire time, and you see the ramifications of the factthat private schools in America have been open as public schools have beenclosed, an effect that is going to have ripples throughout Americanexperience over the next several years.BAIER: One of the questions, Jason, is how the press is going to handlePresident Biden, especially in the first 100 days when it comes to COVID oranything else. Today there was an interchange with the A.P. where thepresident didn't particularly love the line of questioning. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've set the goal at 100 million vaccines in the 100days. Is that high enough? Shouldn't you set the bar higher? That'sbasically where the U.S. is right now.BIDEN: When I announced it, you all said it's not possible. Come on, giveme a break, man.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Give me a break. The interesting thing is that it is now the Bidenadministration's deal, and it's no longer from the outside, you are notdoing enough, it is you. And we'll see how this rollout continues.JASON RILEY, "WALL STREET JOURNAL" COLUMNIST: Sure. I don't think it's anysurprise that people are going to see kinder coverage from the press for aDemocratic president. That will be one return to normalcy, a true return tonormalcy. I think if you are a conservative or Republican, you're used toseeing your guy in the White House get picked on by the press thanDemocrats witness, so that's not much of a surprise.I do think, though, that Joe Biden has to be careful about misinterpretingthe lack of support, the low approval rating for Donald Trump going out thedoor, misinterpreting that as support for a progressive mandate that hethinks he might have. Joe Biden was not elected because Donald Trump pulledout of the Paris Accords or because he banned travelers from states thatsponsor terrorists. That's not why he was elected. He was elected to tackleCOVID, and because people had tired of Donald Trump's personality, of hisbehavior.So, his only real mandate, I think, is to tackle COVID and not be DonaldTrump. And to the extent that he strays from that and adopts a very leftistagenda going forward, I think he risks the same mistake that happened thelast time he entered the White House with the Obama administration,overreaching on things like a very partisan reevaluation of our health caresystem in this country, and the result was losing the House in one midtermelection, losing the Senate in another midterm election. So, I think JoeBiden should be very careful about overreaching in terms of what he thinkshis mandate is.BAIER: Susan, quickly, Amazon's offer to help the Biden administration withits sites on vaccination efforts, Senator Lindsey Graham among otherscriticizing that because they didn't offer it in the Trump administration.What do you make of that?PAGE: But of course, Amazon has now said that they did offer it in theTrump administration. So, I think that would have been appropriate for themto have offered in the past of administration. But that's all I know isthat they say that they did.DOMENECH: No letter was sent, Susan, just to clarify. They said that today.BAIER: No letter was sent to the Trump administration?PAGE: How did they extend the offer then? Did they call or tweet?DOMENECH: That's unclear to me.BAIER: We're going to follow that up. Obviously, they're offering now, andwe'll see if that materializes in the 100 million vaccines in 100 days.Panel, stand by, if you would. Coming up, the disunity over unity with thepanel when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PSAKI: I think if you talk to Republicans on the Hill, which I know many ofyou do, they will say they are not looking for something symbolic. They arelooking for engagement. They're looking to have a conversation. They'relooking to have a dialogue. And that's exactly what he's going to do.MCCARTHY: President Joe Biden says let's give 11 million illegal immigrantscitizenships while we have 10.7 million Americans out of work. Shouldn't weprioritize those Americans out of work first? And those are places that Ithink you could find unity. He knows the agenda and those executive ordershe is signing are partisan, that's dividing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Unity, policy differences, what is the difference and what canhappen in today's Washington. We're back with our panel. Susan, there's alot of talk about unity, and clearly there's all kinds of takes aboutPresident Biden's inauguration speech. But what can happen as far asunifying over legislative policies considering the differences in the twoparties?PAGE: Some things can happen. With the confirmation processes has started,is going relatively smoothly. That's an encouraging sign. The White Housesays they're going to start talks, at least, with members of Congress aboutthat $1.9 trillion COVID relief package. Will there be good faithcompromises on both sides? We'll see. We've kind of stopped using thatmuscle in Washington. We'll see if Joe Biden and congressional Republicanscan start to use it again.BAIER: Man, it really has not been used, you are exactly right. Ben?DOMENECH: There's no context for unity on Capitol Hill when you are aboutto go through an impeachment. There's no context when you have one side ina 50/50 Senate which won't take eliminating the filibuster off of thetable.And I think that one of the big questions about unity isn't really betweenJoe Biden and Republicans, because there won't be much of any. It's withinthe Republican coalition, which today on Capitol Hill and talking to half adozen different senators and senior people in their offices, they're allcompletely befuddled at Mitch McConnell's approach to this impeachmentprocess, telegraphing that this is something that he plans to take up inFebruary. They really don't understand it.And it's down the line, Tom Cotton, Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio,Rick Scott, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, the list goes on, of all of these peoplewho potentially have futures nationally in this party who don't understandwhat Mitch McConnell is doing. They don't believe the Republican Party hasa future in which they are putting their finger in their eye of Trumpvoters. And that's something that is really up in the air right now interms of the Republican coalition.BAIER: That's interesting that you mention the Senate minority leader now,Mitch McConnell, who is somehow negotiating go forward with impeachment butno filibuster busting. Here is Mitch McConnell.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MCCONNELL: The legislative filibuster is a crucial part of the Senate.Leading Democrats like President Biden himself have long defended it. So ifthe talk of unity and common ground is to have meaning, and certainly ifthe rules from 20 years ago are to be our guide, then I cannot imagine theDemocratic leader would rather hold up the power-sharing agreement thensimply reaffirm that his side won't be breaking this standing rule of theSenate.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: So just to give you a behind-the-scenes, Mitch McConnell isessentially negotiating, OK, we'll plan impeachment trial in the Senate,but you can't bust the filibuster. And Chuck Schumer is not agreeing withthat. So, there is no deal as of yet, and that means there's no deal as faras Democratic chairman of all these committees, et cetera. So, all of thisis being negotiating as we speak, Jason.RILEY: Yes, it is. And I will take Joe Biden at his word that he isinterested in unity, but I think the left in general I don't think isinterested in unity. I think they're interested in revenge, Bret. And whenyou want to set up a blacklist of former Trump administration officials andmake it harder for him to get hired going forward, that's not about unity.That's about revenge. Or when you embrace an agenda of critical race theoryor diversity training or the 1619 Project about calling out white peopleand publicly embarrassing them, that's not about unity. That's aboutrevenge. And I think that right now is what is animating the left morebroadly, regardless of what Joe Biden is saying.BAIER: All right, panel, stand by. When we come back, we will talk to youabout a sneak peek at tomorrow's headlines.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: A look at tomorrow's headlines tonight with our panel. OK, Jason,headline?RILEY: Post Trump America continues to unite is a headline I expect to beseeing, or some variation of that going forward, Bret. And I think themeasure of unification will be the extent to which Joe Biden is overturningDonald Trump's policies through whatever executive actions and orders he isable to accomplish. And that's because I don't think the left is reallyinterested in unity. They are interested in payback right now.BAIER: Susan, your headline? And you actually may know what the headline istomorrow, so just tell us about it.(LAUGHTER)PAGE: My headline is White House holds third news briefing in three days,which you wouldn't think would be newsworthy, except it hasn't happened inthe past several years. The day will come when the Biden White House isprobably sorry they have a commitment for a Monday through Friday newsbriefing, but I can tell you, as a reporter, as a journalist, I am glad weare getting back to that.BAIER: Here, here. Ben, headline?DOMENECH: Joe Biden miraculously cures coronavirus. It's going to be theheadline from here on out through the first 100 days, it's just going toget better and better. Just expect it, everything has turned the corner,it's all getting better now.BAIER: Hey, you know what, let's hope that's true. Let's hope it's true.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: All right, panel, thank you very much.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That is it for this SPECIALREPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.
