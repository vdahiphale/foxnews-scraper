Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Right now, President Obama's playing a terrible game with your health care and frankly not only is it wrong, I think it's mean.
What's the game? By the end of June, it is possible that the Supreme Court could strike down subsidies under ObamaCare for those residents in states where the ObamaCare exchange was set up by the feds and not by their state government. That could impact up to 8 million people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No one knows for certain how the Supreme Court will rule, but it could easily go either way. And if the subsidies do get struck down for the almost 8 million, is the Obama administration ready? Does it have a Plan B for the almost 8 million impacted? Nope. And worse, apparently, the Obama administration could not be bothered. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Here is Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell testifying before Congress. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

SYLVIA BURWELL, HEALTH AND HUMAN RESOURCES SECRETARY: The question of having a plan -- we don't have an administrative action that we believe can undo the damage. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

So that's it? No plan? Well, what about the Republicans? Well, give them some credit for trying to come up with a solution, but certainly not much, because they are stepping all over each other. They can't agree on a plan among themselves. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is so appalling. Nearly 8 million could be sent into health care hell, and both parties know all about the risk. They have known about it for more than a year, and neither has a feasible plan. It's very disappointing. And, yes, I think selfish and mean. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
