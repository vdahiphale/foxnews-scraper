This week, the Senate will conduct a Trumpimpeachment trial for the second time and in a House, the split between hissupporters and critics is creating deep divisions inside the RepublicanParty.In a moment, we'll speak with Congresswoman Liz Cheney in her firstinterview since surviving an attempt to remove her from leadership forbacking impeachment. But, first, let's turn to Mike Emanuel with what weknow about this week's trial.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The charge fromDemocrats that former president Trump incited a violent mob, causing theriot at the capitol on January 6th. Top Democrats say the trial will befair and speedy.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  Senators will have to look deep into theirconsciences and determine if Donald Trump is guilty.EMANUEL:  House impeachment managers ask the former president to testifyunder oath. The Trump legal team called it a stunt and rejected it. Detailsin terms of format, timeline and witnesses are still unknown.Many in the GOP argue it's unconstitutional to try a former president.SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN):  Democrats are now wanting to get this overas quickly as they can. They're beginning to realize they may have opened adoor they did not want to open.EMANUEL:  On the House side, Republican conference chair Liz Cheney, whovoted for impeachment, was censured Saturday by the GOP in her home stateof Wyoming. Cheney survived a challenge of her leadership post this weekand won big, 145-61.REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  We're not going to be divided and that we're notgoing to be in a situation where people can pick off any member ofleadership.EMANUEL:  House Democrats and 11 Republicans voted Thursday to removeGeorgia Republican freshman Marjorie Taylor Greene from the Education andBudget Committees. Greene addressed statements she made in conspiracytheories she supported before being elected.TAYLOR GREENE:  I'm sorry for saying all those things that are wrong andoffensive and I sincerely mean that.(END VIDEOTAPE)EMANUEL (on camera):  House GOP leaders are eager to shift the focus toSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats and trying to win back the majoritynext year -- Chris.WALLACE:  Mike Emanuel reporting from Capitol Hill -- Mike, thanks.And joining us now, Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney, still the numberthree Republican in the House.Congresswoman, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday."REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  Great to be back with you, Chris. Thanks forhaving me.WALLACE:  So, as Mike Emanuel just reported, yesterday, your home stateWyoming Republican Party censured you and called for you to resignimmediately, saying that you had betrayed the trust of Wyoming voters.Are you going to step down?CHENEY:  I'm not, Mike, and, Chris, sorry.And, look, I think people all across Wyoming understand and recognize thatour most important duty is to the Constitution. And as I've explained andwill continue to explain to supporters all across the state and voters allacross the state, the oath that I took to the Constitution compelled me tovote for impeachment and it doesn't bend to partisanship, it doesn't bendto political pressure. It's the most important oath that we take.And so I will stand by that and I will continue to fight for all of theissues that matter so much to us all across Wyoming.WALLACE:  They debated -- your home state Republican Party, they debatedfor 11 minutes before deciding to censure you, the congresswoman, thenumber three Republican in the House. What's that about?CHENEY:  Well, I think you have to read the language of the censure partly.I think, you know, that people in the party are mistaken. They believe thatBLM and Antifa were behind what happened here at the Capitol. It's justsimply not the case, not true and we're going to have a lot of work we haveto do.People have been lied to. The extent to which the president, PresidentTrump for months leading up to January 6th spread the notion that theelection had been stolen or that the election was rigged was a lie andpeople need to understand that. We need to make sure that we as Republicansare the party of truth that we are being honest about what really didhappen in 2020 so we actually have a chance to win in 2022 and win theWhite House back in 2024.WALLACE:  You know, there really, Congresswoman, are two questions here,one of which is the role of President Trump. That's going to be debated inthe Senate next week but also the future of the Republican Party. InWashington this week, you survived a challenge to your position as theHouse Republican conference chair.But there was fierce blowback to your decision to vote to impeach thepresident. Take a look at some of that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  She didn't just go vote her conscience on the dayof the vote, she spoke ahead of time, 36 hours, put out a statement.REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  Why is it that America has such a disappointingCongress? Because in a lot of ways, Liz Cheney is exactly like Congress!Deeply unpopular and owned by special interests.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Does it bother you that there was more open outrage among HouseRepublicans to your vote to impeach the president, a vote of conscience, asyou say, then to the years of misstatements by Congresswoman MarjorieTaylor Greene?CHENEY:  Look, I think that, first of all, with respect to CongressmanGreene, we've all been very clear. The things that she has said don't haveany place in our public discourse and we as a Republican conference shoulddeal with that issue. We should have dealt with it. That's not somethingthe Democrats should be addressing on the floor of the House, we shouldhave dealt with that.With respect to where we are as a party, I think this boat and conferencemade very clear, we are the party of Lincoln, we are not the party of QAnonor anti-Semitism or Holocaust-deniers, or white supremacy or conspiracytheories. That's not who we are.We believe in conservative principles and conservative values and webelieve in the Constitution.And the extent to which -- if you think about the threats that the nationfaces, you think about what happened on January 6th, I talked to OfficerSicknick's mother this week and I pledged to her as I know many of mycolleagues have that we will not forget what happened on January 6th andthat the single greatest threat to our republic is a president who wouldput his own self-interest above the Constitution, above the nationalinterest.You know, we've had a situation where President Trump claimed for monthsthat the election was stolen and that apparently set about to do everythinghe could to steal it himself, and that ended up in an attack on thecapitol, five people killed that day. That's the kind of attack that cannever happen again.Our institutions held, but we all have an obligation to make sure that theycontinue to do so and don't look past what happened on January 6th. We --you know, it was just over a month ago.WALLACE:  I just want to ask -- (CROSSTALK)WALLACE:  I just want to ask you one more question about January 6th. Whenyou voted to impeach the president, you said this, he, quote, summoned thismob, assembled the mom and lit the flame of this attack. Everything thatwas followed was his doing. There has never been a greater betrayal by thepresident of the United States of his office and his oath to theConstitution.Congresswoman, one of the things you certainly are is a straight talker.Would you vote to convict President Trump of incitement of insurrection?CHENEY:  If I were in the Senate, I would obviously listen to the evidence.I think that's the role the Senate has as jurors.But I would also point out, though, Chris, that the Senate trial is asnapshot. There's a massive criminal investigation underway. There will bea massive criminal investigation of everything that happened on January 6thand in the days before. People will want to know exactly what the presidentwas doing.They want to know, for example, whether the tweet he sent out calling VicePresident Pence a coward while the attack was underway, whether that tweet,for example, was a premeditated effort to provoke violence. There are a lotof questions that have to be answered and there will be many, many criminalinvestigations looking at every aspect of this and everyone who wasinvolved, as there should be.But I stand firmly by my statement. We have never seen that kind of anassault by a president of the United States on another branch of governmentand that can never happen again.WALLACE:  So, just to press that, if you were in the Senate, would you voteto convict?CHENEY:  If I were in the Senate, I would listen to the testimony. I wouldlisten to the evidence. If you're a senator you have a responsibility to bea juror and I think that's very important.But I obviously believe and did then that what we already know is enoughfor his impeachment. What we already know does constitute the gravestviolation of his oath of office by any president in the history of thecountry, and this is not something that we can simply look past or pretenddidn't happen or try to move on. We've got to make sure this never happensagain.WALLACE:  I want to pick up on -- because you criticized at the verybeginning, you criticized Democrats for voting to strip Marjorie TaylorGreene of all of her committees. After the House voted this week to removeher from those committees, you issued a statement and you said this:Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat majority have no business determining whichRepublicans sit on committees.But, Congresswoman, your GOP caucus debated this issue and ended up givingCongresswoman Greene a standing ovation.So, can you really blame Democrats for moving to act when the HouseRepublican caucus didn't?CHENEY:  We should have, Chris. This is exactly the kind of issue that weshould address inside of our conference. You know, if you get into asituation where whoever has the majority in the House decides who sits oncommittees from both parties, you might as will not have anybody in theminority on any committees.So it should not have gotten to the point that it did. I don't believe theDemocrats have any business determining who from the Republicans sit oncommittees, but we should have dealt with it ourselves. And I think it's --it's very important that we are absolutely clear that those views and thosebeliefs do not have any place in our public discourse. And, you know, wewill want to see action now from Congresswoman Greene, you know, that backsup the kinds of words that we've seen over the last few days and the kindsof apologies.But we have to be very clear, that's not who we are as a party.WALLACE:  I mean, that, of course, is the question, whether it is who youare as a party or not because all of this gets to where the GOP is.Here was Congresswoman Greene's defense on the House floor this week. Takea look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA):  I never said any of these things sinceI have been elected for Congress. These were words of the past and thesethings do not represent me. You see school shootings are absolutely real. Ialso want to tell you 9/11 absolutely happened.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  You say that her opinions have, your words, no place in theparty, but she said this week that she raised $330,000 in 48 hours and thatPresident Trump supports her.And I want to remind you that just the week before last, your HouseRepublican leader, Kevin McCarthy, met with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago andsaid the former president will campaign for Republicans in the 2022elections.So the question is, is this still the party of Donald Trump? And doesMarjorie Taylor Greene still hold a solid place in that party?CHENEY:  Chris, we're the party of Abraham Lincoln. We're the party ofRonald Reagan. We have to really take a hard look at who we are and what westand for and what we believe in.I think when you look at both his actions leading up to what happened onJanuary 6th, the fact that he was impeached in a bipartisan fashion, thefact that he lost the presidency, the fact that we lost the Senate, we haveto be in a position where we can say we stand for principle, we stand forideal.Somebody who has provoked an attack on the United States capital to preventthe counting of electoral votes, which resulted in five people dying, whorefused to stand up immediately when he was asked and stop the violence,that -- that is a person who does not have a role as a leader of our partygoing forward.We have to make sure that we are able to convey to the American voters, weare the party of responsibility, we are the party of truth, that weactually can be trusted to handle the challenges this nation faces likeCOVID and that's going to require us to focus on substance and policy andissues going forward but we should not be embracing the former president.WALLACE:  All right, let's focus on the other side for a moment. Joe Bidenhas been president for two and a half weeks, how's he doing?CHENEY:  You know, it's really -- it's heartbreaking in many ways, Chris,because, you know, we watched the inaugural speech where he spoke of unity,where he spoke of trying to work together in the immediate actions we'veseen with respect to, you know, things like canceling the Keystonepipeline, it's heartless. It really is.The people that are being put out of work, when you look at the ban onadditional permits for oil and gas leasing on public lands -- you know, mystate of Wyoming not only is absolutely devastating to our energy industry,but the resources that come from those leases are what we used to fund ourschools. It's what we used to fund services in our local communities.So we've seen a number of immediate executive orders that really are verydamaging, very negative, and the COVID package that's been proposed, the$1.9 trillion, even Larry Summers has said that, you know, this could causereal fiscal challenges for us. It could bring increased inflationarypressures.So I think that we really do have to fight back against, stand up againstthe kind of far left governing that we've seen so far out of the Bidenadministration.WALLACE:  Congresswoman Cheney, thank you. Thanks for your time. Alwaysgood to talk with you.CHENEY:  You too, Chris. Thanks for having me.WALLACE:  Up next, Republican Senator Rand Paul on why he calls this week'simpeachment trial dead on arrival.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  The Senate impeachment trial starts on Tuesday and in order toconvict Donald Trump, at least 17 Republican senators will need to joinwith all 50 Democrats. That's an unlikely move considering most Republicanshave already indicated they think the trial is unconstitutional. Joining us now from Kentucky, GOP Senator Rand Paul.Senator, we'll get to the procedural questions about the Senate trial thatI know you're concerned about in a moment but first, you just heard LizCheney. Does President Trump bear any responsibility from the attack on the Capitolon January 6th? SENATOR RAND PAUL, (R-KY):  I opposed the notion of -- which I think was amisguided notion, a voting to overturn the election either with Congress orwith the vice president. But I think if we are going to criminalize speechand somehow impeach everybody who says, oh, go fight to hear your voicesheard, really we ought to impeach Chuck Schumer then. He went to the Supreme Court, stood in front of the Supreme Court and saidspecifically, hey Gorsuch, hey Kavanaugh, you've unleashed a whirlwind andyou're going to pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you continuewith these awful decisions. This inflammatory wording, this violent rhetoric of Chuck Schumer was sobad that the chief justice, who rarely says anything publicly, immediatelysaid this kind of language is dangerous as a mob tried to invade theSupreme Court. So if people want to hold President Trump accountable for language, therehas to be a consistent standard and to my mind it's a partisan farcebecause they're not doing anything to Chuck Schumer, not doing anything toRepresentative Omar, not doing anything to Maxine Waters. It's just notfair. It's just partisan politics under a different name. WALLACE:  This is the case that Republicans -- rather the Democratic housemanagers will make before the Senate this next week. They will note thatMr. Trump tweeted his followers a number of tweets, but one of them to cometo a big protest on January 6th. "Be there, will be wild," he wrote. And then they will play videos of what happened that day, what he said, howthey reacted. We made our own compilation of those, including some clipsthat are circulating on the Internet. Take a look, Senator. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We fight, we fight likehell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a countryanymore. UNKNOWN:  Raid the Capitol! Raid the Capitol! UNKNOWN:  Vote (ph) for Trump! Vote (ph) for Trump! (CROSSTALK) UNKNOWN:  They're traitors -- (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE:  Senator, you talk about other people who have said things, butyou know, here there had been weeks of misrepresentations about theelection. Then he called people to come to Washington. Then he talks aboutfighting like hell. People in the crowd are talking about going to theCapitol and then they demand to find Speaker Pelosi and to hang Mike Pence,the vice president of the United States. Is that not incitement for insurrection? PAUL:  I don't condone any of the language and, like I say, I opposedphilosophically and voted against overturning the election. However, Ithink you're going to see the Trump defense play video of Maxine Waterstelling crowds to mob Trump administration and restaurants and attack them. They'll probably show clips of Cory Booker saying, get up in their face ofthese Congress people. You'll probably see comments from RepresentativeOmar wishing and celebrating the violence that happened to me when I hadsix ribs broken and part of my lung removed. I think you're going to see all of this and people are going to have tojudge for themselves, are we going to impeach and potentially criminallyprosecute people for political speech when they get -- say, get up andfight for your country, let your voices be heard. Has nobody in this country heard of figurative speech? You could argue thathis position was wrong and that it was misguided. I accept all of that. Butif you're going to criminalize his speech, you have to do it with the samestandard. You can't just criminalize Republican speech and ignore all theDemocrats who have incited violence. Look at the mayor of Seattle. She went on and on about this being a summerof love. Kamala Harris went forward and said, we should bail out theseviolent protesters. One of them has gotten out three times, committedcrimes three times, including cracking the skull -- fracturing the skulland causing a brain injury after Kamala Harris advocated for getting himout of prison. So the thing is we can't just have a double standard. Both parties have tobe treated the same. WALLACE:  OK.  PAUL:  I think Democrats had any bit of self-reflection, they would besaying this is a really terrible idea. WALLACE:  All right, let's talk about the other issue, which is the onethat you raised I guess a week and a half ago, which is whether this wholeprocedure, this whole trial is constitutional. You offered a motion contending it is not because you said a formerpresident, a president who has left office, cannot be the subject of aSenate trial. The other side argues that under that standard, a presidentcould abuse his power, quit at the last minute, and could not be heldaccountable by the Senate for -- obviously, if it's a legal crime he couldbe but for a political crime, the Senate would be unable to touch him underyour standards. PAUL:  I think that argument ignores the fact that yes, the president canbe prosecuted. And if they think he incited a riot or an insurrection --which is such an overstatement and such a conclusion without any sort ofpresentation of evidence, all the left-wing media just concludes it. But the thing is, yes, they can take them to court, they can take them totrial and do it. I think he has suffered under public opinion and hisnumbers are greatly reduced. And so I think there's all kinds of punishment. But we have to -- look,we've had a country for 250 years and every other congress thought it wasunwise to keep going after an ex-president. Constitutional scholars -- WALLACE:  But -- PAUL:  -- and professional (inaudible) have said that the constitution saysyou impeach and disqualify. If the person isn't there to impeach, you can'tdo either one of them. And so there are constitutional experts (inaudible)-- WALLACE:  But Senator Paul, that's -- PAUL:  Also (inaudible) of my colleagues would say -- WALLACE:  Senator Paul, that's not quite true. If I may, if I may. In 1876,the then-secretary of war, Will Belknap, serving under Ulysses S. Grant wasabout to be impeached for accepting bribes. He raced to the White House andresigned but the house impeached him anyway. And the Senate decided that it had the authority to try him. And it did tryhim and although a majority sought to remove him and to convict him, theydidn't get the two-thirds. But isn't that, the 1876 case of WilliamBelknap, a solid precedent? PAUL:  No. Because we've never impeached a president because we alwaysthought it would destroy and tear up the country and divide us further. The thing is, is when you look at impeaching the president the constitutionhas some very specific requirements. It says when the president isimpeached, the chief justice shall preside. And to me, this is one of the shocking things. When we showed up and wefound out that yes, Chuck Schumer had called Justice Roberts -- and thishasn't been reported widely, but he did -- and Justice Roberts said heck,no, I'm not going to cross the street because you're not impeaching thepresident. This was a strong signal to all of us that this was going to be a partisanhearing with a Democrat in the chair who's already voted for impeachment.You think we're going to get any fair rulings out of a Democrat that'salready expressed favor for impeaching him previously and is going to votethis time to impeach him? So it is a farce, it is unconstitutional. But more than anything it'sunwise, and going to divide the country. If Biden thinks he really -- if he really meant anything about that unityand he really wanted to be a statesman, you know what he would have done?He would have come out and told his party enough's enough, let's move on,we won the election and let's move on with our agenda. But instead, they can't let go of President Trump and they're going to keepkicking and kicking and kicking. But to the rest of the country and to mostof the Republicans, it looks like bitter rancor that they can't get theelection -- they can't get over the election. WALLACE:  Senator, I've got about a minute left. I want to ask you a coupleof quick procedural questions. Do you think the senate will call witnesses, how long do you think thetrial will last, and is there any chance that the Senate will vote toconvict Donald Trump? PAUL:  Zero chance of conviction, 45 Republicans have said it's not even alegitimate proceeding so it's really over before it starts. As far as witnesses, i think unlikely to be witnesses. If they do wantwitnesses there's going to be so much evidence that the president hadnothing to do with this; it was planned previously on Facebook, the bombswere planted the night before. People were attacking the Capitol whoweren't part of the speech, they were already attacking the Capitol whilehe was just beginning to give the speech down there. There's all kinds ofevidence that goes against them. The FBI's investigating all these people and --  WALLACE:  And -- PAUL:  The people who are being investigated -- WALLACE:  -- how long do you -- PAUL:  -- are being investigated for plotting this in advance. WALLACE:  And, Senator, how long do you think it'll last? PAUL:  Hopefully, as short as possible because is really bad for thecountry so I'm for getting it over within a couple of days and moving on.And look, let's debate policy and let's quit sort of just all thiscraziness that everything has to be about attacking President Trump. WALLACE:  Senator Paul, thank you. Thanks for joining us today; always goodto talk with you, sir.PAUL:  Thank you.WALLACE:  Up next, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy on holding PresidentTrump accountable for the capitol riots even after he's left office.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  Coming up, Democrats clear the way to vote on a massive COVIDrelief package along party lines.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN:  I'd like to be - ]I'd like to be doing it with the support ofRepublicans, but they're just not willing to go as far as I think we haveto go.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether that's the end forbipartisanship when we come right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump comes at a time whenthe new Senate Democratic majority is eager to focus on President Biden'sagenda, but they are still determined to hold Mr. Trump accountable for theattack on the Capital on January 6th.Joining us now from Connecticut, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy.Senator, I want to start off where I left off with -- with Senator Paul. Noone in Washington thinks that the Senate is going to vote to convict DonaldTrump this week, but you're going to relive all of the anger, all thedivision of January 6th, you're going to interrupt the Biden presidencyagenda.I guess the question is, to what end?SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Well, let me answer that in two ways.First, I think we have a constitutional responsibility to hold this trial.And I think you laid this out for Senator Paul, there is clear precedentfor the Senate moving forward on impeachment trial, once being sentarticles, even after an official has left office. And so, you know, myanalysis here sort of begins and ends with what is my constitutionalresponsibility. I don't think our job ends just because a president hasleft office, in part because impeachment comes not only with the provisionto remove an official from office, but to disqualify them for futureoffice. So there is still a consequence to President Trump if convicted.And, second, this doesn't stop the rest of the business we're considering.In fact, the Senate can walk and chew gum at the same time. We will nextweek. We'll start off on Monday by confirming another cabinet nominee bythe president. We will likely hold hearings and committees next week tomove other nominees forward. And because last week we moved forward theprocess on the COVID relief bill that is going to save this country'seconomy, we will also spend next week writing that legislation, workinghopefully with Republicans like Rand Paul to make it bipartisan in the end.The Senate's going to do all three things next week. We're going to do ourconstitutional responsibility and hold a trial. It won't last very long. Weare going to move forward nominees and we are going to continue to pushforward COVID relief legislation. The Senate can do all of those things,and we will.WALLACE: I just want to lock this down because I'm not sure that this hadbeen said yet. You are going to set rules that allow for a bifurcatedprocess where you can do things in the morning before 1:00 p.m. and then goto the Senate trial after 1:00, that's been approved?MURPHY: So I -- I think the -- the exact rules of the trial are still beinglocked down, but normally you would start a trial at noon and that wouldallow you, through the committee process, to continue to hold hearings,getting nominees ready for action on the Senate during the morning. Andthroughout the day we will also be working on making sure that those $2,000checks are teed up for passage, that the new money for vaccines is ready togo. We'll do all of that work next week while we are also moving forwardwith impeachment.WALLACE: Will Senate Democrats vote to call witnesses, and how long willthe trial last?MURPHY: Well, I think we should be consistent. Obviously we were verystrongly in favor of witnesses during the first impeachment trial. We werevery disappointed when the House asked for the ability to call witnessesand Senate Republicans denied them that ability. So if the House managerswant to call witnesses, then I think we should allow them to do so.It's a different trial in the sense that, you know, in the first trial wedidn't see what happens. The American public didn't have a window into thedecisions that were being made behind closed doors to trade Americaninfluence in order for campaign help. This time we saw what happened inreal time, President Trump sent that angry mob to the Capitol on live TV.So it's not as important that you have witnesses, but if the House managerswant witnesses, we should allow them to be able to put them on.WALLACE: All right, there -- there are two issues here that I explored withSenator Paul and I want to do the same with you. One is the case, one isthe Constitution. Let's go to the case first.Did the president insight this mob to attack the Capitol? There's noquestion that he fired up the crowd, but he also said this, Senator.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (January 6, 2021): I know that everyonehere will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully andpatriotically make your voices heard.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: A number of legal scholars say that does not come close to thelegal standard of inciting violence.MURPHY: Well, of course you played a clip for Senator Paul in which he saidwe need to fight like hell to preserve our democracy. And that reallystands in context, right? But (INAUDIBLE) had spent --WALLACE: But in this -- well, wait, but in this clip he talked aboutpeacefully and -- and patriotically going to the Capitol.MURPHY: Right. So he -- he incited people to go fight like hell, then hesaid something different. And then as they were attacking the Capitol, hehad a chance, right, as the insurrection was beginning, to tell them tostand down.I was in the Senate chamber literally as those rioters were outside ourdoors while we were being locked down in the Senate chamber. Instead ofsending out a tweet saying that everybody should leave the Capitol,President Trump sent out a tweet attacking Mike Pence, the very person thatthose rioters were there to hang. And so even as the riot was occurring,the president had a chance to turn it around and instead he incited it,knowing what was happening at the Capitol. So I think the case isabsolutely clear both in that rally at the White House and during the riotitself, the president was taking steps to make it worse, not better.And there is, of course, reporting from inside the White House thatsuggests the president was slow walking the response because he was veryhappy with what was happening over at the -- at the United States Capitol.WALLACE: Senator --MURPHY: So I think once all that evidence is put on, there will be nochoice but to convict.WALLACE: Senator Rand Paul also brings up the question of being consistentif you're going to sanction political speech. And he notices -- or he -- henoted a statement made by Congresswoman Maxine Waters back in 2018 whenthere was a furor over's family separation.Take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): And if you see anybody from that cabinet in arestaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out andyou create a crowd! And you push back on them.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: In fact, protesters did for a period of time harass, get in theface, of Republican officials, cabinet officials, elected officials inWashington.Is that incitement? Should that be sanctioned?MURPHY: There is no comparison. This was an effort to overturn an election,in and of itself an unconstitutional endeavor. This was a crowd of tens ofthousands of people. The president had access to intelligence to tell himthat there were individuals there who were intending to storm the Capitol.And then, once again while the attack was happening, the president had theability to turn them around and he didn't.The circumstances are completely different. The president's responsibilityis completely different, especially as the actual attack was happening. Ijust think these are all false equivalencies by Republicans that don't wantto face facts. And, frankly, there's a lot of Republicans that feeldifferently. I think the conviction will be a bipartisan vote. I think it'salso very important to know that many Republicans in the House ofRepresentatives believes that the president's conduct was impeachable.That's different than the trial that we can (INAUDIBLE) a year ago.WALLACE: Well, only ten -- ten voted to impeach on the vast majoritydidn't.I want to -- I've got less than two minute left, sir, and I want to ask youone final question, which gets to the constitutional issue, whether it'slegal to try a former president.Article one, section three of the Constitution says this, judgment in casesof impeachment shall not extend further than removal from office anddisqualification to hold and enjoy an office of honor, trust, and profitunder the United States.The argument is you have to remove, by that language, before you candisqualify and you can't do that and you can't remove because PresidentTrump is already out of office.MURPHY: So, listen, I will admit that this is, of course, a matter of firstimpression. And so I don't think the case that Senator Paul is making hereis a ridiculous one.I come to a different judgment. I think that that clause that givesCongress the responsibility to deny an official future office requires usto take this step even though the president has left office. And, ofcourse, as you cited there, is precedent for that. It sets up a strangecircumstance by which a president or any official could very quickly resignto preserve their right to run later on even though they engaged in prettyserious misconduct.So I think we have this responsibility. But I -- listen, I admit thatSenator Paul's case is, you know, not from outer space.WALLACE: Well, and that -- and these days in Washington, saying something'snot from outer space is a compliment.Senator Murphy, thank you. Thanks for coming in today. And, of course,we'll be tracking the Senate trial this week.MURPHY: Thank you.WALLACE: Up next, Joe Biden says he doesn't think Mr. Trump should receivethe intelligence briefings former presidents usually get. We'll bring inour Sunday group to discuss this break from tradition. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NORAH O'DONNELL, CBS NEWS: Should former President Trump still receiveintelligence briefings?JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think not. What value isgiving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, otherthan the fact he might slip and say something?(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Joe Biden in his first television interview as president tellingCBS Anchor Norah O'Donnell he's concerned about giving Mr. Trump classifiedinformation.And it's time now for our Sunday group.GOP strategist Karl Rove, Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for"The Wall Street Journal," and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams.Well, Catherine, I didn't realize that this issue had been percolatingaround the White House this week. Good for Norah for asking the question.Was this just President Biden expressing an opinion, or is this now policythat President Trump is going to be cut off from getting classifiedinformation?CATHERINE LUCEY, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL": Yes, Chris, that's right, thishad been brought up, there have been questions asked about how this wasgoing to work. Typically, former presidents do get access to some amount ofclassified information and briefings, especially if they're doing some kindof travel or overseas work.Our understanding is, you know, President Biden was expressing a lot ofconcern here. You heard those words. They are very strong. But the WhiteHouse is saying that he was expressing his concern and an opinion and thatultimately he trusts his intelligence team to determine what to do if Trumpdoes seek a briefing.But it really is important to note here just how serious and howunprecedented this is, the fact that the president is raising theseconcerns about him being a security risk.WALLACE: Karl, as the one person in his group who has worked with apresident and a former president, why do former presidents get intelbriefings, how often do they get them, and what do you think of thepossibility that this administration might cut off President Trump?KARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well,first it's a courtesy extended from a president to a former president, orformer presidents. And it's to keep them abreast of world affairs,sometimes to keep them from getting off the reservation in the case perhapsof Jimmy Carter, or because they might be called upon to give advice andcounsel to the current president. And so it is a courtesy. It's at thediscretion of the president. There's no mandatory requirement, no statutethat requires it.My suspicion is, is that if former President Trump were to ask forsomething, for a briefing on an issue that concerns, say, for example,foreign travel for him, that they might extend it, but this is entirely atthe courtesy -- as a courtesy and entirely at the decision of the sittingadministration.WALLACE: Juan, I -- there was a very interesting exchange in the interview.At one point Norah O'Donnell asked President Biden, what's your worst fearabout what might happen, and he said, I hesitate to speculate out loud.The implication seemed to be that he was worried that if President Trumpgot classified information, he might just share it with somebody else.JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. I think, Chris, you know,President Biden, I think, was being polite, respectful. But in plainlanguage, I think what he's saying is that President Trump can't be trustedwith classified information. And, you know, let's be honest here, I don'tthink President Trump could pass the lowest level clearance for gettingsecure information. This man, you know, is estimated to owe $400 million atthe moment. Forbes estimates it at a billion dollars. He has lots ofbusiness overseas. He owes money to foreign banks. So I think that whatyou're seeing here is an expression of politeness from President Biden insimply saying that in his judgment it's not appropriate at this moment.I think you have to keep that in mind because, you know, it's also the caseTrump is -- I think it's fair to say a bitter defeated man who, you know,believes in conspiracy theories and the like. But I think the mostimportant thing is that, you know, Biden feels it's important to keep himat a distance, because, as Karl was saying, this is not just a courtesy,but oftentimes that you rely on a former president to give you advice aboutforeign difficulties overseas. And I don't think Biden is going to rely onPresident Trump in that way.WALLACE: Yes, I think a lot of these presidents don't rely on formerpresidents to give them counsel, including, as you mentioned, Jimmy Carter,Karl.And then let's turn -- switch subjects because there was another notabledevelopment in Washington this week, and that was the move by congressionalDemocrats in the Senate and the House to set the stage for passing COVIDrelief, this huge package, currently slated at $1.9 trillion on a straight,party line vote, Democrats jamming it through Congress, especially theSenate.Here was President Biden this week on that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I believe the American peopleare looking right now to their government for help to do our job, to notlet them down. So I'm going to act and I'm going to act fast.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Catherine, you know, it seemed that there was a noticeable changein a president's tone this week from that meeting early in the week in theOval Office for two hours with a number of Republican senators who had comeup with a very different plan, to the end of the week when you had theSenate setting the stage for a straight party line vote.Is that where you think Joe Biden is now, full speed ahead, we're going toget this thing through on a straight, Democratic vote and forget aboutbipartisanship?LUCEY: I think this was a notable moment, Chris. You really did hear Bidensay, you know, he was prepared to move forward with or without Republicans,which given that he has, you know, campaigned and long-held himself assomeone who can work at a bipartisan way, this is a key moment.That said, I mean, his staff is still staying they would like to talk toRepublicans, they want to incorporate Republican ideas if they can, thatthey are really saying that this is an urgent moment and they don't thinkthat they can wait. They're citing the latest jobs report and they've alsotalked about the fact that, you know, the president said this on Friday,that he thinks that in 2009 Democrats didn't go big enough with economicrelief.One other thing that I think we are going to see more of from them is thatthey're really counting on the idea that -- that there is Republicansupport from voters around the country, you know, even if they're notgetting a lot of Republican support on The Hill.WALLACE: Right.LUCEY: And so they've been -- they've been pitching this plan naturally,they're talking to governors, they're talking to mayors and they've beenreally citing polling that shows some level of bipartisan support. And Iwould expect to hear more from that on them.WALLACE: Karl, I've got just a minute left.The president says I'd like some Republican buy-in here, but he also saysthat his job one, his top priority, is to get this money, hundreds ofbillions of dollars, close to $2 trillion, to Americans as fast aspossible.Is he making a mistake moving off bipartisanship?ROVE: A big mistake.WALLACE: He's only been in office two and a half weeks.ROVE: Yes. Yes, big mistake. The only bipartisan about this is thecriticism of it. The Obama economics czar Larry Summers and Senator PhilGraham wrote op-eds in "The Wall Street Journal" criticizing the size ofthe package and its bad design.Look, this is a rush and it's an unnecessary rush. For the first time sincethe passage of the 1974 Budget Act, the Budget Committee has had no hearingon a budget resolution. Instead, the leadership is writing the budgetresolution, bringing it to the floor without passing it through acommittee. They're cutting corners left and right. We're going to end upwith a badly designed bill.They can wish all they want by pointing towards polls showing Republicanssupport it, but that same thing was around in 2009, Republicans in pollingsaid we like the stimulus and it blew up in the Democrats face in 2010.WALLACE: Panel, we have to take a break here, but when we come back,tonight's big game in Tampa and a prediction on this program some monthsago that came true. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Well, we're just hours away from Super Bowl IV. And for those ofyou who are surprised by tonight's match up, you weren't watching thisprogram on the opening Sunday of the NFL season when Fox Sports announcerJoe Buck made this prediction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BUCK, FOX SPORTS LEAD PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER: I think the Tampa BayBuccaneers collectively, they will be a team that will get to thepostseason this year and -- and really, I believe, be a threat to make itto the Super Bowl.WALLACE: We're going to mark this tape, Joe. If you -- I mean if they endup, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in the Super Bowl, I promise you we will playthis tape next -- next February.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: A gutsy prediction from Joe Buck, although I'm not sure how gutsyit is when you're picking Tom Brady.Juan, I'm going to go out on a limb here and yours -- and say that you'rethe biggest sports fan in his group.Who's going to win the Super Bowl and why?WILLIAMS: Well, if I was with you in Vegas, Chris, I'd have to bet on theKansas City Chiefs. They -- they're the better team. They have the betterrecord. They are coming back to the Super Bowl. We were in Miami last yearfor it and we saw them put on an incredible show against San Francisco. Sofor all those reasons, I would have to say, they are going to win the SuperBowl.But I -- you know, I love a great story. So Tom Brady is the story. As aguy who once was a little bit of a sports writer, you can't beat a manwho's there for the tenth time. That's unbelievable!WALLACE: Karl, it's not quite Joe Buck vintage from last September, but inyour year-end column in December, you predicted that the Kansas City Chiefswere going to get back to the Super Bowl and win the Super Bowl.Are you sticking with that prediction?ROVE: I am, though I'm worried that the Kansas City's offensive tackle,Eric Fisher, is out with an Achilles tendon and the match-up, whoever theyput in his place to match up against the Buccaneers' Jason Pierre-Paul, theHaitian sensation, that's going to have a great deal to do with the outcomeof the game.And if it sounds like I know what I'm talking about, don't believe it. Igot this entirely from my hunting companion yesterday, Texas A&M CoachJimbo Fisher. Otherwise I'd be saying, yes, I'm with the -- I'm with the --I'm going with the --WALLACE: Yes, I was going to say -- all right, wait, wait, I've got to get-- I've get -- I've got to get Catherine in here and I knew that you hadn'tcome up with that on your own.Catherine, real quickly, is this a clean sweep, and you picking KC too?LUCEY: No -- you know, no one's ever confused me for a sports pundit, butI'm going to go with Tampa. I think Tom Brady is a man on a mission and hecould do it once more.WALLACE: Well, as I say, betting against Tom Brady is never a wiseprospect. And the game, of course, will be on tonight on another channel.Thank you, panel. See you next week.Now this program note, join me and the new Fox daytime lineup for coverageof former President Trump's second impeachment trial. That starts thisTuesday on Fox News Channel.And that's it for today.
