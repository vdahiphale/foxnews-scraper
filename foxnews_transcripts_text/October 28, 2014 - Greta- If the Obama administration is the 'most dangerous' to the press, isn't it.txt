'Off the Record,' 10/28/14: If the Obama administration is 'the most dangerous' to the press, it's most dangerous to you ... but what will the media do about it other than complain?

Let's all go "Off the Record" for a second. President Obama has been in the Oval Office for nearly six years and only now are some journalists calling him out for stomping all over the First Amendment and freedom of the press.
It's not just the Obama administration snooping on colleague, James Rosen, or "New York Times" reporter, James Risen, it's much more. It is the secrecy, what the Obama administration doesn't want you to know, what you should know. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Just ask former "New York Times" editor, Jill Abramson. She had the courage to speak out early when it was unpopular to call it like it is. Now the "USA Today's" Washington bureau chief, Susan Page, saying this about the Obama administration. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');

        }
      
SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, USA TODAY: My big fear is that this administration has been more restrictive and more challenging to the press, more dangerous to the press really than any administration in American history in terms of legal investigations and so on. And I think access to the White House has just gotten worse and worse.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
More dangerous to the press? Yeah, I know, no boo-hoo for the press. You don't feel sorry for us in the press, and I don't blame you. You might want to stop and think, if the Obama administration is dangerous to the press, that means it's dangerous to you. The press is the only way you learn about what the administration is doing or not doing, whether it be the IRS scandal or dropped balls when it comes to Ebola.
So if this administration, to use Susan Page's word, is the most "dangerous" to the press, what is the press going to do about it? Just complain? Or pound the president to keep his promise? Remember transparency? Yeah, right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
