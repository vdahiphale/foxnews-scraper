JESSE WATTERS, GUEST HOST: I'm Jesse Watters for Laura Ingraham and this is "The Ingraham Angle" from New York City tonight. Democrats dragging out the same old tired rhetoric as the 2020 White House race heats up. Using the politics of hate to try to turn voters away from President Trump.
But aren't they just creating more division in America plus if House Dems had enough of the radical new class of Congress, the rare vote this week to put him on notice and nearly 7000 illegals arrested just at one border crossing. The majority of them women and children so why are Democrats saying there's not a national emergency. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Plus MAGA under attack at schools across the country. This time students were told their Trump gear was disrespectful and offensive. The story and the debate ahead. But first Democrats deploying the politics of hate to try to win the White House in 2020. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They know they can't beat Trump on policy at all. They just can't do it. But there's more. This is what they're calling a crisis, not the influx of illegal immigrants rushing across the border, no. What constitutes a crisis to Democrats is an actual made up scenario of Trump creating darkness, watch this.

Hillary Clinton: This is a time my friends when fundamental rights, civic virtue, freedom of the press, the rule of law, truth, facts and reason are under assault. And make no mistake. We are living through a full-fledged crisis in our democracy.
SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND , D-N.Y.: I realize that what's happening in this country is devastating. I mean President Trump has created such division, such darkness, such hate.

WATTERS: Joining me now is Dan Bongino, Fox News Contributor and host of The Dan Bongino podcast. Leo Terrell, a civil rights attorney and Star Parker, President and the Founder of the Center for Urban Renewal and Education. Dan, hate is on the Right. The last time I looked, it was the Left that was fire-bombing limousines at the inauguration.
Hollywood's decapitating the President. You know, they're calling him a traitorous Nazi. Wherever I look, most of the hate's on that side, not on the right.
DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR & HOST, THE DAN BONGINO PODCAST: Jesse, I just got done watching Sean's show where they had a college kid on, who got decked in the face by a Berkeley kid who was upset he was recruiting for a conservative ballot.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I mean, it's almost ridiculous but then there's a tactical reason Democrats do this. They took a two-fold strategy years ago, right? They understand that their ideas only appeal to a limited portion of radicals. High taxes, government controlled healthcare, a monopoly on public education.
So what do they do Jesse? They knew they couldn't get you to vote for their ideas so they decided to paint Republicans as racist, hoping you would just vote against them and then maybe they'd get a majority once in a while. That in conjunction with stacking the courts, they think will get them across the finish line.
But they're the ones stoking division, not Republicans.

        }
      
WATTERS: And Leo, it's funny listening to crooked Hillary talking about the rule of law and how important it is for her. You know, the transition of power to President Trump has not been peaceful. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

I mean there's been stings, there's been leaks, there's been unmasking. Now they want to impeach the guy in the first term. Don't you think that would contribute to some of the crisis in the democracy that she's talking about?
LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: No, the crisis is very simple. The people down in Selma, what Hillary and Bernie were saying was that Donald Trump has polarized this country so bad on issues of race, his hatred and the issues are very simple.

        }
      
Donald Trump -- look at Charlottesville, look at the situation with Donald Trump talks about the issue of the of the Muslim ban and I will submit to you that Dan, Dan will tell this audience that Donald Trump has never said a racist thing, you know why?
Because Dan doesn't want -- Dan's afraid of Donald Trump and Dan will not admit that Donald Trump has said racist comments the last 3 years, isn't that true, Dan.

WATTERS: All right, let's just put personal attacks down for one second. Star Parker. We talk about division in this country. Leo right there demonstrated some divisiveness, came out with a personal attack, not on policy, all personal. How do you see it?
TERRELL: That's was personal? Yes.
STAR PARKER, CENTER FOR URBAN RENEWAL & EDUCATION: I see it as the Democrats have divided us a long time ago. They started about 50 years ago. They segmented us into all these little people populations and Donald Trump is bringing us all together. He's fixing everything for everyone and they hate it, they're coming in totally unglued and Selma is an example of the Left trying to take advantage of a point in history that has solved itself.

We are more United as the grass roots community of people, it's only the fringe of the Democrats and so they'll try to strip anything, they are losing the black community and they're losing the black vote and they're having problems with that.

PARKER: Let me tell you what he did say racist. That had anything to do with race. No, Dan, let me address it.
WATTERS: Let Star address it.
PARKER: Because this is important. Actually he has focused on the racial problems in our country by building out these opportunities on his own. We have 8700 opportunities and so on. He's going into the most critical areas in our country and trying to fix them. He made a political promise to the black community that he was going to fix the inner cities.

WATTERS: All right, listen, Dan, I'll give you 30 seconds to respond, go ahead.
BONGINO: Okay, Leo is clearly insane. I don't know how we managed to bypass the Booker. This guy's out of his mind. I'm sorry but Donald Trump - there has never been an allegation that Donald Trump was a racist until he ran for President as a Republican.

Leo was nuts, he's race baiting people on this show, he has no evidence of anything saying being true and he just lied to the audience saying that Muslims are banned from the United States. I was unaware of that because if you're a Muslim, you're allowed in the United States like anyone else.

He's making that up to bait me and Star. It's bait because he has no facts because he's been vaccinated against facts at early age like every other liberal. All we has is this garbage nonsense that Donald Trump is a racist. It's disgusting, it's disgraceful. He should be embarrassed for saying it.
WATTERS: All right, Leo, Leo, we're going to move on to another segment, we're going to give you another shot at this, okay? Because we're going to change topics, all right? Stay with us.

House Democrats now drafting a resolution condemning anti-Semitism in the wake of those remarks. Leland Vittert joins us in Washington with more. What's up Leland?
LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey Jesse, here tonight that draft resolution obtained by Fox news and circulating on the House side of Capitol Hill as you noted, it says anti-Semitism is bad but missing is the name of the person at the center of it all.
Ilhan Omar, the Congressman from Minnesota. Her latest questioning remark alleges and alludes to the long standing anti-Semitic claim that Jews can't be trusted because they might have split allegiances with Israel.

REP. ILHAN OMAR, D-MINN.: I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people for allegiance to a foreign country.

VITTERT: That earned her a swift rebuke from her Chairman on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, "her comments were outrageous and deeply hurtful," said Chairman Eliot Engel, "and I asked that she retract them and apologize, commit to making her case on policy issues without resorting to attacks that have no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee or the House of Representatives."
It's far from Omar's first encounter with charges of anti-Semitism, up until recently she defended a 2012 tweet saying Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."

In a Yahoo news article, she recently compare Israel to Iran. On February 11, she tweeted it's all about the Benjamin's baby, suggesting that Republican support for Israel is driven by campaign donations.
Omar defended her latest comments by tweeting yesterday. "I'm told every day that I'm anti-American if I'm not pro-Israel." This comes at an uncomfortable time for House leadership over the weekend, this cover of Rolling Stone magazine hit newsstands with Omar, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and two other House Democrats on the cover. The @Pelosi account tweeted out the cover.
Now Speaker Pelosi and her team must of course, deal with the division in their own caucus over how to sanction Omar. As you just heard Jesse, Eliot Engel questioned - seemed to question whether she even fit to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee while that draft resolution does not even mention her name.

WATTERS: All right, Leland, thank you. Back to the panel now. Dan, Leo and Star, I don't even think what matters is on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine because nobody even buys it anyway but Dan, it's not just Republicans saying, Omar has a problem with anti-Semitism.
It's Nancy Pelosi, the anti-defamation league, the Jewish policy Center have all calls her statements offensive and prejudiced. Do the Democrats have a problem with anti-Semitism.
BONGINO: They do and Jesse, to be fair I want to applaud the Democrats who've taken a stand against Representative Omar. This is clearly an anti- Semitic trope. She lobbed out there and just imagine and the way to do the test for racism or anti-Semitism is to replace the roles, right?
If we had accused Representative Omar of dual loyalty to a Middle-Eastern country, let's say, we would be accused of Islamophobia immediately.
WATTERS: Well, more than that, we'd be fired.
BONGINO: Oh, you'd be fired. You would be off the air.
WATTERS: This would be the last time you'd see Jesse.

WATTERS: And will Leo speak out against Congresswoman Omar, Leo.
TERRELL: Oh, well, let me just tell you right now. This is the beautiful part of the Democrat leadership. Omar has made anti-Semitic comments and the House leadership Jesse, is taking action unlike the Republican leadership and Dana and Star, they won't take action against Trump.
The House Democrats are going after Omar, saying that her comments are wrong but you see how the Republican leadership and Dan and Star--
WATTERS: Well, wait, wait, wait, Leo. I don't know if you've been awake for the last two years but the Republican leadership, any chance they get to criticize Trump, they do. They're always saying this and that. They're not in lockstep with the President.
TERRELL: Are you kidding me?

TERRELL: Mitch McConnell is in Trump's pocket. Dan and Star is in Trump's pocket because they're afraid of his Twitter. They're afraid of Trumps' Twitter.
PARKER: This guy has to stop saying that because maybe there are other reasons that we support President Trump.
TERRELL: It's true.
PARKER: Maybe we support him because he did move the Embassy to Jerusalem, a promise that had been put on the table for years, decades and then he finally did that. Maybe what we ought to do is be concerned that Louis Farrakhan right after Nancy Pelosi asked Omar to pull back on her anti- Semitic comments sent out to her but a shot out to say no, you need to keep going and now she's been emboldened.
And what she's trying to do--
TERRELL: Classic talking point. We're not about Farrakhan, we're not talking about Farrakhan. This is a talking point.
PARKER: Louis Farrakhan interject himself into this discussion which means now that the Democrat party has a problem because 70% to 80% of Jews in this country have voted for Democrats and now they're looking at all this anti-Semitic discussion so around--

TERRELL: On the issue of race and hatred, yes, that's true.
WATTERS: Okay, when Steve King made some controversial comments about race. He was stripped of all his committeships. Now have they stripped Omar of anything?
PARKER: They wouldn't take no to Foreign Relations committee.

PARKER: They didn't do anything and it's going to get worse because she's not the only one elected that has this challenge and for Leo to try to pretend that Louis Farrakhan is not part of this discussion.
TERRELL: Not pretend.
PARKER: He's fooling himself and trying to fool the rest of America.
TERRELL: Don't give me your typical talking points, Star. You don't--
BONGINO: You have not said anything but talking points. Jesse, let's just rehash this whole thing. Jesse, that Leo keeps calling out Star for talking points.

TERRELL: Dan is afraid. Dan does not want to lose his invitation. He's name calling.
WATTERS: Leo came on the show, name called, then when you say something back to him, he says, oh, you're name calling. Leo, everybody sees right through. Leo, we love you.

WATTERS: I think you'd be more afraid of Dan if you met him face to face, that's all I'm saying.

Republicans turn against the President and his national emergency. Former Acting ICE Director Tom Homan has seen the situation on the ground, first hand. He's here to respond to critics up next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP: We fight war 6000 miles away. We spend billions and billions of dollars. But we don't control our own border.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Hardworking people of every background pay the price for lack of border control and security. In the last two years, I saw officers make 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 or so.
And these are new numbers, hard to believe. 30,000 sex crimes and 4000 murders.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: President Trump today making the case for the national emergency at the border as it looks like he'll have the use his Veto powers for the first time.
As several Republican senators now say they will vote for a resolution to block his order. This as the crisis at the border intensifies by the day. Just last week, nearly 7000 illegals were arrested in the Rio Grande Valley. 1300 were caught in just one day alone.
Most women and children. And in New Mexico, nearly 200 illegals were apprehended near Sunland Park. The majority of those as well were families and unaccompanied minors so why are so many lawmakers denying, there's a national emergency? Garrett Tenney is live in DC tonight with the story. Garrett?
GARRETT TENNEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well Jesse, the main issue here for a lot of Republican senators is not the border wall, most to support that. Their concern is that the President's emergency declaration violates the constitution because it's Congress the supposed to control the spending.
And if Congress allows a person to do it this time, Republicans are concerned it would set a dangerous precedent that would allow Democratic Presidents to enact liberal agendas in the future. So far four GOP senators have said, they will vote against the President's emergency declaration.
Susan Collins, Lis Murkowski, Thom Tillis and Rand Paul who defended his decision earlier today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.: I think we need a wall. I think we need security at the border but Congress came to a conclusion precedent's on the bill, there was a debate over Wall funding. And there was a conclusion.
So I think it's easy to argue that this emergency order, this executive order goes against the will of Congress.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TENNEY: And Paul also said there are at least 10 GOP senators who were prepared to vote against the President's emergency declaration. Sources tell Fox news that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's expected to give the resolution of votes sometime next week before the March 15th recess.
President Trump has said, he will absolutely veto the bill if it reaches his desk and today Senate Majority Leader McConnell said, he does not think Congress has the votes to override it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY.: I think what - what is clear in the Senate is there will be enough votes to pass the resolution of disapproval. Which will then be vetoed by the President. And then in all likelihood the veto will be upheld in the House.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TENNEY: Even if Congress can't override the President's veto, this fight is not over. Democrats have a number of lawsuits challenging the emergency declaration as well, meaning those funds could be blocked for months until those lawsuits are resolved. Jesse.
WATTERS: Garrett, thank you very much. Joining me now. Tom Homan, Former ICE Acting Director and Francisco Hernandez, Immigration Attorney. Francisco, just in the last few days, border patrol is arrested the following, are you ready?
A previously deported convicted rapist, three previously deported violent MS-13 gang members and two previously deported convicted child sex offenders so how's there not a crisis down there that necessitates an emergency declaration?
FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: You just said in your introduction that the vast majority of the people that they're catching crossing are women and children. But wait a minute what happened to the first two years? Where was the emergency the first two years of the Trump presidency when there was a Republican majority? What happened to immigration reform?
What happened to making Mexico pay for that wall? What happened to building the wall?
WATTERS: Well, Francisco, you know you need 60 votes in the Senate in order to get any sort of--
HERNANDEZ: No, you don't. No, you don't.
WATTERS: Yes, you do. For wall funding, you need 60 votes, they didn't have 60.
HERNANDEZ: Look, we're down to enhance barriers. I mean come on guys go ahead, he's already declared the emergency, start building the wall. A resolution is not going to block his funding on an emergency declaration.
WATTERS: Okay, good -- I'm glad you agree that the wall is needed and that he you should go forward. Tom, with the emergency declaration. Tom, I just looked at The Washington Post year and The Washington Post says this, illegal immigration in fiscal year 2019 is on pace to reach its highest level in a decade. What does that tell you?
TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: Because the border's out of control and there is a crisis on the border. Both of - and let's not forget, we keep talking about families, families, families but we got to remember, the intelligence reports clearly show in my 34 years doing his job.
They will move these family groups to one sector to tie the border assets up so the cartels can move narcotics and bad people to another sector. So this border crisis is a national security crisis because what the cartels are moving once the border assets are tied up to these family units.
That's why this is important. It's just not a border crisis, this is a national security crisis.
WATTERS: Yes Francisco, what about the compassion for the young women or the children that are being exploited by the cartels.
HERNANDEZ: Oh that's true, that's strange. You know I have nothing but the highest respect for Special Agent Holman. I got no problem with that. The problem here is if we just passed Immigration Reform, we can take care of the rest. But we're here we are--
WATTERS: But what does immigration reform mean? It means nothing unless you have a secure border.
HERNANDEZ: Okay, fair enough but let's put something on the table, we just keep talking about--
WATTERS: The Republicans have put something on the table. The President and the Republicans have put border wall funding on the table.
HERNANDEZ: Absolutely yes.
WATTERS: --along with common sense reforms and the Democrats just reject it. They don't want to spend any money on actual security. They just want to do all sorts of smart walls. What is a smart wall, by the way?
HERNANDEZ: No, it's not true. Democrats--
WATTERS: What's a smart wall Francisco?
HERNANDEZ: --they didn't even get a chance to reject it. The Democrats didn't even get a chance to reject it. Everybody was afraid of a filibuster. So nobody, no, not the Senate, not the Republicans, not Democrats have sent anything to the President about immigration reform.
WATTERS: All right, Francisco, let me ask you a question, when you have a party at your House, just let anybody in?
HERNANDEZ: Yes, I mean, yes, you have to control the guest list.
WATTERS: Anybody can come in?
HERNANDEZ: You have to control the guest list.
WATTERS: You control the guest list, right and how do you do that? By asking people who they are, by opening the door and closing the door to people that you don't think should be at the party.
HERNANDEZ: Yes.
WATTERS: Why can't we just do that at the southern border and make our country secure?
HERNANDEZ: That's exactly what we should do, that is exactly what we should do.
WATTERS: Okay.
HERNANDEZ: And pass immigration reform so people don't have to come here illegally.
WATTERS: Okay, Tom, I think Francisco is on our side. I believe he believes in border security just as much as we do. Tell me about what your opinion is on these Republicans in the Senate who are not going along with this national emergency declaration?
HOMAN: They're failing their country, they're failing this President. Look, I'm not an attorney but I certainly think the President has the authority given to by Congress to move money from the Department of Defense to secure this nation's borders.
He's protecting his country and look and I've heard some of the Republicans say, well, we wont to do this because the Democrats may do it back to us you know if they ever take the White House back. They've already done it. They've already done it.
President Barack Obama said, he couldn't pass DACA legislation. He says it was unconstitutional couldn't do it but he did it then when President Trump tried to undo their own constitutional movement, he got shut down by the court.
So looks the globes are already off. This President is trying to - he's trying to walk the walk, he's trying to secure this country like he promised American people, there's no downside on securing this nation's border.
There's no downside unless illegal immigration, less drug smuggling, less children dying, less children being raped, there's no downside, let's get it done so I'm disappointed in the four Republicans so far.
HERNANDEZ: But Special Agent Homan, even if they pass a resolution, it's not a bill, it's not a law, it's just the resolution, it doesn't keep the President for spending those funds. They could try to take away the money but they're not going to.
So if President Trump means it, let's start doing but he's really just gas lighting this country on polar opposites for re-election, that's all it is, it's gas lighting and we're not about fixing this problem.
WATTERS: He's not building the wall to get re-elected. I mean, he ran on building the wall, that was a promise he made.
HOMAN: The security of this border isn't President Trump's success. It's America's success and if he fails on the border, America fails on the border. That's the argument here. President Trump didn't come up with the wall by himself.
He talked the experts on the line like myself we spent 34 years doing the job. He's trying to secure this nation as is his job as President, that's every Republican's, Democrat's job unfortunately some are failing American people by not securing this country-
WATTERS: Francisco.
HOMAN: And we have the opportunity to do that.
WATTERS: Real quick question before I let you go. Do you think you could get over a 30 foot concrete wall?
HERNANDEZ: Yes, I can get under it with a tunnel--
WATTERS: No, it goes 10 feet deep.
HERNANDEZ: Look guys, we all know--
WATTERS: I know you're good at shovelling Francisco but I don't think you're that good. I got to run guys.
HERNANDEZ: Well, you know -- lest stop hiring.
WATTERS: All right, I got to run, thank you.
HERNANDEZ: Thank you.
WATTERS: Jerry Nadler, the new Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, launching a massive new investigation today into President Trump. But he admits he doesn't have evidence that Trump committed any crimes. Congress Matt Gaetz who sits on that committee and Alan Dershowitz are here next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JERROLD NADLER, D-N.Y., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: This is not pre-impeachment here. Our goal is not to decide whether there's impeachment. It may come to that if the facts show that, and it may not.  Our goal is to protect the rule of law.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, are you going to cooperate with Mr. Nadler?
TRUMP: I cooperate all the time with everybody. And you know the beautiful thing, no collusion. It's all a hoax.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: That's right, several high-ranking Senate Democrats have actually admitted they found no evidence President Trump colluded with a Russians.  Despite that today, new House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler launched a new investigation into the president, requesting documents from 81 agencies, entities, and individuals as part of a new probe what Nadler calls, quote, they are calling "alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power by President Trump," although Nadler admitted he didn't have proof.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NADLER: If we are going to do anything, you have to have proof. I think there is a lot of evidence, but we have to get a lot more.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So that's what this about, you don't yet have proof?
NADLER: It's part of what this is about.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Joining me now, House Judiciary member Matt Gaetz. So, wait, Matt, so they don't have any proof or evidence, but they are investigating anyway?
REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: I guess this is like the Nancy Pelosi version of you've got to read the bill -- or you've got to vote on the bill before you can find out what's in it. Democrats campaign promising to be the party of solutions. Now they're just the party of endless, unfocused investigations. And what you see from Chairman Nadler is the investigatory equivalent of fishing with the dynamite, seeking information from 81 different entities.
Just to give you a flavor of how ridiculous it is, Jesse, they are trying to get documents from the president's former lawyer Don McGahn, which would clearly be either privileged or subject to an executive privilege. And then they are even trying to get information from content director of the "National Enquirer." So we may find out why Brad Pitt was at Jennifer Aniston's 40th birthday before we find out whether or not there is evidence of collusion with Russia.
WATTERS: Trump has one conversation with a member of the media and that is collusion. Meanwhile, the Democrats talk to the press every day and leak and connive.
It is funny, though, so he's looking at obstruction of justice. The only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting into the White House, in my opinion. He's looking at public corruption. If they were interested in public corruption, maybe they would have cared about the Clinton Foundation. And abuses of power, it's funny because they were really never really interested in the IRS targeting the Tea Party. So it looks purely political, doesn't it?
GAETZ: Of course it is, and it is all a lead up to their efforts to destabilizing and distract this president. What Democrats know is that if Donald Trump has the opportunity to challenge the bureaucracy, to end wars, to deregulate and invigorate the American economy, he is going to be reelected because the American people are going to be doing better. And so the only hope Democrats have is to try to tweezer through every deal he's ever done, every element of his life in hopes that the American people will care more about Donald Trump than they do about their own future. I'm betting on people to actually vote their own interests and not fall just the endless saga of endless investigations with no focus, no end in sight, just a desire to distract.
WATTERS: It is totally hypocritical because Congress takes our money, not their money, our money, and they spend it covering up sexual harassment lawsuits. They bribe contractors with it. They give it to lobbyists.  They pay off the Iranians with it. It doesn't matter, OK? And they want to know with what Trump did with a few dollars in the 80s? It's his money.
GAETZ: And so much of what the Democrats have alleged against the president deals with his conduct before he even contemplated a political campaign. But thus is the nature of Washington today. No solutions from Democrats, no real legislation to deal with immigration or infrastructure or the issues that they talked about during the campaign. Instead just more investigations, more endless attacks.
But the good news is, the American people, the forgotten men and women of this country, they're going to see through all of this and they're going to show up in droves to reelect the president that is ending wars and creating more economic opportunity than any other time in our lives, Jesse.
WATTERS: All right, congressman, thank you very much.
GAETZ: Thank you.
WATTERS: So is this legal? Should the president be at all concerned?  Joining me now, Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor Emeritus. And so you are going to be writing the introduction to the forthcoming book "The Mueller Report." Wow, I can't wait for that.
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: That's right, yes.
WATTERS: Now, James Comey has now come out and he has written op-ed in "The Washington Post" and he says when Barr, the new A.G., gets this Mueller report, he needs to be completely transparent and he needs to share it with the American people. I love listening to James Comey give advice on how to handle investigations. He booted the Clinton investigation and then he tried to cover up the Trump investigation.
DERSHOWITZ: Look, I think he should be transparent. I agree with you that Comey is not the guy to lecture anybody about this. I would hope that once the Mueller report is given to the attorney general, the attorney general before he makes it public will give it over to the Trump legal team. Give them a week or 10 days to write their rebuttal report, let the rebuttal be issued at exactly the same time as the report is issued, simultaneously released. Then I'm going to write an introduction both to the Mueller report and to the rebuttal reports so the American public can see both sides and make decisions for themselves. It would be utterly unfair to have a one-sided Mueller report, and all prosecutorial reports are one- sided, without there being an opportunity to respond.
Let's remember that this is unique. Generally, prosecutors say indict, don't indict. We all criticized Comey for going beyond that and saying we are not indicting Hillary Clinton, but let me tell you what I really think would happen. The same thing is true here. But if they are going to issue a report that goes beyond indict or not indict, at least let there be an opportunity for the other side to respond.
WATTERS: Right, that's fair.
DERSHOWITZ: So the American public can judge based on all the evidence.
WATTERS: That's fair. And it's clear this is personal with Nadler. Trump and Nadler have been going at it back since the 80s in Manhattan. He was always a thorn in Trump's side when he was trying to do deals. Do you think the president faces any -- it's going to be hard to govern with all these subpoenas flying around and everybody getting hauled in front of the cameras every hearing. What do you think is going to happen, and is this the right move for Democrats?
DERSHOWITZ: No, it's not. It backfired when the Republicans did it to Clinton. Look, if the Republicans were in power in the House today and Hillary Clinton were the president, I have no doubt they would do the same thing. This is the way it's come down, and it's not right. It's not right when the Democrats do it, it's not right when the Republicans do it.
Investigations by Congress are supposed to be looking towards legislation.  They are not supposed to be open-ended inquiries into a wrongdoing on the part of the other party. That is not the legitimate function of checks and balances of Congress, and I wish both sides would stop doing that.
WATTERS: I agree, but when the Republicans -- when the Republicans did have the gavel, they investigated events where people actually died. The V.A. scandal, Benghazi, Fast and Furious, those to me seem like legitimate concerns.
DERSHOWITZ: I agree.
WATTERS: There are some issues regarding Adam Schiff. So little Adam Schiff I guess might be in trouble because Michael Cohen under oath admitted that he was colluding or conversating with Schiff before his sworn testimony. Does he face any issue there?
DERSHOWITZ: Only issues within Congress itself. Congress is the exclusive judge of the behavior of its own members. Members cannot be prosecuted or sued, but what they do pursuant to their job. They are not above the law.  That is the law. But Congress could look into it. A Democratic Congress is probably not going to look into it. Look, the American public does not trust Congress to do investigations.
WATTERS: You can say that again.
DERSHOWITZ: That's why from day one I called for an independent, nonpartisan, objective commission like the 9/11 Commission to look into the attempt by Russia to influence elections in general. The American public would have trust in a credible investigation like that. They are not going to have trust in Congressional investigations whether conducted by a Republican majority or a Democratic majority. That is the reality, because everything is partisan and everything is political when Congress investigates.
WATTERS: All right, no one trust Congress, I think everybody agrees on that. Professor Dershowitz, thank you for joining me.
DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.
WATTERS: Coming up, it's been over two years and Hillary Clinton still can't except she's not sitting in the Oval Office right now. And she still can't accept the fact that other Democrats are losing. We're going to be talking about some of her embarrassing comments next.
Plus, high school students being rebuked are wearing MAGA gear to school.  Why? Is it making school unsafe? That debate is up next.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As we were taking pictures, a police officer approached us and said we are asking you to leave the campus right now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: What evidence do you have that the school is actually discriminating against your political believe?
MADDIE MUELLER, STUDENT: Currently on campus as of today, I checked today, and I saw four Hillary Clinton t-shirts, one Obama shirt, a Bernie Sanders hat, and about seven LGBTQ rainbow flag hats on campus today.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: That was high school student Maddie Mueller on this show with Laura just last week who says she was banned from wearing her MAGA hat to school. And now we're hearing more stories like this. In Arizona, for example, a group of students say they were reprimanded for wearing MAGA hats, shirts, and carrying a Trump banner for the school's Party in the USA Day.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So you're going to tell me that you are going to ask my daughter to leave school because she was wearing a Make America Great Again sweatshirt?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, that's not what happened.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That is what happened. Then why is she being asked to leave? She is not the one that had the Trump flag, and even if she did, why can't she have a flag on America Day for school that says Make America Great Again?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because the carry a flag that way is not good use of the flag. It's disrespectful.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Joining me now is Monica Crowley, senior opinion columnist for The Washington Times and Rochelle Ritchie, former Congressional press secretary for House Democrats. Disrespecting the flag. It wasn't the American flag, and that is OK on spirit day. It was like a Trump 2020 flag. Does that cause problems, a Trump flag for people?
ROCHELLE RITCHIE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: You know what, I am not a MAGA supporter.
WATTERS: You're not?
RITCHIE: No, I'm not, surprise, surprise.
WATTERS: But you were the spokesman for the House Democrats.
RITCHIE: Surprise, surprise.
But these kids should be allowed to wear whatever they want to wear. If they want to Make America Great Again hat, then go ahead.
WATTERS: What about a Fox News t-shirt?
RITCHIE: If they want to wear -- I'm on Fox News and I get in trouble for even though I'm here as a Democrat.
WATTERS: OK.
RITCHIE: But these kids in Arizona should have the right to wear whatever they choose to wear politically. And I don't think that if they were causing any sort of disruption in the classroom or causing any sort of fight or protests in the hallways that they should be recommended. Arizona has a problem with this because there was also in 2016 a young woman that was suspended for wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt as well. So this seems to be a thing in Arizona they have an issue with.
WATTERS: Well, I think it's probably more one-sided. And all it takes is for one little snowflake to say, he's wearing a MAGA hat, I'm offended, and then the administration says no one can wear it.
MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: Just like the Covington kids, I hope these kids all get a great lawyer who will work for them pro bono because our First Amendment rights are really being infringed.
WATTERS: Sue them and all get A's.
CROWLEY: But all of the discrimination seems to go one way. It is against the kids who support Donald Trump who come in the MAGA hats or the MAGA buttons or whatever it might be. And as the first student pointed out, Jesse, the kids who come wearing Hillary Clinton gear, Bernie Sanders gear, no problem whatsoever.
WATTERS: Ritchie, why do we never hear stories --
RITCHIE: I like that you call me Ritchie.
WATTERS: We're close. We never heard stories of students or anybody wearing Obama gear, hope and change t-shirts, getting assaulted, getting harassed, getting suspended. Why not?
RITCHIE: I think you have to look at the political --
WATTERS: If the right is so intolerant?
RITCHIE: I think we have to look at the climate that we are in right now, and it is a lot of tension. And I think we're going to run into this problem as we head more into 2020. But even if the kids that wore Obama gear or wore MAGA gear now, I just don't think either side should be reprimanded for that. I think this is a freedom of expression. The problem we have in this country right now is that freedom of speech only counts when people like what you have to say.
WATTERS: As long as they are tucking their shirts in and they look neat.
CROWLEY: Listen, the MAGA hats is an inanimate object, right. But what the left is trying to say is it's a symbol of hate. And actually what the MAGA hat does is expose hate, because if you try to walk around in a school in New York City in any of these leftwing bastions, you're going to feel the hate. Some people are actually getting targeted with violent activity because of it. And those --
WATTERS: When it was raining the other day I had my FOX umbrella on the subway. I put it down and turn the other way. Didn't want anybody to see it.
CROWLEY: And you should not have to do that. You should be proud of your beliefs.
WATTERS: And I am. And I am. But sometimes Manhattan is a little gnarly in the subway. And I smirk, too. I smirk, and that is even worse.
CROWLEY: That's what the left does, it's all about intimidation. They talk a good game about tolerance. They are the most intolerant faction on the face of the earth.
WATTERS: Hold on, let me ask you guys about losers, OK? Hillary Clinton can't get over the fact that she lost the presidency to Trump. Here she is this weekend talking about that and another political loser, Stacey Abrams.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HILLARY CLINTON, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We know, don't we, that candidates both black and white lost their races because they have been deprived of the votes they otherwise would have gotten. The clearest example is from next-door in Georgia. Stacey Abrams should be governor, leading that state right now.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Don't you think she should just accept the results of the election?
RITCHIE: I'm not one to cry over spilled milk, but I don't think we can ignore the fact that voter suppression obviously is an issue, right? And I think that we have to acknowledge the fact that Brian Kemp was the secretary of state, so he was the overseer of the vote.
But I don't think we should be looking at this as a loss for Stacey Abrams.  This really was a win for the Democrats in Georgia, because look how much of a vote they did get. They got 48 percent of the vote. So that shows you the tide is turning in Georgia. And we need to stop looking at this as something we lost and start looking at the wins and continue to fight for voting rights.
WATTERS: I don't know how much voter suppression there is, actually.  Democrats won 40 seats in the House the last midterms.
I do want to get to this new sound bite by Hillary. This is breaking news right here. Listen to Mrs. Clinton.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CLINTON: I'm not running, but I'm going to keep working and speaking and standing up for what I believe.  I want to be sure that people understand, I'm going to keep speaking out.  I'm not going anywhere.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: First time on tape Ms. Clinton said she will not run for president in 2020.
CROWLEY: Do you believe her? She's been on the national scene.
RITCHIE: I believe here.
WATTERS: It's the one thing I do believe out of her mouth.
(LAUGHTER)
CROWLEY: I'm not sure, but I guess we have this to look forward to, that Mrs. Clinton is going to chime in whenever she thinks it's appropriate.
Look, it's easy for us to mock her denial about 2016, the fact she lost two, of all people, Donald Trump makes her absolutely insane. But this is a woman whose whole identity achieving the presidency. She married a man, she hitched her wagon to Bill Clinton. She put up with serial humiliations for decades all in the name of getting the ultimate prize. And so the fact she lost not once but twice, first to Obama and then to Trump, it's making her question her very identity, because her whole identity was wrapped up in sacrificing so much of her self-worth and self-esteem to get that job.  And without it, who is she?
RITCHIE: I'm glad she's not running.
WATTERS: No wonder she fainted. She was married to Bill. I'd faint, too.
RITCHIE: I'm just glad she's not running.
WATTERS: One more topic I want to get to with you guys. 2020 hopeful Bernie Sanders on the breakfast club today stumbling a little bit when asked about what he's done specifically to help the black community.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SANDERS: I think if you look at my record in terms of civil rights and other areas, you will find that it is consistently a very, very.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any legislation you can point to?
SANDERS: Well, legislation that benefits African-Americans, yes. Not specifically, but we passed legislation that benefits working people.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Crickets.
CROWLEY: Crickets. Well, if he is the Democratic nominee running against Donald Trump, all Trump has to say is I delivered the lowest African- American unemployment rate.
RITCHIE: Really quickly, I think that he actually said a lot more in that interview. He did talk about the disparities for African-Americans in this country.
WATTERS: Thank you. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: That's all the time we have for tonight. I'm Jesse Watters in for Laura Ingraham, who is in Mardi Gras tonight. How am I here, Watters, and Laura is at Mardi Gras? I have no idea. I should be at Mardi Gras.  And you're going to see highlights of her down there tomorrow night, so catch that.
And catch me on "The Five" every Monday through Friday at 5:00 p.m. eastern.
