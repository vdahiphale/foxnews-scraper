MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, thank you, Bret. Good evening,everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in Washington, D.C. tonight.After months of silence, tonight President Trump's campaign manager, BradParscale tells his side of the story. He was once hailed the digital geniusbehind Trump's upset victory in 2016. Parscale claims that he was on trackfor an even bigger victory in 2020. But all that changed this summer amid aflurry of questions about his campaign spending and a tense confrontationwith the president over falling poll numbers.Soon after, he was replaced by Deputy Campaign Manager Bill Stepien, a manhe hired. And we all watched as his personal struggles spilled into publicview in a domestic incident that revealed the strain.Tonight, Parscale returns to television to tell his side of the story, whathe thinks went wrong inside the Trump campaign and what led to his nowinfamous run in with the police. And he makes a startling admission abouthis last conversation with President Trump.Here now, my exclusive interview with former Trump campaign manager BradParscale.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRAD PARSCALE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: We had a plan, and I havealways had a lot of confidence in our plan. And I think the president andJared had a lot of confidence in the plan. And it was unfortunate that wediverge from the plan that we can't talk down the stretch.But I think the - look, I think the president is still clearly in aposition that he might be able to pull this off. And I'm not ready to callit off yet, because I think it's weird. I just think it's so weird thatthings like Pennsylvania votes coming in day after day after day after day,Arizona every two hours, the votes kept coming in, but states like had itreally organized, Florida and Ohio easily pulled away. And so, I stillthink there's something to look at there. I'm not satisfied that this was afair election.MACCALLUM: You said we had a plan, me and the president, Jared. And it wasdiverged from at the end. Obviously, you left finally at first in thesummer and finally--PARSCALE: I was removed.MACCALLUM: In September. Removed. How do you feel about that?PARSCALE: I mean, I was hurt. I mean, that's an obvious sign now that I washurt. I didn't get a warning sign really that that no one asked me tochange my plan. No one asked me to do anything different. I don't knowexactly why I was removed and why all of a sudden, we had to challenge theplan. I have a lot of thoughts on why I think that is. But they paused theplan, eventually went back to it. But we had a plan.I had a lot of time to plan. And 2016, people don't like to admit it. I wasa semi quasi campaign manager and then we've got to say that publiclybefore because I couldn't. Jared was the real campaign manager. I was theone doing the day-to-day. And we won and it really didn't make sense to mewhy in 2020 they had to change with--MACCALLUM: Are you talking about 2016.PARSCALE: 2016, I'm saying that I never really got to say what I reallydid. I never really got to say I was a semi quasi campaign manager,everyone got to say, oh, Brad didn't have the experience, but I already wonan election.MACCALLUM: Kellyanne was the campaign manager, no?PARSCALE: Yes, I think that was her time. But I think the people runningthe day-to-day operation were Jared and I, and I think that it didn't makesense why you would pull that team away if you're getting close to 2020.MACCALLUM: So, you say we had a plan. What was the plan? Articulate it.PARSCALE: Well, that's - I mean, that's going to take a book to articulatethe whole plan. It's a big campaign. It's a billion-dollar operation. Butwe understood where the weaknesses were. We need to pick up the votes. Weunderstood what Election Day operations need to look like because the legalfight, we planned that fight out two years in advance. I understood thatthis was going to happen. My team understood it's going to happen.We had a plan to increase Latino black vote, which we did. We had a plan totry to keep the suburban housewives. We had a lot of plans and we knewexactly what the path was to victory. COVID threw a wrench in it, but westill had a plan even through that.MACCALLUM: Biden bested Hillary in 373 suburban counties in Pennsylvania,Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona. So, apparently, they had a plantoo and it involved very little campaigning and very little door knocking.So, a lot of folks look at the 80 million votes that Joe Biden got, andthey say, how did he do that?PARSCALE: Yes, well, we'll see exactly how that vote count goes up. But Iknew in my plan tried to make this a choice election, not a referendum. AndI think that was one of the biggest disputes within the campaign. I knewthat if it was a choice or the president with COVID and the economy, thepresident with his policies versus Biden, I touched 140 plus policiesagainst Joe Biden versus Donald Trump. Trump bested him in 139 withAmerican people.They knew the president's policies are what they wanted. The issue was howto keep this as a choice election. Joe Biden's America going back that he'ssomehow could do this better, which I don't think he can, or Donald Trumpwould made America better and its policies and make sure it didn't end up areferendum on him.MACCALLUM: What was wrong with the plan from the point when you left andStepien took over? What changed? What was wrong?PARSCALE: I'm not going to put the blame on any one person. These were thepeople I hired. Everybody end up running the campaign were my deputies. ButI think what occurred and I don't know exactly why, and this is why Istarted to really have a hard time, because I tried to stay. I tried tostay on to make sure the plan kept going. Like, I'll take a lesser positionbecause I love Donald Trump. I mean, he's like family to me. That wholefamily is my family.And I want nothing more than him to win. I want nothing more than thiscountry to progress the way it was. But they paused. They didn't know myplan. They didn't know to execute it or not. And they started to divergeaway from it, and they started to test it. Should we use data like this?Should we buy TV like this? Should we run this? Should we do this? Shouldwe even work with the RNC, which I think were crucial mistakes and I couldname crucial mistakes.And I just - I don't understand why, because the president should have wonby a lot more. He shouldn't be fine. And I still think he might pull thisoff, which will be - I give it a 100 percent credit to him if he pulls itoff.MACCALLUM: When you were sitting at home in Florida during the last fewmonths of the campaign.PARSCALE: Yes.MACCALLUM: What's going through your mind? You're watching the rallies allacross the country during the middle of--PARSCALE: I'm watching this off TV.MACCALLUM: You're watching the fact that they are pulling ads from swingstates. You're hearing complaints that the campaign has run out of money.And in fact, those complaints are leveled at you for frontloading thespending too much. $10 million on a Super Bowl ad, all of that. So, defendthat and tell me what they did wrong.PARSCALE: Well, first of all, let's defend the budget stuff. It was only $5million on a Super Bowl ad. We end up only going with a 30 second ad. Andit was a great ad.MACCALLUM: But you didn't need an ad at that point, he didn't have acandidate.PARSCALE: Well, let's put it this way.MACCALLUM: That point.PARSCALE: In February of 2020, before COVID, the president in all of ourpolling was winning by 400 some electoral votes. The Super Bowl ad initself paid for itself two times over, meaning are his fan base, his votingbase was so excited that he went up on the Super Bowl, the game they watch.They donated tens of millions of dollars to it. So, you've got tounderstand, not every dollar I spent was all done just as electioneering.It's also how do we raise more money? How do we keep our fan base goingeven stronger? How does the voter get even more excited? How does the - howdo we keep them fundraising the biggest campaign in history, what we weregoing to do.At that point, he was killing Joe Biden. 400 electoral votes. It was goingto be the biggest landslide in American history since Nixon at that point.And we knew we wanted to win the black vote. Jared and I and the presidentsat down and said, what is the best thing we can do at Super Bowl vote? Andwe chose to put the chart (ph) to show the truth between Donald Trump, whoactually did prison reform, and Joe Biden, who put black people in prison.MACCALLUM: It was a strong ad, I think by most accounts, just an unbiasedpolitical campaign advertising.PARSCALE: Made money, helped with the black vote. I think those are twogoals as me as a campaign manager. So, Jared and I never got sideways on aconcept. That's why we were such a strong team for a long time. And I thinkthe worst thing that ever did was to break us too up. I think that was adecision that will go down if the president was his being down the worstdecision.MACCALLUM: So, Jared was also sidelined when you were sidelined?PARSCALE: This is my opinion. I feel like he was slightly sidelined, not asmuch as me, but I think he said a little hand off. I said, OK. And I think,since November of 2015, Jared and I talked every single day and it was inour plan, every day. How to use Facebook? What to do? And I think ourrelationship will go down as one that's pretty amazing in politics.But it got sidelined in the summer and I don't know why. I have no idea. Ihave a clue. I do.MACCALLUM: And it is?PARSCALE: I think it's all the D level people talking heads at around thepresident that never done anything in their life, never created a business,never built anything successful, but talked themselves into something. AndI think when the polling numbers were going down, they were in his ear andI was out working.MACCALLUM: There's a story that you have already responded to about himshouting into the phone at you when you presented some pretty unappealingpoll numbers back in April. You want to tell me about that?PARSCALE: I didn't like lying to him. I like telling him the truth.Sometimes I come with a lot of painful days, watching, knowing that I mighthave let him down or made him upset. But a lot of those D level people hungaround him.They just told him what he wants to hear. They were yes man. And I wasn'tgoing to be yes man. I was going to be get it done, man. And I did it forhim. I did it for the family. I did it for this country because I feel likesomebody need to be the one telling the truth. And I think Jared did too. Ithink we both paid the price for that sometimes.MACCALLUM: When you say the campaign didn't run out of money, I've heardfrom several sources in the campaign that they were running low on moneyand that they had to make tough choices. How do you back up the assertionthat that's false?PARSCALE: Well, I think you look at the FEC reports. The FEC reportsclearly show that there has been so many made up stories. My life, the lastfive years has been made up story after a made-up story, after a made-upstory after crap. And the truth is, the campaign in 2016, the entirecampaign had about $300 million sum. We had that in the bank with threemonths ago are still going to raise another $600 million. They didn't havea money problem and a strategy problem.They didn't know what to say. You just want to say it, they don't have themoney and I think they got caught in a catch-22 there, because FEC reportsdidn't say that and I think the final FEC reports, when it's all said anddone in history, writes in the books, it'll show they didn't have moneyproblems.MACCALLUM: Do you believe that if you and Jared had remained in-charge, thepresident would have won right out?PARSCALE: I don't know if he still - I'm not saying that - he could stillwin this. I think he wins easy. I think he wins by more. I think our planwas just right and we knew what we were doing, and I think we were fightinga million pressures that are hard to explain.MACCALLUM: So, one of the criticisms is that the president's side wasbasically outgunned legally by the DNC, by all of these lawsuits all acrossthe country to expand the voting ability to change the signature reads from60 percent down to 40 percent of a match. All of those cases that happenedall across the country that allowed more votes to be accepted rather thankicked out of the system and rejected. How significant is that? And is itfair criticism that the Trump side dropped the ball on some of that?PARSCALE: In April of 2019, I sat down with my team and I said, let's comeup with the biggest Election Day operation ever, because voter fraud isgoing to be rampant. If it's not going to be rampant, everyone's going tothink it's rampant or they're going to game it. Something's going to happenbecause we sat around for two years in 2017, 2018 where they talked to allthis stuff about all this voter ramp, blah, blah, blah, and I said if wewant to do the same thing, so let's make sure we're there and let's makesure they don't try to steal it from us, make sure they're so scared offour more years.The president always said something very interesting. He always says, whenthe opportunity is right up front and you think you can take it, somepeople just - they do the wrong thing. He'd say that to me, like he taughtme a lot of lessons. And what I mean by that is the people right there,they know that maybe they can put those extra few votes and it could be thedifference of not four more years with Donald Trump and getting along andtelling all their friends that they did it.I think it was important. So, in April of 2019, I came up with the largestbudget in Election Day operations in partnership with the RNC. What thatmeant was to have lawyers everywhere, file suits beforehand, protectbeforehand and somehow between July of 2020 and Election Day that fellapart. And that's a question. I don't know exactly what the answer is, butfrom everything I'm hearing, it did not occur.And I think that is a travesty to this to this campaign. It's a travesty toPresident Trump. It's a travesty to this republic. And I think that itshould have happened. And I don't know why. And I was trying to doeverything I could to keep it from happening.MACCALLUM: Who dropped the ball on that? You have obviously on the Democratside, they were pushing full throttle on all of those issues. And I thinkthere's a good argument to be made that that's how they got to 80 millionvotes out there.PARSCALE: I don't--MACCALLUM: And I'm not saying that it's anything illegal. I don't know theanswer to that. I mean, we see some of this, dead voter. We see some ofthat stuff which is obviously egregious and needs to be worked out. But itsounds to me like you think that somebody dropped the ball, who dropped theball on that side?PARSCALE: I can't. If I knew the name or I knew the people that did it, Iwould. Something happened between the campaign and the RNC relationship andthe deal I had, the deal that we were going to set it up the way I thought--MACCALLUM: What would it have looked like on Election Day under thatscenario?PARSCALE: I wanted lawyers everywhere. I wanted regional lawyeroverstaffed.MACCALLUM: Would you be able to get them in. I mean--PARSCALE: I think we would have filed the lawsuits beforehand. We've beenasking beforehand; we'd be trying to. Why weren't during the early votingdays, why weren't they already getting into there - in there and thenalready filing lawsuits? Why they're not in there? Why are we doing it atpost? And I think that somebody did drop the ball on that. And I think ascampaign manager, I wouldn't have been an expert in everything, but Ialways knew how to sit and ask questions to everybody.I would put the right staff in front of me and said, why are we not doingthis? How are we? Every day we said, how are we preventing fraud? How arewe preventing that we could beat by the DNC in this? And I don't know ifthat happened because I wasn't at the table anymore.MACCALLUM: So, the criticism even before you left in the summer was thatyou weren't around, that you were down in Florida, that you weren't incampaign headquarters.PARSCALE: We weren't allowed. Virginia made it illegal to get in theheadquarters. And I had two choices. I can sit in my one-bedroom apartment,my daughter, and my wife and my two dogs, or I could go home to Florida andoperate in some ease because we were going all Zoom anyways. And I wouldfly up and meet the president when I could. But from - I was living fulltime here on March 13th.My home is Florida, that's where I live. I can operate. I still haven'theard one thing I didn't get done. The only complaint is from all those Dlevel people around the president is, oh, he's not working hard enough,guess what if I can do something an hour that takes them two months to do,I'm just more talented. I could just do it from home. And when I needed tobe up here, I was up here. And as soon as I could be, I was back. I washere the day the offices reopened. It's baseless and just unbelievable.MACCALLUM: So, the kind of things that we're discussing in terms of voterirregularities and some of what we've seen on the periphery is verydifferent from what the president's legal team is now talking about withthese voting changes that happened in the voting systems and Rudy Giulianiand the cases that he is trying to bring, they have not had a lot ofsuccess with those, but they continue to hold hearings and put outaffidavits. What do you think of that move, that push?PARSCALE: Rudy and Jenna (ph) are a friend of mines. I worked with Rudymultiple times and Jenna (ph) obviously worked on my staff. I disagree withsome of the things that are occurring. But do I think the president hasevery right to understand what happened? I would say all those Republicansright now in Georgia that are angry at the Republican Party and they wantit - and they're mad. They don't want to vote. I would do the opposite.I would stand up and I would say, why don't you two senators make a promiseright now that you'll push for Senate investigation from the JudiciaryCommittee of all the voting issues and do that, I bet you all of you willshow up because they'd rather have a just answer than just have theRepublicans disappear again because those Democrats didn't disappear whenthey thought something was wrong. They terrorized us. So, stand up and findout what really happened. You have the power to do it.MACCALLUM: So, you say that you think that the president will still win.PARSCALE: I think that there is still a chance he could.MACCALLUM: How?PARSCALE: You never know, maybe something comes out in these court cases.And I don't underestimate Rudy. Sometimes, I watch him on TV. I'm like,whoa. But the same time, like I mean the guy has done some amazing thingsin his life. And I don't want to underestimate people. And if he believesit, then he should go do it. I think that's what this country is about.And I think the president has a good argument because it's sad in thiscountry, the Republicans say this, if I don't win by more than two or threepercent, it will get stolen from me. A common sentence that I've heardacross this country, how many Republicans say that to me in every littlerace as I traveled the country? They believe that. I tend to believe whenyou hear a myth that long, there might be a little bit to it.MACCALLUM: When you saw Pennsylvania fall and Michigan fall, when you sawWisconsin not go the president's way. Why not try to make a bigger appealto some of the women voters who had maybe changed their mind or maybe hadbeen turned off by some of the president's actions? Why not try to drive upthe Catholic vote, for example, which the president lost some ground onthis time around?PARSCALE: One, two percent possibly we lost of suburban families, right.The men and women in the suburbs, Philly suburbs, Atlanta suburbs. I thinkthat goes to one thing. And I think it was a decision on COVID to go foropening the economy versus public empathy. And I think a young family witha young child who were scared to take them back to school, wanted to see anempathetic president, an empathetic Republican Party.And I think that, and I've said this multiple times and he chose adifferent path. And I don't think he's wrong with this. I love him. Butlike, we had a difference on this. I thought we should have public empathy.I think people were scared. I walked around the - people walk, watch peoplewalk around me. Not like two years ago, when they still walk that's becauseI'm Brad Parscale, but walk around me because I've got a mask on. Now, theydon't want to get COVID.I can see how waitresses stand a little farther from the table. People arescared. And I think if he would be publicly empathetic, he would have a wonby a landslide there. I think he could have leaned into it instead of, runaway from it.MACCALLUM: So, it sounds like you think that was the biggest error, empathyover COVID?PARSCALE: Policy error. There's different kinds of errors. There'stechnical errors, policy errors. There's also things he did great. It'shard to see that now when things are so close. But one of the greatesteconomies in history, he wouldn't even close if he wouldn't have been thatfar. I still think he's going to go down as one of the greatest presidents.I think he got one choice away from being perfect, and that was, do I wantto open the country and be the economic - or do I want to be publiclyempathetic? And I think it goes right into thing because this is one of themost empathetic men when you're sitting there, he asks about your familyand all that stuff. All you do is get on stage and do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: When we come back, Brad Parscale will detail the strategy thathe thinks the president should take in Georgia. Plus, setting the recordstraight on the viral video of his confrontation with police in Florida anda stunning admission about his now relationship with the President of theUnited States.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Have you talked to the president lately?PARSCALE: I've not. And it's pretty hurtful, but it's fine. Just as much myfault as his. I love that family and I gave every inch of my life to him.Every inch. (END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: Back now with part two of my exclusive interview with formerTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: What role do you think the president should play in Georgia?He's going there on Saturday.PARSCALE: He's the leader of this party. And he needs to stand up, in myopinion, to the people of Georgia and say, go vote for these senators andask them to start immediately investigating what's happening in thiscountry, because as everyone wants to blame the president, I think it's theopposite.I think the president is exposing the problem. And that problem is this isa country that just doesn't play fair rules, and I think he just exposes iteverywhere, and I didn't know how much until I joined this, how much allthose things are out. But like, it's just sometimes it's a dirty world.MACCALLUM: Brad, we've known each other quite a while. We've done a lot ofinterviews together.PARSCALE: You're my most interviews.MACCALLUM: Thank you. I want to give you an opportunity to talk about whathappened at your house in Florida back on September 27th.PARSCALE: Yes.MACCALLUM: The video became very public. I'm sure it was a very tough timefor you. And I think everybody is sympathetic to that. Your wife said atone point that you tried to harm her. She later recanted that. She wasconcerned you were going to harm yourself. What do you want everybody toknow about that?PARSCALE: Well, good thing is my wife, and I are in much better place now.My family is in a great place. It's - we went through a very stressful timefor five years. We had lost two children during the election. We buried. Wewere completely attacked by the Left, the Right, the media. And I've got toa bad place. My wife was worried about me and she helped. And she was thereevery day by my side. And I love her for it. And we've never been happier.And I'm just glad I've moved on. And I tried my best for the Americanpeople.MACCALLUM: Do you feel like you're healthy now?PARSCALE: I feel like I'm healthy. Getting better every day as a stress.And this is the last piece of it. To have history remember, as it wasaccurate. And I appreciate we didn't tell the American people that becauseI love my wife. She loves me. She was the first one there right afterwardsand she'll be the last one I ever see.MACCALLUM: Have you talked to the president lately.PARSCALE: I've not. And it's pretty hurtful, but it's probably just as muchmy fault is his I love that family and I gave every inch of my life to him.Every inch.MACCALLUM: What would you say to him?PARSCALE: Keep fighting. Don't give up, don't give up. The country needsyou.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: We'll show you the rest of the interview with Brad Parscaletomorrow night, including his thoughts on what he thinks the presidentshould do and whether he could win if he ran again in 2024.Coming up next, Attorney General Bill Barr says that there's no evidence atthis point of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. So, whatto make of these hearings with bombshell claims of voting spikes and otherscandalous things that are coming out of these in the swing states acrossthe country? We're going to talk to former federal prosecutor AndyMcCarthy, who's been digging into the issues specifically. We'll see whathe knows after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Attorney General William Barr telling theAssociated Press today that widespread voter fraud did not impact theoutcome of the president's election. But I do want to clarify one point onthat with regard to what the Department of Justice is saying tonight.They are saying that the report that some media outlets have incorrectlyreported that they've concluded the investigation, the DOJ, of electionfraud and announced affirmative finding of no fraud, and that is not whatthe attorney general said. There are ongoing investigations, and there isongoing information that continues to come in. So no definitive conclusionon that, but at this point, that's where it stands.So, the issue of voter fraud is popping up around next month's GeorgiaSenate runoff. Here is the Georgia secretary of state. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have opened aninvestigation into a group called "America votes" who is sending outapplications to people at addresses where they have not lived since 1994.The new Georgia project who sent voter applications to New York City, andoperation new voter registration Georgia, who is telling college studentsin Georgia that they can change their residency to Georgia and then changeit back after the election.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Well, as was pointed out here the other night byJonathan Turley, that would be a felony in some of those instances that hehas just raised about voting out of state.Here now Andrew McCarthy, former federal prosecutor and Fox Newscontributor. Andy, good to have you here tonight.ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Hi, Martha.MACCALLUM:  First on this Georgia investigation in what you heard from theSecretary of State Raffensperger. Are you concerned about what you findwhen you dig into these different groups that are essentially get out thevote efforts? But are they doing anything nefarious?MCCARTHY:  Yes. I think, Martha, it's one thing to see that you are notable to prove fraud in court on the present state of the evidence that wehave. It would be quite another thing to say that there aren't rampantreasons to be concerned with the way that mail-in voting on a scale thatwe've never had before has been handled.And as Jonathan Turley mentioned to you, these are, indeed not only statefelonies, they are federal felonies. So, I would -- I would be veryconcerned about it.I also think that we've got to give this a long think when this is all overbecause I don't understand why we shouldn't impose the obligation on theperson to ask for a ballot if the person is interested in having a ballot.Why third party should be mass mailing ballot applications to people isbeyond me. It's a classic invitation to fraud.MACCALLUM:  Yes. There is a lot of levels here. I think people look at itin different ways. Because, you know, what you heard from Chris Krebs isthat it was a clean election, meaning that there wasn't in his mindanything wrong with the machines or the counting, right?But there is also different levels of this, as you point out in terms ofhow these things are mailed out, how they're collected collective,harvesting and all the different rules in different places in terms of whatmakes a valid ballot.Here is one more sound bite from Brad Parscale on this, I want to get yourthoughts on this on the other side.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRAD PARSCALE, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Packing is breaking in,fraud is just, talk about of dead people and I think there was some of thatstuff, but there is also gaming. And gaming is all of a sudden, I show upto 50,000 households after the election and backdate ballots and they showup on the door. Now some people call that fraud, I call it fraud, butDemocrats call them gaming maybe.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  What do you think about that?MCCARTHY:  Well, obviously it shouldn't be done. And it's a little bit hardbecause a lot of dialogue about this is like the two ships passing in thenight.MACCALLUM:  Yes.MCCARTHY:  When people say this was a clean election, it doesn't mean itwas a perfect election.MACCALLUM:  Yes.MCCARTHY:  There's always a certain sort of low thrum of fraudulentactivity that goes on. And the bottom line, Martha, always is, would ithave made a difference? That is, would what you can prove happen have closethe gap between, you know, here the president's deficit and what it appearsPresident-elect Biden has won by?MACCALLUM:  Andy McCarthy, great to have you here tonight, Andy. Thank you.MCCARTHY:  Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM:  So, a surprising decision tonight by the CDC to loosen some ofthe COVID quarantine recommendations. Dr. Richard Besser tells what hethinks about that more when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  Significant shake-up tonight in the government's official guideon COVID-19, specifically, the CDC is expected to shorten the recommendedquarantine period for those exposed to the virus if they test negative from14 days down to just seven.This as we learned that the virus may have been here in the United Statesfar sooner than we have been told. As data now reveals antibodies werefound in some Americans as early as December of 2019.A lot to talk about now with Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO ofRobert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC.Doctor, good to have you with us tonight.Let's start there with a virus probably arriving sooner than we knew, basedon antibodies that were found in blood tests. What do you make of that?RICHARD BESSER, PRESIDENT & CEO, ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION:  yes. Ithink it is interesting. You know, I want to see more data on that to knowfor sure. This is a technique that's often used in public health where youlook at blood collected by blood banks for the purposes and then you lookback to see if there is any sign of antibodies or any sign the infectionwas here. Can you pinpoint when it first arrived?One of the challenges is sometimes antibody to one type of a virus, onetype of coronavirus will cross react with another coronavirus. So I want tomake sure that what they found is truly real, but if it is real, then itsuggests that, you know, if we had been able to detect this earlier and toknow that this had the potential to become a raging pandemic, maybe thereis something that could have been done sooner.MACCALLUM:  Yes, maybe.BESSER:  But those are big if's and there is a lot of work to be donebefore you want to conclude that.MACCALLUM:  Yes. The other thing that I find really interesting is thisthat it shows that it could be 53 million people in this country who havehad coronavirus already as opposed to the number that we see when we lookup the accounts which is about 6.9 million.Here is -- here is what Rand Paul said about that the other night and Iwant to get your thoughts on the other side of this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY):  Right now, New York is having virtually zerodeaths. And you have to say is that because they are washing their handsbetter? Or might it have something to do with the degree of immunity thattheir vulnerable population got? A lot of them died but those who didn'tdie in nursing homes, a lot of them have antibodies now.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  So, your thoughts on the much bigger number than wethought and also on what the senator said.BESSER:  The bigger number, I think is probably spot on. One of thechallenges when you have a virus that spreads from people who don't haveany symptoms is it is hard to know exactly where it is and how many peoplehave been benefited.It's going to have a big impact as we go forward and we look to see what dowe expect the trajectory of this to be. How many people are going to haveto be vaccinated before we start to see a downturn in this?You know, Senator Paul's comments in terms of could people have protection?You know, that's something that could be explored. Nursing home studieswith in terms of antibodies, but we do know the vast majority of people inAmerica are still at risk and need to do those things to try to reducetransmission to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.MACCALLUM:  So, should we have a test that figures out, you know, shouldeveryone have the antibody test and then should vaccines be given first topeople who don't have the antibodies?BESSER:  Well, you know, I don't think that you should give them just topeople that don't have antibodies. I think that the advisory committeetoday that recommended health care workers and people in long-term careinstitutions, nursing homes, is the first is the way to go given the risk.But I do say, and one of the challenges about measuring antibodies, is thatwe know that people who have had an actual infection after several monthsyou may not be able to detect any antibodies, but they could still haveprotection to COVID because of something called cellular immunity. So,there is still a lot we're learning on this.MACCALLUM:  Yes. And the quarantine down to seven days. If you testnegative but you've been exposed, right? Are you behind that?BESSER:  Yes. So, you know, some of this is based on increased science andknowing that those later dates and that quarantine period, you are at lowerrisk of transmitting to other people. And part of it is that the Congresshasn't stepped up and provided support to people to stay home for twoweeks.You know, what we are hearing from states is that, no one wants to tell whothey've had contact with because for a lot of people who don't have sickleave or family medical leave, it means that they could lose their jobs.MACCALLUM:  Yes.BESSER:  So, trying to come up with a balance there between protectinghealth and doing something that people can live with and actually complywith.MACCALLUM:  Dr. Besser, thanks. Always good to see you.BESSER:  Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM:  So, what would a return to Obama era economic policies mean forthe thousands of small businesses that were shuttered by COVID-19restrictions, leaving families to struggle to make ends meet? We're goingto talk about that next with Michael Goodwin.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  Thousands of businesses across the country have been shuttereddue to COVID-19 lockdowns. As of August 31st, the A.P. (Ph) reported thatnearly 100,000 businesses closed their doors forever. Many of those withowners have gone public with their pleas for help. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEX JORDAN, OWNER, EAT AT JOES:  They shut us down for outdoor dining.Three weeks before Christmas, month before Christmas without any kind ofaid to my employees.KEITH MCALARNEY, OWNER, MAC'S PUB:  They never came to us to ask how to dothat in a safe way. Basically, all they did was dictate to us what we aresupposed to do. And with doing that, you still weren't able to survive.ROBBY DINERO, PRESIDENT, ATHLETES UNLEASHED:  Any infringement on ourfreedom for any reason is too far.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM:  So, who will take on this growing crisis of all thesebusinesses across the country? Today, President-elect Joe Biden announcedhis new economic team.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  The goal issimple to keep businesses and schools open safely. And for millions ofAmericans who have lost their jobs or hours and have had to claimunemployment, we have to deliver them immediate relief.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Joining me now Michael Goodman, New York Post chiefcolumnist, political columnist and Fox News contributor. Michael, good tohave you here.You know, Joe Biden is going to have his work cut out for him on thisissue. It's something that you can tell in the voices of small businessowners, people really are struggling. And they patted up to here with a lotof the restrictions.MICHAEL GOODWIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, Joe Biden, if you will recall,Martha, early on was all for a national lockdown and said he would supportthat if the scientist said it was the right thing to do. But I think morerecently, he has begun to realize the damage that they have done,particularly in some of the big blue states, New York and Californiaespecially.And with the vaccine coming down the road, you would think that there wouldbe less need for that and more desired to keep things open. But for a lotof these businesses, it's too late. As your statistics there showed, and Ithink also there is the sense of resistance against these lockdowns thatfeel often arbitrary, inconsistent with rules.And then come of course, you see some of these officials who order theselockdowns breaking them themselves to have dinner with friends or family orto go on trips, even as they tell others not to.So, I think the moment has passed for a big national lockdown. I can't seehow Biden would be able to pull that off.MACCALLUM:  Yes.GOODWIN:  I don't think there is enough support for it anywhere.MACCALLUM:  But, I mean, even when it's done in isolated spots in the bigcities in particular, it's just crushing them. Small business confidencelevels have been plunging since the election at the beginning of November.Fifty-three percent of small business owners say that they expect taxpolicy is going to have a negative impact on their businesses for the next12 months. Forty-nine percent said government regulation will have anegative impact as well. That's what they are anticipating from thiseconomic team, Mike.GOODWIN:  Right. Yes, I mean, I'm surprised the numbers aren't actuallyhigher in both cases.MACCALLUM:  Yes.GOODWIN:  I mean, Biden has talked a lot about raising taxes. You know,even on the personal income tax, small businesses often, you know, passedthrough businesses. So, I don't know how he's going to do that of course,what happens in Congress will be a big part of the outcome. But evenregulations.I mean, we see that in New York a lot that they say you can open an outdoordining spot, but then you have to do x, y, and z. And suddenly, thesemarginal businesses simply can't afford it. There is no profit in doing it.So, you know, it strikes me too, Martha, that a lot of people were talkingabout Biden, Cuomo, Gavin Newsom, and other governors and mayors they'venever ran a business.MACCALLUM:  Yes.GOODWIN:  They've never had a small business in their own family. They havealways been, they're political careerists. So, I think there is adisconnect between what the government says you need to do and what peoplefeel they can do who actually have to bear the brunt of these.MACCALLUM:  I think the migration is fascinating. I saw today that Hewlett-Packard is leaving California, San Jose, California, they're moving toTexas. It feels like every day I see another headline of a business thathas decided that they don't want to stay in these really restricted statesanymore. They want to go somewhere where they have a little bit morefreedom to run their business they see fit, Michael.GOODWIN:  Well, and you talk to individuals who are doing it for the samereason. That if you, for example, in New York City, New York State, if youpay, if you are making the top amount, you are going to pay 12.5 percentextra on your income taxes.I mean, if you are struggling, that's a lot of money if you have abusiness, the same thing, that's a big difference to go on a place withlower taxes, lower regulations.MACCALLUM (on camera):  So real quick, here is President Obama jokinglytalking about a third term. And I will tell you why I played this after wetake a look at it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  If I couldmake an arrangement where I had a stand-in a front man or front woman andthey had an ear piece in and I was just in my basement in my sweats lookingthrough the stuff. Then I could sort of deliver the lines, but somebodyelse was doing all the talking and ceremony, I would be fine with that.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Real quick, Michael. How much of a role do youthink the former president plays in his former vice president's presidency?GOODWIN:  Well, it will be interesting to see. I think Obama is not goingto go away quietly. I think he will be a presence. I think there will be alot of back channel, I suspect with Kamala Harris among others who wasclose to Obama. So, I think this president is not going away. He is young.He clearly wants to be in the game. And there is nothing to stop himreally.MACCALLUM:  Michael Goodwin of the New York Post, good to see you tonight.Thank you.GOODWIN:  Thank you.MACCALLUM:  More of The Story coming up right after this. Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  Tomorrow night, part two of my exclusive interview with BradParscale. He looks ahead specifically to the president's prospects for2024.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MACCALLUM:  Do you believe he should run in 2024?PARSCALE:  I don't know if that's what he should do, but I wish he would. Ithink there's still a lot of story to be told. Do I hope he makes a fewlittle tweaks? Yes. If he wants to call me, I think I will tell him whatthose tweaks are. If he doesn't want to call me, I will wish him the bestof luck. I think he is the best thing for this country.(END VIDEOTAPE)MACCALLUM (on camera):  More tomorrow night at 7 p.m. Eastern.
