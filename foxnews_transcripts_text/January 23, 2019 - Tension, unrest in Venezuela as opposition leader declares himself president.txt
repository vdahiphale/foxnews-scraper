MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST: Thank you, Bret. Good to see you. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum. And "The Story" tonight, this January in America, you won't see this. Let's see the big grand entrance.

TRUMP: The State of the Union speech has been canceled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn't want to get the truth. She doesn't want the American public to hear what's going on.

MACCALLUM: So, how did we get here? Why is there not going to be a State of the Union address? Because Republicans and Democrats can't decide how much to spend to make sure that we have a secure southern border.

They both say that they want that. They have both backed billions of dollars for it in the past. But for some reason now, it's a big problem. And much further, south of the border today, a not entirely unrelated story is playing out. The beginning of the end of the dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. Who oversaw the death of democracy in his country and drove it into the ground.
No food, no medicine. And if you spoke up to complain, you were likely to be thrown in prison. Today, President Trump announcing that the United States would no longer recognize Maduro as Venezuela's President. One day after Vice President Mike Pence released a video appealing directly to the Venezuelan people.

MACCALLUM: So, that was according to the President of Honduras. That accusation is disputed by other observers of Venezuela. But it is true that political upheaval and barely functioning governments in Honduras and Guatemala have driven the movement of these caravans north, that's a fact.
And also a fact now in Mexico today, where migrants are reportedly being given tagged bracelets. They're being told to keep moving it north to United States border. So, here we are.

But first, Isaias Medina, a former senior diplomat representing Venezuela at the U.N. He left that post in 2017 to fight what he calls the "humanitarian apocalypse" in his country.
Isaias, good to have you with us this evening. You know, having watched and listened to what you have said in the past about how much you wanted to see this moment, how are you feeling tonight about what played out?

ISAIAS MEDINA, FORMER DIPLOMAT, VENEZUELA: Thank you -- thank you so much, Martha. Thanks at Fox. And I also wanted to thank on behalf of 30 million Venezuelans. I want to thank President Trump for supporting the restoration of democracy in our country, and for supporting our new President Juan Guaido. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I could not feel better to see the wind changing as you had mentioned. And now, to see that a new young strong president is taking over and filling the void that has been created by Maduro's expiration of his term.
This is a very important matter in the region because Maduro's regime has become a clear threat to the maintenance of peace and security in the American hemisphere. And I do -- I have no doubt that also his relationships with international terrorist organizations like FARC, ELN, and Hezbollah are also are a very clear risk to the national security of the United States.
MACCALLUM: Yes, obviously they have terrorist connections which you pointed out. Drug cartels which are hugely problematic that destabilize the region, as you point out. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, from here to there, how rocky could it get? I mean, is Maduro going to battle this? Is he going to go quietly? It's hard to figure out what the -- what the near future brings here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
MEDINA: Well, the presidents are very clear. It's a very cruel dictatorship that has created an economic meltdown for their own interest of grand corruption. But also, the worst part is the humanitarian deterioration that they have induced through weaponization, of starvation, and medicine scarcity for social control and to remain in power.
This has broken down, and today we've noticed how hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan have taken the streets. And have spoken out to change this regime that has brought hunger and death to the Venezuelan people.

MACCALLUM: I just want to play a very short clip from a documentary that was done, called, Women in Chaos in Venezuela, which speaks a little bit to what you are discussing for the folks at home. Let's take a look.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: It's heartbreaking. I know you could understand it. And there were subtitles on the bottom. But, it's hard for -- I think, for Americans to imagine walking to a hospital with your child and being told by the doctors, "You know, I'm sorry. We wish we could help. There's just -- there is no any medicine here.

MEDINA: Martha, if I can tell you something that, that they use this social control card. It's a socialist control card that was actually issued by ZTE in China. And they try to control people. And who doesn't use this card, it is walking down death row, because you will not be able to get any assistance either in hospitals, in food, or even gasoline.

They were trying to control the population at such extent that they were just killing hundreds of people daily. This is why it's so important that the Trump administration and the international community has supported Juan Guaido as our new president in charge. To take control and bring back and restore not only justice through peace, but the rule of law which is so important, and democracy. To be able to free our people and our territory from a mafia failed state.
MACCALLUM: Yes, it's going to be fascinating to watch. And I know it's a happy hopeful day for you and for so many people in Venezuela. And Juan Guaido was educated, at least, partly at George Washington University here in Washington, D.C. Or down on Washington, D.C. And he is one to watch here.

        }
      
RIVERA: Well, you know, I totally agree with your previous speaker. My old daytime talk show used to air in Venezuela. So, I used to travel quite frequently to the country. Wonderful people, a middle-class country with some of the largest petroleum reserves on earth. To see that crumble first on the Hugo Chavez, and then, his protegee, Nicolas Maduro has been heartbreaking.

To see them rendered so desperate as to drive them to use their constitution to usurp the presidency of the country. I witnessed Juan Guaido, a 35-year-old charismatic, very popular opposition figure who heads the National Assembly. Whether the army though in Venezuela honors what they have done remains to be seen it could be.
You know, we have our immigration crisis, but it could be that what we're watching developed in Venezuela is the beginning of a Civil War. I hope not, but it is a great interest to me that Canada and Brazil and Chile and Peru, all back the United States, all back President Trump in supporting Juan Guaido as the new president of Venezuela.
Remember, two Russian supersonic nuclear bombers visited Venezuela just in December. So, this could be part of a -- of a -- you know a real-world chess match here.

MACCALLUM: It absolutely could. And he was taken into custody, pulled into a van, Juan Guaido for about a half an hour, 45 minutes the other day. He was then released but he is -- he's a courageous person because he's in a very tenuous situation as he tries to do this. And as you say, he's got the backing of the United States and other very strong countries.
I want your thoughts on this whole State of the Union situation before I let you go. What do you -- what do you see in all of this?
RIVERA: I think it's heartbreaking, it's humiliating, it's so embarrassing. You know, I understand that Speaker Pelosi hates President Trump. But to do something to, to deny the American people the State of the Union address. That we've watched our entire lives, the ceremony, the president coming in.

You know, the congressman trying to attract his attention one side rising the other side sitting. You know, stone face the Supreme Court of the United States there. You know, all the leaders of the government, says it is a democracy writ large and to see it undercut by partisan politics, is the end of refusal to negotiate a compromise is something that is just appalling to me.

Why doesn't Speaker Pelosi who cares so deeply about these issues, why don't you sit opposite President Trump and say, OK, I'll give you $1 billion for the wall, not $5 billion? Build 800-miles, not seven.
You know, we've negotiate, compromise. Compromise is painful for everybody, but this refusal to speak and that to cancel this grand event on the world stage like this, I think is really an embarrassment to the United States, and it sustained on democracy.

MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, and there's a really a great irony when you think about it, Geraldo. The State of the Union is not necessarily to come out and say everything is perfect. It's to come out and explain to everybody what the State of the Union is. And it's complicated right now. But there's a reason to convey that message and explain it and lay it out. That's why it's in the Constitution so that people will have that opportunity to hear from the president.
I mean, it's really incredible. So, we'll see how it plays out. Maybe there is hope. Geraldo, thanks. Good to see you tonight.

MACCALLUM: Hot off his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos where he made waves with what was seen by some as a strong Trumpian and anti- globalist message to the world forum. I sat down for a candid conversation early today with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about how the President views NATO really and North Korea, is that meeting going to happen, getting out of Syria and the recent stinging criticism by John Kerry, his predecessor, who says that President Trump should just resign. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MACCALLUM: You said new winds are blowing in the world and they're positive -- you pointed to the Brexit example and also to President Trump, nations matter, borders matter. One headline said Mike Pompeo drops an anti-globalist stink bomb with a smile. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
POMPEO: Well, I did smile. Martha, it's good to be with you. What I did was try to explain to those who were sitting there in Davos why it is that America has been an enormous force for good over these two years of the Trump administration. How our policies make not only Americans safer but the whole world and contribute to economic growth and wealth creation and freedom all around the world. Those were the things I talked about. The importance of the nation-state as the fundamental building block for national security and frankly for stability and regions as well.
It can sometimes seem disruptive. It can sometimes seem like America is acting in ways that are causing trouble. But these fundamental premises that that were built out over 70 years ago need to be relooked and that's what President Trump is driving.
MACCALLUM: That obviously brings to my NATO and a report the other day that the President had said to top national security officials that he didn't necessarily see the point anymore of NATO. Do you agree?
POMPEO: This administration has done more good for NATO than the previous several administrations combined. The increased resources available for Secretary General Stoltenberg and for NATO partners around world are significantly greater, approaching now $100 billion greater than they would have been absent the pressure the President Trump put on. He did that for American national security that is we want NATO to be stronger to protect America. But importantly, European nations now or more formally protected as well.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MACCALLUM: So it sounds like you think it was a waste of time that the House yesterday went through the process of passing a bill that would reject any effort that the President might make to withdraw from NATO?
POMPEO: Yes. That's silly.
MACCALLUM: You know, you look at people like General Mattis and Brett McGurk who on their way out really made an effort to point out their concerns about the President's adherence to alliances or his confidence in these alliances going forward. And you talked about how you know, the dynamic needs to change 70 years later, we're in a different world.
POMPEO: President Trump knows that America can't go it alone. We need partners. We've built out coalitions of dozens and dozens of countries to defeat ISIS. We've built an enormous coalition to put pressure on North Korea, to protect not only United States but Japan, South Korea and the whole region. President Trump understands that strong nations will have alliances that work on behalf of their countries and all countries and so that's what we're trying to do not only with NATO. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But when every organization in the world isn't working, isn't delivering security for the American people, if it is we'll reinforce and where it's not, we'll work to make it better. This president is committed to ensuring that we have security for the American people and by that, we'll also make sure that the world is safer as well.
MACCALLUM: There are some people who asked the question about Article 5. You know if Montenegro is attacked, should young men and women from the United States fight to defend Montenegro? What's the answer to that?
POMPEO: The answer is coalitions can work when every member of the coalition is doing their fair share. That's how -- that's how these relationships have worked for an awfully long time. And unfortunately, some countries took a vacation for 20 years and thought that the threats from Russia or from Asia or from all the places in the Middle East and terrorism, they weren't doing what they needed to do to protect in their countries. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Our urging is this. Every country needs to make sure its contributing enough to make sure that their country is secure. And when they do, America will be with them to support their ass.
MACCALLUM: So yes, American soldiers would go to defend Montenegro?
POMPEO: You know, I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about what might happen or how a certain scenario might unfold, but make no mistake about it. America has always been there when there were important American and global interests is at stake.
MACCALLUM: With regard to the decision to leave Syria and it's a gradual decision is what we're seeing play out. Two new attacks over the one attempted and four killed last week in Syria. How long is the commitment there?
POMPEO: I was with the President over when our Americans were returned on this past Saturday. It's always difficult to be with those families. These are patriots. These are great Americans who sacrificed their life to help keep America safe. Now, President Trump understands that and respects that commitment. And so in Syria, President Trump has made a tactical decision. We're going to withdraw our 2,000 uniformed military personnel from that country.
But make no mistake about it. The defeat of the Caliphate, ISIS Caliphate in Syria is almost complete. We're going to stay there till it's done. This threat from radical Islamic terrorism is a global threat and America will posture itself in a way to ensure that we're doing all that we can to protect the American people from that threat.
MACCALLUM: So not on the ground bombing from a distance? Is that the way you see it in the future? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
POMPEO: I think what President Trump will do is he'll look at each situation to make the best decision on how to approach it. If it requires American forces to be someplace, we'll do that. President Trump very much wants to end these long drawn-out 17 years now in Afghanistan. He says let's find a way to achieve the ends to protect Americans from the threat from radical Islamic terrorism. But let's see if we can do it in a way that is sustainable and makes a sense.
MACCALLUM: What do you say to those like Brett McGurk who I mentioned before who say that no one's happier than Russia and Iran when they hear the news that the United States is pulling out of Syria and likely in the near term future out of Afghanistan as well.
POMPEO: A great question. Let's talk about happiness in Iran and Russia. What is Russia seen from the Trump administration, hundreds of sanctions an enormous military buildup by the United States of America, a missile posture, a missile defense review that makes sure that America will be capable defending itself not only next year but 20 years from now. I assure you that none of these things sat well with Vladimir Putin.
Let's talk about Iran. Do you think they're happy that the largest set of sanctions ever emplace in an economy that is likely to fall into recession by the spring of this year makes the Iranians happy? To see the global coalition against Iran that has been put in place not only Arab countries but countries from Asia and Africa will join us in February in Warsaw for a ministerial that will address Middle East stability in Iran.
I don't think for one moment those two countries believe they're in a better place today with the Trump administration than they were with Barack Obama and John Kerry in charge of this country.
MACCALLUM: So John Kerry, former Secretary of State was in Davos. He was asked if what advice he would give to President Trump.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you had President Trump sitting right off with you, what would your message to him be.
JOHN KERRY, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: No, I can't play that. Because he doesn't take any of this seriously. He doesn't have an ability to have that kind of conversation.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So what would you say to him to get it, sir? What would your message be?
KERRY: Resign.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
POMPEO: I must tell you, we don't pay much attention to the advice that Secretary Kerry is providing to our administration. We're doing our best to clean up the failures that occurred on his watch.
MACCALLUM: With regard to pulling out of Syria and Afghanistan, that's the plan as well right, to pull out of Afghanistan.

        }
      
POMPEO: I'm not going to comment on the future plans and intentions in any of those places. The President will make those announcements when the time is right.
MACCALLUM: So what do you say to those who look back at you know, Bush Doctrine that it's better to fight them there than fight them here. That was post 9/11.
POMPEO: No, Martha, we are. But we are. We are. We took down a Caliphate that grew in the previous administration. You remember, Martha. You remember the pictures of people kneeling on beaches and people in cages and fire. This is the -- this is the space, this is the real estate that ISIS built out prior to the time that the Trump administration came into office. And we literally are in the last set of square kilometers in Syria.
We're done in Iraq with it with the real estate. We took back Mosul. We still have work to do. ISIS and the threat from terrorism remains to be sure but we've made enormous progress and we did it there.
MACCALLUM: You're a former military man. What do you say to those who look at the Kurds who fought alongside us who don't want to be abandoned there and who feel very vulnerable if we leave their side?
POMPEO: I think the President was very clear about his expectation with how the Kurds will need to be treated after the time that the U.S. military personnel depart. We understand the work that they did alongside of us. It was enormously important and good work. We're going to ensure that the Kurds have a proper place in Syria after our departure.
MACCALLUM: And you think that Turkey will abide by that?

        }
      
POMPEO: About lots of conversations, I think we have a way forward.
MACCALLUM: North Korea, some look at North Korea and remember the meeting, the first meeting that the President had with Kim Jong-un shaking hands, the President came back. He said no doubt in his mind that the denuclearization process was underway and that it would absolutely happen.
Now there are reports that there's a new top-secret missile base and perhaps 19 new missiles that we can't identify the locations of. Is that progress?
POMPEO: Let may start by saying the American people should be -- should rest assured that the United States understands deeply what's taking place in North Korea. Sometimes things pop in press reports and folks act like it's news. The American people should understand that the United States intelligence community and our security apparatus knows full well what activities are taking place and frankly which ones aren't. With respect to the negotiations --
MACCALLUM: Are you saying that those are not taking place?
POMPEO: I just want the American people to understand that the United States intelligence community is fully aware of what's going on in North Korea and those things which are not. I don't comment on U.S. intelligence substantively.
Second, with respect to the negotiations, President Trump and I have both for the -- from the very beginning, from the first time I went to North Korea as the CIA Director understand that this is going to be a process that is going to take some time. First step, stopping there testing of their missile program. Second step, stopping their nuclear test.

        }
      
Those still continue. There's been real progress made. There are many conversations going on. Chairman Kim continues to assure the President of United States his intent on denuclearization. And I hope that in the end of February, when the two leaders get together, we can make a substantial step along the way.
MACCALLUM: Quick question for you on Kansas politics. A lot of speculation out there that you might consider running for Pat Roberts seat. There were reports that you spent some time over the weekend with Republican strategist Ward Baker to discuss that possibility and that Mitch McConnell is urging you to run.
POMPEO: Lots of folks have reached out to me and suggested I ought to do that. I have suggested to them that I have a very full plate as Secretary of State and I intend to keep doing this so long as President Trump will commit to it.
MACCALLUM: So no intention to get involved in the Senate race in Kansas?
POMPEO: Martha, every day I'm trying to make sure that I'm doing what President Trump wants me to do to keep America safe. That's my singular focus.
MACCALLUM: Is Mitch McConnell trying to change your mind about that? I know that Kris Kobach who lost the governor's race there is considered a possibility to run for that seat.
POMPEO: I spoke to Senator McConnell once. He asked me if I'd think about it. And I told him I appreciated the phone call.

MACCALLUM: Tonight, a deadly standoff in Florida leaving at least five people dead after a gunman opened fire at a Florida bank. The suspect is in custody at this hour.
Trace Gallagher has the breaking details from our west coast newsroom. Hi, Trace.
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. The shooting suspect actually called police on himself. This happened at Sun Trust Bank in Sebring which is in Highlands County about 90 miles of both Orlando and Tampa.
The sheriff there says early this afternoon 21-year-old Zephen Xaver called 911 reporting that he had fired shots inside the bank. In fact, he reportedly said, "I have shot five people."
Both police officers and sheriff's deputies then set up a perimeter and negotiations with the shooter began but were unsuccessful. Though it's unclear if the standoff and the delay in medical attention led to victims losing their lives.
Finally, the sheriff's SWAT team in a SWAT vehicle rammed through the front doors and that's when the suspect gave himself up. The first sign of grim news came from Highland's County commissioner Don Elwell who wrote on Facebook, quote, "getting more information now, none of it is good. Please keep praying." And sure enough, the sheriff soon confirmed the worst. Watch.

GALLAGHER: Yet the victims have not been identified so we don't know if they were employees or customers. There are some reports he killed everyone inside the bank. That has not yet been confirmed. Zephen Xaver lives in Sebring but he's apparently from Indiana and reportedly has no criminal history.
And as of two weeks ago, he was a correctional officer trainee but resigned. So far there is no motive. Martha?

MACCALLUM: Three years ago, before the Me Too movement began, I worked on a documentary about sex on college campuses.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
MACCALLUM: Like so much else on college campuses today, sex has become deeply politicized. What is consent? What is sexual activity? And most importantly, what constitutes an assault?

MACCALLUM: Questions we're still talking a lot today and it looked at the rules that were put in place by the Obama administration. Rules that dictated that campuses had to basically create their own court system made up usually of a few professors who would decide the guilt or innocence.
In many cases, the accused was not allowed to have a lawyer present with them. And while the motivation was a good one to crackdown on sexual harassment and assault which everyone wants to see cracked down upon. The system was flawed.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She asked, do you have a condom? And I say, yes, I do. She says great. You know, I'll be down in two minutes.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Colleges are looking at campus sex differently these days.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She thought she could give consent and I was just sitting there like what?

MACCALLUM: My next guest has been showing his documentary to his high school students for a couple of years in order to get the kids thinking about these issues, talking about them together before they head off to college. But he recently got in trouble for showing it and has now been suspended without pay.
Michael Poplardo joins me now in a story exclusive. Michael, thanks for being here. What was the goal of your lesson? What were you hoping to achieve in the class, and how did the kids respond?
MICHAEL POPLARDO, SUSPENDED FOX LANE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER: Thank you. Can I first just thank Ashe Schow --
MACCALLUM: Yes.
POPLARDO: She has been wonderful. She helped turn the tide of this entire--
MACCALLUM: Yes. Ashe is a reporter who was in the documentary and who is on this show often as well. Absolutely.
POPLARDO: So, let's get to the objective of the lesson. So I care very deeply about my students. I always have. And for 29 years in teaching seniors I always make an attempt to help the students make a transition to their life after leaving what we might sometimes called the Bedford bubble, especially in late May. I mean, my daughter is a senior right now.
Making connections to seniors who have already committed to college or have a job lined up or going into the military is not a very easy thing to do. But what you can make a connection to their life and one way to do that is what I call bridge lessons. This is not unusual. I have been doing this for years. What's unusual is that this time it included a Fox News documentary. The prior 27 years I did things like this.
MACCALLUM: And you had been showing this documentary for a couple of years. And then someone sent a letter and said that they didn't think you should be showing it to the students. Fast forward for me and tell me what happened.
POPLARDO: Yes. It was an anonymous alert which is a system designed to help the school find out if there is something really dangerous going on. Is someone maybe going to harm themselves or harm the school. Somehow it was used for a different purpose. It was used to complain about this lesson.
It had -- it was very short had three sentences two of which were lies. And the superintendent, you know, for whatever reason, decided that he wanted to investigate this. An investigation was very short lived they didn't speak to a single student, parent or my co-teacher. And four of the 10 lessons I showed this video and I actually had a co-teacher did not speak with him either.
MACCALLUM: So, they have now suspended you. You know, what was your -- you asked the kids to write on cards, you know, how would you respond in this situation? What are some good ways to make sure that you don't find yourself in a situation? How do you really establish consent with other people when you are out in the real world, right?
POPLARDO: Yes.
MACCALLUM: I mean, these are the kind of things that you wanted to get them talking about and comfortable talking about, right?
POPLARDO: Yes. So, at the end of the lesson I did what's called exit cards and they are to write down their take away. The take away that they are to write down basically said which strategy or strategies that we discussed today do you plan to employ when you go off to college, the world of work or the military?
And the kids wrote down some awesome things on there.
MACCALLUM: Yes.
POPLARDO: The cards themselves and my attorneys' possession at this moment, but I remember one sticks out. One student wrote we use designated drivers when we go to parties. How about when we get to college campus, we have a designated, you know, peer. And that person agrees to stay sober and we all agree whatever that person says we do. That was on an index card that was presented to the superintendent --
MACCALLUM: Yes.
POPLARDO: -- at the hearing and no budging. No budging.
MACCALLUM: All right. We are going to follow your story and have you back as it moves along. Michael Poplardo, thank you very much for being here, economics teacher in high school trying to teach some messages as well to the kids about life. Thanks for coming.
POPLARDO: Thank you so much.
MACCALLUM: So up next, New Orleans Saints fans are taking the NFL's controversial no call to court. A story exclusive with NFL hall of famer Tony Dungy, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MACCALLUM: It is the controversial no-call still causing outrage among NFL fans days after a high stakes playoff games between the New Orleans Saints and the L.A. Rams. A Rams player pushed a Saints player receiver out of bounds but the ref did not throw a flag. That one has been looked at from every possible angle after this game.
Now the Saints fans say they were robbed of a trip to the Super Bowl. And some are suing, saying that the only fair solution is a rematch.
Here now in a Story exclusive on this and other things Tony Dungy a former Super Bowl winning coach, of course, hall of famer and author of the new book "The Soul of a Team." Tony, thank you. It's great to have you with us tonight on this story. Good to see you.
TONY DUNGY, FORMER COACH, SUPER BOWL: Thank you. Good to be with you.
MACCALLUM: So, what is --
(CROSSTALK)
DUNGY: I'm a little humored about that response though. That's taking it very seriously.
MACCALLUM: About the suing?
DUNGY: Yes.
MACCALLUM: Yes. Well now you know it's a betting game these days. So, there is money on the table as well. And I think that might be part of the problem. You know, what's your -- what's your take on this whole story.
DUNGY: Well, there have been missed calls, bad calls since the beginning of football or basketball or any other sport. You don't like to see it. I feel the same fans' pain. If it was my home team I would be upset, too. But it's a game. It's a sport. There is human error and we -- life has to go on. We have to move past it.
MACCALLUM: Yes. And nobody said that better than Drew Brees. Let's put up this picture. He was on the field right after the game with his son who was wearing Luis' (Ph) shirt 11, number 11th and doing practice kicking. You know, looking like they had already put everything behind them.
DUNGY: Yes.
MACCALLUM: I do want to ask you about another story here with regard to some announcers that you've written about who you believe are perpetuating a stereotype about black quarterbacks. And this has been researched in terms of the language that commentators use when they compare black quarterbacks and white quarterbacks. Explain -- explain what you see in that situation.
DUNGY: Well, and I believe it's totally unintentional. I don't think it's a thought process at all but you see, you know, the black quarterbacks described as athletic, as having great arm strength as all the physical tools and you just rarely hear about the cerebral part of it.
Patrick Mahomes has played outstanding football for the Kansas City Chiefs. His first year, he is doing some amazing things. But all I tend to hear about is the great athletic plays. He has a great grasp of the game. He understands the game. He processes it mentally. He is a leader. I would just like to hear more of those types of adjectives describing some of our African-American quarterbacks.
MACCALLUM: And this is something that announcers themselves have sort of acknowledged when they look at the way that they approach these conversations about these players.
DUNGY: You know, it has been acknowledged in some arenas, and, again, I don't think it's intentional.
MACCALLUM: Yes.
DUNGY: I think many times we do see the great athleticism and we say wow, but we don't always take into consideration that other side of the coin and the mental part of it and leadership and all the things that go into being a great quarterback.
MACCALLUM: Well, I want to -- there is also a piece in the San Francisco Chronicle that takes a look at whether or not it's time for Collin Kaepernick to return to the NFL. They say there is sort of a quarterback shortage out there and that a lot of people agree that that he deserves another shot that he's done his time for no crime, as they wrote. Do you agree?
DUNGY: Well, when you are the quarterback you are the face of the franchise. There is a lot of things that go into it. And I know I believe there are some teams that Collin Kaepernick could play for and help and benefit but they are saying what's the return? Do I want to turn off my fan base? Do I want to, you know, stand up against the backlash? Maybe it's not worth it.
And I think that's where Collin is now. He's definitely one of the top 30, 35 quarterbacks in the NFL. He should be playing. But right now, he isn't.
MACCALLUM: All right. The book is called "The Soul of a Team: A Modern Day Fable for Winning Team Work." Before I let you go, who is going to win the Super Bowl, sir?
DUNGY: I have to go with New England at this point.
MACCALLUM: Me too.
DUNGY: Very, very close game but Tom Brady against Drew Bruce and those -- or against Jared Goff in those critical moments I think most people would favor Brady.
MACCALLUM: We have that in common and I know you play for Coach Belichick. So, you know.
DUNGY: Yes.
MACCALLUM: Tony Dungy, "The Soul of a Team," thank you so much. Great to have you with us tonight. Thank you for being here.
DUNGY: Thank you.
MACCALLUM: So, coming up next, the students of Covington high school have been -- are they similar to Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the way that they are being treated in the media. Jesse Watters has an answer to that question, coming up next. Wednesdays with Watters.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NICHOLAS SANDMANN, STUDENT, COVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL: People judge me based on one expression which I wasn't smirking. But people assume that's what I have. And they've gone there to titling me and labeling me as a racist person.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
MACCALLUM: He is a junior in high school, Nicholas Sandmann. The student at the center of the so-called clash with the Native American man that spark national controversy defending himself in his first national interview with Savanna Guthrie earlier today.
Jesse Watters says they have been smeared by the press Kavanaugh style. Jesse, welcome.
JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Welcome.
MACCALLUM: Wednesdays with Watters.
WATTERS: Thank you for having me.
MACCALLUM: I was talking about this early. Thank you very much for being here. Why that comparison?
WATTERS: Well, just the face alone they've said his face looks like Kavanaugh. That haughty kind of smirk, and if smirking is a crime lock me up, Martha. I do it all the time. Just think injustice if you look at what happened. The country is reacting the same way that it reacted during Kavanaugh and once all the exculpatory evidence comes out.
For instance, the accuser, in this case the Indian, was lied and said that these white kids were attacking these black protesters. He never even served in Vietnam. Now he said when he came back from Vietnam, he was called a baby killer and spit on. He never went.
And then you know what he did after this protest? He tried to invade a mass at a cathedral in Washington, D.C. and security prevented him from coming in. So, there is all this stuff that's coming out and the media is trying to slither away from it like they did in the Kavanaugh story.
MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, all the things that you point out are accurate and, you know, this story has to be presented in its entirety which is the lesson really of this whole story.
You know, and I went back this morning and watched what was being said to the boys as well, they had said you were the product of incest. You're an incest baby. They've called him homophobic slurs. I mean, and I think that also hasn't gotten enough attention.
WATTERS: Right.
MACCALLUM: And if you change the colors and races of any of the people in this story, I mean, can you imagine what this story would have looked like. Because these are white Catholic kids, they are really getting the brunt of this.
WATTERS: Right. They are criminalized --
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: It's doing some --
WATTERS: -- smiling while white and wearing a MAGA hat. That's apparently a face crime they said. You're right. The black Israelites, this is a hate group. They've been categorized as such, yelling all --
(CROSSTALK)
MACCALLUM: They also went after the Native American man.
WATTERS: Exactly.
MACCALLUM: They said you worship buffalo. You -- I mean, it's horrible.
WATTERS: Yelling all sorts of slurs. And the media has not interviewed these people at all.
MACCALLUM: Not at all.
WATTERS: They got off scot-free. Check out Watters World this weekend though, we might have one of these black Israelites people on the show, so we'll find out what they truly believe.
MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, they went on and on and on. I watch --they were out there for hours and they were looking to pick a fight and they ended up causing one of sorts. But you know, I give that young man credit. He said I wish I had walked away, that would have been the right thing to do.
WATTERS: Maybe.
MACCALLUM: And that he felt like he wasn't smirking but man, what a lesson for all of them.
WATTERS: I know.
MACCALLUM: Jesse, thank you. Good to see you.
WATTERS: Welcome. You, too. Congratulations to your Patriots.
MACCALLUM: Thank you. We'll talk about that more next week.
WATTERS: Yes, we will.
MACCALLUM: That is The Story for this Wednesday night. E-mail me your thoughts at Thestory@foxnews.com. "Tucker Carlson" is coming up next in D.C.
