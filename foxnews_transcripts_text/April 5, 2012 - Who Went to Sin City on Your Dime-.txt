And now some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Comparatively Speaking
Jimmy Carter has walked back a comment he made about his post-presidential life being more productive than those of his contemporaries. Mr. Carter told NBC News, "I feel that my role as a former president is probably superior to that of other presidents." He cited his foundation's work in international and domestic affairs. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
His office soon issued a clarification, saying the former president meant to say the Carter Center has given him superior opportunities to do good. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The former president also said during that interview the current polarized political climate is comparable to Civil War days. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Sin City
It was just last year when President Obama criticized corporate meetings in Las Vegas, telling an audience, "You can't get corporate jets, can't take a trip to Vegas or the Super Bowl on the taxpayers' dime." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But a Denver TV station reports that's exactly what the Census Department did. CBS-4 says the Census Bureau sent 140 administrators from Colorado and nine other western states to Las Vegas for several days to discuss lessons learned from this year's census. They stayed at a hotel and casino on the strip for an estimated total cost of around $100,000.
A Census spokesman maintains the department has used teleconferencing in the past, but sometimes, "You just need to sit down and hash things out face to face." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Biting the Hand... 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
President Obama's aunt, who was recently granted asylum after it was discovered she had been living in the country illegally, is blaming the U.S. for its immigration problems.
Zietuni Onyango told a Boston TV station, "If I come as an immigrant, you have the obligation to make me a citizen." She also said she was assigned public housing despite her illegal status, saying, "I didn't take any advantage of the system. The system took advantage of me."
