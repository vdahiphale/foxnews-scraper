This immigration reform drama playing out on Capitol Hill right now really should have its own playbill that way everyone will know the members of the cast, the understudies, the members of the orchestra and all the key stage hands.
As I said about three months ago, this spectacle has been directed all along by the White House and brilliantly choreographed by liberal New York Senator Chuck Schumer. And today the "New York Times" confirms the White House's stealth campaign to run the immigration negotiation. President Obama's staff has even set up shop in Senate work space and has been drafting language for amendments and then they have been giving other amendments thumbs up or thumbs down. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And let's not forget, by the way, the President's point person on immigration is none other than Cecilia Munoz. She is the former senior vice president of the militant open borders group La Raza that means "the race" in Spanish. The dialogue in this off, off, off Broadway production is stale frankly and it needs a rewrite. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is a break through amendment. This is our time. The system is broken. Latinos will punish the GOP if they don't do this. We need to bring people out of the shadows. Blah, blah, blah, cliches and generalities are what usually follow any time a tough question, a specific factual question is asked. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
For instance, about the economic impact of this legislation, especially on working class Americans. Today on my radio show I really got into it with the co-author of the supposed break through amendment, Senator John Hoeven from North Dakota.
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: This bill and this immigration reform will flood the marketplace with new workers and legalized workers. It will drive up unemployment and drive down wages for the next 10-plus years according to the CBO. How you can support that?
SEN. JOHN HOEVEN (R), NORTH DAKOTA: My whole focus here is to secure the border first. And I've tried to put forward five tough conditions that must be met before any illegal immigrant gets a green card or a permanent legalized status. That's what I'm trying to do - is secure the border first. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END AUDIO CLIP)  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Oh, that sounds nice but that's never the way it ends out playing out. And if they are not enforcing the law as it exists today, why are they going to be enforcing tougher new restrictions tomorrow? So we in fact know that the border is never going to be secured under this type of scenario.
GOP senators supporting the Gang of Eight are already starting to hear negative reviews. Calls to their offices are overwhelmingly against the bill. But I have to say it looks like the fix is in, in the U.S. Senate.
But I hope that House Speaker John Boehner is watching this drama carefully. Knowing that La Raza is co-directing this production he should announce that the House GOP is done with comprehensive immigration this year and simply pass a resolution urging President Obama to start enforcing the border to protect American prosperity and the national security interests. Republicans can then refocus the debate on helping increase the prosperity of all American workers - all legal immigrants and their families as well.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's "The Memo."
