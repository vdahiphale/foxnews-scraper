Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Have you heard the drumbeat from the far left insisting that the very liberal justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, resign from the Supreme Court?
Yes, her pals on the far left, or maybe now ex-pals, are pushing for her to step down. Now, it's hard to believe after all she has done for them. Just today, in her 35-page dissent in the Hobby Lobby case, she smacked the conservative justices with tough words. You might wonder, why is the far left turning on her and telling her to scram? Well, friendships are very fragile in Washington, and loyalty doesn't exist in a town that's a snake pit. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Right now, the far left is terrified that, come November, Republicans will regain the majority in the Senate, which means if something does happen to Justice Ginsburg after November -- and she has had some serious health problems -- President Obama will be forced to nominate a more moderate justice than Justice Ginsburg, a moderate liberal who can get confirmed by moderate Senate. So the far left wants to strike now, while the Senate is still Democrat, so they can cherry pick the next justice. It's all politics. It's not loyalty. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Maybe Justice Ginsburg should heed President Harry Truman's advice: If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
