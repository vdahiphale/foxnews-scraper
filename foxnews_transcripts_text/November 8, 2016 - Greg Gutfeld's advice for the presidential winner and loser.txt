Sub-headline: How our next president can begin healing a divided nation

 
So either Trump wins and Hillary loses or Trump loses and Hillary wins. Here's advice for both on each occasion: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So trump, if you win: After thanking family, supporters and assorted water boys, promise critics that President Donald is not campaign Donald. That you'll serve all Americans -- not just fans, but critics. That means admitting to mistakes, then seeking to heal. Please don't audit me.
Now that means, Hillary, you lost. You had a good run. Now go become a billionaire like you've always wanted. Start a bed and breakfast with Huma. You could serve Weiners. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But if you win, Hillary, don't gloat: Wikileaks looms. Your best bet: Find the middle of the road and prove those wrong who called you Castro in culottes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, Donald, if you lose, concede politely. And when you launch Trump TV, please give Alex Jones the slot he earned -- right after Scott Baio. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
To Trump's media pals, if he loses, I know you'll blame those who didn't back him. But you made that bed and kicked everyone -- but Trump -- out. You own it.
Last, for Democrats: Figure out how to talk to white men. Republicans? Figure out how to talk to everyone else. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And Gary Johnson? Buy a globe.
Finally, America: congrats. We did something together -- we voted. That's teamwork. Some countries don't get this far. So no matter who wins, pat yourself on the back. This ain't Russia... yet!
