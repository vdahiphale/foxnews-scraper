Let's all "Off the Record." It is so tough when the really good guys die, the ones who are so humble and who always went the extra mile for others.
That's Jean-Claude Mille. He was the chef for so many Samaritan's Purse projects, from Samaritan's Purse volunteer camps in Haiti during the cholera outbreak to the many summers he cooked for injured vets and their spouses at Operation Heal our Patriots run by Reverend Franklin Graham in Alaska. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Jean Claude died in his sleep last week at the Alaska camp. And so I thought I would honor him by letting you meet him because I know you, too, you would have loved Jean-Claude. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then there is this pic. My last pic with Jean-Claude taken at Operation Heal our Patriots over the Fourth of July. And to think, with that smile, I just had no idea that would be my goodbye. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
