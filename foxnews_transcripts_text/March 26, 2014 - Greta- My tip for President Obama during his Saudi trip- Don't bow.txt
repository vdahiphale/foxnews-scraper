Let all go "Off the Record" for a minute. President Obama is heading to Saudi Arabia. Even though he has not asked, I have a tip for him. It's about manners.
In the last 24 hours, I have become a bit of an expert on them, having failed to keep my own manners. So what's my tip? When the president greets King Abdullah, try the old American handshake -- you know, the firm grip -- and not the bow. The last time he went to Saudi Arabia, he bowed. Now, he denies it, but here is the video, so you can decide. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We don't bow in this country, especially to countries with such dismal treatment of women like Saudi Arabia, where women can't show their ankles. The religious place where they'll hit them with a stick if they do. Women can't drive. They have to get permission from their husbands to have a mammogram. And God forbid something is found on their mammogram, they then have to get male permission to get medical treatment. This is just for starters. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, the president should go to Saudi Arabia, proud of our American values and customs. A handshake will do. No double cheek kissing, either. That's French. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
