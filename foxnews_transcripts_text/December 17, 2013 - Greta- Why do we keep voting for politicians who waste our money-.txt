'Off the Record', 12/17/13: It's time for voters to speak out, get involved and get some payback on lawmakers who don't feel guilty about wasting our tax dollars 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

I don't get it. Waste. Waste of your money to the tune of not thousands, not millions, but billions of dollars, and all done by people we choose, the very politicians we vote into office to help us.
We never demand that they stop wasting our money, and there are no consequences for the billions of dollars in waste. Why does it never stop? Well, politicians know they can get away with it. We don't do anything except keep voting them in. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Ever hear the term "enablers"? That's us, the voters. We're the enablers. The politicians have decades of proof that we'll do nothing about their waste of our money. And with rare exception, Senator Tom Coburn being one of those rare exceptions, politicians seem to have no guilty conscious about it, zero. It's almost as if they don't have relatives themselves back home working hard to make ends meet and paying taxes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Instead, politicians have developed a cavalier attitude. What do they care if it's other people's money? And yes, that would be your money. So, if right now you're sitting there furious at the billions and billions in waste -- and you should be -- you have two choices: Either pour yourself a drink, a big one, or get active. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Start exercising your voice. It doesn't have to cost you a dime. You can even do it on your laptop as you watch TV. Start speaking out, encourage others to run for office, write your politicians daily, maybe hourly. It may drive the politicians nuts, but let's face it, it's payback. They're driving us nuts.
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an important issue you think I should take "Off the Record," go to Greta.com and tell us about it.
