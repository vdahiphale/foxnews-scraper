DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Dan Bongino, Marie Harf, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is "The Five."
This is a Fox News alert. A must-see TV moment set for tomorrow in Washington, Attorney General Bill Barr and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will hold a news conference at 9:30 AM, on the dot, on the Mueller report. President Trump saying he may also do the same, having a press conference. Barr has been facing increased scrutiny from Democrats over his handling of the Russian investigation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So this, Dan, is a moment we've all been waiting for. You're going to get it in the morning whether you like it or not. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DAN BONGINO, GUEST CO-HOST: We've already know, a must-see TV. I mean, it's up there with the Dallas episode, right? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: I know, -- I need to be up. Yes, it will be definitely a must- see. Everybody got to get up and watch.
PERINO: Yeah. I mean, you can't miss it. But, you know, we already know the topline conclusion, OK? There was no collusion. A matter of fact, there was no effort at collusion. And the Russians tried to collude and the Trump team said no. My question now going forward is what the heck was Bob Mueller doing for 675 days. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Andy McCarthy has an absolutely terrific piece where he asked this question. How quickly did Mueller figure out there was no collusion? The viewer had been up on a wire for a year and a half. They had to know nothing was going on. What was he doing for 675 days?
PERINO: That's an interesting question. Just going back to a previous special counsel investigation which is that Patrick Fitzgerald the U.S. attorney, who was a special counsel for the Valerie Plame case, knew immediately who had leaked the name and it wasn't Karl Rove. And that still went on for four more years -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONGINO: Fine, what were they're doing? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Marie, you're going to be up, ready --
MARIE HARF, GUEST CO-HOST: I'm ready.
PERINO: But do you think that -- do you think Democrats -- I'm very nervous. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HARF: I'm just --
PERINO: Yeah. They've been going after Bill Barr. They don't know what's in it. Now, I do think it's a good thing that he's going to take questions from the press and that might take a little bit of the tension out of it?
HARF: We'll see, right? I think that some of what Dan said Barr did not say was in the Mueller report. He did not say there was no -- that the Trump campaign said no thank you when they tried to collude. So I think one of the things that people are looking for is how Mueller explains things and events we know happened, and how he explains that they do not amount to criminal collusion. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Just as an American and as a human, I actually want to see how Mueller deals with the Trump Tower meeting, Manafort giving polling to the Russians, all of those things. I do think the President Trump's tweets about the Mueller report have gotten increasingly -- how do I say this nicely? Aggressive? In the past few days like he -- it seems a little bit like he's trying to preempt what he knows will not be uniformly good report for him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
There will be things in this report that are embarrassing, that all of us sitting around this table would say I would never have done that if I worked on a presidential campaign. I think Trump knows that and is trying to get ahead of it.
PERINO: Or do you think, Jesse, that maybe he is just -- I don't know if it's any more aggressive than before. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: Relentless with the special counsel for a year and half. I don't think anything changed there. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HARF: These past few days, though, feels a little different? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: It does feel different for you? I'm glad you're in touch with your feelings, Marie. I think 9:30 is little early. I would prefer 10:30 or 11. It would give me more time to go to the gym and digest. I also -- I also think this is what's going to happen when the report comes out.
PERINO: OK. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: A bunch of liberal media members are going to hold up each page and they're going to hold it into the sunlight to see if they can see behind the redactions, because everybody does that. I always do that. There's a small hope I can and you're not going be able to do that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think what he should do just to mess with the press is give 400 pages of the whole thing redacted, just to screw around with them and then say fine, here's the real report.
BONGINO: One big black --
WATTERS: One big black -- 400-page document and drive them all crazy. I think you're right. There is going to be some derogatory information in there because this was a very brutally intrusive exam into an administration and the campaign. So you're going to find some flaws and this was undertaken by kind of ferocious and -- not sinister but angry partisan Democrats with a lot of liberal pedigree. So they're going to find some things. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But overall, no obstruction, no collusion. I just don't know how CNN is going to handle it because this last week they had the lowest rated week of all of 2019. So they have a choice to make. Are they going to now report real news about Spygate or are they going to continue to push fake news? Because they've lost to the Food Network last week, which means people would rather watch a pot boil than watch CNN. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: You like it when these things happen, you like to get the news, but you also like to watch the other media getting the news.
GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Yes. Did you know what this reminds me of? Do you remember April the giraffe? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Yeah.
GUTFELD: Do you remember how long we waited and waited. This is like April the giraffe having twins at separate times. It's like OK -- didn't April already give us a giraffe three weeks ago? Anyway, this -- the media are like movie critics who are the denying the spoilers, right? They're like, we already know what happened but they're -- no, no, no, no, no, no, Luke, Darth Vader really isn't his father. No, it is. Sorry, guys. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But you know what it is? The Mueller report to the media is like cheap tequila in high school. You try it, you get drunk, and you have a hangover forever, but then you forget about it and you do it again. So they're setting themselves up for feeling miserable on Thursday afternoon. I will agree with you, Marie. There is this prison of two ideas. He's vindicated or it's a cover up. There's going to be a lot of little things going on that people can sink their teeth into. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They're going to say well, now we know that the Russians colluded, but we also know that it was a one-way street that Trumps weren't chasing it. And so it just means you have to be more aware of what the Russians are doing, but we already knew that. It's really about the Russians and how they manipulated the media, not the voters. The collusion was Russia playing the media for suckers.
BONGINO: Dana, can I add here --
PERINO: Yeah. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
BONGINO: It's interesting how the standard has shifted here, though. There's going to be negative information. OK, the whole July 5th, Jim Comey press conference was negative information about Hillary, yet everybody wanted to make that go away. But you're right. If you were there for basically a proctology exam on your entire life for the last five years, of course it's going to be negative information.

        }
      
GUTFELD: Oh, I've been there.
BONGINO: But that is not the question. The question here is was a crime committed and the answer according to Barr's summary is no.

        }
      
HARF: On collusion, but on obstruction we know that Bob Mueller is going to lay out a legal case for obstruction and a legal case that says it doesn't rise to the level of obstruction. He didn't answer that question. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

BONGINO: So why didn't he charge him?
WATTERS: His job is to charge and not charge.

        }
      
(CROSSTALK)
HARF: Guys, I think Mueller should have made a decision on that. I agree with you, he should have made a decision and not left it up to Barr. But there will be an entire section that says this is why we believe Donald Trump committed obstruction. So when you say no --

        }
      
WATTERS: Very hard to obstruct something you didn't do.
HARF: Barr said that's actually not true legally. Obstruction, you can be charged with even if there's no underlying crime --
(CROSSTALK) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
WATTERS: So -- OK, if you frame me for murder and I say stop, I'm obstructing?

PERINO: Can I ask Dan one other question which is that -- the attorney general is definitely going to get additional questions about the verb he used last week in congressional testimony which was he believes there was spying on the Trump campaign. And so, I don't know if the Mueller report goes into that fully, but certainly if you open yourself up to a press conference, you're going to get questions about it?
BONGINO: Well, no sane person believes that the team wasn't spied on. Not only they used national security letters on the record, not only do we now know there was a human intelligence asset used against the Trump team on the record. We also know that a foreign intelligence surveillance court, a synonym for spying for rational people, used a warrant and three renewals to spy on the Trump team.

Getting into the euphemism game is the height of political immaturity. Just take the L. You've spied on the Trump team. Admit it. Drop the loss Democrats, and cut the euphemisms crap. It looks silly. You didn't spy -- you report a spy, no. He was an undocumented informant. You're like, are you guys crazy? Like every sane person knows the guy was a spy.
PERINO: But then, no matter what, Jesse, the congressional Democrats now - - remember -- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she said she's for impeachment. Just last week she said that. Pelosi said, well, we're not there yet, but do you think that tomorrow at 9:31 AM the Democrats will say they have a case?

WATTERS: Well, they have to be pretty fast readers to do that. But I'm sure they're going to try to make some sort of hay out of it just -- but going back to your point. Think about how the spying happened. They cooked up the intelligence, leaked it to the press, then took the fake news reports and used it to get a wire to spy. And I can tell you now we know this.

I look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God rest their soul.

WATTERS: Bernie Sanders quickly responding to Trump's attack by saying, looks like President Trump is scared of our campaign. He should be. Of course, Trump didn't stop there. He also called out Bernie Sanders for bashing his tax cuts, even though the socialist senator benefited from them. Here's what Bernie said during the Fox News town hall.

Dana, what do you think about Trump now really isolating Sleepy Joe and Crazy Bernie?
PERINO: I think that Trump has incredible political instincts and he knows that it is true that these two are the front runners. There's no one -- he's just going to engage them early and often and he just announced a $30 million hall for the first quarter. Now, Bernie Sanders is also raising a lot of money. Biden is not in the race yet, officially. But Bernie Sanders is able to get all of the headlines. He is actually driving the debate. He is the front runner.
Now, what I think it's pretty interesting is that he's a lot like President Trump, right? Authentic -- what was the number one thing that we used to get in our Fox News voter analysis? We like it that he tells it like it is. And a lot of the people -- I'm sorry, a lot of the arguments that people say -- used to say Bernie can't possibly win are the similar ones to what people said about President Trump not winning.
And I wonder is this the election matchup we should have? Remember when President Trump said at the State of the Union, we're not going to be a socialist country.
WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: All right, let's have that decision.
WATTERS: Let's do it, socialism versus capitalism, Greg. Are you ready? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');

        }
      
GUTFELD: Well, maybe that's what it should have been in 2016 if something hadn't happened. OK. What pisses me off here is when you see a socialist defend their wealth. Suddenly their sense of individual opportunity and freedom springs to life because it's about them. Now, when they're talking about you, it's easy to be a socialist because it's your money, but when it's their money and they're talking about themselves, suddenly it's like I pay my taxes. I pay my taxes.
When you denigrate a system that you happily benefit from, you should do one of two things. Abandon the system and live according to your beliefs, which a lot of people do. They'll move into some kind of commune and share the wealth and do awful things. Or admit you're a hypocrite and don't care. So he's got to do that. That's the only problem with his authenticity is that he's a hypocrite. Can I respond to Sleepy Joe Biden?
WATTERS: Yes.
GUTFELD: I did not see that one coming. Like, I wouldn't have thought of Sleepy Joe Biden. But the interesting thing is the secret to these nicknames are not physical descriptions but auras, right? It's kind of like -- yeah, low energy. That kind of thing is like -- when somebody tells you a rumor about a coworker, even if it's false, you still actually believe -- you look at that person differently.
WATTERS: What have you heard?
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Yes. Someone says, you know, Jesse was arrested in a park without his pants on. That probably didn't happen but now all I can think about --

GUTFELD: It's more like a seven-dwarf kind of thing, the sleepy dwarf, right?
WATTERS: I think you're right.
GUTFELD: I'm sneezy.
WATTERS: To Greg's point, isn't it amazing that a socialist can make a million dollars bashing capitalism?

PERINO: What a country.
WATTERS: What a country. That's how great our system is.
HARF: Greg says there were two options. The third is to try to change the system.
GUTFELD: Yes, but you have to -- I agree with you --
HARF: And so, that's what Bernie -- I think, what probably argue is he's trying --

GUTFELD: Can I interject quickly?
PERINO: Go for it.
GUTFELD: He would be wise to admit that the system is great, but he can improve on it rather than saying the system is corrupt.
WATTERS: That's a good point.
HARF: So, the reason Bernie and Biden mostly are in first place is because of name I.D. at this point. We've seen as these other candidates have gone out there and done events and started raising money. Their numbers are taking up a little bit as well. So these weren't particularly creative nicknames Donald Trump gave to them.
GUTFELD: You've got to give it time.
HARF: Yeah -- no, he needs a little while to think about it. So I think what will be more interesting, as we get towards the first debate where all of these candidates are on stage, where the name I.D. numbers are closing a little bit and aren't so far apart, that's when we'll see who are the other top-tier candidates? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Yeah, you could have a major bath. Someone could blow up. Forget the third part of government they're going to eliminate, and they could crash and burn.
HARF: The other point is that Democratic primary voters, statistically, are much more moderate. Like 2 to 1 moderate than progressive. We've seen that recently. So while Bernie has name I.D. and some support, I think when we get done to primary voters, they're not where Bernie is statistically speaking.
BONGINO: Well, the problem of all big government Democrats have is they're basically all hypocrites and frauds. I mean, we've seen this with John Kerry --
HARF: Really nuanced argument.
(CROSSTALK)
BONGINO: It's a true argument because, you know, John Kerry --

BONGINO: Hey, if you're going to argue -- Marie, let me ask you this, OK, if you're going to argue for higher taxes because you believe higher taxes are a net public good, it's going to do good for society, why do Democrats not voluntarily pay more? I don't have to be coaxed into paying into charity because I believe it's a good thing. We do a scholarship thing in my neighborhood. Nobody forces me. Why don't Democrats play more if it's a public good?
HARF: Because the public good should be paid by everyone. It's not --
BONGINO: Why not start there? Lead the way, Marie.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Republicans are already giving more to charity, right? So Democrats tend to think that government should be doing that work. Conservatives don't think that.
BONGINO: It's such a faulty argument. I mean -- on the network, and she said one time to Tucker -- well, you know, individual choices aren't going to make a difference. The government is full of individuals making choices. So your argument is that individuals are flawed, but when we put them in government they all have angelic-type powers? It's so ridiculous.
WATTERS: I'm really glad you brought up the taxation and charitable donations because Beto O'Rourke gave one-third of 1 percent to charity. Bernie Sanders, the first year he made a million dollars, gave 1 percent to charity. Kamala Harris gave 1.4 percent to charity. Just want to make sure the audience knows that.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BONGINO: President Trump trying to stop the surge at the southern border by cracking down on the policy of catch and release. Attorney General William Barr issuing a new ruling that would deny bailed to some asylum- seekers while they wait for hearing. This comes as the mayor of Hume, Arizona, has declared an emergency over the migrant situation in his border city. Mr. Watters --
WATTERS: Yes.

BONGINO: -- I think Trump has had a better week so far in immigration. I think he painted them into the corner with his wonderful policy of sending people who came here illegally --
WATTERS: Right.
BONGINO: -- to sanctuary cities that will take care of them. WATTERS: That's what they've wanted.
BONGINO: That's what they wanted.
WATTERS: They've said they'd provide sanctuary.
BONGINO: And this William Barr ruling that -- listen, you're going to have to remain detain if you enter illegally and claim asylum. I think it's been a good week.
WATTERS: Yeah, Barr is quietly becoming very forceful and effective attorney general. And I think Trump is slowly winning at the border. He's doing it methodically. But if you look at this Barr situation and then you look at the ninth circuit ruling they had the other day, the slow but steady wall construction, and kind of changing and shifting the narrative in the media. Now the media is acknowledging there is some sort of crisis on the southern border.
BONGINO: And Jeh Johnson said it on this network.
WATTERS: Right. And as you've said before how he's kind of backed the Democrats into a corner on sanctuary cities. He is slowly moving the needle. Now, is it ever going to change? I don't know. I think it's going to take at least 6 to 8 years to finish the job. But I think he's got the -- his heart is in the right place.
BONGINO: Marie, I assume you have some disagreements, but what do you think about Jeh Johnson on this network saying that there is a crisis and acknowledging there's a crisis at the border. Is this changing the narrative on the Democrat side all the sudden?
HARF: I think there are a lot of Democrats particularly from these border districts who have been saying that for a long time. The question is how to fix that and how to attack it. And short of Congress actually stepping in and doing something, the overall situation, we will continue to put band aids on things. We'll continue to do executive actions.
The overall situation cannot be really fixed without massive congressional action. And quite frankly, I don't foresee that happening at all. This Barr thing, this new executive order, I think it's one attempt to try to get a handle on it. It could have the reverse effect of hurting them when it comes to overcrowding.
They're already overcrowded at these facilities. They don't have enough room for people. So these are all band aids because Congress won't get off its behind and act. Really, they're the ones who are trying to -- the executive branch cannot do this on its own.
WATTERS: I agree.
BONGINO: Dana, I was interviewing Hogan Gidley last week at the network, and I asked him a very simple question. I said have the Democrats lifted a finger to propose one substantive proposal on immigration at all? And he was crystal-clear and said no, nothing. I mean --
PERINO: It's interesting because in the last -- the first quarter of the year I think the president was on the defense when it comes to immigration. You look at the shutdown, et cetera. But in the last ten days he's flipped that. And now the Democrats have to realize -- OK, we're going into 2020. President Trump is still going to run on immigration and they have to be for something. So what are you for? You can't just be against what he is proposing.
The other thing is on the Barr memo or ruling, it's not an executive order, right? He has the ability as the attorney general to overrule the immigration judges if they are misreading the law. It's a serious miscalculation to say that he's changing things wholesale because he's already said, one, is contrary to the practice that the A.G. uses. It's not going to go into effect for 90 days. It would probably only affect a few thousand aliens. It is not a whole big deal.
But it is a little bit of something to help perhaps deter people from coming to the southern border which is what the president says is his main goal.
BONGINO: You know, Greg, I love how Democrats always ignore incentives. You know when you create an incentive system like we're going to let you out after 20 days if you bring a child. Now we find out children are being used in this kind of circular rotation back and forth. Democrats always ignore the incentives. I guess this is why I think regular voters kind of understand where Trump is on this.
GUTFELD: If you ignore incentives through long-term solutions, you will always be seen as the bad guy. If you look at Trump. Trump's kind of brought consistent plan, it's always about process, whether it's terror, borders and crime. It's very direct and simple. It's like you follow the law. This is what you do to increase security.
The downside is, you will be portrayed as a villain because in the short- term, you're the adult, you're the bad guy. You have to say no. But in the long-term, your benefits will be seen. So, in a weird way you sacrifice popularity for a long-term security.
To the point about the sanctuary city dare, which I agree was brilliant. Why not stop there? Well I mean why stop there. Let's move on and try - let's start daring everybody to put their money where their mouth is.
JESSE WATTERS, PANELIST, THE FIVE, FOX NEWS: I agree.
GUTFELD: I was thinking about this about if you are a socialist, you should only be able to use services provided by the government. If you are a socialist. Therefore, no organic coffee, no video games, no smartphones. You can't have any of the benefits of the free market.
DAN BONGINO, PANELIST, THE FIVE, FOX NEWS: You have to drive the Russian Lada.
GUTFELD: Yes, exactly. A beautiful car.
WATTERS: And if the world is going to end in 12 years, I think everybody rides a bike. Pelosi gets to work on a bike. AOC takes the bike.
GUTFELD: Or just prepare for the funerals. Like why aren't you buying. You should be buying the caskets.
WATTERS: Liquidate your 401(k).
GUTFELD: Exactly.
WATTERS: You're not going to need it.
GUTFELD: Donate to charity. Everything.
BONGINO: Up next, new proof that Prosecutor Kim Foxx's so-called recusal in the Jussie Smollett case was a total joke. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MARIE HARF, PANELIST, THE FIVE, FOX NEWS: Chicago prosecutor Kim Foxx facing new criticism after saying she recused herself in the Jussie Smollett case. Newly released text messages show she was communicating with her staff two weeks before those charges were dropped against the actor. Foxx taking a swipe at Smollett while also mentioning R. Kelly writing "pedophile with four victims, 10 counts, washed up celeb who lied to cops 16. On a case eligible for deferred prosecution, I think it's indicative of something we should be looking at generally." She also wrote "just because we can charge something doesn't mean we should." Foxx's responding to the text messages in a new statement and is defending her communications about the case.
Greg, I feel like you have a lot of thoughts on this.
GUTFELD: I do have a lot of thoughts.
HARF: The floor is yours.
GUTFELD: The best part of this whole story is her describing Smollett as washed up. That hurts him more than anything that's been going on. Calling him a liar, calling him a hoaxer, but calling him washed up. That's a stab right in the chest because remember in his mind he did this to - he hoaxed this hate crime to elevate him beyond the mundane level of celebrity hood that he had reached. He felt that he deserved more and that was the whole point of this was to become bigger than what he was. And I just feel like when he reads that little piece of information that washed up, it's just going to - that's worse than going to jail for a guy with an ego.
DANA PERINO, PANELIST, THE FIVE, FOX NEWS: Yes.
WATTERS: There is a second-best part of this whole thing that Avenatti who was going to ...
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: And he was going to try to represent the two brothers.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: That for me was the second best. I just like how the prosecutor knows this guy's a knucklehead. But at the same time, she is a complete idiot because she's laughing here at the police chief saying, oh! I just got a call from the Chief of Police. He wants to know what's going on and what happened, LOL, which shows she has total disrespect for law enforcement. Who she's supposed to be working with in the city? The other thing is, I agree with her. I don't want police officers and prosecutors overcharging people. I understand that.
HARF: Where she compared the R. Kelly charges.
WATTERS: No, I understand the point that she's making, but something like this when you fake a hate crime and you make all the police officers work 24/7 on this and you frame 63 million Trump supporters who voted for this President. You can't let a guy off like that. There has to be some consequence to doing that.
HARF: Dana.
PERINO: Well yes. OK. So, she knew he was guilty, and she was upset about the charging guidelines. We could all agree with that. That actually makes sense. But she knows he's guilty and now she's laughing at the cops. She already has a problem with them anyway. The police are trying to restore, and the new mayor Lightfoot is trying to restore trust between the community, the public and the press.
So, it's so insulting to the cops and here's the other thing. Let's say she doesn't want to charge him. Fine. What she did is let him get off scot-free including he got to walk out there and say; I did nothing wrong.
BONGINO: Yes.
PERINO: She should have said; you're going to get out of this. We're going to keep your $10,000, but you're going to say, sorry, but she didn't do that. And that's why she'll continue that problem.
HARF: That's interesting. She had just asked for an apology.
PERINO: No, she let him get off scot-free.
HARF: Yes.
GUTFELD: Do you think there was some involvement with other people?
HARF: I mean I know there are conspiracy theorists out there, but we haven't truly seen any evidence here. I think it's a very ...
GUTFELD: Who needs evidence, Marie.
HARF: I know.
GUTFELD: I have an opinion.
HARF: High standard.
PERINO: We had to see emails and texts.
HARF: I think that it's just very bizarre. Like I still don't know why they decided to drop the charges, like I still I am actually confused about that because there is no smoking gun about why they did. What do you think?
BONGINO: I don't think he was overcharged. You know remember Rocky IV throw the damn towel, when Apollo is getting beaten up. Like Jussie's legal team.
WATTERS: Jussie.
BONGINO: Jussie, sorry.
WATTERS: Don't make that mistake.
GUTFELD: No, Chris Rock says it's Jesse now.
WATTERS: He lost.
BONGINO: Jussie's legal team, when do you look at this. Here's the file. OK, guys. Here's the evidence file for Jussie. It was this thick that his story, can we be honest here, it's not adding up. When did they say OK, let's throw the towel, Let's apologize, let's move on? It's widely recognized in the justice system, but yes, they don't have to charge you with everything, but you have to have some recognition that hey this isn't working out like we planned. He never did that. I don't think he was overcharged, and I think it'll disincentivize people from doing this in the future. And by the way you are absolutely correct, the most damaging part to him in this whole story is that washed up actor.
Don't think for a second that's not eaten him alive.
HARF: But when you say it will disincentivize, you think it will disincentivize people to come forward and claim.
WATTERS: Both.
BONGINO: No. I think it will disincentivize people from claiming things happened that didn't in obvious efforts to inspire hatred towards people they dislike. In this case, Trump's supporters.
WATTERS: And it will make everybody doubt anytime they see an alleged hate crime.
HARF: Well, it shouldn't.
WATTERS: Whether or not it was true or not.
HARF: That's not fair though.
WATTERS: But that's a natural psychological reaction. Everyone is going to now think Jussie Smollett, hey, there you go.
GUTFELD: Today too, was it a couple of guys arrested for beating up a guy in a Trump hat. And they actually arrested an immigrant.
WATTERS: An immigrant wearing a MAGA hat.
GUTFELD: Yes. So, it does happen. There is still hate crimes.
HARF: Last week, there were three black churches in Louisiana torched. The guy, the son of a Deputy Sheriff has been arrested and charged with hate crimes. In Louisiana.
BONGINO: Throw the book at him.
HARF: So, there are real examples out here. I don't like that Jussie Smollett puts any doubt in people's minds when they do come back.
WATTERS: Jussie, not Jesse please. Just stop it. He's dragging my name through the mud.
GUTFELD: He lost the U. There is no U in Jussie. Only a me.
HARF: So, where does this go next, Greg.
GUTFELD: I don't know. I hope that the city falls through in the lawsuit and he pays.
PERINO: Yes. And I think that the investigation into the request by the police for an independent investigation into Kim Foxx's office. We'll continue. And you've really got to sell this tea, because this is like the ...
HARF: I know.
PERINO: I've been waiting for this.
HARF: No pressure. OK. UP next, the big surprise from the Nashville trip. The Five recorded a song with country star John Rich. We'll show you next. You don't want to miss that.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: We had a great time in Nashville and now it's time to reveal the big surprise that we told you about yesterday. I co-wrote a song with country music star John Rich. He actually kind of rewrote it because it sucked. Anyway, I wrote the chorus and he brought us to his studio to record it. It will blow your mind. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: It's a dream come true. And if we have you, John Rich.
JOHN RICH, SINGER: Yes.
PERINO: To record a song that Greg has written.
GUTFELD: We co-wrote it.
RICH: We're co-writers.
PERINO: Very generous.
GUTFELD: What I wrote was pretty crappy, but you made it better.
RICH: Well, thank you. I put them together, put some music to it and now we have the song.
GUTFELD: You wrote it on the back of a Walgreens pharmacy bag.
RICH: I did.
GUTFELD: We're not going to ask what you were picking up there.
PERINO: No, we're going to ask him that.
GUTFELD: But I just want to, did it clear up?
PERINO: It cleared up. I'm good. So, I thought it would be cool to come in here on the song that we co-wrote and record it together and have you guys been on the recording. So, basically, we take chord charts and we assign a number to a chord. So, A is one. And what would 4 be, A, B, C, D would be 4.
WATTERS: You didn't say there would be a test.
RICH: When Greg sent me the lyrics, I read him the first time. How many different versions of Greg wrote this? What you wrote was really wide and all over the place. And so, I dialed it in, and we came up with this song called Shut Up about Politics.
WATTERS: I like that.
RICH: So, shall we start?
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Yes.
RICH: OK. The first thing we do is I listen to the word. Shut Up. That's it. All you guys is to scream shut up loud as you possibly can. That's it. This is going to be great.
GUTFELD: Where is the gospel choir and the hip hop interlude.
RICH: That will be an overdo. Now they're going to go out there and we're going to play this sucker.
WATTERS: OK.
RICH: I'm going to get on the mic and sing it. And what we're going to do for the shut ups is I'm going to stand you guys all around the mic once we get to track down and you're just going to basically say, shut up about five times in a row as loud as you can.
PERINO: OK.
RICH: I want to place this. OK. Yes, do it again.
GUTFELD: As long as you don't catch Jesse playing air guitar, I'm OK with it. It's very, very disturbing.
WATTERS: Can you stack these. Stack them up.
RICH: We'll put him in a few of the spots. We'll come in and they can hear what it sounds like. We did it. Awesome. Way to go.
GUTFELD: I think I'm ready to do a whole album.
RICH: I do too.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: My god.
GUTFELD: So, Dana, this I think was the best day of your life.
PERINO: It was really one of the best days. Peter's in the green room. So that was obviously that was best day, second best day. We - of our time here on The Five. I think that was one of my favorite things. Remember the bus trip from 2016.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: You sat in the back and you would make me laugh so much writing lyrics to country music songs I would play, and it was all about The Five and I said we should do this one day and record it and it took three years. Yes, but we got it done. And that John Rich joined us was great.
GUTFELD: By the way, the song, hopefully people can hear the whole song somewhere. I mean are we going to tweet it out or because it is - it's a hit song.
WATTERS: It's catchy. I love saying shut up on Fox News and not getting in trouble. I've been wanting to say shut up a long time.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: On The Five. And that we got away with it and that's why my voice is worse as well as some other things.
PERINO: Last night. Yes, so we all got to sing the shut-up part, but I said my mom did not let me say shut up as a kid. So, it was very therapeutic to get in there. What do you think of the song, Dan?
BONGINO: Well, I didn't have that rule in my house. I love my mom. Very catchy. I like it a lot. it's kind of remind me of that new Freddie Mercury movie where they're doing Bohemian Rhapsody and they're doing the Galileo, more Galileo, but that was great. You guys look like you're having a lot of fun doing that.
GUTFELD: You know what's interesting is that it's The Five that's saying shut up about politics.
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: That's interesting because we - this show is based on responding to politics. We don't talk politics. We respond. People don't understand that we are here to respond to political arguments from a human perspective. That's what the show does.
PERINO: And also, to remind people that politics might be what we talk about but it's not who we are.
GUTFELD: Right.
PERINO: And that was another good reason why we wanted to leave Manhattan for a day, go out there, see the people, meet the fans.
WATTERS: Yes. Apparently, I'm also a drummer. I had no idea. I can play the drums. Did you guys see that ...
PERINO: I thought it was pretty funny when you were hitting the drums and so I was in there with the drummer and you hurt your arm and he was laughing at you.
WATTERS: I just re-aggravated some tendonitis I had.
HARF: You OK there?
WATTERS: Yes.
GUTFELD: By the way, the bit when you - OK, so they basically did this in one tape.
PERINO: I know their band is so professional.
GUTFELD: It's a big and rich band and they are amazing. Absolutely. These guys are professionals. You don't understand.
WATTERS: I just appreciated how John Rich edited your stuff down.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Like someone has been trying to edit Greg for years and John Rich finally did it.
GUTFELD: Yes. The original lyrics were a bit messed up.
PERINO: It's the best song. Great day. I loved it.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: Thanks, John.
GUTFELD: How people are going to be able to hear the song? Do we know?
PERINO: We're working on it.
GUTFELD: We're working on it. It's not officially done yet and when it does it'll be number one everywhere. Trust me. Trust me. One More Thing is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: It's time now for One More Thing. Just one more Nashville thing, you'll recall last year, Jesse and I went to the Waiting for Wishes event down in Nashville. We've got to go again this year; it was very fun. So, we did a joint One More Thing today, right.
WATTERS: That's right. Kevin Carter and Jay DeMarcus host this every year down there at the Palm where we wait tables for people who make donations and they raise money for children with life threatening medical condition. So, Dana and I went down and did some good things and also had a little fun.
PERINO: It was a lot of fun. And I think that our friend Johnny put a little video together. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: Hi everybody, we're in the kitchen Waiting for Wishes, Middle Tennessee. Everybody in here all these celebrities see Little Big Town. They're serving hundreds and hundreds of meals. And the key is for all of us to be really, really humble. And for us to be the servants for the night. I'm not exactly sure where Jesse is, I'm pretty sure he's eating somebody's steak. Here I am back here, it's time for dessert. Jesse Watters hasn't picked up a single plate all night.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And why didn't you bring Greg. I have Jesse and he said, you all didn't let Greg come, he's here. What was the deal?
PERINO: Well, Greg is busy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: What was he busy with. That is the question.
GUTFELD: I probably can't talk about what happened last night.
PERINO: It is a great event and of course we got to meet Andy who was the Ambassador for the day and she - this is a great news. So, she had - she's only 8 years old now. She had childhood cancer, but she is three years remissions free and her wish was to go play with the women's national soccer team, she did, and she scored a goal.
WATTERS: That's right. And I also met a woman named Connie who served us dinner at Bob's Steak and Chop House. She's an amazing woman and she put up with all my BS the whole night.
PERINO: And she called you Jason which was hilarious.
WATTERS: Right. I had a split personality, kind of like Greg.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: It was great.
WATTERS: And she also knows front porch. I think they're related more on that later.
PERINO: All right. Greg, your turn.
GUTFELD: All right. Head over to foxnewspodcast.com. I have an interview with the legendary artist and custom car builder Newt Newton. If you grew up and loved hot rod monster art, this is for you, because I grew up on this stuff. The 70s had the best hot rod monster art. Check it out, Newt. All right, time for this. That's me. All right.
I'm getting tired of Boston Dynamics and their stupid robots doing stuff like this. Check it out. I don't even know if this is great or not, but here you've got a bunch of robot dogs. What are they doing? Where are they? Here they come. So, Boston Dynamics keeps releasing these videos like they're doing something special, but actually what are they doing here. These are robot dogs. What do you think they're doing, Dana?
PERINO: I don't know.
GUTFELD: I don't know, but you'll find out in a second. Here it comes.
PERINO: It seems a little scary.
GUTFELD: It is a little scary. They're pulling a truck.
PERINO: This is self-driving cars are going to look like.
GUTFELD: I don't know.
WATTERS: Self-driving.
GUTFELD: I'm over you Boston Dynamics. Robots aren't great. OK.
PERINO: All right, Marie you get to go next.
HARF: So, my Buckeye Nation, this spring game for college football with this weekend 61,000 fans came out to the show and they witnessed the punter Drew Chrisman (ph) surprising his girlfriend Avery (ph) with an on-field marriage proposal.
PERINO: Oh boy.
HARF: he set up a fake kicking competition, told her she was going to compete and when the time came, he got down on one knee, pulled the ring out of his cleats. The ring was in his cleats and he proposed. She accepted. It was great.
WATTERS: You know that's the only time football player should be taking a knee on the field.
HARF: You have to make it political.
PERINO: Sometimes you do that if you want to go to the 20-yard line automatically.
WATTERS: Touch back.
BONGINO: Quickly on this one, so a scientist is out there claiming when you die that you actually know you're dead and consciousness lives on and you can hear the doctors and the people around you in the room actually ...
HARF: Talking about you.
BONGINO: Claiming you're dead. I just have to say, I don't need a postgame show, when it's over, it's over. I don't need that little hourglass on the computer screen, just go dark. I don't want to hear the doctor calling it quits for me. Thank you very much. I hope this scientist is wrong.
GUTFELD: But they have no way to prove it. No way to prove it. How do you know.
BONGINO: You can't do it.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BONGINO: Subject interviews will be quite boring.
PERINO: Boston Dynamics can figure it out.
GUTFELD: They're after all of us.
PERINO: They're just making robot dogs.
GUTFELD: Yes. Robot Dana.
PERINO: All right. So that was fun. Of course.
GUTFELD: Was it? We're all hungover.
PERINO: We're going to be at 9:30 in the morning, because you know what's going to happen tomorrow morning, Attorney General Bill Barr going to get a press conference on the Mueller report. Set your DVRs. Never miss an episode of "The Five." "Special Report" is up next.
