FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER: PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL FIRE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS LEAKING INFO TO MEDIA 
Rachel Campos-Duffy: I mean, one of the most underappreciated, underreported stories of the Obama administration is how much he swelled the government roles with crony bureaucrats. So, this is a liberal tactic. They know their ideas don't win at the ballot box, so they bypass the American people, they go to the courts and the other thing they do is fill the bureaucracy and government with their cronies who can stop an agenda like Donald Trump's. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MERCEDES SCHLAPP: I think it could come from either side. The problem is, Eric, is that it's tough to track down this leaker. I mean, we've seen the case of one leaker being caught, I guess you could say, through the Department of Justice and it's really trying to figure out who these   individuals are. And it's time consuming. But it's a critical role for the Trump administration to look at. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JUAN WILLIAMS: I don't know if Comey was a leaker when he had been doing his job. He had already been fired when he leaked. To my mind, what was telling about Corey Lewandowski's statement was he said, 'information leaked that's detrimental to the Trump administration.' In other words, he's not talking about someone violating a security agreement.

SENATOR KAINE: SENATE GOP NEEDS TO START OVER AND WORK WITH DEMOCRATS ON HEALTH CARE
MERCEDES SCHLAPP: We've already seen one of the congressional Democrats push forward a bill on impeaching President Trump. I mean this is a game that the Democrats have played since President Trump won the election and was then inaugurated as president. It is one of those things that has been very telling of the Democrats. The Democrats keep overplaying their hands by using words such as treason and impeachment. Their playbook is incredibly obvious. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JUAN WILLIAMS: Senator Tim Kaine started out by saying that we haven't proven anything yet; but he's right in saying that this investigation now has hard evidence of a Trump campaign official doing business with a Russian, introduced via e-mail. This person has information coming directly from the Russian government. At that point, then you start to say, well, what is going on here and why wasn't this meeting disclosed earlier? Why did it take the New York Times reporting to force Donald Trump, Jr.'s hand?
RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY: Yeah, Senator Bernie Sanders comparing the GOP health care bill to 9/11 is outrageous. And by the way, Elizabeth Warren said that the Republican health care money is blood money on the backs, or the lives, of the American people. Which, by the way, is a perfect   description of the federal tax dollars she wants sent over to Planned Parenthood. This is audacious.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');

RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY: It did, but I find it creepy and this is coming from a girl who had her life taped for six months on MTV's Real World. I don't want it in my home. And what Latino mother hasn't said 'I'm going to kill you' to their kids, and what if Alexa comes?
MERCEDES SCHLAPP: I do think there is something strange to be said about having Alexa in your room. I think I could only handle Siri these days and she works half the time. Obviously, this is where you have the benefits of technology. We've seen the iPhone and such revolutionize our lives. But at the same time, when you look at privacy laws and whether it's a distribution of data from these technology companies or so, then it gets complicated, right?
JUAN WILLIAMS: Yeah, in fact, there's a story about a television show, it might have been you and me, Eric, and something is said on the television, like 'call the police,' and Alexa responds. Apparently, Alexa thought her name was called. So you've got to be aware.  Now even in your own house, that to me is very strange.
