 Let's all go "Off the Record." Presidents should be presidential at times of grave importance, like right now, as the nation debates President Obama's Iranian nuclear weapon deal. This is a very serious matter.
And I don't know about you, but as I listened to President Obama today at American Universities speaking about his proposed deal, I was embarrassed for him, and I was dismayed for us. He got petty with a disgraceful cheap shot. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Just because Iranian hardliners chant death to America does not mean that that's what all Iranians believe. In fact, it's those hardliners who are most comfortable with the status quo. It's those hardliners chanting death to America who have been most opposed to the deal. They are making common cause with the Republican caucus. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Really? So, if one dares to question the wisdom of President Obama's deal, he then links that person to the enemy - to people who chant "Death to America"? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, President Obama deliberately planned this punchline, drawing a laugh from the university audience. You heard them laughing. But this Iranian deal is not a laughing matter. And President Obama's very cheap shot at anyone daring to oppose him, including the many Democrats who do, is certainly not presidential.
But don't you stoop to his level and fire back with an insult. Because you know what? We have bigger fish to fry than his pettiness. We need a robust debate. Is this Iranian deal right for America or not? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
