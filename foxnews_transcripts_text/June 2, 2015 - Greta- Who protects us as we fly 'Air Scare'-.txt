'Off the Record,' 6/2/15: What's it going to take for the TSA to clean up its act when it comes to airport screening equipment? 
By Greta Van Susteren 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Let's all go "Off the Record." What is it going to take? Hundreds of people dead? Families in utter grief and inconsolable? Baggage thrown all over the countryside?
Yes, I know ... that is harsh. But someone has got to be harsh and knock some sense into our government. According to a DHS inspector general report, the TSA is not properly managing the maintenance of airport screening equipment. Really, that equipment that identifies bombs, knives and box cutters. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If you think the maintenance issue is terrifying, how about this: Last night my colleague, Catherine Herridge, reported right here that the TSA failed 96 percent of its security tests. Those are tests administered by undercover agents in a DHS inspector general probe. Those tests include sneaking fake bombs and banned weapons through security - a 96 percent failure rate. That's almost 100 percent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's so outrageous that I don't know what to say. Here is what White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said today about it: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The President does believe that the American people should feel confident in traveling in airports all across the country because there are security measures in place to protect the American traveling public. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Really? Confident? Maybe the White House feels that way. The president has Air Force One, and we Americans make sure it is safe for him, as we should. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But what about the American people? Who is taking care of them? Why do they have to fly "Scare Air"? That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
