 KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST Hello, everyone. I am Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Richard Fowler, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It is 9 o'clock in New York City and this is "The Five."

New video tonight emerging of the vicious killer who blew himself up and murdered 22 and wounded dozens more Monday night in Manchester, England. A neighbor shot this footage of Salman Abedi last July. This video coming out as the British government has expressed outrage and blame towards America for leaks in the investigation. 
For more, let's bring in Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts. Live from Italy where the President is tonight. John?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });

        }
      
JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS: All right. Kimberly, good evening to you. You know, the plague of leaks at U.S. agencies took a troubling new turn today when police in the U.K. said, they will go and stop sharing intelligence and evidence with their U.S. counterparts because of the plague of leaks that have been coming out here at least to the United States, about the Manchester bombing.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
They were infuriated in the U.K. when the name of the bomber was released in the United States before they were ready to release it. And then the fact that these photographs of bomb evidence showed up in "The New York Times," it basically just hit the roof. So, Theresa May when she came to NATO today said that she was going to speak with President Trump about the intelligence sharing that's going on between the U.S. and the U.K. Listen here.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: Our partnership is built on trust and part of that trust is knowing that intelligence can be shared confidently. And I will be making clear to President Trump today that the intelligence shared between law enforcement agencies must remain secure.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ROBERTS: You know, for his part, the President really was in sense about all of this. He's been complaining about it for a long time releasing a statement saying, quote, "The leaks of sensitive information pose a grave threat to our national security. I'm asking the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to launch a complete review of this matter and if appropriate, the culprits should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, what he was addressing at the NATO Summit earlier today, President Trump really kind of appealed to the other 27 membered nations of the alliance to throw in more on the issue of terrorism than they have in the past. To become full partners in going after ISIS and the terrorism that it inspires. Listen to what the President said. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All people who cherish life must unite in finding, exposing and removing these killers and extremists. And yes, losers. They are losers. Wherever they exist in our societies, we must drive them out and never, ever let them back in. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROBERTS: Now, NATO is taking more steps in terms of counterterrorism. They're creating a counterterrorism unit and putting in place a single person who coordinate that unit. But they were very clear in a communicate today Kimberly saying that they are not at the point where they're going to engage in military action as an alliance or at least may be individual membered nations against ISIS. But the President would like to see them do that. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state as he was en route from Israel to Italy yesterday or the day before -- it's getting a little hazy now -- said that he thinks they will probably move in that direction but right now they are going to stay in an observational stand point -- Kimberly. 
GUILFOYLE: All right. John, thank you. Okay, Dana, where do we stand? 
DANA PERINO, CO-HOST Well, I think on the leak portion of this, that it is dangerous if you have an investigation that's ongoing and you reveal evidence to early. For example, some of the photographs that were put forward included pictures of a bolt that were used. So, you could conceivably trace that back. And people who are responsible could cover their tracks if they think that they are about to get made because of the investigation.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That said, it is possible that you could go through an investigation like this and find out that the leak was not necessarily meant to hurt President Trump or to hurt the U.K. investigation. This information was out there and available and there could have been a mixed communication between the Brits and the Americans. But obviously it should be investigated. I also think though, we have to remember that leakers are sometimes glamorized. Okay? And that would include somebody like an Ed Snowden. So, he becomes extremely famous and he is just praised from certain quarters, from all over the world. He is living the high life. Even though he has to live in Russia.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(LAUGHTER) 
PERINO: But he's with his girlfriend and he's free but he gets all this attention. And I think that glamorizing leakers such as Ed Snowden, and not actually holding them into account for this type of thing leads to others saying, you know, they could get away with that and not pay a consequence.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Okay. Greg, so where do we go from here in terms of our relationship, the U.K. obviously is upset, they're concerned about these leaks. This sort of puts the U.S. a little bit on its heels but it could be an advantage to President Trump if it's played out right. 
GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST Well, I just came up with this phrase, loose lips sink ships.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Wow! 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

GUTFELD: I think it's going to catch on. 
PERINO: That's the navy guys that are outside. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST Sink Brits.
GUTFELD: You need to keep England happy. It's basically our spouse in this world. It's the closest relationship that we have. So, is this a big deal and why? From an intelligent standpoint, I'm not sure, because I don't know, it was two days later. The stuff was out there. But from a respect standpoint, it's a big deal. There's always a conflict here. America is the big fish. And countries bristle when we don't do not observe their boundaries. 
Well, they know that we're the most powerful country in the world. We don't have to throw it in their face. They don't want to be the robin to our batman. Even though they are the robin to our batman. But I think, you know, countries also should worry a little less about the information leaked after an attack and about the acting on the information both forward the attack.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Exactly. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: I think I would be more outraged for what happens before. 
GUILFOYLE: Great point.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Thank you.
GUILFOYLE: Be more upset about what you missed, to prevent it, to begin with, than the aftermath and saying, oh, we are upset now because you are, you know, giving some information up.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All right. Jesse, so what do we do to kind of mend this relationship? Obviously the U.K. is upset. We know we have a leaking problem. But now I think this gives the President a platform to say, listen, we're going to get to the bottom of this. Whoever is behind it, it is going to have to be prosecuted. Enough is enough.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: It's an interesting point, displays right into the President's hand, why the leakers have now overplayed their hand. They're playing a very dangerous game now and it feeds into his mantra about plugging these leaks. 
GUILFOYLE: Yes.
WATTERS: And the enemy from within. I think it's one thing for a leaker to leak something that embarrasses the President or setups maybe an obstruction of justice charge against the President. But it's a whole another thing and I don't know the motivation here to leak something that damages our alliance or embarrasses an ally or destroys the trust of a great ally or even potentially jeopardizes our national security? So, you know, President Obama --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Do they want the President to get the blame?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Yes. I mean, I don't really know the motivation but yes, it doesn't make the United States look trustworthy. So, someone has an agenda. It is either the holdover Democrats that are trying to destroy the Trump presidency from within. It's either bureaucrats or Republicans in there that never like President Trump that are trying to wage political warfare against him or it is just fake news stuff. You know, there's a lot of anonymous sources out there. Who's telling these reporters these things? Are there actual administration officials saying these things? Where are they getting the --
GUILFOYLE: It seems credible if the U.K. is upset about it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: This one seems credible but I think in the broad scheme of things, a lot of the stuff comes out of the middle of nowhere. So, they have to probably initiate some sort of task force and make an example --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: But it's on this President's watch. That's the problem why he is upset and justifiably, the U.K. is upset. Something has to be done about. This doesn't look good for the United States, period. 
RICHARD FOWLER, GUEST CO-HOST: I agree. I think this leak-a-palooza which I like to call it, we're at a 120 some more days into the Trump leak-a- palooza. And I think it looks really bad for the United States but here's the thing, I don't think you can blame the journalist who's getting this information, reporting it responsibly. And a lot of times, journalists, we saw it last week where they said, we are not going to reveal the city. We're just going to reveal the information that pertained to the leaks. You have got to deal with the leakers. And at the end of the day, all of these leakers report to one person. Donald J. Trump. He is the head of this government. And for 130 some out days, we've been talking about getting the leakers. And guess what? They are still leaking.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: When the government is so big it, it's hard to find these guys. 
PERINO: Well, and also, I think also, this leak, however it got out, I don't think that it was necessarily intended to specifically hurt President Trump. The other ones certainly were. So, maybe they will find it's the same person. I don't know. But I also think that our relationship is so good. And the President was able today to have face-to-face diplomacy and say, I am sorry. I am going to try to fix this and by 6 o'cloc tonight when Bret Baier was doing "Special Report," he had breaking news alert, okay, just found out that the Brits now have said, okay, no problem, we will going to start sharing intelligence again. So, this stoppage of Intel sharing lasted about six hours. So, if you got in a fight with your husband or your wife, six hours later, you can actually, if you have a good enough relationship, you can put it behind.

GUTFELD: Very good point. 
GUILFOYLE: Good advice. 
GUTFELD: I do think, you know, all leaks are different whether this is -- it falls under the umbrella of these other leaks. I think this is, leaks never go away because humans can't shut up. And they always use information and gossip as tools to bond. So, an officer might go to the press because it creates an alliance. And so, this is why it is so hard in every business, including our own. We can't control what's being said. No one can. That's why I think these leaks, on a different path and a different lane down these other ones. And I think that the real story is, the relationship, how to keep the relationship strong. If you've been together for a long time, the seven year itch and all that other stuff.

GUILFOYLE: But the reality is the situation -- 
FOWLER: Exactly. 
GUILFOYLE: -- that he has people that are in there that -- people who have been appointed the positions that you're not able to look at the VA. So, the problem is, he is stuck with that. They are there. They know that. 
WATTERS: Yes.

        }
      
GUILFOYLE: He kind of can't touch them. And so, that's a problem. And then you have people disseminating information, lack of veracity. Not even a goal objective here. And so, then what do you do? He is now the guy who is on the watch.

FOWLER: But that's what happened when there is nobody in your White House who has ever worked in the White House before. 
WATTERS: You know what, the minute Trump is -- 
GUILFOYLE: He has to have loyal, trustworthy people with him, otherwise it is going to continue to happen.

FOWLER: I think we should get the leakers. I just don't think he has the ability to find them. 
WATTERS: We'll get to the bottom of it.

Coming up, a Congressional candidate allegedly body slams a reporter in Montana and now people are blaming Trump for it. We will tell you about this outrageous situation straight ahead. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: It was the battle in Bozeman, the melee in Montana. House GOP candidate Greg Gianforte has been cited for misdemeanor assault after attacking a reporter -- Ben Jacobs -- who had put a recorder up to his face and started asking questions. Double G said not right now. But Jacobs persisted. Sounds like Jesse.

BEN JACOBS, GUARDIAN REPORTER: You were waiting to make your decision about health care until you saw the bill and it just came out and -- 
GREG GIANFORTE, BUSINESSMAN: We'll talk to you about that later. 
JACOBS: Yes. But there's not going to be time. I'm just curious if you could --

JACOBS: Yes. And you just broke my glasses.

JACOBS: He just body slammed me.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, you got to leave.

GUTFELD: So, it sounds kind of bad. How bad? The sheriff's office said there is probable cause to issue a citation, but the injuries didn't meet felony assault. So, normally you'd would blame the GOP candidate for his actions, that's what adults do. We assign blame to those responsible. We are not babies. Or Belgians. But the media, you know who they are going to blame? Rhymes with Trump.

JOE SCARBOROGH, MSNBC: A guy assault a reporter, which I guess would be too surprising in an age of Trump where he calls the press the enemy of the people. These reckless words have consequences. 
JENNIFER RUBIN, THE WASHINGTON POST: There is a cost to continually berating the media… You create an atmosphere in which these people are not treated like human beings. And although I'm sure the president did not intend for this particular candidate to do this, that is the end effect when you begin behaving that way. The fish rots from the head. The tone of the politics for the country is set by the president of the United States. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did Donald Trump have anything to do with what this candidate did? Let's hope that candidates --
DON LEMON, CNN: Reporters, they are the fake people back there. They're the horrible people. They're the enemy of the American people. If you think that that doesn't have anything to do with it, then you are sadly, sadly mistaken, my friend. 
(END VIDEO CLIPS)
GUTFELD: Hmm. He puts the Don in donkey.
Now, it's funny using their logic, they could now be blamed if anyone attacks President Trump. They've gone full-blown THD: Trump Hysteria Disorder. Obviously GG did wrong. He lost his temper. And you don't throw people to the ground. Including even reporters. But you also don't blame Trump. He can't be at fault for everything. Oh my God! My soup is cold, blame Trump. Holy crap, I have a zit, blame Trump. Oh no, I'm getting fat, it's Trump's fault.

By the way, that last one is real. Barbra Streisand once said that Trump's presidency made her gain weight. Then Lena Dunham said it caused to lose weight. Make up your mind bunch of babies. The fact is, you can't blame Trump for anything including breaking some guy's glasses in Montana while Trump is thousands of miles away in Brussels. You've got to say, that's what I call reach. 
All right. Jesse, could we blame all this disruption in college on the Left wing liberal media, at CNN, at MSNBC, we could just blame away. 
WATTERS: I would like to do that, as a matter of fact. 
(LAUGHTER)
That's what I like to do. 
GUILFOYLE: Maybe you try.
WATTERS: Think about it. I mean, the media has called Trump Hitler for a year and says that he needs to be actively resisted and then what happens? Madonna says, she wants to blow up the White House. De Niro says, he wants to punch the President. And the Left Wing has been running wild. Burning things down. A woman the other day actually tried to ran her Congressman off the road because he'd voted to repeal ObamaCare. Was that the media's fault? No. So, Trump says, fake news and now all of a sudden some guy gets in trouble in Montana? Listen, I feel sorry for the victim and I do want to say, I know this is me going out on a limb -- beating up reporters is not the right thing to do. If Jesse Watters knows that, I think it's true.

FOWLER: Can I just say one thing? If somebody broke my glasses, that would be a situation, I think --

FOWLER: But if Gigi broke my glasses, Gigi would have a really bad black eye. 
GUILFOYLE: Anybody noticed anyone else who has Gigi initials? 
GUTFELD: No, that's the other issue, Kimberly. I am glad you brought that up. Gigi, that name has been armed by this. I am a practitioner of nonviolence.

GUTFELD: Yes, I am. Well, Kimberly now that you started talking -- 
GUILFOYLE: Perfect. I am K.G., by the way. 
GUTFELD: K.G. And you are K.G. But the media is acting like this is a huge outrage. We kind of know that this guy lost his temper. You see that every day in life. It just so happens it's a Republican and a reporter. So my God, the world is ending. Stop puffing. She's huffing. 
PERINO: Shaking my head at you.
GUTFELD: She's saying like this.
FOWLER: I agree with Dana's head shake.

(LAUGHTER)
GUILFOYLE: It spoke volumes. 
GUTFELD: What I'm saying is that, people lose their temper. The guy wrote, you know, all the time, it's just that the two variables involved make it a big deal. 
FOWLER: But I think we're missing the story here. The real reason why the media is blaming Donald Trump is because he did the robo call for Gianforte and he denounced him. 
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: Well, he is far away right now. He doesn't have time for these long distance calls and denounce it. But on a serious note, really, what does this have to do with President Trump? Anything that happens, they want to try and attribute it and say that it's his fault. And castigate him for it. Was this wrong what happened? Absolutely. Talk about choking. Why did this guy do this when he was doing well and then he just loses it? 
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Obviously, he's got some kind of problem. I mean, tell it like it is. 
GUTFELD: Yes. Exactly. 
PERINO: You don't just like body slam, break glasses. I mean, it's nonsense. You get away with this not even in second grade. 
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: Okay. On the playground. But he's doing this. Its conduct is unbecoming. So then the question, in terms of whether or not, you know, he's suitable to be able to serve. People make mistakes. It happens. I get it. Believe me. People make mistakes. But nevertheless, in terms of just like blowing this completely out of proportion, to say that it lands on the steps of the oval? And this is the fault of Donald Trump? Wow. That is such a reach. 
GUTFELD: I mean, come on, Dana. You can't agree with that guy on that morning show. Morning Steve. Is that morning Steve? 
PERINO: No. No.
GUTFELD: Is that guy Steve with the funny hair? But no, you have to admit that the media -- it is anti-Trump world. 
PERINO: Oh, I agree with that. That's what I was shaking my head about. 
GUILFOYLE: Exactly.
PERINO: If you are running to be a representative of our democracy and you can't answer a question about the Congressional Budget Office without losing your -- and like assaulting somebody and throwing them to the ground, you have got a serious problem. But blaming President Trump for it would be like saying any Democrat that cheated on their spouse -- that was a direct result because of what Bill Clinton did. 
GUILFOYLE: I've heard that. 
WATTERS: I gave that exact point. 
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: And then the whole point about blaming presidents. Remember the whole hashtag, thanks Obama? 
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: It became like a joke. So, any president is going to get the blame about anything. Obama. He blamed President Bush like for four years and it became a big joke. But here's the worst part about this story for me. Their spokesperson, the spokesperson for the candidate lied about what happened and put out a statement saying something completely that didn't happen. On paper. They put it out there. 
And actually, there are eyewitnesses that happen to work for FOX News. And Alicia Cuna says, this is what I saw happened. She has three other witnesses. And this is what I think is really bad. If you think that you can actually lie about what happened and get away with it? Now, he is probably going to win tonight. Fine, here comes another winner to Washington, D.C. 
WATTERS: Well, I mean, if you beat up a reporter in Montana, your poll numbers might go up. 
PERINO: Well, that's exactly could happen. 
(CROSSTALK)
FOWLER: Donald Trump, he's a loser -- he breaks glasses. Call him a loser. 
GUTFELD: All right. Well, I think you know what, let's not descend to the level of name colors. 
FOWLER: Donald Trump? 
GUTFELD: No. Anybody in particular. All right, up next. President Trump is fulfilling a campaign pledge to be tough on NATO. And European leaders aren't too happy about it. Details, when we return. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Holding NATO accountable with one of President Trump's core campaign promises. And during a speech at NATO's headquarters in Brussels today, Mr. Trump showed no signs of changing his position. 
NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations. But 23 of the 28 membered nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they are supposed to be paying for their defense. This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States. Two percent is the bare minimum for confronting today's very real and very vicious threats. 
PERINO: Take a look at how some of the media reacted to that. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's because the president is lecturing the NATO allies. With very angry and it became clear during the course of the school thing. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Publicly berate fellow members for not living up to their defense spending commitment. They also alluded to allies who own massive amounts of money from past years which seem to echo the previous misunderstanding that this is all about back dues. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump in Brussels delivering a public shaming to the Veteran leaders there. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This was his debut at NATO. They were really angry. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
PERINO: What do you make of that, Greg? 
GUTFELD: They should all shut up. Seriously we can't be strong with Europeans, Europeans are so much more superior to these roughneck Americans. They are sophisticated. They drink tea and espresso. By the way, Trump is doing what he supposed to do. He is a sales man. You start with an extreme position and ask for the moon and you get something in return. He asked the question. He disrupts, creates a debate. At the end of all this, they end up shaking hands and maybe he gets the ball moved closer to us. 
PERINO: Kimberly, he is actually been able to get many countries to agree that they will pledge. There could've been a little more criticism in private and more praise in public. 
GUILFOYLE: Sure, ultimately we are about the objective and achieving the goal at the end. This is something he had to call them out on. This is awkward. We better make sure to save face. It's a little bit of a brash style, but it is producing results. By the way, why don't people pay up? I mean we are expected to pay rent in apartments and pay for the gas we put in our car. If they want military protection as the benefit of working with the United States, they need to pay the bill, right? That makes sense to me. It really does. You can't sit there and complain and whine about stuff when you are not even paying your dues. This would really bug me in my flamingo class. 
PERINO: There was even Charles Krauthammer talking about how he didn't say the words in article five, an attack on one is an attack on all. Sean Spicer the Press Secretary said well that is what the whole event was about. Why do we even need to say that? Is that nick picking? 
WATTERS: It could be. It's not something you are supposed to say as you address NATO? And make the allies feel a little bit better? Maybe he should have said that. I think it's understood. I think it's important for NATO to start brushing up. We had NATO deployed in Afghanistan for a little while. There were having problems communicating, different countries have different rules of engagement. There are air to air communication issues, air to ground communications. Some countries weren't even getting off into the air, because they didn't want to do certain air raids. 
GUILFOYLE: Some didn't have uniforms. 
WATTERS: Some didn't have the right equipment. It's clear that the president is making these NATO allies take ownership and its stakeholders in own national defense. I think that is a positive thing. 
PERINO: Some of those countries lost a lot more soldiers than we did. 
FOWLER: NATO was created because the United States wanted to counterbalance USSR. We created NATO and because we are the creators of this thing, we have a responsibility to make payment. On the campaign trail, he said he wanted to get rid of it. It's awful, stupid. Now he is like I'm ok with it but this is about diplomacy. Diplomacy is not the "celebrity apprentice." it requires you to be behind the scenes, making deals, projecting posture in public. There was not that. 
WATTERS: Now these nations -- 
(CROSSTALK) 
FOWLER: That was not effective, it was embarrassing. It made America look bad. Before it made America look ineffective and strong. 
(CROSSTALK) 
First of all, the president flip-flopped on the position. 
GUTFELD: So he could bring them to the middle. That is what a salesman does, Richard. 
FOWLER: This is diplomacy. Not a New York reality show. 
GUILFOYLE: He is not a guy that has flowery semantics. 
PERINO: I do hope President Trump gave Erdogan in Turkey the side eye. 
GUTFELD: The side eye? 
GUILFOYLE: Like this, Greg. 
PERINO: Directly ahead, President Obama taking shots at President Trump. We will tell you about it when we return. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
WATTERS: President Obama got a rock star like welcome in Berlin today. He had a not-so-subtle message for his predecessor. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If there are disruptions in these countries, if there's conflict or bad governments, if there is war, if there is poverty -- in this new world that we live in, we can't isolate ourselves or hide behind the wall. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: He is back, K.G.! He is back. Have you had enough or not? 
GUILFOYLE: Roll it again, please. I want to hear it. Of course he is going to say that. He really is fundamentally opposed to pretty much everything that President Trump ran on and is now trying to embark on his presidency with these policies and decisions. Of course he is going to say I don't want the wall. This is what really divides us. That is his message so he is being consistent with his core principles which are diametrically opposed to President Trump. 
WATTERS: He is also being consistent by continuing to violate traditional post-presidency etiquette about criticizing the predecessor. What do you think about that? 
PERINO: He is very young to be a former president. He is got a long life ahead of him. A party he feels responsible for all of the losses across the country. He has to figure out a way to try to help them. Because when President Trump beat Hillary Clinton, now the Democrats are in the wilderness. They don't have anybody. There's a really interesting balance between allowing your success or the space he needs in order to be commander in chief and do it in his way and also trying to protect your legacy. I'm not sure what President Obama is going to come down on that but it look like it is going to be a lot more active. 
WATTERS: He is doing a lot of presidency protection these days my Greg. We can't hide when there's conflict behind walls. He said. He had behind the Syrian civil war. He did want to get his hands dirty at all. 
GUTFELD: What's interesting about this is it's not a strong statement. It's just a casual mild statement but it's also deliberately misinterpreting the issue. No one is building a wall to hide. It's kind of a college freshman comment to make. Walls are made so you can hide behind them? Smart guy President Obama should live outside. We all live within walls. If walls imply you are a coward, President Obama should live on the street and prove that we don't need walls. They are the most practical thing on the planet. They protect you. The wall isn't for hiding. It's for protecting. 
WATTERS: There is a wall around his new house in D.C., Richard. It's a very tall wall. 
GUTFELD: I bet you have tall walls, Richard. 
FOWLER: I agree with Kimberly on the point that the Trump agenda and Obama agenda are diametrically opposed, right? We can all agree there. Building a wall on our southern border is not only cost-effective but it's rather stupid. 
GUTFELD: It's not hiding. 
WATTERS: Why is it stupid to protect the country? 
FOWLER: This argument that all these terrorists are running across the Mexican border is absurd. 
WATTERS: There's ms-13 gang members coming across and drug traffickers coming across. 
FOWLER: Wait, we can talk about this ms-13 thing. Like if we saw that ms- 13 would solve all the drug problems in America. It's a public health issue, not a criminal justice issue. We won't fund NIH, we will get the affordable care act and all the programs that help people who are addicted to drugs and then we say we will go after the gangsters and solve the drug problem. 
PERINO: That is a good debate. 
WATTERS: Before they come into the country? 
FOWLER: Stop the drugs. 
WATTERS: Locking them up once we cuff them. 
GUILFOYLE: Well walls apart, part of the framework to protect public safety. Part of the equation is drug trafficking, these gangs seem to embrace their own free-market. There's also weapons, the criminality in terms of building their and core group and jumble people into gangs and have them commit crime. Violence is at the core of it. It's not just isolated to drug trafficking. That is the reality of this situation. By the way, no problem with sessions and the rest of the DOJ saying let's get rid of ms-13 and other violent gangs that are plaguing our urban communities. That is the beginning of it. Bottom line, enforced immigration laws are on the book. 
WATTERS: Richard doesn't believe in walls so when he staying at his hotel room, everybody come in, open door policy. Don't even knock. Just come right in. President Trump is gearing up for his big fight of political enemies. We will have a report after the break. 
GUILFOYLE: Just come in. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
FOWLER: The Trump administration is gearing up for a street fight. The White House allegedly planning to strengthen its legal and rapid response team to fight back against leakers and ongoing investigations, this is what the president contended in a delusive scandal. Dana. 
PERINO: I think I recommended this a couple months ago. They should have somebody come at the point person that answers questions about Russian investigations and special counsel, because it allows them and freeze them up to be able to talk about jobs, economy, health care bill, foreign policy. Interestingly, when Bill Clinton did it he had Lanny Davis. Lanny Davis is one of the D.C. insider type lawyers. And also he knew all of the press. They all live together in northwest D.C. I actually think it's a little easier for the Clintons then it's going to be for President Trump. 
FOWLER: I agree with you. I think you should have done this a long time ago, a smart move by the president. What you do is create two tracks. You create the agenda track, what's happening, what you need to move. On the other track, you have dealing with all the scandal stuff. What do you think about it Greg? 
GUTFELD: I think he needs help -- he is dealing with a media and a party that is working together - Trump presidency is like that married couple that lives above you that is always arguing really loudly. It sounds crazy and scary but they are still together. 
GUILFOYLE: Doesn't sound very happy. This is true. Not about the married couple. He needs to have his own rapid response team. He needs to have that crisis communications. He should've had it right away. The people that is most loyal to him and are going to be able to get control of the situation, He is at a disadvantage from day one after he was sworn in. It's not too late. He can turn this around and I think because of the situation with how the way the media and et cetera with all the Russian collusion investigation, this has now forced a hand in terms of -- now we have to deal with it. Let's put a team in place. I think he has some very good people that he is going to roll out on this. That is really going to shut this down, so the sooner the better. 
WATTERS: I concur. A day late and a dollar short like you said. Reince Priebus did a great job at the RNC. Very nice person but obviously needs to take some responsibility for the chaos here. Better surrogates. Maybe triple the amount of surrogates they are using. More lawyers may be. Get on the same page as the house and senate. 
(CROSSTALK) 
FOWLER: But wait a minute, you just blame Mr. Reince Priebus for a problem that exist from the top. The president cannot control the White House period. 
(CROSSTALK) 
PERINO: Can I say one thing? It will only be as effective as President Trump respects it. If he is going to put in place, that means -- he has meant tweeting this past week. It has been beneficial to him. Give them the space with no twitter. 
FOWLER: A quick break and when we come back, one of us isn't going to be here. Kimberly is going to host "Hannity" tonight. She will have the latest details on the Montana issue, so tune in at 10:00 p.m. Eastern, goodbye K.G. have a great show. 
WATTERS: See you later! 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
WATTERS: Time now for "one more thing." I'm quarterbacking this segment because Kimberly headed over to the "Hannity" studio. Preplanned guest totes testing. Dana what do you have? 
PERINO: All right this guy might be the most enthusiastic contestant on the price is right ever. Check it out. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good luck. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my god! 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
PERINO: Can you blame him? That is Ryan Bells from Millerton, Pennsylvania. He broke the record today and walked home with $31,500 after three of his five chipped landed in the $10,000 lot. Can you imagine that? Congratulations, Ryan. I love the price is right. 
WATTERS: Congratulations, a great show. We talked about it the other day. The Trump budget was on full display and they are cutting a lot from the EPA. One of the things he used to justify it, the EPA paid $700,000 for a climate change musical. Dana didn't think I could actually find the musical. But we did. Roll it. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
(SINGING) 
Until Martha's last few years 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WATTERS: They were singing about a pigeon. Dismal reviews early, they closed. There goes the musical. Greg, what do you have? 
GUTFELD: They raise the global warming with all that hot air. 
(LAUGHTER) 
GUTFELD: It was a terrible joke which is why I did it. 
PERINO: My favorite. 
GUTFELD: I'm a big racing fan as you know. I can't get enough racing. My favorite race is the 41st annual sue Opelousas 500 check it out, turtles. Ed carpenter, (inaudible) they are all tortoises. They took to the arena in the Indianapolis zoo. Interesting about this horrible, horrible race is that the prize was a bottle of gin mixed with milk. None of the other ones left. There were five turtles. 
PERINO: Maybe they have stage fright. 
GUTFELD: I don't know if turtles -- it's a turtle, Dana I'm not making excuses for turtles anymore, their own their own. 
WATTERS: What a race that was and Richard, what do you have? 
FOWLER: I will tell you what I got, a couple weeks ago, it was teacher appreciation week and I was late. I want to hashtag thank a teacher. I want to thank a teacher, an English teacher from Ohio and a debate coach who worked weekends and evenings, his students include doctors, lawyers, teachers and this Fox News contributor. There is a picture of me getting I think that was a nationals? 
PERINO: Wait, I was in forensics! 
FOWLER: Oh, so was I, my god! I was a policy debater. 
PERINO: One of those. 
FOWLER: There was my debate partner. It 
PERINO: Did you do extent at all? 
FOWLER: I was hardcore policy debater. 
WATTERS: Living dangerously, ok. 
PERINO: You are a winner here. 
WATTERS: Set your DVR so you never miss an episode of "The Five." "Hannity" up next with our pal, Kimberly Guilfoyle.
