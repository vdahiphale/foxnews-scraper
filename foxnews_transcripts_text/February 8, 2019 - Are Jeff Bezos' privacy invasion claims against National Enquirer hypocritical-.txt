LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight with a Fox News Alert, and a big one, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax is under increasing pressure to resign tonight. This, after a second accuser, has called him out for sexual misconduct. This time the allegation is a forcible rape 19 years ago.
2020 Presidential aspirants in the Democrat field have been quick tonight to call for Fairfax's resignation. And while it's tempting to delight, in the downfall of a Democrat who peddles in double standards, I believe Fairfax deserves a full examination of the facts before he's convicted by his fellow Democrats or frankly by the public. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, for the latest, including some moves toward impeachment hearings. Wow! We now go to Ellison Barber, live tonight in Richmond. Ellison. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');

        }
      
ELLISON BARBER, CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Laura. Yes, a Virginia State Delegate says if the Lieutenant Governor does not step down by Monday he plans to introduce articles of impeachment. That Delegate just wrapped up a press conference. Here's some what he had to say. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });

PATRICK HOPE, D-VA, HOUSE OF DELEGATES MEMBER: There's no question that violent sexual assault clearly qualifies as a high crime. The House of Delegates will have to grant me unanimous consent. I would hope that no member would stand in the way of this process getting underway. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HOPE: The Lieutenant Governor has not been charged or convicted of anything. He denies any wrongdoing. He is facing sexual assault allegations from two different women. One says he forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hotel room during the 2004 DNC convention. Another says, he raped her in 2000 when they were both students at Duke University. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In a same, Lieutenant Governor said, "I deny this latest unsubstantiated allegation. It is demonstrably false. I have never forced myself on anyone ever. I demand a full investigation into these unsubstantiated and false allegations". 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Lieutenant Governor then went on to say that he had passed two FBI background checks in his past and these allegations did not come up. He says, that this is a coordinated smear campaign effort and that he will not resign.
The law firm representing the second, most recent accuser, says "Mr. Fairfax's attack was premeditated and aggressive" and that "Ms. Watson shared her account of the rape with friends in a series of e-mails and Facebook messages that are now in our possession. Additionally, we have statements from former classmates corroborating that Ms. Watson immediately told friends that Mr. Fairfax had raped her." Laura.
INGRAHAM: Ellison great reporting tonight. Thanks so much. And we're going to talk about all this - the Former DNC Chair Donna Brazile and a lot of other topics in a matter of moments. But, first, we want to get some perspective from Virginia tonight and for that we go to Tim Hannigan who's the Chairman of the Fairfax County, Republican Party. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now Tim we still don't have any hard evidence that Fairfax indeed commit these horrific acts - both sexual assaults. Yet the Democrats are jumping all over each other to call for his resignation tonight. Now how do the State GOP leaders feel about this, especially given what we saw with all the jumping all over Kavanaugh when those allegations came up. And do Democrats see any irony in all of this?
TIM HANNIGAN, FAIRFAX COUNTY, VA GOP CMTE CHAIR: Well, I can't speak for the Democrats. But I dare say that many of the many Republicans believe in exactly what you just said now, which is, that these are serious allegations that require serious attention and due process.
But I think there's an angle here that maybe is being overlooked. And that angle is that the start of this whole unraveling of our state government, which has so embarrassed Virginians, was a Bill that was proposed by a Delegate from Fairfax County where I'm from, which called for third trimester abortion, and what was really infanticide. And then Governor Northam-- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Yes, that's been kind of swept under the rug. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNIGAN: Right
INGRAHAM: While everyone is focusing on these decades-old issues of blackface or sexual assault, as important as those are to many Americans. That is interesting, because without the revelation of what the heck is happening in Virginia among the democrats with this late term abortion, infanticide, none of this other stuff probably would have come to light, at least not now, at least not in the way it has one after the other. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But I have to ask you Tim, I'm watching the comments - I'm going to bring this up with Donna later - Donna Brazile. But I'm looking at some of these comments online. Every time there's an article about blackface or this person dressed up - online people are saying Virginia is a racist State. Virginia still believes in the confederacy, all going after Virginia, Alabama, Florida one of the--
The hatred being cast at the entire Commonwealth of Virginia, which I'm a proud resident, is really disheartening to a lot of us. And it's uncalled for. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNIGAN: Right, it is uncalled for. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: It's bad acts from some people. It's uncalled for.
HANNIGAN: And it doesn't reflect reality. I've lived in Virginia now for 27 years and that's not the way Virginians are. And Virginians feel let down by these Democrats in positions of governing right now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But the reason why I had mentioned that infanticide is because it demonstrates how far the Democrats have moved away from the mainstream. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Yes. Yes. Tim, I'm going to cut you off. But - we got to go. But I think, look, everybody has to take a breath here. Don't convict people until some type of due process or evidence is actually in. We really appreciate it.
When we come back special "Awards for The Hearing Impaired Democrats". Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee embarrassed themselves today. Now having languished in the minority since 2011, they have been itching to sink their teeth into anything and any one Trump related.
Now forget the important oversight function of the Committee. There were too many political points to be scored. There were too many Congressional reputations to burnish, too many opponents to burn. And despite the fact that he's only going to be in his job for maybe another week or so, Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was in the hot seat. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Recall, that he only stepped into this role three months ago when Attorney General Sessions was fired. But every, Democrat without exception, grandstanded. For the most part they asked questions that had nothing to do - zero relevance to their proper oversight role. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So the only purpose was to hit him with cheap shot after cheap shot after cheap shot, knowing that Whitaker was rightly going to assert what's called the "Deliberative Process Privilege" in refusing to answer questions about conversations he had with other DOJ staff or with the President himself. It's totally expected.
So given the Democrats over-the-top performances today, and it being the awards season after all, we thought tonight would give out our own awards. So for "Most Frustrated Inquisitor", the award goes to, Representative Mary Gay Scanlon. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

INGRAHAM: OK. We're going to suspend too. I'm sure that that won't last - be the last award we ever give out this season. It's almost too many things happening. Now with the Democrats starting all manner of Trump investigations, you can rest assured there'll be lots of dramatic and absurd performances, twists and turns in the days ahead, and that's "The Angle".
Still ahead, I go one-on-one with Former DNC Chair, Donna Brazile. She here to respond to what's going on in Virginia tonight, plus the increasing creep of PC puritanism that I discussed in last night's angle, so stay right there.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Bowing to the every demand of the politically correct puritans puts us on a dangerous path, slippery slope, whatever you want to call it. The concern is that without some safe space to make mistakes in the past, good people won't want to be involved in public life at all. Maybe, it's time to reconsider the shifting standards of the PC puritans.
So last night I warned about how people in both parties, now even corporations are falling victim to the ever-shifting PC goalposts. Now, I worry that the real offenses like the donning of blackface, discriminatory intent as adults, well, that's being casually lumped in with imagined offenses like the release of an all-white tennis shoe being labeled insensitive during Black History Month.
And could the attention given to these flash points have irreversible effects in our society and then just end up driving us all further apart when we need to come together for some real solutions.
Now for some answers, we're joined by my friend of too many years to count, Donna Brazile, Former Chair of the Democratic National Committee and Co- Author of the Book "For Colored Girls Who Considered Politics". Donna Brazile, great to have you in tonight, thank you so much for joining us.

DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR: And I'm with you, during Black History Month you are wearing all black.
INGRAHAM: Yes, and yesterday it was Green New Deal, I was wearing green. So I'm in complete thematic dress.
BRAZILE: We love it.
INGRAHAM: OK. Thank you. All right, Donna, what do you make of all of all of this with - the problem in Virginia, but then we have the corporations saying white shoes are racist.
BRAZILE: I remember a couple of years ago when we say selling white sheets during Black History Month was also racist. Look, this is not about symbolism only. This is the substance of the conversation that perhaps we need to have as Americans.
It's been almost 400 years now since the first group of Africans arrived at on the shores of Virginia. 400 years is a long time to have a conversation worthy of a great nation like ours. And I think, we often put aside you the moment and just deal with the controversy. And say, why won't - this is a great moment, for you and I to talk about race.
Where are we in the 21st Century? Can we at least agree on the language that we must use in order to address some of these big issues, whether it is white males appearing in blackface, which clearly is objectionable, no matter the period, because we all know what it symbolizes. Or you know talking about white tennis shoes during a time when it's time to celebrate Black History Month.

BRAZILE: Well, hell, I better dye my hair now. Oh my God.
INGRAHAM: But you know what, when you think about this, you've got Ralph Northam the governor of Virginia, Democrat Governor, who gets up there and he talks about this photo. And doesn't really say it's - he's in one of the pictures. But then he comes up the next day and says I wasn't in either picture.
He gets himself in trouble kind of two times. Once for the photo with the KKK guy, is the Colin Wayne (ph), I guess. Then saying it's not - it's neither person is myself. Then you move on to Justin Fairfax. We have more allegations about him today, which I'll get to. Then you get the next in line, also said, Well, I've dressed up as a rapper.
BRAZILE: OK. And then we got the Majority Leader, who's a Republican. See, it's not it's not a partisan issue.
INGRAHAM: No, I don't think it is actually. Some Republicans are trying to make it partisan. I actually think Democrats jump on Republicans--

BRAZILE: And Republicans jump on them.
INGRAHAM: --on something they did 30 years ago and now Republicans think I'm going to get you back, because you have a double standard. And my point is, is there - and you talk about this. Is there any safe space where we can have this conversation?
I know you as a person. You know me as a person. We've known each other for a long time. We don't agree on a lot of stuff.
BRAZILE: Right.
INGRAHAM: But you can have a reasonable conversation as adults. I think the rest of the country watching this show all over the place, they're saying, "I get along with people".
BRAZILE: Right.
INGRAHAM: Like, what is this that's happening? So where do we go we go from here for that amnesty or that safe space?
BRAZILE: Well, I love to use the word amnesty, because I do believe there's a path to redemption. I'll give you a good example. Back in the 1990s, I was - that was a Congressional staffer. Robert Byrd, the former leader in the United States Senate and a former Klansmen.
INGRAHAM: Wasn't he grand wizard, wasn't he in the Klan?
BRAZILE: And a recruiter, he was all of the above. Robert Byrd went to the floor of the United States Senate and denounced his engagement with the Klan, his involvement with the Klan. I thought that was a moment that we should have this conversation.
And yet, John Lewis and many others went and say, "thank you". "Thank you for not only denouncing that that racist".
INGRAHAM: But that wouldn't be good enough today, Donna, that would not be good enough today.
BRAZILE: Well, that's a start. That's the start. Acknowledged the past. We cannot--
INGRAHAM: But he was actually an acting member of the KKK and you still got the Robert Byrd rest stop or Robert Byrd Library, the Robert Byrd - everything in West Virginia.
BRAZILE: Yes.
INGRAHAM: And so today given the new standard people got to resign immediately. They got to get out of public life. You'd have to rip down all those Robert Byrd things, whether he apologized or not, we had Ralph Northam apologize.
BRAZILE: But not only did he apologize, but he went on to not only spearhead legislation like the renewal of The Voting Rights Act. He went - he endorsed Barack Obama in 2008--
INGRAHAM: Yes, but doesn't matter. Today, none of that matters, because there is no redemption for anybody today.
BRAZILE: That's it. What I'm saying is that there is a path forward. We--
INGRAHAM: So if you're only a liberal you can get redeemed?
BRAZILE: No, I'm not saying liberal. I mean, if Robert Byrd was a Republican, if Robert Byrd was a whatever - independent. The point is, is that there we should have an individual path. Look, there are many times in my life - look at this - this is I got a good rocking chair.
INGRAHAM: Tippy-Tippy.
BRAZILE: Look they're many - no, this is too early for me. There are many times--
INGRAHAM: It's late.
BRAZILE: Look, there are many - there were several moments in my life when I've had to say, "You know, what, I was wrong.
INGRAHAM: Yes.
BRAZILE: And I've apologized for it. And you know what? It made me a better human being, because I had to lower, I had to humble myself and that's--
INGRAHAM: Yes, I do that every Donna.
BRAZILE: I do it too.
INGRAHAM: All right. There's a lot of concern over the Democratic Party right now in Virginia. I'm a Virginia resident. Love this. Went to University of Virginia. But as promised (ph), it's not just moving Left, it's moving more towards Socialism. And in this piece titled from the National Journal, "Democrats are boosting trump's reelection prospects".
One liberal Democratic strategist was alarmed by the rising tide of socialism within the Democrat Party, it said this. "We're on an out-of- control roller coaster going 100 miles-an-hour, and we have no functioning brake. One is leading and the void could not be more clear". So do you share that concern?
BRAZILE: We have raised the profile of one dynamic young woman just elected to Congress, who I do believe is a mover and shaker.
INGRAHAM: AOC.
BRAZILE: AOC. And what I like about her is that people are talking about these issues now. We're talking about Green Deal. We're talking about raising the wage. We're talking about issues that Democrats have been talking about the years, but all of a sudden--
INGRAHAM: Right. But the Democrats are signing on to something that's not even a prescription, it's just this resolution that would eliminate cars, eliminate planes--
BRAZILE: Yes.
INGRAHAM: And give people jobs who are unwilling or unable to work - unwilling to work would also get a minimum of living. Is that the Democrat Party today?
BRAZILE: No, because we have we have several proposals. I told someone the other day, we have like six different proposals on how to strengthen our health care system.
INGRAHAM: And Pelosi doesn't like this.
BRAZILE: But you know my mother said it best, when we were growing up. She said, "It's not what they call, it is what you answer to". I think most Democrats would answer to--
INGRAHAM: They know--
BRAZILE: --How are you? We are Americans who believe in giving every - each and every American healthy start is term life. I mean that's not socialist.
INGRAHAM: But that's not what - all said - I don't want to say it's all about AOC. But there is genuine concern within the Democrat Party that you think you have Trump on the ropes, but then all of a sudden, whoa, it's whiplash to the left--
BRAZILE: Oh my God--
INGRAHAM: --when the country said, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
BRAZILE: Laura--
INGRAHAM: Well, I got to ask you about Northam. Do you think Northam should go?
BRAZILE: He is not going.
INGRAHAM: He said wasn't going to go today. But do you think he should?
BRAZILE: The Democratic Party of Virginia has said, we're going to spend this weekend talking to our officials and figure out a path forward.
INGRAHAM: So you don't have a feeling on whether he should go or not?
BRAZILE: I don't believe we know the answer, because as you know on Friday night, he said one thing and then on Saturday night - you may have to wait till tomorrow afternoon.
INGRAHAM: I had someone on my show on Friday--
BRAZILE: Well, you need to show on Saturday--
INGRAHAM: I had someone on Friday, Jo diGenova said he's a racist and I love Joe and I said, "I don't think he is a racist".
BRAZILE: No he is not.
INGRAHAM: But I'm getting heat as A Republican for standing up for Democrats. It would be nice if the favor were returned when conservatives are unfairly attacked, there's like three people - like, I can count on one hand to defend me--
BRAZILE: Ronald Regan launched his campaign in the Neshoba County, Mississippi.
INGRAHAM: Right, me bet.
BRAZILE: And a few after his election he signed the bill to make Martin Luther King a National Holiday. We need a have to redemption - every American, regardless of color.
INGRAHAM: About this Fairfax, these allegations against him?
BRAZILE: I am--
INGRAHAM: --the Lieutenant Governor.
BRAZILE: I am deeply alarmed at these allegations and--
INGRAHAM: And a second woman came forward today.
BRAZILE: I am deeply alarmed. I have talked to Justin.
INGRAHAM: He denies it.
BRAZILE: Justin is someone I know very well.
INGRAHAM: Well, he denies it. He is denying this. He said, it didn't happen, and she said she has told people and contemporaries. And then we don't know much more.
BRAZILE: We've run this story before. But you know what? You need to have an opportunity to hear more, to have the due process, and investigation. But I support these women coming forward.
INGRAHAM: All right, Donna Brazile. It's so much fun. I haven't talked to you--
BRAZILE: We might be doing Women's History Month now--
INGRAHAM: Absolutely.
BRAZILE: And then the age, so I can dye my hair.
INGRAHAM: All the month, I can only invite Donna during--
BRAZILE: Senior citizens comes on.
INGRAHAM: --during actual thematic months.
BRAZILE: Senior citizens.
INGRAHAM: Oh, come on.
BRAZILE: There must be a hot chick diva month and I want to also come in that month.
INGRAHAM: All right, Raymond said that Donna is the only person who doesn't age over like two decades. Has no age. Thanks so much for coming on. We really appreciate it.
BRAZILE: Go Saints.
INGRAHAM: All right. Oh God, they're still talking about the Saints, these people. All right coming up, what if your last name also doubles as an offensive term? Should you be able to put it on your license plate anyway? Plus, when do the friendly skies become too friendly? Huh - talking spittle and other things on those blankets, with Raymond Arroyo, "Friday Follies" next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: It's Friday, and that means it's time for Friday Follies. A Canadian man has denied putting his name on a license plate, Delta and Coke are walking buck what some are calling a creepy marketing campaign. Joining us now with all the details, blanketing us blanketing us with wisdom, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor, and of course "New York Times" bestselling author of the upcoming book "Will Wilder and The Amulet of Power." My kids just got their copy, Raymond.
Raymond, let's start with this controversy over a napkin and what Delta thought was a good idea.
RAYMOND ARROYO, CONTRIBUTOR: The napkin came as they often do with the complementary beverage. But it read in very small print, "Be a little old school. Write down your number and give it to your plane crash. You never know." There was a space to write your phone number. Some were outraged by this. People tweeted they thought it was creepy. One woman said she felt stigmatized and pressured. Eventually Delta and Coke apologize. Does this offend you at all?
INGRAHAM: Not at all.
ARROYO: I don't mind this. But people were upset.
INGRAHAM: First of all, what is the big deal? You are close to other people on a plane anyway. You might as well if there's someone interesting to you.
ARROYO: Some of the people tweeting said it made them feel uncomfortable because you're encouraging ogling. But my feeling is --
INGRAHAM: Here's an idea, if you don't want somebody to ogle, I always say oogle (ph). Is it ogle?
ARROYO: It's ogle.
INGRAHAM: Why do I say oogle (ph)? Ogle you, then don't come in with short shorts with your entire pubic area showing for the whole plane to see hanging out of your clothes, and maybe we won't be.
ARROYO: Ogling you. I would've liked this to be a conversation starter, like name your favorite book, and then you leave it in place for the person to put their favorite book or favorite TV show. Conversation is good, and a little romance in the air, I don't mind that. But not for me, anyway. The only romance am having is if my wife is in the aisle.
INGRAHAM: I have met some interesting people.
ARROYO: Oh, you have?
INGRAHAM: Yes.
ARROYO: Anything you'd like to talk about?
INGRAHAM: Not right now, but yes.
ARROYO: Strangers on a plane.
INGRAHAM: Yes.
ARROYO: Better to get a date than to keep you warm with those airplane blankets. In turns out according to travel and leisure -- did you love that transition?
INGRAHAM: Yes, great.
ARROYO: They only provide clean blankets on originating flights. All the other blankets are just refolded.
INGRAHAM: Disgusting.
ARROYO: And by the way, don't like the cellophane baggie fool you. You think oh, this is clean. A flight attendant blogger Sara Keagle, says they just repackage them with everybody's germs.
INGRAHAM: Hello?
ARROYO: Now, Laura I have to share this with you. There was a tweet that emerged, a comedian, Nicole Byer went on a Delta flight. When she unfurled her blanket, she claims she found this goodie in it. Human feces. I don't even know what to say.
INGRAHAM: That must be diapering the baby.
ARROYO: They do sometimes diaper them on the pulldown tray.
INGRAHAM: She didn't have a wipe. She ran out of wipes. And let me just tell you, never put your hands and the seatback compartment. I put my hand in there once, went right into a dirty diaper. That thing is nasty.
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: Raymond and I travel, we travel with the staff a lot, and we bring wipes.
ARROYO: Lysol wipes. Lysol wipes.
INGRAHAM: People are looking at us, can you wipe my seat too. I'm happy to do so.
ARROYO: What do I look like, Hazel?
INGRAHAM: Talk about dated references. But I often do help other people clean their seats.
ARROYO: "Wall Street Journal" claim blankets are only cleaned every five to 30 days.
INGRAHAM: The drool.
ARROYO: So avoid the blankets. Just don't touch anything. Wear your hazmat.
INGRAHAM: Come in with a hazmat. That is a lovely transition to the next story. Dave Assman of Saskatchewan in Canada attempted to put his name on a license plate. What happened?
ARROYO: The Assmans, that's the way your pronouce it, Oss-man. Some crude people might say Ass-man, had quite as storied history. Dave's distant relatives Dick appeared on the David Letterman show in 1995, Dick Assman, and he is something of a local celebrity. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DAVID LETTERMAN, FORMER LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: We were kind of taken by the man's name, Dick Assman. I don't know --
(LAUGHTER)
LETTERMAN: I don't know that I've ever met a guy named Assman. Tonight, if we have a second, we'll just call and spend a minute or two here on the show getting to know Dick Assman.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hello?
LETTERMAN: Hello, who is this?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dick Assman.
LETTERMAN: Oh, Dick.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: First of all, I missed that David Letterman. That was before he was all caught up in politics.
ARROYO: This sparked something called Ass-mania. Now his relative Dave Assman can't get local authorities to allow him to put his family name on his license. They claim, and I quote, "The committee must abide by a set of guidelines regardless of if the word in someone's name is pronounced differently than the offensive version." So because A-s-s-m-a-n appears offensive to people, they will not put it on the license. I am deeply offended for Mr. Assman Oss-man, because what if your name is Boobman, what if you're name is Lipschitz. You can't have a license with your name on it?
INGRAHAM: Apparently. But you know what I'm offended by? I'm offended by, well, I'm offended by people he do vanity plates at all.
ARROYO: Do you remember this. In "Seinfeld" they had a similar episode about this, in fact with the same Assman reference. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Assman? These don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What's your name again?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cosmo Kramer.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Cosmo Kramer. You are the Assman.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I'm not the Assman.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you are.
(LAUGHTER)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ARROYO: Apparently in Saskatchewan, a real Assman cannot put his name out there. I say be a proud Assman, put your name on your license. He should take it to the high court.
INGRAHAM: Media-ite.
(LAUGHTER)
INGRAHAM: Thank you, Raymond --
ARROYO: Thank you, Laura.
INGRAHAM: -- for that Friday Follies. My God, what's happened to us?
After a batch of stolen texts revealed the sultry affair he was having, Amazon and "Washington Post" CEO Jeff Bezos is leveling a charge of extortion against the "National Enquirer." So why is Peter Schweizer calling him a hypocrite? That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: A lurid affair caught on text and charges of extortion, and that's the state of play between one of the wealthiest men on the planet and the most famous tabloid in American history. Trace Gallagher has the story tonight from our west coast newsroom that's buzzing. Trace?
GALLAGHER: Hi, Laura. When the world's richest man says he was blackmailed by the world's most famous tabloid it tends to generate a little buzz, and now you have the feds involved. First Bezos went on a blogging platform called Medium and posted details of the alleged extortion, including messages sent to him from the "National Enquirer," its parent company American Media, and American Media CEO David Pecker, threatening to release intimate photos of Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez unless Bezos agreed to, one, call off his investigation of how "The Enquirer" got the private pictures and texts, and, two, issued a statement saying the investigation that uncovered his affair with Sanchez was not politically motivated.
Bezos of course refused, writing, quote, "Of course I don't want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out."
American Media has now responded, saying it wasn't blackmailing Bezos and that the messages were good faith negotiations to resolve the matter, saying, quote, "American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos."
That said, American Media CEO David Pecker says the company will conduct its own investigation into what, if any, action needs to be taken. And the government is also getting in on the action. Federal prosecutors are now looking into the "National Enquirer's" is handling of the Bezos extramarital affair story. As for how the intimate photos were leaked in the first place, a reporter for the "Washington Post" owned by Jeff Bezos says that he has spoken with Bezos' lead security consultant Gavin de Becker. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MANUEL ROIG-FRANZIA, "WASHINGTON POST": Gavin de Becker told us that he does not believe that Jeff Bezos' phone was hacked. He thinks it's possible that a government entity might have gotten hold of his text messages.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Though earlier, Gavin de Becker said publicly he thought the brother of Bezos' mistress Lauren Sanchez played a role in leaking those private photos and texts. We shall see. Laura?
INGRAHAM: Trace, great job.
And our next guest finds the invasion of privacy complaints from Bezos warranted, but also hypocritical. Filmmaker Peter Schweizer has a new documentary that examines how these tech behemoths operate in stolen and manipulated information, that is your information, by the way. Peter joins us now. Peter, the "National Enquirer" seems to be in the wrong here with how they came after Bezos, but it's kind of ironic, isn't it, that Bezos is crying foul about stolen text when these tech companies can be guilty in the end of much worse.
PETER SCHWEIZER, PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTE: That is exactly right, Laura. About a decade ago, Eric Schmidt of Google declared that privacy was dead, and the tech titans have essentially been selling everybody's information. And what's troubling is they don't just use that information, our information, to sell us advertising and sorts of things like that. They also use it against us.
And so to me it's quite ironic. I sympathize with Jeff Bezos, but I find it quite ironic that they're raising privacy concerns when the high-tech industry, primarily Google and Facebook, but also Amazon pedal in selling our information and invading our privacy on a regular basis.
INGRAHAM: Peter, another point is that the employees of the "Washington Post" who ultimately work for Bezos saw that one blog post basically trying to out the "National Enquirer" and are just celebrating him as a national hero. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a certain amount of badass-ness about Jeff Bezos that I think makes us all proud to work for him.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: "Badass-ness," that's where we are. I want to play one more thing, though, because this is funny. This is Dylan Byers of NBC also saying that this all could be good in a way for Bezos. Let's watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DYLAN BYERS, MSNBC MEDIA REPORTER: To me it's not so much what does "National Enquirer" have on Jeff Bezos that's driving this story. What I wonder is what does Jeff Bezos be have on the "National Enquirer"? What does he have about the ties to Trump?
He has earned his journalism wings with this move. So he has pulled off a masterstroke in terms of recasting his own image, in terms of making himself look like a good guy again.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
INGRAHAM: That's an pretty interesting term. A good guy, a hero, he's a guy just like you and me, Donny Deutsch said on "Morning Joe." So it is kind of an image recast. But then again, Pecker, he has already gotten an immunity deal from Mueller, so it's like he's working with Mueller on some of this killing the stories about Trump deal. So I don't get where any of these people are going. What do you have to hid? What does AMI have to hide? I don't get it.
SCHWEIZER: It's interesting, Jeff Bezos is in this story kind of the victim, right, so that is going to help him. But I think most people are going to look at these tech titans and ultimately not view them in a sympathetic light. And it's not, in my book, because they make a lot of money. More power to them. They create these great companies, these great products and services. But it's because of the invasion of privacy. With all of these online companies including Amazon, a big part of their revenue stream is selling information about you. And they use that information against you.
Some of them at Google and others talk about the fact that their goal is not just to sell your information. It's to actually change and manipulate your values and your views. So I sympathize with Jeff Bezos in this case, but to paint him as some kind of a victim like the rest of us I think is patently ridiculous.
INGRAHAM: Peter, before we go, I've got to get you quick, quick thoughts on Hillary Clinton, who I guess is, maybe they just need a woman to get the job done over there running for president. She is still dangling out the prospect of running. And it looked a little more likely today that she was actually going to throw her hat in the ring. With everything that you exposed about Hillary and the email server, how good would that be?
SCHWEIZER: I think it would be an enormous gift to President Trump if Hillary Clinton were to run. What I'm betting on is that Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia, will be the stalking horse for the Clinton machine. They're longtime associates. He raised a lot of money for them when Bill was president, they helped him get elected governor of Virginia. So they're going to try to live vicariously through Terry McAuliffe and go up against the Obama machine in 2020 with their candidate. I think it's going to be quite a slugfest.
INGRAHAM: Wow, Peter, thanks so much. We really appreciate it tonight.
And we have highlighted a number of inventive funding ideas to help build that wall over the last several months. Up next is a Tennessee lawmaker who says that he has figured it out. He is here next to tell us how.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: Tennessee Representative Bruce Griffey, filed legislation earlier this week that would establish a fee imposed on customers for transmitting money through certain entities. That's a mouthful. Basically, what this does is require a levy on money transfers from Tennessee to Mexico, and then set aside those fees collected for the border wall.
His state would be not the only one to explore such a measure. Arizona, Montana, and West Virginia are considering or have considered similar proposals. Here now is Bruce Griffey. Could they actually get the job done if a number of the state legislatures banded together?
REP. BRUCE GRIFFEY, R-TN, TENNESSEE STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Certainly, if we have enough state legislatures that would all act together and get on the stick and let's get something done. I'm so frustrated that some of our Republican representatives are not fully supporting President Trump as I feel they should, and propose this legislation.
INGRAHAM: Name some names, Congressman. I don't want to do pie in the sky stuff, to quote Michael Bloomberg, because I'm telling you, Mike Rogers in Alabama recommended the same thing. He pushed this bill back in the summer of 2017. It was focus on Honduras. Honduran immigrants in the United States send back $4.33 billion just in the year of 2016 to 2017, $4.33 billion. So that, you tax it over two percent over 10 years, there's your wall, bingo, $20 billion. So he pushed this back then, didn't get any traction. I think it's a no-brainer. This is a complete no-brainer.
GRIFFEY: I agree. I don't know why it hasn't been done more fully, and I just felt like I'm a freshman legislator in the state of Tennessee. I wanted to do my part to support the president and the efforts to build a secure border wall.
INGRAHAM: When we look at the, I think what you see on social media, a little off this topic, the concern now about these blackface controversies and racism and what people did in their past, and pictures, and language, I feel like there is a new focus on the south in general. Online I see entire streams of messages about how certain states should basically not be part of the United States anymore. Tennessee isn't one of them, but it's like Alabama, Florida, now Virginia, maybe even Mississippi, they are so filled with a bunch of white southern racist that they can't be redeemed. I kid you not, that is where the conversation has gone online.
GRIFFEY: I understand. It's unfortunate. But one of the bright spots of this may be is for this conversation to come out and show that a lot of these Democratic congressmen and governors, and they are so hypocritical. And it's frustrating. The old Democratic Party that I used to know about is not this current Democratic Party. And I certainly wish we could get back to get some serious discussions and Democrats and Republicans come together, and let's work through the problems and come up with the best solutions for Americans.
INGRAHAM: Thanks so much for joining us. An interesting idea for trying to build the border wall. We'll take all of them we can get. My final thoughts on a busy week, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
INGRAHAM: All right, guys, if you haven't downloaded my podcast, shame on you, because you missed RBG out on the town this week. Arroyo and I unpacked it all. Subscribing is easy. Go to Podcastone.com, or to iTunes, and you'll love it.
And Mike Emanuel and the "Fox News @ Night" team now take it from here.
