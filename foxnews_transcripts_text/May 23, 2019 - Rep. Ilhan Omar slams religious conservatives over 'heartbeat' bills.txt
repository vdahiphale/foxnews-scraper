President Trump just issued an executive order giving the attorney general of the United States, Bill Barr, the authority to declassify material related to his investigation into the origins of the Russian probe. Major declassifications should be coming forth, should be forthcoming, and the deep state should be very worried tonight. This is major news.

Joining us now for more by phone is our own John Roberts.
John, take it away. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Dan, good evening to you.
You know, we had known that this was coming from some time now. And tonight, it breaks that the president has instructed Bill Barr and the intelligence agencies to declassify information regarding every aspect of the Mueller investigation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, this would include a number of other things including the scope memo, which is what was Robert Mueller's instructions in terms of what he was to investigate. It would include documents related to the FISA memos regarding the surveillance of Carter Page. It would involve the surveillance of people like George Papadopoulos, potentially others. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And it also fits into what John Durham, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, is doing in terms of finding out, investigating what the genesis of the investigation into the Trump campaign, and whether they possibly colluded with Russia was. And what is interesting to me is that the president says that he wants to make sure that all Americans, this is according to the statement, all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred and the actions that were taken during the last presidential election, and will restore confidence in the public institution.
So, that is a suggestion that when this information is declassified, not only it would be declassified from the intelligence agencies and the attorney general, but potentially from the attorney general to the public as well. So, at some point in the future, Dan, I can imagine that we may read a report that has a lot of information in it that that up until now has remain very protected and very secret.
BONGINO: John, is it possible that we will get declassified those Gang of Eight briefings that happened in August between John Brennan and the Gang of Eight in August 2016? Have you heard anything about that? Is that a possibility? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ROBERTS: I have not heard anything about that specifically, but when the president says declassify the documents that are related to the investigation, that would include a lot of things that went on during the Obama administration. If there were meetings between the intelligence officials, they were related to this investigation, I expect they could be in the list of materials to be declassified.
But don't forget that when you look at the executive order which I said earlier, the statement, there is one particular sentence here that may limit exactly what we can see and that is when the president says he wants to declassify information pertaining to this investigation in accordance with the long established standards for handling classified information which typically means you can't talk about sources and methods. So, we may learn a lot here, Dan, but we may not learn everything.
BONGINO: John, thanks a lot. I know you've had a really busy day. I appreciate your time. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

But, first, it was an intense day in the Washington swamp, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi desperately clinging to a gavel. During a rambling presser, she went to bat for her radical base, floating impeachment fantasies and even accusing the president of needing an intervention.
Watch this.

And I do think that impeachment is a very divisive place to go in our country. If we can get the facts to the American people through our investigation, it may take us to a place that is unavoidable in terms of impeachment.

BONGINO: Let's start with this declassification.
Congressman, I'll go to you first, given that you're up there on the Hill. Is this the moment that spy-gate co-conspirators here have been dreading forever, this declassification order?
REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA: It sure is. Monday night, as a matter of fact, on this show, I predicted we were days from action and weeks m from evidence. I think what's most important about this executive order is it shows that Comey, Clapper and Brennan are all in jeopardy. If this was a question of misconduct of the FBI, the president wouldn't have given the attorney general's sweeping authority to be able to compel the production of evidence from the intelligence community, from the CIA, from the NSA, and that's where I believe there is evidence that was withheld from the FISA courts where George Papadopoulos is saying, we weren't colluding with Russians, that would be illegal. That was withheld. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', '');
          });

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, you mention the Gang of Eight briefings, Dan, and what's so important about that is that they include statements of exculpatory evidence, evidence that would have shown that Carter Page and George Papadopoulos were not a basis to continue this investigation and that is not going to line up with what was presented to the FISA court. So, that desperate display I think is going to really show where the corruption occurred and they should be very worried.
BONGINO: Geraldo, I will go to you next. It's good to see you studio.
Listen, they were in a world of trouble right now. I mean, Congressman Gaetz brings up a great point, when Attorney General Bill Barr was up on the Hill in his testimony, he didn't just say the FBI, he was very clear it was possible malfeasance with the intelligence community and he was very specific at large here. Not just the FBI.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, this may be bigger than just FBI spying and I think their days are numbered behind this story. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
RIVERA: A couple of points. I think that, first of all, to watch the speaker of the House of Representatives and the president of the United States going at each other like junior high students is very disheartening. I think that this is really not good for the country. The personal sniping.
In the speaker's case, however, what is revealed by her use of the terms cover-up and so forth leading up to her meeting on infrastructure with the president is that the agenda of the speaker has been exactly in sync with the most radical members of the Democratic Caucus. She is thinking impeachment. She wants to prove obstruction of justice with all her might. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But what is happening is, when these documents are revealed, what it will show is an obstruction of injustice, the president's frustration, his flailing out at the Democrats is because he committed no collusion. There is no underlying crime. It's not Watergate and people using that parallel, using that analogy, including our own Judge Napolitano, are way off base because there was no collusion, there was no obstruction. It's obstruction of injustice.
But I think that this is dangerous, this reckless rhetoric from the president and the speaker of the House. I think they better cool it right now. Maybe the Memorial Day weekend will give them some time to ponder it. But as this evidence comes out, I want to know at what point did the special prosecutor know to a reasonable certainty that there was no collusion? Why didn't he tell the president when he got to that point that there was no collusion? Was he trying to entrap the president in a perjury trap? I really think that -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BONGINO: I don't blame the president at all for being upset. You are accusing him for being in a cover-up and a crime, that made him more upset. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, Matt, going to you quickly, can I just ask you, what's the -- you've been around the legislative arena for a lot longer than I have, what is the legislative purpose of all of this? Congress is not the FBI, Matt. Their oversight and their investigative abilities, correct me if I'm wrong here, are to legislate, not to become the junior FBI.
MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIR: Well, you know, they do have an oversight responsibility which is baked into the power of the purse and their ability to fund the government. So, they do have a legitimate oversight. What they do not have a legitimate right to do is to have their own prosecutorial investigation which is why the proper thing for Bill Barr, who, by the way, the attorney general has been undergoing an investigation for quite some time now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So the fact that the White House is now taking this extraordinary step which we been waiting for for months and months and months, it probably means this is well enough along where they have a grasp of what they want to declassify, what needs to be made public.
And, Dan, here is the key, two key things, number one, this is going to take the wind out of the sails of impeachment, because it's no longer about all the faux coverage of potential wrongdoing for Donald Trump, which has been proven to be completely wrong. It's now going to be about the Obama- Biden administration.
What did they know, when did they know what? What didn't they stop? Why did they use their powers in an unauthorized way to go after their political opponents?
This really puts the issue on the other foot as Geraldo is saying. It's not about President Trump's wrongdoing. It's about what happened during those Obama years and I think this is nothing but positive for the American people who want to get to the truth. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
BONGINO: Yes.

        }
      
Congressman, you are up there. You're living with this every day.
GAETZ: You're right.
BONGINO: Is there a possibility that when Bill Barr talks about this being bigger than the FBI, if you watch the Lisa Page testimony in Congress, she seems very confused that some of the information in the FBI was getting may have been given to the CIA as well. As a matter of fact, she doubts that could have happened, even though it seems apparent based on Brennan's briefings that the sources were the same. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Is it possible there were parallel paths? Yet it all went back to Christopher Steele in the end?
GAETZ: The strongest evidence that those parallel paths existed is that you have Brennan and Clapper and Comey all starting to point fingers at one another about the extent to which the dossier funded by Democrats, cooked up by liars and then comingled with Russian information wasn't really the driving force of this entire investigation. And so, I think as we get closer to the target, you're going to see more of a circular firing squad start among those people who were so desperate to derail the Trump presidency that they took illegal action before a secret court that had no defense attorney.
You know, to Geraldo's point about the level of the discourse here, it's really strange when our speaker of the House question the president's mental state. What I see is that this question about impeachment is torturing the Democratic Party. And so, if the president needs an intervention, I think that Nancy Pelosi and the rest of her caucus all need to go on Dr. Phil and talk about their feelings and sort of figure out how to deal with this question.
BONGINO: The president should be above that. He doesn't need that. He is winning now. Let Bill Barr do his job. You've got them --

RIVERA: They will be uncovered and we will see who did what, when.

GAETZ: The president was able to get $16 billion to our farmers. He was able to negotiate through a gridlock on a disaster response, and he was able to centralize this investigation on the greatest political scandal in American history. That's a pretty good day for someone who needs an intervention.

Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Despite the radical Democratic Party's impeachment dreams, a brand new CBS poll is showing that the majority of Americans want the so called lawmakers to stop their endless witch hunt into Trump and Russia. But Democrats clearly e aren't listening to the American people. As President Trump pointed out, they are hell-bent on smearing him and his fellow Republicans.
Check this out.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: So, I've been under investigation -- a phony investigation based on no facts, based on an overthrow of the president, and I'm very proud of the way we've come out, very proud. But now, Peter, we have to go through it again. The American public is not standing for it.
Their whole focus is on 2020 and trying to demean the Republican Party and demean the president of the United States. They either wanted to demean so much or they want to get him out of office anyway we can. I mean, you had one gentleman, Green, Congressman Green, he sounds like a real beauty. He said, the only way we're going to beat him is to impeach him.

BONGINO: Joining us now is Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt, former Obama economic advisor, Austan Goolsbee, and Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe.
Lisa, I will go to you first. When are they going to admit and finally come clean, the left, that the spying happened and give up on this ridiculous obstruction story? I mean, at some point, you've got to take the loss. When does this end?
LISA BOOTHE, CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think they were going to. I mean, what have we seen from the Democrats? Their entire aim has been to try to create this illusion of smoke so that people inevitably think that there is a fire there. But there has never been a fire and Democrats will continue to paint that illusion, they're going to try to discredit any of the information that's coming out. That's the whole entire reason why they've been discrediting Attorney General Bill Barr because they think they have been concerned about what we're going to find out.
Because think about it this way, so, it took Mueller two years, 19 attorneys, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 500 witnesses --
BONGINO: That's a lot of search warrants. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BOOTHE: Yes, exactly. To come to this determination that the Steele dossier was not correct and that President Trump did not collude. It took a top State Department official when meeting with Christopher Steele to discern that this information was not credible and he had a political animus.
So, why? At what point did Robert Mueller, what point did investigators know that there was no collusion with President Trump and his team and why did they continue with this investigation?
BONGINO: Yes.
BOOTHE: I think the American people want to know and the American people want to know if government officials like Peter Strzok who clearly hated President Trump put their thumb on the scale to try to damage the Trump administration.
BONGINO: You just asked the key question. When did Mueller know?
Charlie, I go to you next. I believe there are two key questions here. If our operating principle is going to be, according to the Democrats and some of their buddies in the media, that any dealing with Russians is potential collusive activity, then why wasn't it a major story this week when the Kathleen Kavalec State Department notes launched and it said, sources, Steele, Trubnikov and Surkov, two Russian disinformation specialists. Did I miss that?
CHARLIE HURT, CONTRIBUTOR: It's the whole thing. It's like this game of projection on the part of Democrats. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Whatever they accuse President Trump of doing, we then find out not only did President Trump not do it, but they did it. The only collusion with Russian that went on in the 2016 election was by Democrats, was by the Hillary Clinton campaign working with misinformation from the Kremlin in order to smear Donald Trump, in order to throw the election. It's pure insanity.
And I sort of almost feel sorry for Nancy Pelosi. I think she is losing her mind. She is the head of a party that has been lying to their voters for two years and now, know all these voters are realizing that they have been knowingly lying about every step of the way about this stuff and leading their supporters to believe that they were going to be able to oust this president on this cockamamie story about collusion.
And then at the same time, not only you have this coming to a head, meanwhile on the issues that people care about, her party is going off the left edge of the world in terms of live birth abortion and open borders, all this stuff that the mainstream Democratic voters out there doesn't support this. But her party is completely been hijacked by this screaming left wing agenda, or this nonsensical lying business about Russia. It's a real bad situation she finds herself in.
BONGINO: Austan, I will pose the same question to you. And I'm sincere when I say this. If the Democrats operating principle they had been using against Trump for the last two years now is that these interactions although noncriminal based on Mueller's own reports are indicative of some kind of malevolent behavior or collusion, then why does the fact that Hillary's team paid a guy to get information from Russians, I'm genuinely curious why they get a pass on that. Do you have an answer?
AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER OBAMA ECONOMIC ADVISER: Well, the Steele dossier and the fusion thing was first funded by Republicans.
BONGINO: No, no, no. Timeout. That is not true. That is inaccurate information. I cannot let you say that.
GOOLSBEE: Fusion GPS was, not the dossier.

        }
      
BONGINO: No, no, no. Austan, that is incorrect and inaccurate information. You can Google it yourself when you get off the air. The Washington Free Beacon pay for opposition research on Trump.
The dossier project was exclusively a Democratic operation. That's a easily verifiable fact. I'm sorry.
GOOLSBEE: OK, the thing that helped the president --
(CROSSTALK)
GOOLSBEE: I didn't say Republican Party.
If you look at the charge of collusion, if that's what the report disproved, on record and to you, Dan, before it ever came out, I said, I hope that it proved there was no collusion because that would be an awful day for the country. It does not exonerate the president, specifically said that they could not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice.

GOOLSBEE: Congress has the right to investigate that and the president of the United States is not allowed to systematically and say, we will refuse to cooperate with any investigation. It stinks but you're not allowed to do that.
BOOTHE: Austan, here's what I want to know. So, Democrats keep saying that they want to get to the bottom of Russian and interference in the country, yet why have we not heard anything from Democrats about wanting to find out if the dossier was Russian disinformation that the FBI then used get FISA warrants to spy on President Trump and his team?
GOOLSBEE: We should find out.

All right. Directly ahead, more on the president's major declassification order today. We will have reaction with Tom Fenton, Sara Carter, and Sidney Powell, coming up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: A lot of people say deep state, I don't say deep state. We have a lot of bad people and I think they are being found out. I think right now, I saw where Comey is blaming with this one and Brennan is blaming another one, and they are going against each other, and Clapper I think yesterday may be he's blaming President Obama? Oh, so surprised to see that happening. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
You got a lot of bad people. You got a lot of bad people. They have unsuccessfully tried to take down the wrong person.
If you look at Comey, if you look at McCabe, if you look at probably people -- people higher than that. If you look at Strzok, if you look at his lover, Lisa Page, he talked about the insurance policy just in case crooked Hillary loses, and that didn't work out too well for them.
Should she lose, we'll have an insurance policy and we'll get this guy out of office. That's what they said and that's what they meant. That's treason. That's treason. They couldn't win the election and that's what happened.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BONGINO: That was President Trump earlier today calling out by the name the biggest bad actors in the deep states effort to rig an investigation, spy on Team Trump and try to overthrow a duly elected president.
And breaking moments ago, the president is taking action, issuing a major directive, granting the attorney general authority to finally declassify key documents in the ongoing review of the Russian probes origin and surveillance of the Trump campaign. Day by day, we are inching closer and closer to justice to expose this entire Russia hoax once and for all.
Joining me now for reaction is Judicial Watch's President Tom Fitton, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, along with the author of "Licensed to Lie", former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell.
Tom, I'll go to you first, given that you have some news. You guys have just done incredible work of getting these documents exposed. One of the things I saw about your latest request is you are looking for changes in the talking points for Jim Comey's let's call it infamous July 5th, 2016 briefing, where he lays out the case against Hillary and then mysteriously exonerates her at the end.
What's the key point that was changed and that that you are trying to get a hold of?
TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT: Well, we are trying to figure out. You know, we have all heard about the wording changes, they quoted the law and they had to get around actually quoting the law and accusing her of talking about conduct because it was believed obviously presumptively to an argument for prosecution. And on top of that, even after they exonerated her or gave her a get out of jail free card practically speaking because of the sham investigation, they still were writing a chart of all the laws she may have violated with excuses as to why she shouldn't be prosecuted.
And someone asked, why are you still working on this? Keep in your back pocket. So, we want that information as well.
So, the talking points about his outrageous get out of jail press conference for Hillary, on top of the list of crimes they try to hide from the American people, you know, this is why when you talk about transparency, the president has got to, in my view, and the attorney general take a broad view here because there is a lot of secrets, thousands of secrets about the deep state conspiracy that need to be released, and designating the attorney general to cut through the chafe that's thrown up by the other agencies to declassify this material is an important step for transparency, accountability, and the rule of law.
It means that the American people can begin to see these documents and importantly grand juries.
BONGINO: Sara, I'll go to you. That July 5th speech, if you remember the initial version of what we had heard of the speech, included the Hillary Clinton emailing Barack Obama which was changed to a senior government official which was then taken out in the end. Which appears, it makes it look like, they were all in for Hillary and all out for Donald Trump when it came to the investigation.
I have a second question after you comment on that.
SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR: Oh well, yes absolutely - absolutely Dan. I mean, we can see the evidence over and over again, based on documents, that judicial watch Congressional lawmakers have been able to pull forward.
And now we see with this how important it is that the President issued this memorandum. And I want you to think about this, look at who we put in the memorandum, the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Treasury, the Secretary of State, you know, the CIA.
He is asking all of these agencies no slower rolling, no more slow-walking this information, let's speed up this process and let the Attorney General then decide what documents should be made public, because the American people deserve that. And people should take a very, very close look at all of the agencies that he has demanded cooperate with the Attorney General. That says a lot.
BONGINO: Sara, a quick follow-up and then I go to you, Sydney. What do you think the most damaging piece of information in this declassification in the five buckets we've talked about, what do you think it is?
CARTER: I think there's going to be two things. The first I believe is going to be the exculpatory evidence that of George Papadopoulos and Carter Page. If they were recorded, which we have heard they were by Stefan Halper who was a spy basically for the FBI and that the FBI withheld that information from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
That is going to be huge. I will tell you something else, something that people aren't talking about, and that was the unmasking, Dan. I think one of the biggest pieces of information that's going to come out here too as well is those people that were unmasked. That means Americans that were unmasked, their conversations, telephone conversations with foreigners.
And remember Samantha Powers, there was a big debate here, and Trey Gowdy got her to answer some very important questions. She unmasked roughly 300; that is unheard of. Put it this way, when John Bolton was at the U.N., he unmasked three people, three people. She unmasked close to 300. And I'm going to tell you some of those names are going to be very important when they come out.
BONGINO: Yes, Sara, that's what started the case of the unmasking. Sidney, I'll go to you--
CARTER: That's right.
BONGINO: --with your legal expertise, I would appreciate - from a legal framework, if there are recordings made by an intelligence asset the United States is using, remember they processed Papadopoulos in the criminal courts, it may have been a counter-intelligence case, but he was charged criminally in the criminal court. He retains all his civil rights as a citizen.
And they went into this court and they had exculpatory evidence on tape about George Papadopoulos potentially indicating that, not only was he not involved in a collusion scandal, but was repulsed by the very idea. Is this really damaging to the United States government legal team that processed this guy?
SIDNEY POWELL, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Yes, it is. It's called a Brady violation. The government has a legal and ethical obligation to produce to the defense any evidence that is favorable to the defense or impeaches the credibility of the government's witnesses.
That is what my entire book Licensed to Lie is about and how the government, particularly Andrew Weissmann - and remember, he was Mueller's Pit Bull in running this entire Special Counsel investigation - love to hide exculpatory evidence and send innocent people to prison. I think we're going to find a lot of violations of the Brady rule in the Special Counsel's conduct.
BONGINO: Tom, I - one quick follow-up for you, Tom, I got about 10 seconds left. This Gang of Eight briefing that Brennan gives in August of 2016, remember Brennan's on tape saying he hasn't seen the dossier till December, just quickly if that's declassified and that information came from Steele, how much trouble is John Brennan in?
TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT: Well, Brennan ought to be in a lot of trouble nevertheless whatever comes out, because we know he was pushing this dossier purposefully by linking it to Congress outside of the Gang of Eight briefing with Harry Reid who then unsurprisingly essentially leaked it through public letters back to the Obama administration.
Just quickly, these are primary documents that need to be released, and we can't trust Mueller to have characterized them correctly. That is why it is essential the Attorney General release the materials so we can judge for ourselves what Mueller is telling us about them.
BONGINO: Tom, Sara, Sidney, thanks a lot.
Congresswoman Omar under fire again for criticizing people of faith right on the floor of House of Representatives. Absolutely unbelievable. We will have reaction from Congressman Lee Zeldin, Allie Beth Stuckey and Kerry Picket when we come right back. Stay tuned.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BONGINO: Welcome back to Hannity. Democrats are up in arms over Alabama's new abortion law. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors recently voted to block all official travel to Alabama for one year in response to the legislation. Unbelievable.
Now, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is weighing in on the new Heartbeat Bill in places like Georgia and Alabama, and she is facing heavy criticism for targeting religious conservatives on the House floor. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. ILHAN OMAR, D-MINN: I am frustrated every single time I hear people speaking about their faith and pushing that on to other people. Because we know the so-called religious politicians, when it comes to their life, their choices, they want to talk about freedom. But when it comes to other people's lives and other people's choices, they want to talk about religion.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BONGINO: Joining us now with reaction, New York Congressman Lee Zeldin, Relatable podcast host Allie Beth Stuckey, and Daily Caller reporter Kerry Picket. Congressman, I will go to you first.
What is with this streak on the left of constantly questioning the morals of people who disagree with them? It goes back to this idea that we think there are people with bad ideas they think we're bad people. It's totally different.
What is with this streak on the Left of constantly questioning the morals of people who disagree with them? It goes back to this idea that we think there are people with bad ideas and they think we are bad people. It's totally different.
REP. LEE ZELDIN, R-N.Y.: They should not - they are the last ones who should be doing this world of - engaging in this world of double standards and moral equivalency. You saw it with Ilhan Omar's anti-Semitism. If she was a Republican, when we pass that resolution about a month and half ago, that would've been singularly emphatically forcefully focused on combating anti- Semitism, instead of that world of moral equivalency would have been naming names. And Ilhan Omar wouldn't be serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
They are - they have pledged to resist, oppose, impeach, and obstruct everything and anything. They would prefer to insult, incite and investigate rather than legislate. And it's unfortunate, but they believe that you can obstruct and investigate us to - America to greater prosperity, to greater freedoms which is just absurd. So it's crazy this world that they are going down.
I'm offended when I hear that speech that you just played. I'm a father of identical twin girls, they were born in their second trimester 14.5 weeks early, they were less than a pound and half. I have seen life in the 25th week and these girls have grown up to be strong, healthy, beautiful and intelligent.
And thank God they have had the right to life, and we should be respecting the right to life of the parents but also that kid as well. And if you're not ready for parenthood, alternative should be offered and available.
BONGINO: Allie, if the Left is seemingly so comfortable with abortion, why are they constantly playing the euphemisms game? I just heard a story, I took some notes on this out of NPR, they had some kind of a style guide. And Kerry, I will get your comment on this - thanks to what you do for a living as a reporter, but you are not allowed to refer to a fetal heartbeat anymore? You can't call it partial birth abortion, and you can't even all it an abortion clinic. I mean, if they are so comfortable with this, why the euphemisms game all the time?
ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, RELATABLE PODCAST HOST: Right, even if you look at a more Left-leaning or even Google it, if you Google what an abortion is, it doesn't actually mention the fetus or the baby at all. It just says the termination of a pregnancy and that is convenient dehumanization that makes their moral relativism, and even worse than that, I would say immorality feel okay to them.
And what amazes me is that I have hardly ever, if ever, heard someone on the Left who is a part of this pro-choice side be able to properly and accurately articulate what a pro-life person believes, which is very simple that a human life is a human life no matter how small, no matter how young, and therefore has a right to live.
They try to get around it every way they can, because the fact of the matter is, when you say you are okay with killing a child for the sake of convenience, it's a really hard pill for other people to swallow, and I think they realize that.
BONGINO: And I think it was your Twitter feed Allie today where I saw - it may have been yours - where you said, I can articulate the pro-choice position well, but it's odd that they can't--
STUCKEY: Right.
BONGINO: --but they can't - it was yours right - but they can't articulate ours. Kerry - that's a great point, Allie. Kerry, going to you, this boycott - travel boycott from these states, I saw some of your points here. You've made the point that with so many of the states now, Missouri and others states, looking at pro-life agenda, I mean does this really limits the effectiveness of these so-called boycotts from liberal places like Los Angeles, does it not?
KERRY PICKET, REPORTER, THE DAILY CALLER: Absolutely, Dan. Think about this for a second. I recall to number of years ago California tried doing this to Arizona with a SBA that was emigration or illegal alien bill with, I think, law enforcement. They didn't want them asking them what the illegal aliens' status was, and they ended up boycotting Arizona. They did the same thing to North Carolina with a bathroom bill.
So what these states ended up doing with these abortion bills, they pretty much passed their bills all at the same time and now California, particularly with L.A. County, they said guess what, you know guys, we're going all do it at the same time and they're not going to be able to isolate one state to try and make us the bad guy, and that was absolutely brilliant, because trying to isolate Alabama, it's just not going to work this time. They are not going to allow California to pretty much legislate for one particular state or even all these states.
BONGINO: Congressman, quick last word from you, you know what I think has changed the game for us, ultrasound. It's made it harder and harder for the euphemisms game to exist. You are looking there with the technology, certainly it looks like a child to me.
ZELDIN: It's real, it's a heartbeat, becomes extra personal. That's a life, it's breathing and it should have the opportunity to be born and to thrive. We should be opposing infanticide. We should be speaking up against non- doctors performing abortions. We should be standing strong against late- term partial birth abortions.
If we believe that governments should be fighting for people who can't fight for themselves, what better example is there out there than fighting for that baby who tomorrow in America is going to be ripped out of a mother's womb with a grotesque late-term partial birth abortion, all the more reasons personally and passionately, emotionally to be fighting for the life not just of the parent, but the baby as well.
BONGINO: Kerry, Allie, Congressman, thanks so much.
A big update in the Jussie Smollett case. Plus, President Trump speaks out on the American Taliban, John Walker Lindh case. Pam Bondi and Daryl Parks are here next, stay tuned.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BONGINO: Welcome back to Hannity. Law and order in this country is under assault. The Jussie Smollett saga is ongoing tonight. It's snaring multiple high level officials and is a prime example of what is perceived as a two- tier justice system in America. Fox News Correspondent Trace Gallagher joins us live from the West Coast newsroom with the latest. Trace?
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: And Dan, breaking tonight, the files in this case are now being unsealed. And of course the attorneys for Jussie Smollett oppose unsealing them, saying it violates his privacy.
But Cook County Judge Steven Watkins wasn't having it, saying the day the charges were dropped, Smollett wasn't worried about privacy, when he went before the cameras to wrongly proclaim that he had been vindicated.
We expect the 600 or so pages of documents to go public as early as tomorrow, potentially including grand jury testimony, alibis and corroborating evidence. And they could reveal exactly why state's attorney Kim Foxx abruptly dropped the 16 counts against Smollett for staging a hate crime hoax. Foxx unofficially recused herself after she intervened by asking the Chicago Police Superintendent to turn the case over to the FBI.
Foxx was asked to make their request by Tina Tchen, former Chief of Staff to First Lady Michelle Obama. Today, Tchen declined to be served a subpoena by a retired Illinois judge who is seeking a special prosecutor to investigate this Smollett case. Tchen told the investigator issuing the subpoena that she would never accept it. The investigator says, oh she will be served. Dan?
BONGINO: Trace, thanks a lot. Tonight, we are also tracking two other disturbing stories, including a horrific murder committed against a 14- year-old girl in Maryland. The suspects are MS-13 members who were supposed to be deported last year. However, according to ICE, local authorities did not turn them over.
Meanwhile, this morning, John Walker Lindh was released from an Indiana prison after serving 17 years for providing support to the Taliban and President Trump is not happy about it. Joining me now with reaction, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, and civil rights attorney Daryl Parks.
Pam, I will go to your first on this immigration case out of Maryland. The sad fact of this tragedy here is that, although a lot of people come to this country illegally, broke the law and may not go on to commit additional crimes, 100% should not be here according to our laws. And if they were enforced, this 14-year-old girl would be alive today.
PAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: She would, Dan. And the facts of the case are horrific. She was 14, she was stripped of her clothing, she was beaten with a baseball bat and chopped up with a machete and buried. It's horrific what they did. And they were MS-13 gang members. That is the problem with not coming into this country legally.
This is what President Trump has said all along. Prosecutors wholeheartedly agree with him. We have to vet people coming into our country. Gang members, drugs, human trafficking is all coming into our country, and sadly we are seeing it firsthand now this 14-year-old victim has just suffered a horrific death because of it. And they should not have been here, they should not have been released, they should have been turned over to ICE.
BONGINO: The details of it, as you just described, sounds like something out of an awful horror movie and it's really grotesque. Daryl, I mean what possible reason could Prince George's County in Maryland have for not honoring a detainer against these two suspects? I don't understand, why would you ignore an ICE detainer, what's the point?
DARYL PARKS, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Dan, I think we have a system breakdown here. From what I know about the case, the Department of Corrections actually released it to the Juvenile Justice Department. And they on the judge's order - on the juvenile judge's order, released the children back into the public. And so, thus we see the process is not speaking to each other. And I would also say that ICE needs to do a better job of knowing where the possible detainees are.
(CROSSTALK)
BONGINO: Woah, hold on Daryl, because ICE was supposed to be notified by a change in the detention facility. So that's not an - if you want to comment, Pam, please go right ahead.
BONDI: Yes, and Daryl is right. There was a breakdown, but the breakdown was they should have notified ICE. They had an obligation and a duty to notify ICE when they turned the defendants over to the juvenile detention facility. So, there was a breakdown but it was their fault, not ICE's in any way, shape, or form.
BONGINO: Pam, while I got you--
PARKS: This is a kind of problem I think we ought to be able to fix. I think the system has to fix itself and should be able to work that type of problem.
BAMNGINO: Well, Daryl, the problem now is there is a system. The system is ICE lodges a detainer, asking you to detain that individual until they can pick them up. If you then release these individuals into the streets and they go on and commit other crimes, how is that a problem with the system? That's a problem with sanctuary cities and really horrible immigration policies. I don't get your point.
PARKS: I think you to be - both things. I think one is system needs to be fixed so that ICE can have the personnel to watch the process and what's going on. For example, law is all day long watching to see who is in custody, who is not in custody, so I think it goes both ways.
BONGINO: Daryl, what part of the system broke, though? I don't get what you are saying. What part of the system broke? ICE lodged the detainer. Prince George's County was not notified when these two people, these suspects, were transferred to another facility. What part broke down?
PARKS: I think you agree though ICE knew where the possible detainees were. So they knew where to follow them and see where they were. They also could have an obligation to watch where the--
BONGINO: Pam, please--
BONDI: Yes, you know, Daryl and I respect Daryl, Daryl and I've been on the same side of cases together and I think the world of him. But Daryl, no in this case, ICE should have been notified.
PARKS: OK.
BONDI: They believed that he was under - the defendants were under detention. And the County - Prince George's County had a duty to tell ICE and they did not because they consider themselves a sanctuary city, and that's the problem.
BONGINO: Alright. Thanks Pam and Daryl. We appreciate a great debate. We will be right back with some final thoughts. Stay tuned.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BONGINO: Welcome back to Hannity. Folks, this declassification story is going to be a big deal. Stay tuned. These five buckets of information that are coming out are going to be enormous. Stay tuned, Pandora's boxes open. And unfortunately that's all the time we have left tonight. We had some great guests. We really appreciate you tuning in. Thanks so much for joining us tonight.
