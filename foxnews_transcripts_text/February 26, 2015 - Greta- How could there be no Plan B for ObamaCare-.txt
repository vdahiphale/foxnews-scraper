'Off the Record,' 2/26/15: A Supreme Court case could blow up the Affordable Care Act as millions of Americans know it, and the Obama administration has no backup plan

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');

        }
      
Now, let's all go "Off the Record." I don't get this - it has to do with ObamaCare, President Obama and his Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell. Either no one is thinking, or worse, no one gives a damn.
Here's the problem. Regardless of your view of ObamaCare, it now impacts millions. Next Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on a key case, King vs. Burwell. If the president loses -- and he could -- millions of Americans will lose the subsidies that allow them to afford health care. That's a big deal. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No one knows what the court will decide. But this is urgent enough for millions of Americans that the administration better have a Plan B ready. Do they have one? Here is HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Capitol Hill today: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know you hope that the court upholds your position, but shouldn't the administration and your agency have a plan in case it fails?
SYLVIA BURWELL, HHS SECRETARY: The question of having a plan, we don't have an administrative action that we believe can undo the damage. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

So, no backup plan. Really? Of course, no one knows what the court will decide. But I can tell you this, President Obama is at high risk of losing this. The Supreme Court may only rely on the plain language of the statute and go further, not in the bigger picture of policy. That would be curtains for ObamaCare. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That means millions of Americans would be thrust in the worst possible situation. I don't get why the Obama administration has no Plan B ready for this one. I sure would. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
