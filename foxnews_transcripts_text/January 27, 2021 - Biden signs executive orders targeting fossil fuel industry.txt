BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Greg, Jesse thinks that Husky is aPoodle.All right, next up, President Biden takes another huge shot at the energysector in the name of climate change. Critics say it's a job killer.The Homeland Security Department issues a national terrorism bulletin,warning of more anti-government violence similar to the capital riot.Plus, the big money Wall Street game of chicken over video game retailerGameStop. This is SPECIAL REPORT.Good evening. Welcome to Washington, I'm Bret Baier.On the same day his administration said up to 90,000 people may die ofcoronavirus in the next four weeks, President Biden is concentrating onwhat he calls the climate crisis tonight. The president saying the nationcannot wait any longer to address it. The Biden administration insisting itcan folk on -- focus on both crises at once.The President has signed more sweeping executive orders today to cut oil,gas and coal emissions and double energy production from offshore windturbines.The energy industry and Republican lawmakers have characterized theapproach as either pie in the sky or a big job killer during an economicdownturn.White House Correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off tonight live from theNorth Lawn. Good evening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. President Biden says today is climate day at the White House, whichhe says also means it is jobs day. But that doesn't mean the plans he'sputting in motion now, let everyone in this country keep the job they haveright now.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The first order I'm signing istackling the climate crisis at home and abroad.DOOCY (voice over): President Biden is doing that by banning new oil andgas leasing on federal lands and ordering federal agencies to go green. Theadministration claims anyone who loses an energy industry job because ofthis can be retrained to do something else.JOHN KERRY, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL CLIMATE ENVOY: Coal plants have beenclosing over the last 20 years. So, what President Biden wants to do ismake sure those folks have better choices, that they have alternatives,that they can be the people who go to work to make the solar panels.DOOCY: And close to home.GINA MCCARTHY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL CLIMATE ADVISER: We're not going to askpeople to go from the middle of Ohio or Pennsylvania and ship out to thecoast to have solar jobs. You know, solar jobs will be everywhere.DOOCY: On Capitol Hill today, lawmakers heard testimony from Biden's pickto be Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.JENNIFER GRANHOLM, NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF ENERGY: Having been thegovernor of Michigan when the automotive industry was on its knees, Iunderstand what it's like to look into the eyes of men and women who havelost their jobs through no fault of their own.DOOCY: To preemptively fight climate change, FEMA may soon redirect $10billion to build sea walls and elevate homes in flood prone areas accordingto The New York Times.MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Listen, when most people get upthis morning, or have -- when they got up this morning, they didn't look atit and say that their number one priority was climate. They probably lookedat it as the virus, we need to keep the priority where it is.DOOCY: But the White House tells Fox, FEMA can handle COVID-19 and climatechange with this "Getting the COVID-19 pandemic under control is a toppriority for the president and this administration. While we are lookingfor opportunities to help communities become more resilient to floods andfires that does not and will not involve limiting our ability to fight thispandemic. Any reporting to the contrary is simply misinformed."The White House COVID-19 response team is trying to accelerate vaccinedistribution, but supplies remain tight.ANDY SLAVITT, SENIOR ADVISER, WHITE HOUSE COVID-19 RESPONSE TEAM: Now, wedo not keep a stockpile of a large number of vaccines. We keep a two tothree-day supply as a practice, just to account for variation inmanufacturing production. That's it, the rest moves out to states.DOOCY: President Biden sees COVID-19 and climate change as matters of lifeand death.BIDEN: It's not just the pandemic that keeps the people inside, it's poorair quality. Multiple studies have shown that air pollution is associatedwith an increased risk of death from COVID-19.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): But the White House knows that executive orders onlyaffecting people in this country aren't going to fix climate change.John Kerry the climates are admitted today that because 90 percent of theworld's emissions come from other countries, the United States could getdown to zero emissions tomorrow and the problem still isn't solved, Bret.BAIER: Peter Doocy live in the North Lawn. Peter, thanks. More on this withthe panel.Chicago public school students are getting more time away from theclassroom. Teachers have ditched plans to report to class this week overconcerns about coronavirus safety.Correspondent Garrett Tenney has the latest tonight from Chicago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GARRETT TENNEY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The standoffcontinues over Chicago public schools thousands of students are expected toattend in person classes on Monday for the first time in 11 months. Butteachers' union is defying the district's orders, threatening not to showup and to go on strike.They say the school district safety plan doesn't go far enough. The unionis demanding that teachers be vaccinated before in person learning resumes.Ahead of the next round of negotiations, Mayor Lori Lightfoot is askingteachers to speak up and force the union to change its tone.LORI LIGHTFOOT (D), MAYOR OF CHICAGO: We need you to work with us. We needto talk to your leadership because we can't get there unless we get theretogether.TENNEY: Across the country, parents, teachers and school leaders arepushing back on union efforts to keep students at home.In Bellevue Washington, the teachers' union reversed course this week toallow some in person learning after a growing number of its own membersspoke out.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We felt that we were in the middle that the kids werejust caught in the crossfire, that families didn't have a voice.TENNEY: In Loudoun County, Virginia after more than 6,000 school employeesreceived the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, frustrated parents aredemanding the school board set a date for reopening against the wishes ofthe union.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're a bunch of cowards hiding behind our children asan excuse for keeping schools closed.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am not asking you to remove any distance learningoptions. But for those children where distance learning is failing them andwant to go back, let them go back to a learning environment where they canthrive.TENNEY: Today, Dr. Anthony Fauci again reiterated that study after studyhas found that schools do not pose a high risk for transmitting the virusand can reopen safely when safety protocols are followed.But last night, President Biden's Chief of Staff suggested teachers' unionsare right to refuse returning to the classroom until they've beenvaccinated and until Congress approves Biden's $130 billion plan to helpschools reopen.RON KLAIN, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I don't think unions are overrulingstudies. I think what you're seeing is schools that haven't made theinvestments to keep the students safe. And we as a country should make theinvestments to make it safe.(END VIDEO CLIP)TENNEY: Mayor Lightfoot isn't saying how the city will respond next week ifthe teachers union goes on strike for the second time in two years. Butoutside legal -- outside legal groups are already preparing to take legalaction on behalf of parents if schools close down, Bret.BAIER: Garrett Tenney in Chicago. Garrett, thanks.It was a down day on Wall Street today, which accelerated after the FederalReserve announced it would keep its low interest rate policies in placeeven well after the economy has sustained a recovery from the pandemic.The Dow had its worst day since October, losing 634. The S&P 500 dropped99, the NASDAQ pledged 355.There is a big money tug of war happening on Wall Street right now. Itinvolves investors who are waging some of their fortunes large and small onthe fortunes of a few select stocks.Fox Business Correspondent Lauren Simonetti joins us tonight with theamazing story of GameStop. Good evening, Lauren.LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT (on camera): It trulyis amazing, Bret. And one of the reasons for the selloff we store -- we sawtoday is market manipulation by amateur traders often stuck at home becauseof the pandemic using online chat rooms like Reddit and popular apps likeRobinhood to take on the big institutional players like the hedge funds andcause some of them to unwind their positions. It's really a David versusGoliath matchup. And right now, David is winning.So, GameStop that's the most heavily shorted name out there but it's notthe only target of this Reddit crowd which also includes Express,BlackBerry, AMC Theaters. The retail traders are encouraging one another tobuy, buy, buy, forcing hedge funds to scramble to cover their shortpositions. What that does is push up the price and the value of somestocks. In ways, Bret, that defy logic.GameStop shares up 13,000 percent from their 52-week low and stakeholderRyan Cohen who made a $76 million investment in GameStop which is astruggling mall retailer. He made that investment last year, his stake nowworth $3.1 billion. Gains like that are becoming a headache for regulators.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Secretary Yellen and others aremonitoring the situation. It's a good reminder though, that the stockmarket isn't the only measure of the health of our economic -- of oureconomy. It doesn't reflect how working in middle class families are doing.(END VIDEO CLIP)SIMONETTI (voice over): But it's emboldening the retail traders who mightbe left holding the bag here. And that's why the top securities regulatorin Massachusetts is calling for a cooling off period saying "I really thinkat this point, it calls upon the regulators, in this case, the New YorkStock Exchange to consider simply suspending it for a month and stoptrading it. These small and unsophisticated investors are probably going toget hurt by this."But Bret, will regulators allow them to get hurt? As experts debate ifindeed this is creating a bubble situation, how much risk does it pose tothe broader markets?BAIER: That's a fair question. But there's also people out there obviouslythat ask, is it fair to intervene in a market? You know, a market is amarket, or change the rules of the game when the little guy is makingmoney?SIMONETTI: Yes, and I'm not sure there's a good answer to this one. Butwhat regulators have to do is make sure there is not systemic risk causedby this.So, let's say this speculative activity causes a big hedge fund to unwind,that would be a major problem. And conversely, what to do if and when theretail trader who doesn't have a license gets burned in the process.BAIER: It's a fascinating story. Lauren, we appreciate it, thanks.According to intelligence officials monitoring threats, there is apparentlya real possibility that the violence in and around the nation's Capitol isnot over, that's what they're saying. Lucas Tomlinson is at the Pentagontonight with details. Good evening, Lucas.LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening,Bret. The Department of Homeland Security is warning a potentially moreattacks in the United States following the riot at the U.S. Capitol threeweeks ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TOMLINSON (voice over): The Bulletin says "Information suggests that someideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exerciseof governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as otherperceived grievances fueled by false narratives could continue to mobilizeto incite or commit violence."Officials tell Fox News the new warning is centered around the historicinauguration date of March 4th, when presidents used to be sworn in before1937.The fresh warning comes after the FBI and Secret Service requested NationalGuard troops stay in D.C. until the end of March.In a letter, the acting Army Secretary 12 House Republicans led byCongressman Mike Waltz are demanding an explanation "The National Guardshould be used as an option of absolute last resort."Head of the new DHS warning Senator Tom Cotton called these sendingdeployments in overreaction.SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): I'm on the Senate Intelligence Committee, I'veconsulted with Senate leadership. I don't -- I'm not aware of threatreporting that suggests we need 7,000 troops and razor wire around theCapitol.TOMLINSON: In an interview with The Washington Post ahead of the D.C.National Guards, the Pentagon restricted his authority to respond to thoseJanuary 6th riots, something Major General Walker did not mention at hispress conference Monday.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOMLINSON (on camera): And DHS also says it has no information about anyspecific credible threats. The new warning expires at the end of April,Bret.BAIER: Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon. Lucas, thanks.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've done things wrongin my life. I will admit, not purposely but I've done things wrong. Butthis is what the end result is.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: President Trump after his last impeachment trial in the Senateholding up the Washington Post saying Trump acquitted.Let's get some perspective tonight from historian Jay Winik about theupcoming Senate trial and the current environment in Washington. Jay,thanks for being here.JAY WINIK, HISTORIAN: Greg, great to be here.BAIER: What's your take of this senate trial as we begin, not next week,the following week, how this is going to unfold?WINIK: You know, I'm a little uncomfortable with the trial. You know, beingrough and tumble in American politics is nothing new. It's been like thatsince the founders started the country.But having said that, I think there's something that feels a little bitvindictive, a little bit harsh in all this. And that's not really theAmerican way.If you think of Richard Nixon, he was pardoned, and most historians nowagree. That was the right thing to do. And with Donald Trump, if you thinkof where he is now, he's in Florida. He's a private citizen. He's beendisgraced before the world. He's under a cloud of personal disgrace. Anddespite these legions of supporters, he is in many ways a man alone.I think the Democrats would have been well just to let it be. And I feelthat a trial will only deepen the divides in the American public, ratherthan healing. And we need right now is healing.BAIER: That's interesting. I mean, some Democrats say it's just a matter ofprinciple. Some Republicans have joined them but clearly, it does not looklike they're going to get anywhere near the 17 senators that they'll needto convict, at least right now as we look at it.I want to play a soundbite from Joe Biden's inauguration speech and get youto react.WINIK: Go ahead.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Our history has been a constant struggle between the American idealthat we're all are created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism,nativism, fear, demonization had long torn us apart.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: A number of people lauded that speech, what was your take?WINIK: You know, my feeling about the speech is that it was a solid speech.I don't think it was the best speech of the last 20 or 30 years. Itcertainly didn't approach anything like Abraham Lincoln's monumental firstinaugural or let alone his second inaugural. Of course, was in where hetalked about with charity for all. It was nothing like FDRs, we havenothing to fear but fear itself speech. Let alone, Ronald Reagan'sgovernment is not the answer.Having said that, I think -- I think Biden did a couple of things well. Ithink he spoke about unity which is laudable. It had a folksy quality toit, and it was commendably optimistic. But having said that, there issomething about this speech I thought a little weirdly flattening. Almostlike poetry but without the poetry.You know, presidents used to hang around -- used to huddle around the radioto listen to FDR because they felt that he was a friend. Where the(INAUDIBLE) he was a member of the family.And I get the sense that probably many Democrats feel that way about JoeBiden now. But to Democrats, that's the harder question. So, I suspect thatthis elusive -- this quest for the elusive unity may prove to be a(INAUDIBLE) in the end after all.BAIER: Well, one of the biggest questions about unity is coming up. Andthat is whether they try to get rid of the filibuster in the Senate, andthere's a lot of history there, you know it well.WINIK: Right. Well, I feel very strongly about this question of thefilibuster. If you think of the halls of the Senate, in -- and then oncewalk such great names as Stephen Douglas, as Charles Sumner, as Henry Clay.And these are some of the great giants of American -- of Americangovernance.And we see that debate is part of the DNA of American -- of the Americanfabric. We should not be circumscribing debate; we should be encouragingit.BAIER: Jay Winik, historian, we thank you very much for being here.WINIK: Thanks for having me, Bret.BAIER: Still to come, a new secretary of state has major challenges waitingfor him with China and Iran. And up next, the report card on thecoronavirus response. Which states are passing, which are failing?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today is the shot. Hopefully, that would have happenedearlier. But now, we're just moving forward.BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: We're just stuck rightnow because we don't have supplies.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Cancel culture has struck San Francisco public schools. The boardhas voted six to one to remove the names of historical figures such asGeorge Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Thomas Jefferson from the schools.Supporters of the move say Washington and Jefferson were both slave owners.And Lincoln who ended slavery, allegedly oppressed indigenous people.The list also now includes California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein.The elementary school bearing her name will be renamed over allegations shereplaced the damaged Confederate flag outside of city hall when she was thecity's mayor in 1986.Current mayor, London Breed, rebukes the plan last October as offensive.And said the board should be focused on re-opening schools instead ofrenaming them.California taxpayers have shelled out at least $11 billion, and perhaps, asmuch as $30 billion in fraudulent unemployment claims since the pandemicbegan. Auditors say the state's unemployment system has -- was targeted byinmates and cybercriminals who filed bogus claims and then pocketed thecash. One even claimed to be Senator Dianne Feinstein.The woman who oversaw that system, State Labor Secretary Julie Su partiallyblames the Trump administration and is now heading to Washington to takethe number two spot in President Biden's labor department.As we told you earlier, the Biden administration is projecting as many as90,000 Americans will die from the coronavirus in the next four weeks.Officials say they are examining additional ways of speeding vaccineproduction.New York governor Andrew Cuomo says he will have a plan for the city'srestaurants by the end of the week. There's been tremendous controversyover whether the restaurant should be open during the pandemic in New York.There are increasing concerns in California about a new strain of thecoronavirus there. Media reports say multiple cases have been reportedacross the State of California.Tonight, a report card on the coronavirus pandemic. While some states areexperiencing big drops in infection rates and deaths, others are stillstruggling. Correspond Gillian Turner takes a look.GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Last week,California's Governor Gavin Newsom announced residents would not receivethe 50 million vaccine doses they've been counting on. Long lines ofdriving vaccination sites are the new normal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ED SCHUMMER, RESIDENT, CALIFORNIA: They're not even able to fulfill alltheir first line recipients that are eligible now, you know. And you go,what's going on?TURNER: California's use just 40 percent of the 5.3 million doses allocatedby the federal government. It's among the five slowest states to vaccinateaccording to the CDC.The California is just one state of many that had been heralded aseffectively managing the pandemic. Maryland is another.GOV. LARRY HOGAN (R-MD): The demand for vaccines. We'll continue to farexceed the supply that will be available to us.TURNER: Government figures show wealthy and highly educated Maryland iswell below average among states in getting shots into arms.Neighboring West Virginia though, poorer and less educated overall is achampion among states. It's now the first to provide vaccinations to everynursing home resident.CDC figures show several New England states and the Dakotas are among thosewith the highest reported death rates. Yet, North Dakota has one of thehighest vaccination rates, having used 85 percent of its available doses.But other mostly rural states with fewer hospitals have managed to keepdeath rate relatively low. Including Utah, Kentucky, and Maine.Florida, even with its large senior population has managed to keep deathrates in the middle of the pack among states, it ranks 26th. But challengesremain. 75-year-old Nancy Smythe spends three to four hours a day trying toscore a vaccine appointment in Naples.NANCY SMYTHE, RESIDENT, NAPLES, FLORIDA: It seems hopeless.TURNER: At retirement haven, The Villages, a vaccination site closedsuddenly last weekend, leaving seniors racing for shots at drive-up sitesand supermarkets.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We spent at least an hour on the phone, the two of usjust dialing, dialing, dialing until we finally got through to get thefirst dose.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER (on camera): Asked at The World Economic Forum about the biggestCOVID challenge in the U.S. right now, Dr. Fauci said earlier this weekthat mixed messaging has cost the nation dearly. He also said states haveresponded inconsistently to the pandemic's challenges. Exactly what we'retalking about tonight, Bret.BAIER: Gillian, thank you.TURNER: You bet.BAIER: Up next, the nation's new top diplomat starts to work with plenty ofchallenges on his plate. We'll take you to the state department.First, legendary actress and comedian Cloris Leachman has died. Leachmanwon an Oscar for her role in The Last Picture Show. She was also the noisyneighbor, Phyllis on the Mary Tyler Moore Show.Her publicist says Leachman died in her sleep of natural causes at her homein California. Cloris Leachman was 94.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: A Census Bureau official says the numbers used for dividingcongressional seats among the states will not be ready until the end ofApril. The deadline for turning in the apportionment numbers has been amoving target since the pandemic upended the Census Bureau's once-a-decadeheadcount.The figures were supposed to be turned in at the end of last year, but theCensus Bureau requested until the end of April after the virus outbreakcaused the Bureau to suspend operations.The country's new top diplomat is vowing to rebuild the ranks of foreignservice and rely on its expertise. But Secretary of State Tony Blinken isinheriting a bundle of policy challenges on his first day at the new job.State Department correspondent Rich Edson looks at some of them tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE:  I am honored to be your secretary. Nowlet's get to work.RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  That work involves a long list ofquestions of how the United States will navigate the world under the Bidenadministration, and confront China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea. At apress conference on his first full day at State Department headquarters,Secretary Antony Blinken says the administration is still evaluating muchof its approach.BLINKEN:  We are reviewing a number of steps taken late in the lastadministration.EDSON:  As part of what the officials call a routine review, the StateDepartment has suspended some foreign arms sales, including weapons toSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Blinken also stressed that Chinais committing genocide against its Uyghur population. He says the U.S. andChinese governments have a competitive and cooperative measure, and canwork together on issues like climate change, as Republicans pressureBlinken to maintain the last administration's aggressive policies towardsChina's government.MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  We need Secretary Blinkento keep clarifying the China threat and hold Beijing accountable for itsunacceptable repression in places like Tibet and Hong Kong, and hostilitytowards Taiwan.EDSON:  They are also major challenges in the Middle East. This week thePentagon dispatched another B-52 bomber over the Persian Gulf in ademonstration to deter Iranian aggression. The bomber departed yesterdayfrom Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.(END VIDEO TAPE)EDSON (on camera):  This week Iran's government demanded the United Statesreturn to complying with the 2015 nuclear agreement. Secretary Blinken saysIran must do so before the United States would consider reentering thedeal. The secretary acknowledged that would take some time. Bret?BAIER:  Rich Edson at the State Department, Rich, thank you.Up next, the panel on President Joe Biden's energy and climate changeactions. First, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around the countryare covering tonight. FOX 2 in Detroit as one of six men charged in analleged plot to snatch Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer pleads guilty toa kidnapping conspiracy. Ty Garbin appeared in federal court in GrandRapids a few hours after prosecutors filed a plea agreement loaded withdetails about that operation and his pledge to cooperate withinvestigators.FOX 2 in San Francisco as Oakland International Airport becomes the firstin the U.S. to sell COVID test kits in vending machines. Customers take thetest on their own, then return saliva samples via FedEx. They will receiveresults on a mobile phone app. Test kits range from $130 to $150.And this is a live look at New Orleans from FOX 8, our affiliate downthere. One of the big stories there tonight, thousands of houses are beingdecorated as floats after the coronavirus outbreak canceled the elaborateparades during the carnival season around Mardi Gras. So the so-calledhouse float movement started almost as soon as a New Orleans spokesmanannounced last November that the parades were off. They still have thespirit down there.That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'llbe right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  When I think of climatechange, I think of answers to it, I think of jobs. A key plank of our buildback better recovery plan is building a modern, resilient climateinfrastructure and clean energy future that will create millions of goodpaying union jobs.SEN. STEVE DAINES, (R-MT) SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE:  It's 11,000 jobs thatare cut with one stroke of the pen of President Biden. It looks likePresident Biden is working on make America unemployed again kind ofstrategy, thinking more about Saudi Arabian workers than Montana workersand U.S. workers.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Nineteen executive orders now, and actions, you've got 24 executiveorders total over the last eight days, two of them today on climate changeto deal with the Interior Secretary pausing entering new oil and gas leaseson public lands or offshore waters, and review all existing fossil fueldevelopment, directs federal agencies to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies,and environmental justice, it's described, directs federal agencies todevelop programs, policies, and activities to address the disproportionatehealth, environmental, economic, and climate impacts of disadvantagedcommunities.The Keystone XL pipeline, which we know was one that got eliminated as faras the construction from October, the total number of American unionworkers constructing Keystone XL will exceed $8,900,000,000 in gross wages.In total, Keystone XL is expected to employ more than 11,000 Americans inthis year, creating $1.6 billion in gross wages. That obviously not thecase now.Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the"Washington Examiner," Mara Liasson, national political correspondent forNational Public Radio, and Ben Domenech, publisher of "The Federalist."These are executive actions, executive order, Ben, but they are havingsignificant impacts in these different communities especially.BEN DOMENECH, "THE FEDERALIST":  Absolutely they are. And I spoke todaywith some senior officials from the Trump administration and on CapitolHill who were engaged on this. They view this as being very ill thought interms of the approach. You can talk what you want to, as John Kerry didtoday, about wanting to address climate change, but there is nothing inthis that is about science or technology. Instead, it seems more like arecipe to just kill one of the most thriving areas of the American economyover the past decade, which is of course the arena of natural gas.Going to all these different workers and just saying they are going to needto learn the code or learn to make solar panels is really not a solution.And there is another area of this that I think speaks to what is going tobe an ongoing dynamic with the Biden administration, which is they talk agood game when it comes to satisfying what progressives want to hear fromthem. But then when it comes to actually implementing the policy, they arenot willing to go quite that far. So you already saw a carve out withinthis four tribal lands, for instance, something that is going to be a bigissue going forward. And I think that that is going to continue to be anissue for the Biden administration as they try to satisfy their left flankwhile still speaking to the more corporatist supporters that they have.BAIER:  You mentioned John Kerry, former secretary of state, now climateadvisor, climate czar, if you want to call him, talking about, asked aquestion about the thousands of jobs that are being lost.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KERRY, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL CLIMATE ENVOY:  You look at theconsequences of black lung for a minor, for instance, and measure thatagainst the fastest growing job in the United States before COVID was solarpower technician. The same people can do those jobs -- 75 percent, 70percent of all the electricity that has come online in the United States inthe last few years came from renewables. Coal plants have been closing overthe last 20 years. So what President Biden wants to do is make sure thosefolks have better choices, that they have alternatives, that they can bethe people who go to work to make the solar panels.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  They can make the solar panels, Mara. How do you think that fliesin West Virginia, Pennsylvania, those different states?MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: That is going to be the big question. Joe Biden repeated again today thathe wasn't against fracking. He wasn't going to stop that. He cares aboutPennsylvania, not just because he's from there. It's a really importantelectoral state. And this is going to be a big test.I think it is kind of unrealistic to say that every coal miner can learn tocode. I think it's less unrealistic to say coal miners can learn to workand create solar panels. So the big question is, because there is going todisruption, as John Kerry says, coal jobs are already disappearing. DonaldTrump did not reverse the decline of the coal industry during his fouryears in office.So will there be a big push to pour resources into these communities thatare going through these dislocations as we move to an economy that is notdependent on fossil fuels over time? That is going to be a big test forBiden. The difference is between now and when Obama tried to do thesethings, he's got the auto industry, he has Wall Street, he has a lot ofindustry. The Chamber of Commerce had nice things to say about this plan.So things could be different now.BAIER:  Yes, time does change that. Byron, elections do have consequences,but there are concerns. Here is a back and forth with Senator John Barrassoand the incoming energy secretary, if she gets confirmed, JenniferGranholm.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, (R-WY):  I'm just curious how a long-term banconsistent with the president's goal of unifying the country and puttingAmericans back to work and helping our economies grow, how is that allconsistent?JENNIFER GRANHOLM, ENERGY SECRETARY NOMINEE: I know that part of what JoeBiden has put together is a sort of SWAT team inside of the federalgovernment to focus on communities that have powered in America, and tomake sure that we don't leave those workers behind.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Byron, thoughts?BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER":  Well,when the president took office, he said he is facing four consecutive orsimultaneous crises. There is COVID, and then there is the related economiccrisis because of COVID. There's the climate crisis, and then the racialequity crisis. I think most Americans would agree that the first two arethe most urgent right now.So I think today, being climate day at the White House, was a little bithappy talk for the Democratic base that wants to see the president doingthis sort of thing. The whole green jobs talk that Secretary Kerry gave wasvery reminiscent from the first days of the Obama administration when theyhad a hired Van Jones to be the green jobs czar. That whole thing didn'twork out all that well.So I think the new president has clearly taken real actions like theKeystone pipeline, he's actually gotten back in with the Paris agreement,so there is some real action. But a lot of this is actually talk to makethe Democratic base feel like the president is acting on their issue.BAIER:  Yes, as we have said many times, the biggest things happen throughlegislation in Congress. And with such slim majorities, Ben, there isconcern about how this would get packaged. Would they try to usereconciliation on something for climate change, somehow saying it is abudget item? There is a lot of possibilities here.DOMENECH:  Again, this is a situation where I think, to Byron's point, theywant to send a message without necessarily doing the things that are goingto have as much immediate ramifications and actual results. Again, if weare going to have solutions on climate, it is going to be about science andabout technology. It's not going to be about nuking the American naturalgas industry. And it's not going to be something that I think has thesekinds of carve outs and trying to give people leeway one way or the other.Even this approach that was originally favored would have much moreextended timeline. Instead, they just have a year-long pause. It isbasically the equivalent of the Obamacare message, if you like your plan,you can keep it. If you like your current drilling plan, you are supposedto be able to keep it. But we have heard that before from Joe Bidenhimself, and I don't think that the industry has a lot of faith in thatgoing forward.BAIER:  Panel, stand by. Up next, looking at how individual states aredealing with the coronavirus pandemic.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LINDA PERALES, CHICAGO TEACHER:  The reality is that we have the privilegeto be able to work from home. We have been teaching effectively sinceMarch, almost one year, from the safety of our homes.MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT, (D) CHICAGO:  The CTU union's leadership has made itclear that despite the data and science confirming the safety of in-personlearning in the schools, they have determined that pre-k and clusterteachers should not report tomorrow.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  A Chicago teacher and the Chicago mayor saying they are not goingback to school this week. The CTU is the union, the teachers' union there.And teachers' unions around the country are making those decisions.We are back with our panel. Mara, this seems like constant issue not justin one section of the country but all sections where parents are dealingwith this and teachers unions and teachers are dealing with the safetyissues.LIASSON:  Yes, there is no single thing that symbolizes returning to normalor getting past the pandemic then sending your kid back to school. I can'tthink of anything else. And parents want to go back, kids want to go back.You have to figure out how to do it safely. Joe Biden says he has askedCongress for money to ventilate schools, clean schools, social distanceschools, things that are going to make teachers feel safe.But we don't have any evidence that there has been community spread inschools. Schools seem to be relatively safe, but they have got to open withcertain protection. So that is the name of the game. When schools open,people are going to feel like we are getting back to normal.BAIER:  White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain was on another network, askedabout this, and said the teachers unions have a right to be concernedbecause there's not enough money. That was his answer, Byron.YORK:  And Klain acted like schools shouldn't reopen until Congress passesthe relief bill and money can flow. It took an awfully long time to pass aCOVID relief bill last year. And so it is just extraordinary. And thissituation appears to be getting worse. Not only do you have the situationin Chicago, but you have this extraordinary situation in San Franciscowhere the school board spent hours and hours debating taking the names ofhistorical figures off of schools, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,Abraham Lincoln, taking those off of the school, making a plan to implementit when they do not have a plan to even reopen the schools. So you have aschool district spending hours on the name of a closed down school.BAIER:  Even the San Francisco mayor saying they should spend more time onreopening rather than renaming. Ben, what about the vaccine distributionand the outlook for how that is going to move to these different states?DOMENECH:  Look, I think that we can obviously see that there has beenproblems in the way that these states have gone about approaching vaccinedistribution. The differences in the methods that they have used and theway that they've prioritized different populations, I think, can obviouslybe criticized.But in this current dynamic, what you were talking about with these publicsector unions and the school experience, my daughter is far too young to begoing to a public educational institution, but if she was old enough, Iwould be tearing my hair out at the insanity of the approach that has beenused here. We know from evidence around the world, as Mara said, that thiscan be done safely. It can be done responsibly. And it can get us back tonormal, not just in terms of our living experiences but in terms of theeconomy as well. That can be done. It is very much possible.Instead, we have these teachers' union who have completely politicized thescenario, essentially demanding ransom dollars, that they get more and moremoney thrown their way in order to reopen and to establish normalcy again.I just can't imagine a worse example of the kind of way that these schoolsneed to be able to serve their communities.BAIER:  A number of private schools are doing it around the country as welltonight. Panel, standby.When we come back, a look at tomorrow's headlines tonight.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, a look at tomorrow's headlines, at least what thepanel thinks they will be. Mara, first to you.LIASSON:  I think there will be a headline somewhere that says Joe Biden'sapproval rating in the mid-50s hitting an achievement that Trump neverreached. We don't know how long this will last. I think presidentialhoneymoons are things of the past, but so far he is having one.BAIER:  Byron?YORK:  My headline is "GameStop overtakes Amazon as world's richestcompany."(LAUGHTER)YORK:  I want to be clear that it's a joke.LIASSON:  That's good.YORK:  At least I think it's a joke.BAIER:  That's such a crazy story. All right, Ben?DOMENECH:  Joe Biden responds to serious questions from reporter with yourmom joke.(LAUGHTER)YORK:  He has responded to questions from Zeke Miller, Bo Erickson, and nowFOX's own Peter Doocy by being dismissive. It's clearly going to be adynamic and this administration.BAIER:  All right, thank you panel, those were some good ones.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIALREPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. FOX NEWS PRIMETIME hosted by MariaBartiromo this week starts right now.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC.
