Let's go "Off the Record." Today is Tax Day. Lucky us, right? This is the day we are reminded that our government wants your money, yet, doesn't give a damn about waste and fraud.
It is just gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. You aren't the only one. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is obviously frustrated. He took to Twitter tweeting this: "At 83, I'm close to losing hope that I will see a flat tax." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
At age 83? You could send that one at 33 and have the same result. None. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I don't know about a flat tax, whether it is a good idea for America or not, but I do know one thing. The current tax code doles out hundreds of billions of dollars through loopholes and special deals to special people. People who are lobbyists who have wads of dough in their pocket to schmooze all of Washington. They all get special deals, but not you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You and I both know Congress doesn't give a damn about fixing the tax code - it is just gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. And President Obama doesn't give a damn either, because if he did, he would have done something. He has been in the White House seven and a half years and he's done nothing about that tax code.
Instead, you know what he is doing? He is asking for a raise. Yes the presidents' budget calls for an 18 percent increase in spending on former presidents. That's money President Obama will get once is he out of office in January. It is just gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that is my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
