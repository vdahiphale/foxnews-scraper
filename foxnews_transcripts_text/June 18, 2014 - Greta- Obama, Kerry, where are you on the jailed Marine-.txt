Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. This is unthinkable. A US Marine rotting in a prison in Mexico for almost three months. Yes, of course, I'm speaking about Sergeant Tahmooressi, who did two tours of Afghanistan for us. So, what are we doing for him?
Well, for starters, three outspoken women are standing up for our Marine. The first one is his mother, Jill Tahmooressi. She has pounded the pavement and even sat outside his Mexican prison with us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JILL TAHMOORESSI, MOTHER OF JAILED MARINE: He is not a criminal. He made a mistake and made a wrong turn. And said right at the border, I have got guns. I don't want to be here. Let me turn around and go home. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, too. Here is what she told me last night about how she would handle Sergeant Tahmooressi's imprisonment. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: I can tell you what I would be doing. Burning up the telephone wires, sending, you know, envoys, not just our ambassador, but others coming in and talking to the highest level Mexican officials, making it clear that this is really important to us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then there is the "Momma Grizzly" herself, former governor Sarah Palin. She has had it. She just posted on her Facebook page, in part, "It's crappy that more hasn't been done to free this detained U.S. Marine. We must do implore our Commander-in-Chief to help America's Marine. Perhaps Sergeant Tahmooressi deserted his post, his mother would get the red carpet treatment at the White House, instead of being ignored."
I have a question for two men. Yes, you know the two guys, President Obama and Secretary Kerry, if these three women can speak up, where are you? We are waiting. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
