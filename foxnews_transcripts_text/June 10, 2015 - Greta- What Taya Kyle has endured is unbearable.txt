Let's all go "Off the Record" for minute. You all know the movie "American Sniper," the story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. It is the biggest movie of the year. But it is my conversation with Chris' widow,Taya Kyle, during my Greta Talk podcast that reminds me of the expression "Don't sweat the small stuff" and that is so true.
What Taya has had to endure - and is enduring - is not the small stuff. It's the big stuff. It absolutely takes your breath away. Not only did she lose the life of love of her life in a flash, but she had the unthinkable job and extra pain of telling their two small children their father was dead, murdered. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

TAYA KYLE, WIDOW OF CHRIS KYLE: I have never had anything I don't think more heart breaking than to sit down and tell them that it's forever.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
