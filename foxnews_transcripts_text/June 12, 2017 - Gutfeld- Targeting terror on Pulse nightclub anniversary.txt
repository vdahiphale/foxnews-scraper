Headline: Gutfeld: Targeting terror on Pulse nightclub anniversary
Sub-headline: The best way to honor victims is to remind us of the truth

 
On the one-year anniversary of the Orlando terror attack, how is it being remembered? The Washington Post left out the massacre's cause, the only reference to Islamic state is actually in the caption. Yet it had no problem calling the attack another example of gun violence, which I guess makes Hurricane Katrina water violence. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A better way to honor victims is to remind us why they were killed, not how they were killed. After 9/11, you don't honor the dead by saying they were murdered by a plane and a box cutter. They were killed because of radical Islam. And the gays and lesbians murdered at the Pulse, same thing.
So, a year later the press obscures facts in the name of political correctness. So, if terrorists can gun down gays, but hey, let's target the outrage that follows instead. A piece in The New York Times was called "A night of terror, a year of racism," focused on critics of radical Islam -- it's not racist, if it's a set of ideas, just remember that -- and said the response to the attack was a missed opportunity for gun reform. Once again, terrorism always exposes enablers and their flaccid responses to evil. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This weekend, there were protests against Sharia Law, mocked by the media who smeared them at times as far right. How crazy is it that if you come out against intolerant, sexist, homophobic deadly tyranny, it is you who is the problem? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, yesterday was another anniversary, the first hanging of a witch took place in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692. If our modern media were around then, they would side with the hangman.
