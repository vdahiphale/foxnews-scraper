Let's go "Off the Record." Yes, I know, I sound like a broken record talking about the police, but I must again tonight. I want to go on the record, noting my appreciation and admiration for law enforcement.
Yesterday's job by the law enforcement in San Bernardino was something we should all be proud of. The call went out - a shooting  - and more than 300 law enforcement officers immediately responded, running toward danger, not away, and as our hearts bleed for the 14 massacred victims and their families and friends. It was law enforcement risking their lives. They stopped the killers before the killers could kill more by gun or with their bomb-making factory at home. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I am not the only one who is proud of law enforcement. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JARROD BURGUAN, SAN BERNARDINO POLICE CHIEF: I will tell you as the chief of this agency, I am incredibly proud of the way our folks responded, not only the response here help and regional partners, but the way they engaged in that officer involved shooting. That was nothing short of heroic, and extremely proud of the way that they handled that.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {

        }
      
And while the chief won't say it himself, I will. He also needs to take a bow. You don't have law enforcement like San Bernardino without a great leader, that's the chief. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
