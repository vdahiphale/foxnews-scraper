Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. I just don't get it. Apparently, the rules just don't apply to everyone. And that's unfair.
You have to pay your taxes on time, but the IRS, well, they can take their good old time sending you your refund, besides the fact it's your money, not theirs. That's not fair or right. And 318,000 federal employees owe delinquent taxes. The IRS knows who they are, where they are, but doesn't bother to dock their paychecks. That's not fair or right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Al Sharpton owes $4 million to $5 million in unpaid taxes. He gets to go in and out of the White House like he's the president. That's not fair or right. And the Constitution explained the government must get a warrant to seize your stuff, yet the NSA does it without a warrant. That's to the fair or right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And remember when Senator Feinstein raised holy hell about the CIA spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DIANNE FEINSTEIN, SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE VICE CHAIRMAN: I view the acting consul general's referral as a potential effort to intimidate this staff and I am not taking it lightly. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

So why was she so mad? Well, for starters, it's a crime. But they got a pass. No indictment. It's not fair, not right. And then the news today that not even job consequences for the CIA law breakers, the CIA won't discipline them. That's not fair or right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So here is my point. We are sinking into chaos as rules apply to only some, that's just not unfair, it's actually dangerous. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
