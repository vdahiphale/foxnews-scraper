DANA PERINO, HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Geraldo Rivera, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.”
That is our theme song, it's 5 o'clock somewhere. Remember when “The Five” first started and people told us they started happy hour early because it's 5 o'clock?

PERINO: It's my week to D.J., so it's my day of the week to D.J. So you know what you're in for. You're going to love it. All right. But on to our topic, Ilhan Omar -- Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, she's not backing down from the controversy over these comments about the 9/11 terror attacks.

REP. ILHAN OMAR, D-MINN.: Here's the truth. Far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it.

REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: Printing on the front page to circulate all around New York City an image that is incredibly upsetting and triggering for New Yorkers that were actually there, and were actually in the radius that woke up one morning or were in their schools and didn't know if they were going to see their parents at the end of the day to elicit such an image for such a transparent and politically motivated attack on Ilhan. This is -- we're getting to the level where this is an indictment of violence against progressive women of color.

REP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: They do this all the time to us, especially women of color. They do that. They take our words out of context because they're afraid because we speak truth. We speak truth to power. This is just pure, racist acts by many of those -- hateful acts by those because she does speak truths when it talks about different issues that they don't disagree with, and I'm really outraged.

PERINO: One of the first people to come out against Omar's comments is Congressman Dan Crenshaw who lost an eye fighting terrorists in Afghanistan. AOC is facing new backlash for this twitter attack on the decorated war hero, telling him to, quote, go do something about domestic terrorism.
Omar also dragging President George W. Bush into the controversy with this tweet, the people and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. Was Bush downplaying the terrorist attack? What if he was a Muslim?

So a lot to unpack here, Greg. Let me start with you in terms of what -- George W. Bush was sending a warning to the terrorists.

GUTFELD: Yeah, she's not very good about -- Jesse is the king of what- about-isms. She's the worst at it. That was a terrible -- that was a terrible what-about-ism.
PERINO: It didn't work.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Look, here's her problem. She's too casual about something that everybody takes really seriously. Let's assume that she knows that 9/11 is a bad thing. I think she does. The problem is she's interested in -- more interested in what happened afterwards. And what that does is by shifting the emphasis and the priority to that, it makes it seem like she cares less about 9/11. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And the weird thing, I think, that I find troubling and persistent because she's made this mistake a number of times is that she finds an attachment to the never-forget element kind of tiresome. It's like when she was critiquing people about the way they say al-Qaeda, and how they overdramatize it. It was like she was saying that you place too much importance on the threat of terror, because, in her mind, the real importance about her as a victim.
And so, even here when they're talking about like -- you better not criticize her because she could become a victim of something. It's like -- well, we could just say the same thing about the very criticisms you say about us.
PERINO: It is interesting to watch how like Congressman Dan Crenshaw and AOC and the other like -- they go back and forth on twitter and it's kind of strange, but kind of good to see the fight.

        }
      
JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Yeah. I don't think she's fighting fair because she blames every attack on her being a black female Muslim refugee instead of actually addressing what she said. To Greg's point, I think the impression that she was giving off was she cared more and thought that Islamophobia was a bigger threat than radical Islam. And no one actually believes that.

        }
      
I don't think she's a hero. I also don't think she's a victim. I think she's a below average talent who doesn't have the sensibility to survive very much longer in Congress. She's a lightning rod.
GUTFELD: How do you know that?

What I don't like is that she never really acknowledges what she says when she's attacked. She says you're only attacking me because of my identity not what I actually said. And that's like playing sports against someone, they're always complaining to the ref.

You know, they're getting dominated play after play after play and they're always whining to the referee. She just does not have the talent, I don't think, to stand in the ring and fight.

It's a mass murder -- mass grave downtown.

He's the one also that reached across the aisle to average Americans when he was attack publicly, and he kind of demonstrated that olive branch extension. But I'm not seeing from these other lawmakers --
PERINO: On Saturday Night Live. The other thing is in terms of like -- I understand that she's young. I can get it. But, you know what? She won an election. She's in a position of leadership and power and there's responsibility with that. And I have spoken on the record my entire career, sometimes on behalf of other people in the last 10 years for myself. I can remember one time when I was taken out of context, and the reason for that is because I'm thoughtful about what I'm going to say. Every week she complains about being taken out of context.

Here for the first time in history you have two Muslim women in the Congress of the United States. They carry an enormous burden. It's not just their personal lives or their districts, they're representing four million, five million Muslims in the United States. There's a lot there. There's a lot of responsibility there.

California is certainly is always saying, oh, we want more people and they want more people in their sanctuary cities. Well, we'll give them more people. We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply, and let's see if they're so happy.

RIVERA: The road from the border to wherever the illegal immigrants are being taken will be lined with lawsuits. I guarantee you.
WATTERS: OK. Emily, I think the restriction is financial. You can't just spend -- it cost a lot of money to transport people all the way from the border to San Francisco.
COMPAGNO: Yes. One of the limitations on it would be budgetary in terms of whether it's considered legal. I want to point out that I just think the biggest issue to me is that the Democrats aren't listening to local law enforcement, and they are not listening to regular people. It's such a top-down discussion. And that is why there's such friction at the local community level that people are upset about.
Do you remember in February when -- the woman, Larson, was like brutally murdered by a six-time civil detainer request, illegal immigrant. He had a history of violent felonies, etcetera. It was -- you know, it's kind of one of those token case of which, unfortunately, there are a lot.
Point, guess what happened on Tuesday. The Santa Clara County administration voted overwhelmingly to soften the sanctuary policy because the point is those policies harm communities in multiple ways, including the immigrant community because it doesn't provide the clarity that they can use to understand how and when they can immigrate legally.
And so, in Santa Clara County they're basically -- they're voting to soften it. And, as they say, the immigration laws there are dysfunctional, everyone is confused. And as I always say, whose job is it then to clarify? Get to it, legislators. Instead of squawking about it, go do your job and clarify the policy, and then we can all survive.

WATTERS: All right, Greg.
GUTFELD: This headline from the Washington Post, White House want -- wanted border detainees released in sanctuary cities to target Trump foes, so even the media is portraying the very policies that they claim to love as punishment. I mean -- they're actually mad at Trump for giving them what they asked for. Let's say it's a stunt. Let's say it's a bad idea.
The fact is if you don't like having these released illegal immigrants there you have to explain why because this is your policy. You have created this problem. So, if Pelosi thinks it's a stunt -- don't say it's illegal, say why don't you want them there?
WATTERS: Well, that's a great thing. If you're a reporter in Washington, Pelosi gives her Thursday press conference. Why don't they ask Nancy Pelosi that?
PERINO: It's going to be a doozy next week. She's going to have a lot to answer for. There's going to be lots of things. A couple of things, first of all, I don't think that this policy, even if it's a stunt, let's say it's implemented. I don't think it stops the flow of migrants coming to the border.
WATTERS: No.
PERINO: Because they're like, oh, well, then maybe we get to go to San Francisco?

WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: We're being overwhelmed. We don't have enough resources, that's one thing. The other thing is it reminds me of bridge-gate, using your political levers in order to attack your political enemies. And, again, his -- I don't think that the president's base needs firing up.
I get that it's a great point like it does plays mind games with the Democrats. Like, really? Then what about you? What are you going to do? The other thing I would say is if the administration who denied this up until two hours before the president tweeted it and say it was going to happen, don't brainstorm in emails. Brainstorm in person, not in emails.
GUTFELD: I just think -- I don't think you can compare it to bridge-gate. I think that it was probably an idea that they put forth. But I do think it does make progress because you're going to force the Democrats to either embrace or deviate from a policy that they believe hypothetically. Make it a reality.
RIVERA: Why not get the Democrats to cooperate with you?
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: Let the president call -- I love the president, but he's tempestuous and he's thin-skinned. He should call up Chuck Schumer.
GUTFELD: Sounds familiar.
RIVERA: Call him up and say, hey, listen, dude. Let's do something before we're really in the heat of the presidential election. We've got a million people coming across the southern border. There is the crisis of which you spoke.
GUTFELD: OK. To that point, we've had two parties that never solved this problem because they never wanted to. This is --
RIVERA: Agreed.
GUTFELD: And Trump being essentially apolitical, let's face it. He was a Democrat for a long time. He's a Republican because it makes sense. He is the first person really to say let's try to solve it for good. He's being the adult in the room.
PERINO: I don't think that's fair. I think that there are -- definitely - - look, I worked for George W. Bush. He wanted to solve that problem. The deal that was on the table is the one that's probably going to be the one that is going to be solidified.
The people on the extremes, right and left, are the ones that don't want the deal, and that's what pulls people apart. I think President Trump could make this deal tomorrow.
RIVERA: And that's why George W. Bush got 44 percent of the Latino vote.
PERINO: That wasn't the reason why to do it. I mean, he wanted the border security, but --

The hunter though is becoming the hunted now as William Barr, the new attorney general declares he will investigate how this whole bogus thing got started.
You can imagine that does not sit well with those who cheered on the probe, that was apparent and the reaction to the attorney general's comments that the Trump campaign had indeed been spied on by the FBI.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The attorney general did exactly what President Trump wanted. He dodged questions, held a conspiracy theory, and like the president, lobbed baseless accusations.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: I really don't know what he's talking about when he talked about spying on the campaign. When I hear that kind of language used, it's concerning, because the FBI, the Department of Justice conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance.
I have never thought of that as spying. The Attorney General has come to the belief that that should be called spying. Wow, that's going to require a whole lot of conversations inside the Department of Justice.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
RIVERA: That's spying, yes it's spying.
(LAUGHTER)
You should know that the outgoing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has come to William Barr, his boss' - new boss' defense saying in a rare interview with The Wall Street Journal that it is "completely bizarre" that people think the Attorney General is trying to mislead the public.
They really are just worried in the media and in government, all these people that promoted this phony notion for over two years that they will be exposed and embarrassed, that they will be called out on it, don't you think?
WATTERS: More than just embarrassed, there's criminal referrals now being tossed around and I thought Juan was going to be here today--
(CROSSTALK)
(LAUGHTER)
--because all week Juan has been saying, Jesse, there was never spying, you are a liar, stop misleading the audience. And I printed out all of this mainstream media article, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Journal, all calling these people--
PERINO: National Review.
WATTERS: --National Review, FBI paid informants, secret surveillance. I mean all of this stuff, the media--
RIVERA: Wiretap.
WATTERS: --has been saying that they've been doing, and now the media does not even believe their own reporting.
RIVERA: I think that the cat is out of the bag. It will be very embarrassing. Emily, don't you think, here they have promoted the notion that our President was a traitor, that our President was a spy for the Russians, that he was an asset of Vladimir Putin.
Now they have to take it back, now they have to - I think be exposed in a way that would be extremely embarrassing, if not at risk of some jail time.
COMPAGNO: Yes, and what is difficult to reconcile to me too are these - you know members or former members of law enforcement of our country and of the DoJ, why wouldn't they be behind the process, why wouldn't Jim Comey, former director, say yes I support the notion that if there is concern that the government is overreaching in limits, if there is concern that there is - there are warrantless and unreasonable searches and seizures occurring, then yes I support an investigation into that.
I would think they would be and should be the model for not making conclusions before the entire investigation has been completed. But unfortunately, this type of hypocrisy we've seen the entire time.
RIVERA: Dana, it reminds me of someone like a trapeze artist who was swinging and they jumped for the other bar--
PERINO: And they miss it?
RIVERA: --the bar of collusion and it didn't exist.
PERINO: And there's no net.
RIVERA: And there's no net.
PERINO: And then--
GUTFELD: There is a net, it's called the media.
PERINO: Well, I was thinking that the media was included in that.
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: The media is definitely included, it's definitely included.
PERINO: I do wonder it for Rod Rosenstein, if he feels like he's checked into Hotel California, he wanted to resign two months ago and like now he's still there defending everyone.
RIVERA: I was very surprised that he came public. He didn't have to defend William Barr at this stage of--
PERINO: But I think that he is - I think that he's a true civil servant, does a good job, and I don't think he does it just out of loyalty, I think it does it on the merits.
RIVERA: Would you care, Greg, if it did not amount to criminal conduct but just was embarrassing to The New York Times. New York Times and Washington Post who won the Pulitzer Prize--
GUTFELD: Yes.
RIVERA: But they're reporting on this list. Are they going to give it back?
GUTFELD: I don't know.
(LAUGHTER)
I mean, obviously the real collusion was the media and the Democrats, let's - and by the way, have you noticed that Comey has become even more irritating.
RIVERA: Yes.
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: That was amazing. That sound on tape seems like it went on forever. You know what a great prank would be, never let this die down. We should now embrace the idea of Russian collusion just - and then start sending anonymous tips to CNN and say don't let it go, it's working really well for you, keep pushing it.
The funny thing is they have gone from accusing - I've said this before - they've gone from believing that there was a spy in the White House to arguing over the semantics of the word spy.
WATTERS: Right.
GUTFELD: That's how desperate. So my tip to the media is find a new story. There's some really exciting stuff out there, artificial intelligence, terror and technology, loss of privacy, I know but it doesn't sell. This is profit driven divisive media.
RIVERA: Should they be response - should they really be called out in a way that embarrasses them for wasting so much time.
GUTFELD: Talk about the most thin-skinned profession on earth will never happen.
PERINO: And also it is the profession that gives themselves more awards than Hollywood.
GUTFELD: Yes, it's true. Every day is the Oscars.
RIVERA: It's so intramural too. They give it to their buddies.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: They write for each other.
RIVERA: Well they do stories in order to impress their other peers, that's all it's about.
PERINO: Absolutely, and they tweet for each other too.
GUTFELD: Exactly.
RIVERA: Lori Loughlin reportedly defiant in the college admissions scandal. Chicago officially hits Jussie Smollett with a lawsuit for over $100,000. Michael Avenatti faces 335 years behind bars. Guess how many times he was on CNN? It's all in our legal roundup next.
PERINO: Listen to your song is, If I Had a Boat.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Twice a year, well that's good song for you, Emily.
COMPAGNO: Alright, updates in three legal stories we've been covering. First up Lori Loughlin reportedly thinks she did what any mother would have done in the college admissions scandal. Loughlin also doesn't believe she broke the law, even though she's facing 40 years in prison.
Now this is Massachusetts top federal prosecutor who says some of the other parents charged in the scheme are trying to get a new judge assigned to the case who would view them more favorably.
Right, Geraldo, let's start with you.
RIVERA: Well first of all, judge shopping, every good lawyer does it, and to think that you get the same justice from every judge is ridiculous, naive, and the voice of inexperience. The other thing I want to say is that the actress Lori Loughlin and the - you know I had many people, clients and the friends of clients, who when it comes time to justice to be meted out, and they really know now that they're facing actual time in prison, it's an awakening that has a real sobering effect on you.
Panic sets in, you'd never ever thought of yourself - I mean just think, two three months ago, she was on top of the world. She was doing these movies for The Hallmark Channel and everything else and had wonderful recognition.
GUTFELD: That's top of the world? Oh my God.
(LAUGHTER)
RIVERA: But I heard she was very good.
GUTFELD: Kill me.
RIVERA: She's very successful, don't be so stunned. She's very successful and suddenly her whole world has collapsed and her own children now look at her as the instruments of their own humiliation.
It is a horrible, horrible thing. I feel nothing but pitiful for her.
WATTERS: Yes, she was also on Full House, which is a pretty sitcom--
GUTFELD: From the Full House.
(CROSSTALK)
Such an old trike (ph) joke I couldn't resist.
WATTERS: Oh yes, I think I used that line in my weekend show.
(LAUGHTER)
(CROSSTALK)
Which we haven't filmed yet.
(LAUGHTER)
I like judge shopping, I like the concept of it, I like clothes shopping, I like all kinds of shopping. And I think lawyers have the right to do that. But I do think she's getting bad legal advice, because all the other people involved, they took the deal, she didn't, and her lawyer should have known better.
RIVERA: Maybe she wasn't offered a deal.
WATTERS: I think she--
RIVERA: Remember, she gave $500,000. Felicity gave $15,000.
WATTERS: That's true, but I think any good lawyer could have--
RIVERA: Come on.
WATTERS: --got her into that basket.
(LAUGHTER)
PERINO: I would say one thing important to remember, ignorance is not a defense, the truth is.
RIVERA: Nice.
PERINO: How about that?
COMPAGNO: All right, up next--
(LAUGHTER)
You said you didn't have any thoughts on it.
GUTFELD: Oh thanks Emily, now I know where you stand.
COMPAGNO: I'll come to you first with this, so Chicago making good on its promise to sue Jussie Smollett for more than $130,000. This comes after the actor refused to reimburse the city to cover the cost of investigating an attack that police say he orchestrated, and also he was indicted by a grand jury.
So, Greg, what are your thoughts?
GUTFELD: What did you just say?
(LAUGHTER)
Smollett is a joke, but I'm going to sound like a broken record. He only responded to what the media offered him. If you want to - if you want to move somewhere fast, there were two stories, what we're going to get to the Kavanaugh stuff.
The Kavanaugh smear helped Avenatti and the hate crime hoax helped Smollett. Smollett just figured out, you know I can be bigger than what I am. So I don't necessarily say it's entirely his fault. The media took this for everything and he knew he could get away with it, and he still might.
RIVERA: Oh I think that that is such a superficial analysis.
GUTFELD: Oh thank you, Geraldo.
RIVERA: I mean I really--
GUTFELD: Will you accuse somebody of superficiality?
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: Emmett Till came from Chicago. He was lynched for flirting with a white woman in Mississippi on vacation. This is a very serious thing. When a black man takes the history of this country and use it to his own benefit.
GUTFELD: Oh I'm not saying it's a joke.
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: This guy is - this is far more serious than these people trying to chisel their kids into college.
GUTFELD: I agree. That's why I have no comment.
(CROSSTALK)
(LAUGHTER)
COMPAGNO: Dana?
PERINO: Punished, I'm for punishment.
COMPAGNO: Jesse?
WATTERS: I think he should not have gone to Hawaii right now. I think that's really just thumbing his nose in the face of the police officers that spent a long time trying to track down the real perpetrators and now nothing.
GUTFELD: Maybe we'll find a lost tiki doll, when he's surfing.
(LAUGHTER)
COMPAGNO: All right, you guys, let's get this real fast.
GUTFELD: That's a Brady Bunch reference.
(LAUGHTER)
COMPAGNO: Finally, Michael Avenatti is facing 335 years in prison after being hit with 36 new federal charges for allegedly stealing millions from his clients, not paying taxes and committing bank fraud. Geraldo?
RIVERA: He is my least favorite public person on earth.
COMPAGNO: Wow.
RIVERA: I despise Michael Avenatti. And for me to say that, for me to go there, there's a lot of people I'm jumping over to get to Michael Avenatti, the single most obnoxious person.
(LAUGHTER)
COMPAGNO: Yes.
RIVERA: He leveraged his way to notoriety--
GUTFELD: Even more than Kilmeade?
RIVERA: --by exploiting Stormy Daniels.
(LAUGHTER)
I mean look, he used Stormy Daniels to pole-vault on to the media. Then he became a fixture, because he is articulate and charismatic in the cable news sense of the word. He got on television a lot.
CNN put him on 121 times, MSNBC put him on 108 times; I mean this is an exploiter, a bum. He really should be--
GUTFELD: Here's a question, CNN--
RIVERA: He stole money from disabled clients.
GUTFELD: CNN or don't go chase some lady who exchanged emails with a Russian bot, how come nobody is trying to find out where Julie Swetnick went? Where is Julie Swetnick?
I Google her name you know every week or so just to find out if she's been arrested or what is she doing. Is that weird?
RIVERA: Who is she again?
WATTERS: She was the face--
COMPAGNO: Kavanaugh.
WATTERS: Kavanaugh gang rape victim.
RIVERA: Oh my goodness.
COMPAGNO: That Michael Avenatti promoted.
RIVERA: Right.
WATTERS: That's right.
COMPAGNO: Last word on Avenatti?
WATTERS: I would just say that I have two shows on Fox and he's been on TV more than I have.
(LAUGHTER)
That's a lot.
COMPAGNO: All right, you guys, got to go. Fan Mail Friday is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: Well they didn't get the best part, which is, Here's a Quarter Call Someone Who Cares, live from Travis Tritt.
GUTFELD: Oh blaming the producers.
PERINO: Not really, no I love--
GUTFELD: Somebody's not coming to work on Monday.
All right, first question, Rita G. Name three things that are always by your bedside. Dana?
PERINO: Okay, well a book. Right now, I'm reading Shannon Bream's galley, it's called Finding the Bright Side, it's coming out.
I have eye drops, you know. I have aquifer (ph) but I also have some - I have - do you have the yoga toes?
COMPAGNO: Yes, I do.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: What are yoga toes?
COMPAGNO: They are - they are by the table by the TV, so I put them in when I'm watching, yes.
GUTFELD: What are yoga - you put them in between your toes?
COMPAGNO: Yes, but they're silicone, they feel really good and they stretch all your toes.
GUTFELD: That's just creepy.
COMPAGNO: If you wore heels, you would-
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I do and I don't need them. But I only wear heels on one night a week at a certain bar.
Jesse?
WATTERS: I have The Gutfeld Monologues; Liars, Leakers and Liberals.
GUTFELD: Liars, Liberals and Leakers.
WATTERS: And a phone charger.
GUTFELD: Phone charger. Geraldo?
RIVERA: The phone, because I have five kids and four grandkids, water and nose spray.
I would go on to other things, but I can only say them in certain states.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: Okay.
COMPAGNO: Oh wow.
GUTFELD: Emily, we know you have yoga whatevers.
COMPAGNO: No, those are in front of TV. So, yes I have books too and the one I'm reading right now is called Incendiary and it's about the mad bomber in New York in the 1950s, which is totally fascinating and (inaudible) it was over 15 years. And also the remote control for the window thing at the top, and then--
PERINO: Oh I have that too.
COMPAGNO: And an eye mask.
PERINO: Oh I have that too. Our beds are like the same.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: I would name three things, but I can't remember what their names are.
All right, what scared you as a child? This is from Derek L. Emily?
COMPAGNO: That my family would move, while I was at school. I had this weird fear and every day it was very - a very real fear and so every day I was like, will somebody come and pick me up or they moved when I was--
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Well, how long did this fear last?
COMPAGNO: I--
GUTFELD: Do you still have it?
(LAUGHTER)
COMPAGNO: No, I don't. Now everyone has cell phones, I can get hold of them.
PERINO: Wow.
GUTFELD: Geraldo?
RIVERA: Vampires.
GUTFELD: Vampires?
RIVERA: Vampires. You know, I'm a city kid, so when we went camping, I worried that the vampires would come get me, because you told ghost stories and--
GUTFELD: How ironic, you became a lawyer.
(LAUGHTER)
He joined the other side. Jesse?
WATTERS: I was afraid of Geraldo as a kid.
GUTFELD: Me too.
(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: Clowns and dogs.
GUTFELD: Clowns and dogs.
How about a very hairy clown, that must have been very scary, clown with a tail.
PERINO: And now you are not scared of dogs.
WATTERS: That's right, I got over that fear.
(LAUGHTER)
Well, I'm still terrified.
PERINO: The Wicked Witch of the West.
GUTFELD: Oh yes, everybody did.
PERINO: I had to go into my mom and dad's room, I couldn't take it.
GUTFELD: Yes, that was a frightening frightening movie, people forget about that.
You know what I'm scared, going to prison, because I grew up on--
WATTERS: For snoring?
GUTFELD: (LAUGHTER) I grew up a cop shows.
PERINO: You don't want to go to jail?
GUTFELD: So I was - I had the wrong sense of proportion on going to jail, because I watched Dragnet and Adam-12 and all those shows. So I thought that like everybody went to jail, everybody. And in every - in comedies, people were in prison.
WATTERS: Just Avenatti.
(LAUGHTER)
GUTFELD: Just Avenatti. All right, all right, all right, One More Thing is up next. What's the song?
(MUSIC)
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: John Denver, Rocky Mountain High. You liked it?
COMPAGNO: Love it.
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: He also did a concert.
PERINO: You like that song, right?
GUTFELD: What?
PERINO: Rocky Mountain High?
GUTFELD: I wasn't listening.
PERINO: That song, contemporary, Rocky Mountain High, I picked it just for you. Darn it, but anyway, we had country music today. And next week, we have a very exciting news. “The Five,” all of - we are going to Nashville. We will be live from the Wildhorse Saloon. John Rich will be joining us at the table. Also Kathie Lee Gifford joining us and we are going to have the best time. This is Tuesday, April 16 in Nashville. Tickets are not needed to attend. So, if you want to come see us, that is where we will be. Greg?
GUTFELD: Bring booze. All right. The Great Gutfeld Show, tomorrow night, 10 O'clock, great show. I've got Charlie here, Tom Shillue, Kat Timpf, Tyrus. That's Saturday, April 13, 10 PM. Be there or I will never speak to you again. I think I have time for this, don't I?
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Animals are grazing.
WATTERS: Yes, it has been a while.
GUTFELD: It has been a while. We haven't done this. Mule makes me happy.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Mule makes me happy. Two dogs having fun. Two dogs playing with a balloon
PERINO: Oh, great.
GUTFELD: Look at that. You know what's amazing? That balloon weighs 200 pounds and it--
PERINO: They are pretty good.
GUTFELD: Yes, they are pretty good. They are actually--
PERINO: Have fun.
GUTFELD: They're just little people dressed in dog outfits.
PERINO: Wow.
RIVERA: And they take turns.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: That is - really, yes.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Isn't that nice?
PERINO: Wow.
GUTFELD: You'd learn a lot from these two dogs.
PERINO: This is like congress should watch this.
RIVERA: Let's just keep watching this forever.
(CROSSTALK)
RIVERA: All right.
WATTERS: I can't stop watching this. All right.
PERINO: It's amazing. Do you want to do your little thing at the end?
WATTERS: Yes, that's good.
PERINO: Okay, Jesse.
WATTERS: I would like to wish my mother a very happy birthday.
PERINO: Happy birthday, mummy!
COMPAGNO: Happy birthday, Jesse's mom!
WATTERS: It is her birthday today. Dr. Watters, I should correctly address her.
PERINO: Yes.
WATTERS: She's in Maine today and I called her to say happy birthday, and she said she got the cable fixed on the TV and she said every station comes in clear except Fox News.
PERINO: Conspiracy.
WATTERS: And I - Yes, something I don't know what's going on there. But anyway--
GUTFELD: She should have been a marine biologist. Dr. Watters.
WATTERS: Dr. Watters. Someone in my family needed a degree. I wasn't getting one.
RIVERA: You didn't graduate?
WATTERS: Not with a PhD.
RIVERA: Oh there.
WATTERS: All right.
PERINO: All right.
WATTERS: Also my weekend show, 8 o'clock, we have Mike Rowe. I'm developing a man crush on him.
PERINO: Okay, he's great.
WATTERS: I love that guy. Also obviously, Diamond and Silk everybody. They are very mad at DL Hughley, he took a huge shot at them, and Candace Owens we have and Dan Crenshaw.
RIVERA: Terrific.
PERINO: Oh, that's a great show. All right. Emily?.
COMPAGNO: Okay. You guys check out this video where a heroic border collie dog dashes behind a moving car in order to save a Chihuahua.
(CROSSTALK)
COMPAGNO: Let's play that.
PERINO: Wait, what - how--
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: That really happened?
COMPAGNO: Literally.
PERINO: Awesome.
GUTFELD: Wow, that sounds staged.
(CROSSTALK)
COMPAGNO: They didn't know.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: Wow, Geraldo, you go.
RIVERA: I have to quick do this. I live in Cleveland, great town on the rebound. Cleveland Clinic, a tremendous asset. For the 17th year in a row, they did the Minority Men's Health Fair.
PERINO: Oh, cool.
RIVERA: It is free. You know, black and brown men suffer disproportionately from diseases like the diabetes, high blood pressure--
PERINO: Heart disease.
RIVERA: Cholesterol, heart disease, all of it. I was glad to work with Dr. Charles Modlin, the wonderful founder of the Minority Men's Health Fair.
PERINO: That's so cool.
RIVERA: My second year and I'll be there every year.
PERINO: Yes.
RIVERA: Going forward.
PERINO: All right. That's a great thing to do.
COMPAGNO: That's cool.
PERINO: All right. Well, we have had fun with music week. I think everybody had fun. I mean can't wait to be in Nashville next week. Hope you will join us there. That's it for us now. We will be back here on Monday as well, not just Tuesday. Have a great weekend.
