SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: I think we can agree on is we shouldn't shut the government down over a dispute. And you want to shut it down. You keep talking about it.

SCHUMER: OK, fair enough. We disagree. We disagree.

SCHUMER: This temper tantrum that he seems to throw will not get him his wall and it will hurt a lot of people because he will cause a shut down.
HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: We think we left it in a pretty good place. We gave him two possibilities. They said they would think about it.

BRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Welcome to divided government in 2019, Oval Office meeting between the Democratic leadership, the president there fighting for the border wall funding, later at another event said he was fine with that.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: I don't mind having the issue of border security on my side. If we have to close down the country over border security, I actually like that in terms of an issue but I don't want it to be an issue. I want it to be something that the country needs.  It's not really an issue. It's something the country needs. It's common sense.

BAIER: So where are we as a partial government shutdown looms 10 days from now? Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for "The Washington Times," A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at "National Review," Charlie, it was quite something to see, obviously, just the moment was quite something to see. But then the minority leader saying, you know what, get the cameras out of here, let's talk. And then the president turning and saying, Nancy, it's about transparency.
(LAUGHTER) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CHARLES HURT, WASHINGTON TIMES: That's one of the things I'll never understand, a complaint that I'll never understand in this era of Trump. I would think that at the very least people who don't like Trump and don't like the stuff that he says would at least applaud the fact that he is, shall we say, transparent. He doesn't mind having the press in these meetings.
But you got two people here in Pelosi and Schumer who have 60, 65 years of political experience on the guys. This guy is a complete novice. And what we saw in that 15 minutes in the Oval Office was him completely getting them -- playing rope-a-dope with them so that they are playing 100 percent his game. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He is right, on the issue of border security, Republicans win that fight, Trump wins that fight. In fact, it's what got him elected. But there are a couple things that Chuck Schumer said in particular that I thought were fairly amazing. One is the line about election matter. I guess elections matter except 2016 when Trump won. And then also he says this having just lost two seats, a pretty historical difficult thing to do. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BAIER: But then kind of blows it off. North Dakota and Indiana, who cares about that?
HURT: That was the most astonishing thing out of it to me, the idea that he would say that when the president brings up North Dakota and Indiana he's in big trouble, completely dismissing two very important entire regions of the country. I thought that he will live to regret that remark. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BAIER: A.B., Democrats seemed to be happy with the fact that they had the president on camera, on tape saying I will own it. If it shuts down, I will own it. But negotiations are continuing. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });

        }
      
A.B. STODDARD, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: And to Charlie Hurt, it's a rope-a-dope. Look, Republicans have dreaded this moment for months, and they don't want a government shutdown. Yes, the Democrats did this last year and they regretted it very quickly. As the president pointed out, they opened it right back up. Government shutdowns are a loser particularly when you proclaim that you want one and you are the architect of the shutdown. You will get blamed.
Republicans still have a majority in the Senate and the House. They don't want to shut the government down on their watch. The Democrats like Nancy Pelosi are saying you guys have the votes, you guys fund the government.  You're right, it's a partial shutdown. It's only five agencies left, about 20 percent of the discretionary spending, but it still is a political loser to shut the government down and jump up and down smiling about it.
It doesn't matter that border security is not a potent issue. It is. The wall is a popular policy idea among Republicans. But shutting the government down is never a good idea, so Republicans like Mitch McConnell had to come out and clean up and say I don't know what happened with that contentious meeting, but we don't want to shut the government down.

        }
      
GOLDBERG: And it's going to get worse. I agree with some of the things Charlie said about transparency and all that, but the idea that this was 100 percent Trumps game and rope-a-dope, Republicans on the Hill were calling it the Schumer shutdown right before this meeting. They can't call it Schumer shutdown anymore. I think at minimum the Democrats, they can overplay their hand, they get strategy wrong all the time. But they went in hoping to get what they got today.
BAIER: Right, but for the base, Charlie, the president, this is probably his last chance to stand up and say I want this wall funding. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HURT: So obviously it's very good, this is an important issue for the base. But if you move away from the word "wall" and start talking about border security, which is kind of the thing that's being debated here, that's far more widely popular beyond just the Republican base. That is where you start eating into a lot of Democratic support. And when you have people in the party who are legitimately in favor of sanctuary cities and legitimately opposed to any kind of border security, that's a winner for Republicans.
I also think we should be careful overstating how damaging a shutdown is.  Obviously, it's very disruptive around here. But remember the last time Republicans got blamed for a shutdown, they went on to win historic, in 2012, went on to win historic margins in the House. So I think that we get really upset about this sort of thing because it's so unusual, but I don't think that beyond here it makes quite as big a difference.
