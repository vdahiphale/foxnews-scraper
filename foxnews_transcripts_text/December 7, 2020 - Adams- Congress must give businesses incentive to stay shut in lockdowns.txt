MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: One day closer indeed. Good to have youback, Bret. So, good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York.And this is THE STORY.So, you remember during the election, Democrats accusingly pointed to theother side. They blamed them for ignoring the scientists. They said if JoeBiden were elected, he would listen to the scientists. Yet the president-elect is appearing to break with that theme. He named Xavier Becerra tolead the Department of Health and Human Services. Becerra has no medicalbackground. He is a highly partisan Democrat politician and lawyer chosendespite the fact that Biden was urged by medical groups across the nationto choose someone with a medical resume.And still, the arguments to follow the science continue day-after-day as ajustification for shutting down schools and churches and now even outdoordining. As if labeling it, science should convince us that we should stopasking questions about what makes the most scientific sense.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY): And we have been religious about following thedata and the science.BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: It has served us well in terms ofthe focus on data and science leading us to decisions.GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-MI): This is how COVID-19 spreads. The science ofthe virus, and that's why we've got to limit indoor gatherings.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: But if it is truly the science, why have so many of the rulemakers been exposed as rulebreakers? Listen closely to Admiral Giroir ofthe COVID Task Force when he was asked about this morning about theserecent bans, which include indoor - outdoor, I should say, outdoor, in thetents with the open sides, dining. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ADMIRAL BRETT GIROIR, WHITE HOUSE COVID-19 TESTING CZAR: The science doesnot say that in all of us on the task force. Dr. Fauci. Birx, Redfield,Hahn, we all - Dr. Adams, the surgeon general, is that we do, if you're ina surge place, need to limit indoor dining and indoor bars, you don't haveto close schools. You don't have to close universities. You don't have toclose your major industries.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: You heard what he said. So, Americans have been incrediblypatient throughout the nearly 10 long months of this pandemic. But thatpatience is wearing thin as much of the latest set of lockdowns isbeginning to appear arbitrary with regard to the science.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANGELA MARSDEN, CA BUSINESS OWNER: I have had enough. They have not givenus money and they have shut us down. We cannot survive. My staff cannotsurvive.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are here because of Cuomo and de Blasio trying tocrush the little man who dare to speak up.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not going to back down to tyranny. It's not -that's not what I'm going to do. And I'm not going to teach my daughtersthat that's OK.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our government leaders have abandoned me.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you the owner?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: $4 trillion of stimulus money and gave it to who?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you want to tell other restaurant owners who--UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wake up, stand up. This is America. Be free.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: All right. We begin tonight with Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky,a longtime critic of many of these lockdown measures. Senator, great tohave you here this evening.SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM: You hear the desperation in these people's voices. What wouldyou say to them tonight?PAUL: Without question, this virus has been devastating to so manyfamilies. Kelly and I lost a good friend today, and we're grieving fromthem and our prayers go out to their family. But the thing is, is we oughtto at least still use logic to try to figure out how we stop this. I thinkultimately the vaccine will be very successful, but I don't see anyevidence that crowd control, hand washing, standing six feet apart. Allthese things they tell you to do, closing down the restaurants, closingdown the schools, there's no real evidence that they're changing thetrajectory of the disease.If you look at the incidence of COVID, it's going up like this, it's goingup exponentially despite all the mandates. So, those who say there isscience just aren't paying attention to it.Look, this isn't a lack of compassion. I want people to get the vaccine. Iwant them to be able to avoid this scourge. But at the same time, keepingall our kids' home isn't changing the course of this disease. They'vestudied this in four different country-wide studies. They've studied theincidence of the disease. They've studied the transference of the disease,and they've found that closing schools doesn't work.Even the socialist de Blasio is now opening schools. So, now we have ourgovernor in our state closing schools right about the time that everybodyelse is finally accepting that closing schools isn't working.MACCALLUM: Yes. I want to ask you a little bit more about that in a moment.But I do want to ask you about the stimulus, because that is obviously sucha painful part of this as well. Just the financial burden. As you heardfrom Angela Marsden and the others in that video, there's $455 billion ofthe already allocated stimulus that has gone unspent. I know you haveconcerns about that and also about some of where this money has gone.PAUL: I think the most important thing is if you want to get people back towork, you can't pay them more not to work than they get for working. Rightnow, there's about three and a half million jobs that would be filledimmediately if you weren't paying people more not to work. So, it's sort ofthis big heart, small brain syndrome.People say, I want to give people money, they're out of work. But if yougive them more than they normally made by working, they'll continue, theyinstitutionalize unemployment. So, it's a big mistake to continueunemployment above the normal level.What I would have done all along throughout this is I would have extendedunemployment, but I wouldn't have given additional money to thoseunemployed because it serves as a disincentive to people getting back towork. So, more stimulus is just more borrowed money and not good for thecountry.Right now, you look at the GDP for the last quarter, going up at 11percent. You look at unemployment at six percent. I saw a statistic todaythat said we had growth numbers in the job numbers, this last set of jobnumbers, private job numbers that were better than 95 out of 96 months ofPresident Obama's term.So, we really should be looking at this in a rational way and not saying,oh, let's just print more money and borrow more money. We're getting out ofthis. And as soon as we get the vaccine, we're going to get out of this ina rapid fashion. And all I would say to government officials is, let's getthe vaccine out as soon as we can.MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean, let's hope because as you say, you lost someone.There are people all across this country who have lost people that theylove. It's a serious disease. I keep going back in my mind to what you saidin the beginning. You see that line that's going straight up, and you seeacross the country, everywhere I go, people wear masks more now than theyever did in the earlier stages of this. And it just raises the big curiousquestion about how much we still don't know about this awful virus, doctor,and Senator.PAUL: And I think one of the things that the Supreme Court got right whenthey made the ruling right before Thanksgiving. They said even during apandemic, the Constitution isn't to be put away and forgotten. The FirstAmendment and the thing is, is it's not that I'm telling everyone to go tochurch. I think there are some people in our society where there aredangers to go and sit in church for two hours.If you're in your mid-80s and you're listening to this, I'm notrecommending it. But I'm also telling you that the government shouldn'ttell you, you can't go to church and the government shouldn't tell you, youcan't send your kids to a religious school. Doesn't mean it's alwaysadvisable. With schooling. I think it is.Opening the schools is advisable. And the government, Governor Beshear, inmy state interfering with this is an interference of the First Amendment. Ithink the Supreme Court is going to strike him down very quickly or they'regoing to send it back and say, hey, look, we already ruled on this just atThanksgiving that you can't infringe the First Amendment.But there's good advice and you can take advice and you can give advice.But once you mandate it, it doesn't become advice. It becomes a form oftyranny. So, I think the government should not be in the form of mandatingthese things because sometimes the science isn't clear and sometimes, theychange their mind on the science month-to-month and week-to-week.MACCALLUM: Xavier Becerra, his selection as the head of Health and HumanServices. What do you think about that, Senator?PAUL: I'm concerned about the reports that say that he's been a championfor late term abortion and at the time of birth abortion, and that'soutside the norm. Even pro-choice people a lot of times will say theybelieve in some restrictions, but to believe in sort of complete unlimitedabortion until the time of birth or after, I think is something that's avery radical position. And I would hate to have him in-charge of trying todispense government moneys towards that kind of policy.So, we'll look long and hard and I'll try to keep an open mind. But myfirst impression of what I'm hearing about him is that he may be wayoutside the mainstream of what anybody in Kentucky would think is right.MACCALLUM: Just back for a moment to the loss of learning in schools. Veryinteresting piece today in The Washington Post. A Lost Generation is thetitle. Surge of research reveals that students are sliding backward. Themost vulnerable are the worst affected. I think we're going to be feelingthe pains of this in our society for a very, very long time. All of thesekids at home in front of computers, if they're lucky enough to have one,it's devastating.PAUL: This education gap and there's always been an education gap out therebased on poverty and lack of education among the parents. But now it'scompounded because the kids had a chance, they had an escape. They got togo to a school and some of them discover the wonders of learning. And someof them went on to be a Ph.D. and scientists, they're not going to get thatif they're at home and they're in a dysfunctional place where their parentsare not capable of teaching them.So, really, this should be a strong message to teachers that we appreciateyou and we think you do a good job. But instead, so many of the teacher'sunions have react and said, hey, no, not me. But the evidence is teachersare not dying from this. Kids are not trained--MACCALLUM: My goodness.PAUL: And it isn't an increased danger.MACCALLUM: It's good news and it should be embraced as such. We're - in asecond. I'm going to talk to the surgeon general about the vaccines andother issues, but before I'll let you go, I want to ask you your thoughts.There was a debate last night between Senator Loeffler and Raphael Warnock,the reverend in Georgia. Your thoughts on this very important race comingup.PAUL: I watched the entire debate, and I came away thinking, my goodness,that Raphael Warnock must be a radical liberal. But that point aside, Ithink there was a distinction and he really can't escape all of his paststatements about either defunding the police or that you can't serve God inthe military. And I think these are statements that do put him out of themainstream. And I think I met my wife in Georgia. I worked as an E.R.doctor in Georgia.I know what Georgians are like. And I just don't know if they're going towant somebody so far out the mainstream, somebody who actually has used theBible to justify abortion. I don't know what part of Bible that he'sreading, but a lot of that is really outside the mainstream of people wholive in Georgia.MACCALLUM: Senator Paul, thank you. Always good to see you. Joining me, aspromised, Dr. Jerome Adams, the U.S. Surgeon General. Dr. Adams, very goodto have you here. Thanks for being here. We played some sound earlier froma California restauranteur who's getting a ton of attention because I thinkshe has tapped into how so many people across the country are feeling whoare watching their businesses close. They're watching the people who workfor them get into desperate situations. Here is a bit of the interview thatshe did earlier with Neil Cavuto. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARSDEN: You guys knew in March, so open up the empty hospitals, bring theship, get space for the ICU beds, but you can't crush people, the averageperson. I had a homeless man jump through my window (ph).UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, man.MARSDEN: I know a bartender whose son was just robbed in their front yardby gunpoint. People are desperate and it is very, very, very serious.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, Dr. Adams, how do you address that part of the nation'shealth crisis that's also going on right now?DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Well, it's an incredibly importantaspect of this crisis that I've brought up even before COVID. We call itthe social determinants of health. If people can't support themselves,they're not going to be healthy, regardless of what else is going on aroundthem. And we really need to make sure when we ask people to stay at home,when we ask people to close down places for the sake of the virus, that weare doing it for a short amount of time as possible. We're doing it basedon the science and that we are providing them the supports that they needso that they can comply.And that's what you're seeing fail right now. And I feel for her and I wanther to know that number one, we are providing extra support for overwhelmedhospitals. We've got 20,000 people deployed. We're helping stand upalternate care facilities, but we're still facing an incredible surge. Andwe need people to hang on a little bit longer. But we also need states andCongress to really support these restauranteurs, these other people outthere so they can do the right thing.MACCALLUM: Should the task force be giving more guidance to the country onwho needs to shelter in place and who doesn't and businesses that can stayopen. This debate over people who are eating outside now that is being shutdown. These restaurant owners and these businesses across the country havespent so much of their own money building these tents and outdoorplatforms. I mean, it's at a breaking point for so many of them. So many ofthese businesses may never recover. Should the federal government taking abigger role in how these states should be doling out these restrictions?ADAMS: You ask a wonderful question, and it's one that we tackled at thetask force today. I just left our task force meeting, and we talked a lotabout putting out better guidance, improved guidance based on what we nowknow about the virus and you and Senator Paul talked about it. We know thatit is safe to keep schools open in general when you take precautions. Weknow that outside is better than inside and that if you close down people'sability to congregate in an outdoor area, they're just going to run inside,and the virus will spread.So, I think we need to be more intelligent, more strategic about some ofthese closures. And we're going to try to give states and healthdepartments better advice. But to the people out there, I would say youstill have to comply. You've still got to use common sense. If you have 20people outside of your household gathering together outside, that's stillgoing to be higher risk than if you're with people just within yourhousehold. So, it's got to be a give and take. But we're near the finishline. Vaccines are coming in the next week--MACCALLUM: That's what we keep hearing.ADAMS: I think.MACCALLUM: All right. With regard to that, there was a really interestingCDC study that showed that based on blood tests, that people who gave bloodin back in December, that something like 53 million Americans, if youextrapolate the number from the ones who were positive from those bloodtests in December likely already had the virus.Now we're at, I think, 7 million something in that neighborhood in terms ofcases. So, if 53 million people already had the virus, how do you identifythem and then work on the ones who haven't had it to get the vaccine tothem first? Wouldn't that make sense?ADAMS: Well, great question. And again, it's another one. It's like youwere at the task force meeting, Martha.MACCALLUM: Oh, good.ADAMS: We talked about this. Right now, we don't know. Well, right now wedon't know how long people's antibodies are going to last. And we know thatin the studies they vaccinated people who did have antibodies. And so, itis not going to harm you based on what we know about the vaccines. Ifyou've had the virus and you get vaccinated again.We're going to still encourage people at this point to get vaccinated ifyou've had the virus, starting with the most vulnerable people in long-termcare facilities and nursing homes. But I want to hit on a point you justbrought up, at least 10 million people, probably more in this countrywho've been exposed to the virus. And there's something that you can do.Convalescent plasma is a treatment out there that has potential to reallyhelp individuals recover if they've gotten COVID, particularly in thissurge. So, I want to go to the fight is in us dot org if you've recovered fromCOVID, because you could save a life right now, we want to get through--MACCALLUM: That's such an important point. Yes.ADAMS: To this virus - to this vaccine.MACCALLUM: Losing 2000 people a day in some of the recent days that we'vegone through. It's just extraordinary and awful. Dr. Adams, thank you.Great to have you here tonight.ADAMS: Hey, did you get your flu shot, Martha? Because we need everyone todo it.MACCALLUM: I did.ADAMS: It's Natural Immunization Week.MACCALLUM: Yes., and I made sure my whole family got it too. So, yes.ADAMS: One thing we can all do.MACCALLUM: Yes, absolutely. Everybody should get their flu shot. Dr. Adams,thank you. Good to see you tonight.ADAMS: Thank you. Hang in there. We'll get there together.MACCALLUM: All right. We will. Thank you, sir. So, coming up next, howStacey Abrams and other Democratic groups successfully lowered the bar inGeorgia on what constitutes legal ballot. This is the heart of the issuethat you should learn more about. Karl Rove on whether the GOP has enoughfirepower to prevent a repeat of what happened in November. Coming up next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: You must govote and vote early starting December 14th. You have to do it. They cheatedand they rigged our presidential election.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: This election was rigged, and we can't let it happen to two of thegreatest, most respected people in Washington. We can't let it happenagain. And for whatever reason, your secretary of state and your governorare afraid of Stacey Abrams. They're afraid of her. So, we know theDemocrats are planning to cheat and we can't let them do it again.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So that was Saturday night, President Trump in Valdosta,Georgia, he is in his campaigner in chief mode. When he was there, he wasobviously campaigning for Senators Loeffler and Perdue. Stacey Abrams andother Democrat groups successfully lowered the bar in Georgia on whatconstitutes an allowable legal ballot. Many that were allowed through inthe presidential election would likely have been rejected in priorelections for things like a lack of signature or a weak signature match.But a lawsuit from Democrats prompted a big change, and it was made rightbefore the presidential election.As the Atlanta Journal Constitution noted back in March, voters must bequickly notified when election officials reject their absentee ballots,allowing them time to correct problems and have their ballots counted,which is known as curing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: I believe that the election process isa mess. I really wish the governor to call a special session to clean it upand the Republicans simply have to turn out more votes than Stacey Abramscan steal.In 2018, 3.5 percent of the absentee ballots were thrown out. This year was0.3 of 1 percent. The agreement, the secretary of state made with StaceyAbrams, was crazy.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Joining me now, Karl Rove, former Deputy Chief of Staff toPresident George W. Bush. Byron York, Chief Political Correspondent for TheWashington Examiner, and Richard Fowler, Senior Fellow at the New LeadersCouncil. All are Fox News Contributors. Gentlemen, welcome. Thanks forbeing here.I think that, a lot of people who have watched this closely over the lastfew weeks are getting around to the realization that so much of what wasdifferent this time obviously stemmed from the mail-in-voting, which wascompletely unprecedented. We never dealt with anything like this in ourcountry and also a lot of rules that were changed in the weeks and monthsleading up to the election in terms of what made a ballot allowable andwhat made a ballot disallowed.And most of us, we got our mail-in-ballot really carefully, we've got tosign on one side, you've got to sign the other. You have to make sure thatyou check all of the boxes on the back in order for it to count. Karl, whenyou listen to those strong words from Newt Gingrich, is he right? Do youagree?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, I'm involved in thisraising money for the Georgia Battleground.MACCALLUM: Yes, you are. Thank you.ROVE: Fund to help candidates. But yes, there are lots of things that needto be clarified. State law requires that the signature on your ballotmatched the signature on your registration card and the consent decree gavethe ability to match it to any signature that you might have on file.That's in violation of the state law. There's a requirement that theseboxes at which you can. 800 of them, I believe the number is, where you candrop off your ballot.Well, there's video on those boxes, but in order for that video to matter,the campaigns have to have ready and available access to it in real-time,it needs to be live streamed or made available to them so that they canmonitor those boxes.And if those boxes, if something - some shenanigan goes on, there's noballot harvesting allowed in Georgia. So, if somebody shows up and shoves abunch of ballots in there, there has to be a way to take those ballots,segment them and put them aside, make the extra checks and go after whoeverharvested those ballots and dropped them in there.And if the camera goes down, put those ballots that are accepted in thatbox during the period that the cameras down, need to be segregated. Andagain, they need to be carefully looked at to make certain that they'relegal. But, yes, there are lots of things that have to be resolved andguidance has to be uniform. Lots of counties in Georgia do match thesignature on the ballot to the signature on the registration card. Butother counties had decided that they were going to do something else. Sothere needs to be a uniform standard. Otherwise, we're violating the 14thAmendment.MACCALLUM: Yes. And Richard, that's the law that there's no ballotharvesting in Georgia. So, it does seem very important that if one personis putting in more than one ballot in a box, that would be something thatwould need to be double checked. Right. So, the laws have been loosened tothe point where there's a lot of questions. And I think it ends up hurtingboth sides of the equation down the road at some point, doesn't it behooveus to make sure that these things are fixed?RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Listen, I think we can do everythingin our power to make sure that every American has a chance to cast theirballot, we have to also acknowledge that we're voting during a globalpandemic and during that pandemic, there's a lot of Americans who might notbe able to drop their ballot off. How about if you're an immunocompromised89-year0old and you can't leave your home, you need to drop your ballotoff, and we've got to do everything in our power--ROVE: Richard, you can mail in your ballot--FOWLER: I did not interrupt you, Karl. I did not interrupt you.MACCALLUM: And it's a valid point, Richard. I mean, so what - tell meanother person who wouldn't be able to mail the ballot. I mean, whatpossible circumstance would you be in that you couldn't individually mailyour ballot from your house and put it in the post - in the mailbox?FOWLER: You absolutely can mail your ballot. But once again, what Karl wastrying to point out and what the president has tried to do over the pastcouple of months is sort of disparage the Georgia voting system. But afterthree and four recounts, what we found here is that there is no voterfraud, no voter fraud has been done. No voters took advantage of thesystem. And the system worked exactly as it should work. And as a result,Joe Biden won this election.And while Republicans have a voter registration advantage in Georgia, thereason why Joe Biden won this election, the reason why Raphael Warnock andJon Ossoff have a chance to win this election is because of the work ofblack women in the state of Georgia, like Stacey Abrams, like Keisha LanceBottoms, who are working to register voters and working to energize AfricanAmericans in the Atlanta suburbs to turn out and vote. And that's what'sgoing to happen on January 5th.Once again, these women are going to mobilize voters and they're going tooust the Republicans--MACCALLUM: I mean everybody agrees that mobilizing voters is an absolutelyAmerican thing to do. But the question is whether or not there is anythinghappening that shouldn't be happening, because that's also a very Americanquestion. Karl - quick thought from Karl, and then I want to get Byron inhere, because I know you've got something to say.ROVE: Talking about voter registration. A New York Times columnist saidviolate the law by moving to Georgia, registering to vote, vote for the twoGeorgia Democrats and then go back home. Andrew Yang said, I'm going to goto Georgia and register. Georgia law requires that any voter has to have a--FOWLER: Those are opinions, Karl.ROVE: He has to have the intention of being a permanent resident of thestate. And if you go there just to vote in the election, it's a violation,a felony violation. So, we've got to have some protections on that.FOWLER: Of course, but those who are just opinion authors making a point.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Let's make a 100 percent sure, Richard.(CROSSTALK)ROVE: Additional candidates saying, I'm going to violate the law bycommitting a felony. We don't need to worry--FOWLER: This is a Republican secretary of state, Republican governor--MACCALLUM: Presidential candidate.ROVE: Don't need to worry about those people.(CROSSTALK)MACCALLUM: Sorry, guys. I'm going to let - let me get Byron in here, Byron,you're covering this Georgia election as well. There was a lot ofdiscussion about President Trump's appearance on Saturday night. Was hejust talking about his own election or was he really helping these twocandidates? What do you say?BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, we heard the story going in, whichwas the president would go down there, he would rant about the presidentialelection, he would undermine the candidacies of David Perdue and KellyLoeffler. And actually, he didn't so much. He did, of course, talk aboutthe presidential election because that's what he does. But he spent anenormous amount of time talking about the election and urging Georgians toget out and vote. He said it over and over and over again.There was a huge sign in back of him that said, request your absenteeballot right now. He talked about urged people to get mail-in-ballots andto mail them in immediately. And also, there are a couple of lawyers,Sidney Powell, and Lin Wood, who have filed lawsuits on behalf of Trump,but have also urged Georgia voters not to vote in the runoff because theysay it won't be secure. And President Trump very specifically said, no, no,no, do not do that. You have to vote. So, I think that he really didproduce for Loeffler and Perdue in this visit.MACCALLUM (on camera):  And he was so emphatic about that he is actuallygoing to go back and do it again, as being reported tonight that he willhead back to Georgia to continue to try to make that point.So, Karl, there's a news story that GOP lawmakers in Georgia are proposingrule changes before January 5th, that would require a photo I.D. forballots cast by mail. And Democrats are pushing back against that. I'm noteven sure how that would work exactly, but is that going to be a reality?KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think that's going to bedifficult to do, because, you know, one of the things we learned in Bush v.Gore, was that you have to have -- operate under the rules in effect whenpeople vote and we are already voting in Georgia. People are, you know,voting by mail. Next Monday they'll start voting in person and so I thinkthat's going to be difficult to do to change the rules.I do think though that new uniform guidance from the state board ofelections on what is acceptable behavior by each of the 159 counties is away to get some of these things resolved and my understanding is theRepublican effort is aimed at doing exactly that, because differentcounties interpret things and do things in a different way. And that reallyis raising a 14th amendment issue of equitable treatment of people indifferent counties, so state board of elections resolving whatever issueswhich there is already statutory authority for them to act is probably abetter way to go.MACCALLUM:  Richard, let me ask you the last question because I'm about togo to Ken Starr here. Raphael Warnock -- raphael Warnock, excuse me,basically said that he would be -- he wouldn't really give his answer onwhether or not he would vote for court packing if he's a senator. Do youthink that's a problematic moment for him?RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  No, not at all because I think thevoters in Georgia are more concerned of their top issue as COVID-19, sohe's going to continue to focus on that and I don't think court packing isgoing to come up anytime in the near future because we really don't knowthe balance of the Senate quite yet. So, I think his answer was fair and itwas the right answer.MACCALLUM:  All right. We got to leave it there. Thank you very much, ByronYork and Richard Fowler and Karl Rove. Good to see all of you tonight.Thank you.ROVE:  Thank you.MACCALLUM:  So, joining me now is judge Ken Starr, former independentcounsel under President Clinton and former solicitor general. Ken, good tohave you here this evening.KEN STARR, WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL:  Thank you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  You know, these issues of the changing rules, and we are goingto talk about Pennsylvania in the next segment but I want to stay withGeorgia here. Because there were a lot of rules that were pushed through asa consent decree and you hear what Karl just said. Now you've got thisthing that -- you know, some of us looked ahead and said maybe it comesdown to a runoff in Georgia, but not enough time now. People are alreadyvoting there.So, do you -- are you concerned that the changes that took place in Georgiaare not going to be recoverable before January 5th? It doesn't look likethey are.STARR:  Yes, it's a real danger. And we certainly have learned a lesson,haven't we? These actions on the part of state officials, the secretary ofstate or whomever, we can go from state to state, making these changes,agreeing to changes and the like were violating the Constitution of theUnited States. They were usurping power. That's a strong way of putting it,but it's absolutely true.So, whether they were intoxicated with power or whether it was simplyignorant of the limitations imposed by the Constitution of the UnitedStates, all these changes were made.I'm so glad you pointed to the flood tide of mail-in ballots. Forty-onepercent of the American people voted mail-in. And yet what we are seeing instate after state is the rejection rate and everyone should have the rightto vote, but they have to vote lawfully. The rejection rate absolutelycollapsed to a minuscule level and so that is extremely problematic interms of the confidence of the American people should have in the resultsin state after state.MACCALLUM:  So, when people say -- you know, when you listen to theelection officials that say, you know, everything adds up. You know, youheard Richard Fowler, they went back and they looked and they matched allthe signatures and everything matched up, so in the recount, in his mind,proved that there was no problem, but it appears that what happens happenedbefore that, before we even got to that point. What's your interpretationof that?STARR:  Yes. My interpretation is too little, too late and again, I thinkthis rejection rate falling basically to zero tells you that something wentawry. Whether it was fraud, whether it was error, whatever, it justsuggests strongly that if history is a guide, and history is a pretty goodguide, some balance went through and many ballots went through that weredisqualified for one reason or another.It's not too much to ask to say this is a matter of state law, obey thatlaw and then your vote will be counted. If you don't obey state law, thenyour vote should not be counted.MACCALLUM:  I want to play the sound bite from last night from RaphaelWarnock. Let's play that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA), U.S. SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  People aren't asking meabout the courts and whether we should expand the courts. I know that's aninteresting question for people inside the beltway to discuss, but they arewondering when in the world are they going to get some COVID-19 relief.I'm really not focused on it. And I think that too often the politics inWashington has been about the politicians. I'm a pastor.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  Ken, we heard, you know, back and forth during thepresidential debate between President Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden wouldalso not answer that question. And it's a really important question tovoters.STARR:  It's huge. This is a dereliction of duty, with all due respect tothe good reverend. He is a candidate. He needs to answer these seriousquestions that have been put into the public debate. To try to mess withthe court structure after over 100 years of stability, the functionality ofthe Supreme Court I think is simply wrong on his part. He's hiding behindCOVID-19 to just avoid a very important and basic question to the structureof our Constitution.MACCALLUM:  Ken Starr, thank you very much. A lot of questions about all ofthis still. And Georgia is not the only state that pushed through theselast-minute rule changes before the presidential election. Listen to MarkLevin on how he explains what happened to these rules in Pennsylvania.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST:  Few months before the election, they said yes,no signatures required. You don't need signature comparison. You don't needa postal date and if the postal date is smudged, you're going to count itanyway.And yes, even though election day ends on Tuesday at 8 p.m. Eastern Time,we're going to extend it to 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday. They had nolegal or constitutional basis for doing any of that. So, they violatedarticle two, section one, clause two of the United States Constitution,which leaves the power to the state legislature to make the election.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (voice over):  So, it's up to the state legislature to makedecisions on voting, not the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, so howdid they get away with making all of those decisions and why isn't theSupreme Court going to pick this up? Congressman Jim Jordan next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM (voice over):  Changes, rules, court cases that all happened inthe weeks before the election, also a big focus in the swing state ofPennsylvania. At the center of an election case before the United StatesSupreme Court, Republican officials believe that there were more than 2.5million mail-in ballots that they say did not meet the standard of acompleted ballot.Now Justice Alito has weighed in on this. He has set a deadline of tomorrowfor Pennsylvania election officials to respond to the request.Here's Life, Liberty and Levin host Mark Levin laying out exactly whathappened in Pennsylvania. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LEVIN:  Fourteen months ago, in the state of Pennsylvania, if you had votedby mail-in ballot, it would have been discarded. If that mail-in ballot hadbeen counted, that would have been fraud. Fourteen months ago, in the stateof Pennsylvania, if you sent in a ballot without a signature, that ballotwould be discarded. If it was counted, that would be criminal fraud.Fourteen months ago, in the state of Pennsylvania, if you sent in a ballotwith a signature that didn't match your signature that they had on file,that would be discarded. If it was counted, that would be criminal fraud.Fourteen months ago, in the state of Pennsylvania if you sent in a ballotbeyond election day, it wouldn't be counted and if it was, that would befraud. If you sent in a ballot without a postal stamp date on it, it wouldwouldn't be counted and if it was, that would be fraud. Or if you sent in aballot where they couldn't tell what the date was because maybe there was asmudge on the ink, it wouldn't be counted. If it was counted, that wasfraud.All of those ballots today count. They were all counted in Pennsylvania.Because of unconstitutional and illegal changes that were made by officialsand made, quote, unquote, "officially" by individuals in Pennsylvania.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera):  All right. So, joining me now, Ohio RepublicanCongressman Jim Jordan. Congressman, good to have you here today.REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  Good to be with you, Martha.MACCALLUM:  I mean, it is so mind-boggling when you look back.JORDAN:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  It used to be that the bar was so high to be approved for anabsentee ballot, you had to apply in advance, you had to give your reasonfor why you weren't going to be able to walk into a voting booth that day --JORDAN:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  -- and then you would be given permission to receive anabsentee ballot. Now we all get that COVID-19 changed a lot of things inthe country this year, but to lower the barrier in the ways that Mark Levindescribes I just think makes it also crystal clear.JORDAN:  Yes, and it's even worse because in some counties, voters wereallowed to cure their ballots, fix their ballots in other counties theyweren't. In some counties they allowed pre-canvassing in other countiesthey didn't. In some counties they set up temporary satellite offices wherepeople could vote and other, they didn't.And you can imagine which counties did this, it's the Democrat-runcounties. So, you add everything Mark had and you add that onto it. Not tomention the fact when you send out all these ballots, we had a staffer --I've said this many times, we had a staffer who works for our office andfor a judiciary committee who at her apartment, she got her ballot, fourother ballots were mailed to her apartment that were people who didn't livethere.MACCALLUM:  Yes.JORDAN:  That is a recipe for disaster and all we are asking now is whywant some of these -- why won't Governor Kemp in Georgia, for example, letus recheck the signatures and actually find out the rejection rate that Mr.Starr was talking about early. It was next to nothing this election whenyou've got 41 percent of the electorate sending a mail-in ballot in. Thatdefies any type of common sense, so why don't these guys let us check itout?If they are so confident their elections were fine, why don't they let uscheck it out? But they refused to do so and that's what's troubling so manyAmericans.MACCALLUM:  Yes, I think that's exactly right, and the thing that reallystrikes me in Pennsylvania -- and this isn't, you know, just for thepresidential election, this is because a precedent has been set for thisnow going forward. So that's why it's so important --JORDAN:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  -- to all Americans no matter what your party is that you haveto feel confident. You know, I have a neighbor who got six ballots for hisneighbors all put in his mailbox. So, I mean, this kind of happens all overthe place. It's not to say that there should be a different outcome, wedon't, you know, we don't know that. But the fact to the matter is it wasso dramatically different.But here, let me ask you this question. So, you have the legislature inPennsylvania that has the Constitution -- the state constitutionaljurisdiction over voting rules in the state --JORDAN:  Yes.MACCALLUM:  -- but the Supreme Court, the state Supreme Court inPennsylvania overruled what they decided. Now that sounds to me -- I'm notan attorney but that sounds to me like a classic set up for something thatthe Supreme Court of the United States --JORDAN:  Of course.MACCALLUM:  -- would want to get involved in. So why aren't they?JORDAN:  Well maybe they will. We certainly hope they do and I think you'reexactly right on the analysis. The U.S. Constitution is clear, this is anarticle two section one concern for the state legislature. That's where wehave to focus. They have the ability to set the time, place, and manner ofelections and they have the ability to determine the electors, ultimatelydecide on the electors.So, it is a state legislative issue. You're exactly right. And the reasonwe got to get to the bottom of all this is if you think about the fact, 74,75 million voters for President Trump, surveys showed that over 70 percentof that number, 50 some million people think the election was rigged.When you have over a third of the electorate think there are major problemswith your election process with the integrity of your election, that is nothealthy.MACCALLUM:  Yes.JORDAN:  That is not good for a country. If for only that reason we hadbetter get to the bottom of it. And these state officials who are making itdifficult for us to get answers, they are not helping that situation forour entire nation. That's what concerns me. That's why I'm for every debatewe can have, everything we can do to get to the truth so the Americanpeople can be confident in the real outcome. MACCALLUM:  Going forward. Absolutely. Changing gears for one second beforeI let you go, I only have a minute, but, you know, there was a story lastnight about the Attorney General Bill Barr, that he might consider leavingbefore the end of the year or before the term ends. Now today they aresaying that he would serve in his post as long as the president needs him.Just a quick reaction to that, Congressman Jordan.JORDAN:  That's between, I mean, that's between the president and theattorney general. I will tell you I'm glad the attorney general announcedlast week that Mr. Durham has now been given a designation of specialcounsel. I think it's important. Frankly though, I wish he would've told usthat before the election. I wish he would've told us that in October whenhe did it.MACCALLUM:  Thank you. Congressman Jordan, good to see you tonight. Thanksfor being here.JORDAN:  You bet. Thanks, Martha.MACCALLUM:  Breaking news just in on the president's a vaccine summit whichwas scheduled for tomorrow, the CEOs of Pfizer and Moderna now saying theyplan to not attend. We are going to tell you why when we come back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM:  Breaking tonight on the race to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, theCEOs of Pfizer and Moderna both say they will skip President Trump'svaccine summit which is scheduled for tomorrow in the White House. That iswhen the president expected to sign a executive order granting U.S.citizens priority access to both companies COVID-19 vaccines before dosescan be shift off to other nations.Both CEOs citing, quote, "regulatory requirements for their refusal toattend" claiming that they can be in the same room as the FDA doctor who iscurrently reviewing their applications for emergency use authorization.Today of course is December 7th, and on December 7th 1941, more than 2,400Americans lost their lives when the Japanese launched a surprise attack onPearl Harbor. Launching America into World War II. Nearly half of those whowere killed that day were on board the USS Arizona.My next guest is one of the last two surviving crewmembers from that ship.Lou Conter went on to have an incredible career in the navy after theattack. He learned to fly and complete missions all over the South Pacificduring World War II.He serve -- he continued to serve in the Korean War, and in 1975, hereturned to Pearl Harbor to write training materials for the troops headedto Vietnam. Until he eventually retired in 1967. Lou Conter was set to bein attendance for events commemorating Pearl Harbor today was held back dueto the COVID-19 concerns and he joins me now.LOU CONTER, PEARL HARBOR SURVIVOR:  Thank you very much.MACCALLUM:  What do you remember, Lou, about Pearl Harbor and about theattack, and what happened to you when those bombs hit?CONTER:  Well, it's a day that nobody will ever forget. In my memory oranyone who was there. But we were highly trained for the last two yearsbefore Pearl Harbor and as Commander Fuqua, our first lieutenant(Inaudible) through the raid said that everyone on the ship served withdistinction because they were highly trained. And I believe that that's oneof the greatest acts that American sailors and officers of the navy, thearmy, the air force, it was the army air corps at the time can do. December7th was a date that will live in infamy. Thank you.MACCALLUM:  Lou, where were you on the ship and what do you remember aboutthat moment when the attack began?CONTER:  Well, I was the quartermaster third class and I had to watch onthe quarter deck (Inaudible) and when the first planes came across, we signgeneral quarters and the captain, Van Valkenburg, our skipper, went to thebridge. And Admiral Kidd, Commander (Inaudible) supervision number one whowas captain of the ship when I first went aboard there in Arizona.And Kurt Haynes, the quartermaster with me went to the bridge. And CaptainVan Valkenburg told me to secure the quarter deck and come to the bridgebecause my job is to steer the ship in and out of port. We had the vesseltied up alongside of us so we sent the men forward to cut the lines to thevessel. And that's when the boats made from the vessel through a lineacross to the tower after it blew up. We blew up about five minutes aftereight, which is seven or eight minutes into the attack.We took a armor piercing bomb alongside a number two turret and wentthrough five decks and into the lower hand in the (Inaudible) lower handand the four lower hand and (Inaudible) ammunition for turrets one and twowere and a million pounds of powder blew up. The bow of the ship came outof the water about 30 or 40 feet and settled straight back into the baywhere it still sitting today.And Commander Fuqua got knocked down where he came through and he came upon the quarterdeck and took charge of the ship. He had us surviving memberspulling men out of the fire and laying down on deck because they wereburned pretty badly. And we had 50 or 60 (Inaudible) sent to the hospital.We were about in shape, but about 8.35 in the morning and we got them intothe hospital and came back and helped fight the fire. The fire was burninguntil Tuesday. So as Commander Fuqua said, everyone on the ship did exactlywhat they were trained, highly trained to do. And they served withdistinction.So, I'm very happy that I have lived as long as I have. Eleven hundred andseventy-seven of our shipmates perish that day, with 2,403 servicemen fromthe whole service that day.MACCALLUM:  That's an -- it's extraordinary.CONTER:  So, Pearl Harbor must be remembered as a main holiday in Americaso it will never happen again. Thank you.MACCALLUM:  You are so right about that, sir. I've had the honor of goingto Pearl Harbor and of learning about the men on the ship and those whowere buried with the ship. And even stories of brothers who after theypassed, wanted to be returned to the ship, have the remains returned to theship after that.You were not able to go this year. Explain to us what it has meant to youin the past to return to the ship to remember those that were lost thatday.CONTER:  We've been -- since the 50th anniversary in 1991 when PresidentBush was there. My family and I have been there for practically every yearsince, and this year we had a reservation. And I called November the firstand they said they're going to extend the reservation and when you got offthe plane you had to go into hibernation for two weeks.MACCALLUM:  Yes.CONTER:  Before you could get off -- out of the hotel. So, we can't sailout November the first and will come next year, God willing I will be 100in September 13th. We'll be there next year to the 80th anniversary. Todayis the 79th anniversary.MACCALLUM:  Well, that be extraordinary and we hope that you will be thereon the 80th anniversary. I hope that some of us will get to out there andjoin you for that. That would be an extraordinary experience.Lou Conter, thank you so much for your service to this country, and you area living testament to the strength and the courage of the men on the USSArizona. Thank you so much, sir, for being here tonight.CONTER:  Thank you very much for having me. God bless Kenn Potts and theother men of the Arizona survivors today. There's two of us still living.He will be 100 in April 15th. Thank you so much.MACCALLUM:  God bless you both. Thank you, sir.Remarkable to talk to Lou Conter. What an amazing man and he doesn't seemlike he is 99 years old to me. I don't know about you, but he seems, Idon't know maybe 75 if I had to guess. So, we're really grateful to him forbeing here. If you want to learn more about that period in our historywhich is so important, "Unknown Valor:  A Story of Family, Courage, andSacrifice Starts in Pearl Harbor Goes All the Way to Iwo Jima."
