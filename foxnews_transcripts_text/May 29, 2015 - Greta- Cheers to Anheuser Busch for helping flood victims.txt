Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. The numbers are absolutely staggering. Already more than two dozen deaths confirmed from the flooding in Texas and Oklahoma. Just horrible.
Plus, thousands more are suffering. Their houses washed away, all their belongings ruined and many of those hurting citizens have even more trouble tonight. They don't have something you and I take for granted with the flip of a faucet, drinking water. You need drinking water to live. It must be clean, not contaminated or you will get very sick. It could even be life-threatening. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, who is helping those without drinking water? Anheuser-Busch - yes, the beer people. Anheuser- Busch is stopping beer production at its Georgia plant and instead, canning water. With the help of the Red Cross, they are sending the canned water to flood victims. It's a great idea. I admire them for helping. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
While I'm not suggesting you go out and drink this weekend - that's your business - I know if I have a beer this weekend, mine will definitely be brewed by Anheuser-Busch. That's my very small way to give them a nodded toast for thinking fast, jumping in and helping. Cheers to them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
