Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute -- and this is pretty crazy and really gives you an idea of what's wrong with Washington.
First, you have the cheater. A congressman from Louisiana, Vance McAllister. He's a Republican. He has a wife and five kids, and he has disgraced himself, hurt his family. He got caught romantically kissing a staffer. It's all on video, and now, of course, it's on the Internet. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But it gets worse. As soon as the news breaks, a Democratic congresswoman comes up with a really dumb idea. Congresswoman Jackie Speier is reportedly planning to introduce legislation requiring not just the cheater, but all members of Congress and staff to undergo sexual harassment training. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, it's really bad if members of Congress need special training to know cheating is wrong, especially cheating with staffers. But it's even more ridiculous to send everyone in Congress to school, and punish the entire group based on the bad behavior of one congressman and one staffer. Not everyone needs anti-cheating and anti-sexual harassment school. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, instead of coming up with ways to punish those whose behavior is good, how about doing what we really pay you for. And for starters, clean up the mess you all made, that waste and fraud. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
