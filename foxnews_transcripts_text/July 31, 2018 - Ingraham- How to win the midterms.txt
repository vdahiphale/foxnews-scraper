SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Ingraham is still in New York. Why didn't you tell us we were in New York? You would've put you on the show. 
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: You never invite me anymore. It's like two ships passing in the night.

        }
      
INGRAHAM: Two ships -- but I gotta tell you -- I loathe to complement you because everybody else does, so I have to tease you. But that interview you just did was so inspiring. I am so glad you tracked her down, a story of redemption. We all need to read those. Everybody makes mistakes in their lives.

INGRAHAM: No, there are a lot of people in prison.

HANNITY: Have a great show. 
INGRAHAM: All right, thanks Sean good evening. I'm Laura Ingraham, this is 'The Ingraham Angle' live as you can see from New York Saturday. We have a fantastic show, I'm always immodest, a fantastic show for you this evening. What'll prove the powerful force in the midterms? Bob Mueller or the economy? Two top pollsters join us with information you will not get anywhere else and a House candidate -- check this out -- this happened last night at midnight that I got word of this.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Calls First Lady Melania Trump a name so repulsive, so vile, that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wants him banned from Twitter. Leader McCarthy will speak with us exclusively tonight about that and a lot of other topics. Plus, why is one of the NFL's most prominent owners suddenly going silent about the national anthem protest? 
He's being shushed. Raymond Arroyo will be looking for answers in a special Tuesday appearance on the show. But first, how to win the midterms? That's the focus of tonight's Angle. 
Now you probably heard this, that traditionally, parties in power lose seats in the midterm elections. According to the latest Quinnipiac poll, there are some troubling signs for Republicans. But all is not lost. But check this out, it's important you for you to understand what is at stake.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Among independents, a group that Trump won by four points in 2016, Republicans face a 17-point deficit as of now versus the Democrats. Among white women, a group Trump won by nine points in 2016, they are now preferring Democratic candidates by a 14-point margin. And among voters, 65 and older, they prefer Dems by a 14-point margin.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now look, there is no doubt that the left is energized and they're craving for power. But if the Democratic Party gains majority, in either House of Congress, what are they going to do? Well, they'll try to reverse all of Trump's progress, and destroy one incredible economic recovery. Industries will be decimated. Jobs will be lost. Of course, the other obvious danger, should the Democrats won, a House majority, well, what will that be? That sounds a little bit like this.

INGRAHAM: Someone tell her that it doesn't rhyme, by the way. Do we want the rose gallery running the government, controlling federal spending? Stymying the president at every turn? But let's remember, should Nancy Pelosi repossess that Speaker's gavel, you can bet that she will mire the country in endless investigations of the Trump administration, and plunge us into a daily impeachment drama. There's no doubt about it.

Well tonight, I have four recommendations to keep all of this from happening. Number one: the Republicans should be out, day in and day out, selling the Trump economy. Go across your districts and remind people that for his administration, its promises made, promises kept and the Republican Congress helped him along the way.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });

        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
The president promised peace and prosperity and that is what he delivered. He promised to hold China accountable, make NATO countries pay their fair share. Renegotiate NAFTA. And that is what he is doing. Republicans promised to cut taxes and rollback onerous job killing regulations. And they did that, too. Now this is why the Democrats keep talking about other issues, talking about things like Mueller or Michael Cohen, or Stormy or Michael Avenatti. But why the Democrats do that? Because they have zero answers to Trump's success. They have no alternative except to go to the tangential, unimportant issues. Now the president, because he gets how to tell a story, he understands the value of touting the economy as he did tonight in Florida.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're setting records like never before, since the election, we have added 3.7 million new jobs. We are in the longest positive job growth streak in history. The African-American unemployment rate has reached the lowest level in history. History. Sorry about this, women. But the unemployment rate has reached the lowest level in over 65 years. It will be history.

INGRAHAM: It was great. And I think about a lot of things, I think about old flashbacks, but it really makes me smile, given everything that has happened on the economic front, to look back on what Barrack Obama said about Trump back in 2016. Do any of you recall this?

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for, that he is going to bring all these jobs back, well, how exactly is he going to do that? He just says, I will negotiate a better deal. How? How exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have and usually, the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.

INGRAHAM: OK. Well, he's got something. I don't offense his magic wand. Maybe it's just great politics. Its face it, due to Trump agenda, we have record-low unemployment and the best job market in decades. And by the way, we have 375,000 manufacturing jobs that did come back to the United States, President Obama. According to MarketWatch today, wage and benefits are rising at the fastest pace in the decade.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The employment cost index rose .6 percent in the second quarter, a tick below the MarketWatch estimate of 7.4 percent. More important, the cost of worker compensation, in the form of pay and benefits, edged up 2.8 percent to mark the biggest yearly-gain since mid-2008. In other words, workers are making out better. You bet. 
The argument for every Republican candidate goes something like this. If you want to get this economy going, if you want to keep this job market thriving, see your investment accounts growing, vote Republican. Number two, a way to avoid impeachment, and keep the midterm elections and Republicans grip? Educate voters on what the Democrats have become. The Democrats, let's face it, have gone totally nuts. Then now want to abolish ICE. They believe people should not be able to use things like normal gender pronouns, that's offensive to Democrats. They prefer that I guess we go to war with Russia rather than supporting Trump's diplomatic overtures to Russia. 
They want to sanctuary cities from sea to shining sea. One guy even wrote a column, a Democrat, about how we should have no borders at all. At least they're honest. Now they have a world where illegal immigrants are protected while our citizens become an afterthought. So on the campaign trail, emphasize how the Democrats are on the margins. They're the fringe. They are the radicals. They threaten individual liberty. Now this is the party now of regulation and speech codes. It's a party that is intolerant of any view but their own. They want to turn our entire country into, like, one big college campus, where every expression is controlled by them.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Number three: argue that a life Democrat congressional rule is merely going to be the nation will be locked into two years of relitigating the 2016 election. In other words, any real hope of solving our immigration, our spending, our entitlement, or our infrastructure problems -- poof -- it's all going to evaporate.

        }
      
With this economy roaring, right now, we will can focus on those things, because of Trump and his big victory, we're finally out of the post-9/11 crisis mentality. Remember, it wasn't so long ago that we were either mired in the Middle East or dealing with fallout from the housing bubble, the financial crisis, or essentially just allowing China to dominate us with impunity. 
But thanks to Trump, we can now, as a nation, have a real conversation, and a debate would be nice, about the role that the United States will play in a world where the limits of globalization they've frankly become pretty obvious. But let's not forget, the Democrats are loathe to even begin considering that. They don't want to debate. They want to personalize, demonize, isolate Trump from his base. The fourth way to win in the midterms and avoid impeachment: be happy warriors. Have fun on the campaign trail.

It is a great time to be an American. I can't think of a better time, frankly, in my lifetime, and this economy, than right now. Are you kids out there watching? These are the good old days. Because of the efforts of Republicans and this White House, more Americans will be able to pursue happiness. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Sometimes we forget the latter part. People can realize their dreams. Trump was having that fun tonight and telling those stories.

TRUMP: I was shaking hands with policeman in New York city and the first one came up to me and said, Mr. President, I want to thank you so much. I said, what did I do? He said, my 401(k) is up 44 percent and to my wife thinks I am for the first time a financial genius. She is giving him all the credit. She said, darling, I love you so much.

INGRAHAM: The audience was laughing and having fun. That is what politics at its best is all about. Making people's lives better. Connecting with the electorate. Personalizing the narrative. And that's with the president did tonight. He's out explaining why his policies are working. Highlighting the results and the benefits for particular regions of the country. I hope he goes to places, by the way, that he lost in the general election, or the vote was kind of close. Don't be deterred by the protesters or their resistance mentality from traveling to places like California, Illinois, Colorado, and go back to Wisconsin, go to Michigan.

To win over independent voters, and even some Democrats, the president and the Republicans have to take the wind out of the resistance's sails. This is best done by focusing on your results and offering more solutions without the histrionics or the side issues that will just be used to caricature you later on. And finally, if the president wants to do something in Congress before the midterms, hey, I would push for a middle-class tax cut.

I know they are considering another capital gains tax cut, but how about another middle-class tax cuts? Make what you already passed, and is working, permanent, and expand the cuts you have in place. That puts the Democrats totally on the defensive and on the spot. That means they are going to have to vote against their own constituents' economic well-being. That's a great idea. And one last midterm strategy, there was something of the president said about this wall and his desire for the wall that caught my attention. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: We're going to have tremendous border security that will include the wall. That will include the wall. We have started large portions of the wall, but we are going to need -- even the way we negotiate, we're going to need more, we're going to get more, and we may have to do some pretty drastic things, but we are going to get it.

INGRAHAM: All right, well, I hope by drastic things, he's not referring to a government shutdown. Now I know a lot of you conservatives are like, yeah, government shutdown. I get it. It's tantalizing. But it's like the skeleton crew works the government and it functions just fine for a time being and I might force Congress to fund the wall before the midterms, although I'm not sure that would happen. As a political strategy -- I'm talking about winning at November to prevent the impeachment of this president -- I think it is really risky. It's really risky. 
Why is it really risky? Because with suburban women, with the independent voters, that is not really where they are. Results matter. Making their lives better matters. And with the president on the wall 100 percent, but if you're going to take a risky gamble on shutting down the government, the time to do that? That was last March when the whole omnibus spending bill debate was going on. Right? That's when the president had the good instinct, it was in the morning he voted on it, the good instinct to veto it.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
Well the Republicans made him change his mind on that -- he didn't veto it. But that was a time to take the stand. Now it is too close to the election, the midterm election. And plus, I think it would also convey a sense of chaos. And that's not what those independent voters want to see. They want a happy warrior president. They want the economic success is touted. They want to know who the Democrats really are. They wanted steady as she goes.

So Mr. President keep the focus on the economy, like you did tonight, and your party cannot lose. Remind voters that without a GOP Congress, your booming economy is sure to unravel. And then when it does unravel, it is going to give way to daily impeachment warfare on Capitol Hill. As for you Republicans, who still don't really fully embrace the president's record, I have to say this, frankly, you don't deserve to win. But for the rest of you, make these midterms just the start of something phenomenal. And that's the Angle. 
Joining me now for reaction as John Summers, a Democrat and former communication director for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Dan Bongino, an NRA TV contributor and author of the forthcoming book, "Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump." Great to see both of you. All right, John, take it away. Where do you think I went wrong with my four steps to holding the House and Senate and avoiding impeachment?

JOHN SUMMERS, FORMER COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR FOR SENATOR HARRY REID: Well you had a lot of stuff in there. But you also had some things that I don't disagree with. I think when we talk about with the president needs to do, first of all, he's got to improve his approval rating. They are abysmal right now. In fact his approval ratings are currently lower than Richard Nixon's work at this point in his presidency. He's got to take some steps to improve his approval rating. I would love to see the happy warrior tweet overnight. It would be a welcome change, I think -- to actually see him --

SUMMERS: He was having a great time in front of his base. But the base isn't what he's going to need to win. It's great he's got I believe 88 percent approval rating among his base, but that won't win over as you are saying, independence and other people. What he's got to do is go back, and Republicans need to do this, and Democrats need to do it, we all need to be focusing on the people who -- the hardworking families, who elected Trump into office and that's where he's lost sight. And one way he can do that is to provide farmers relief from this terrible trade war that he started.

INGRAHAM: OK, Dan. First of all, most of those people hate Trump, who were wrong about the election in 2016, but now they are giving all the advice to Republicans. Your reaction? 
BONGINO: Yeah Laura, these are the same people who printed in "The Washington Post" that Trump had approximately a 0 percent chance of winning. I'm not making that up, that was an actual headline, I think it was Chris Cillizza was one of the bylines on it. 
I mean why would you write something so absurd? He obviously didn't have a 0 percent chance of winning. He speaks more to your animosity toward the person than it does your political acumen. Now I just want to address something John said though. I am always kind of weirded out by this, when people say Trump should focus more on the middle class, when he just was responsible largely for a tax cut that has filtered down to the middle class and now we are seeing the numbers.

I get this a lot when I debate with Democrats. They try to prod you with emotion, but they lose all of the facts and data. We just had the employment cost index. 2.8 percent. Barack Obama hovered around 2.2 present this entire time. He's at 2.8, Trump is only been in office two years. We've just seen an explosive growth, even an income tax revenue toward the government. 
We've seen 4.1 percent GDP. Recovering from eight disastrous years of Barack Obama. I think the middle class gets Donald Trump and I think, John, I respect your analysis, I think you are way off there. If anybody's in touch with the middle class it's Trump. 
SUMMERS: His approval rating would be way higher than it is, so you're wrong. That's an important data point for you. Another important data point for you is the fact that those middle class tax cuts that you are talking about, yeah, some of them do trickle down to the middle class, but the majority of those tax cuts actually benefit -- 
INGRAHAM: Yeah because those of the people that pay all the taxes John.

INGRAHAM: For everyone who has investments, right? How many people are invested in the stock market? If you're smart, if you're interested in in the stock market. Most people with any extendable income are invested in the market. But on the middle class, guys, I think it's really important for the Republicans to take the high road. I'd go for another middle-class tax cut. Dan Bongino, do you agree with me? I'd push the Democrats on that. I'd cut even further for those families under $100,000 income with three or four kids, I'd cut them further. Let the Democrats veto that or not --

BONGINO: Laura, I agree with you. I'd like to see a five or six percentage point cut in the metal brackets that would affect would affect middle-class married families, no doubt about it. But notice how -- that John spins it again. They do this all the time. They say, well it will trickle down to the middle class. No, the middle class got an actual tax cuts. 
(CROSSTALK) 
INGRAHAM: And they have like $2,000 more in their pocket now. 
BONGINO: I know if you are -- I don't know if you are unfamiliar with how the tax cut works. Maybe you should take check the data on the percentage point tax cut. But what's interesting Laura -- 
INGRAHAM: All right guys, we're out of time, yeah -- but I will say this. The president gets about 55 percent approval on the economy. We will see. A lot more to get to. Ron DeSantis up next. Big rally tonight. What happened behind-the-scenes? We'll tell you. Don't go away.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: We are restoring American strength and American pride. This may be, in fact it probably is, the greatest movement in the history of our country. But you keep it going, we need to elect more Republicans. We need more votes. And we need to elect Ron DeSantis as your governor. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: Don't you wonder how you get chosen to sit behind the president? I want to know. Joining us now with more as Congressman Ron DeSantis. What an amazing night, Congressman. I know you were on cloud nine because somehow, last month, when I was down there, you were down 15 points, and now you are up 12 points. Again, polls can change. I'm not saying -- we are not getting too confident here. But that is like a 27-point spring. What could possibly account for that, Congressman? 
REP. RON DESANTIS, R—FLA.: Well look, we had the president has been behind me but was more public toward the end of June. We had a big debate on Fox News, which showed the distinctions between the two candidates, which was very important, not just the fact that I am supported by President Trump in my opponent was fighting Trump during the election, but also on some of these substantive issues that you and I have discussed, things like e-verify, being tough on illegal immigration come a big distinction there.

But tonight, I think was just taking it to another level. Laura, that whole arena was filled with people. And there were thousands of people waiting outside that couldn't get in. There was a lot of electricity. Those folks are fired up, ready to go, and look Florida is going to -- I think we will do well in Florida in the midterms this year. 
INGRAHAM: A lot of people are talking about, because of the horrible natural disaster in Puerto Rico, and a lot of people are moving into Florida from Puerto Rico, they had a horrible situation they've had to personally deal with. Registering to vote, if some of them weren't, they're going to a registered Democrat. Do you have a strategy for dealing with that because I understand that the Democrats are moving on that front? Now, we're obviously moving past the primary there. 
DESANTIS: Sure. So the sitting congresswoman from Puerto Rico has endorsed me. She's a Republican. Jennifer Gonzalez and she's a good friend. And that community in central Florida is receptive to pro-jobs, promote economic growth -- 
INGRAHAM: Good. 
DESANTIS: -- pro-education message. So we can do it. Governor Rick Scott, his approval rating amongst that community in central Florida is, like, 70 percent because he's worked very hard. 
INGRAHAM: Wow. 
DESANTIS: He managed the hurricane, aftermath as well, and he managed the Maria aftermath, when you had folks that were leaving Puerto Rico to come to Florida. So yeah look, we need to compete everywhere.

INGRAHAM: OK, now, some people don't have any sense of humor. What is your reaction tonight to that ad? Some people think it's kind of goofy. I have already endorsed you, full disclosure. I endorsed you five years ago when you weren't announced yet. But what about that? 
DESANTIS: Well look. The response has been overwhelmingly positive because in this business, you have to be able to take a step back, poke fun at yourself, have fun at this, and part of what makes me I think effective is that I have a wife that is my best friend and best supporter, we have a family, that is very important to both of us. And we wanted to let voters know about that. 
We wanted to do it in a way that is not the typical cookie-cutter ad --

INGRAHAM: Well, first of all congressman, I think your wife should run in the future. I'm already five steps ahead of you on that. 
DESANTIS: She gave a heck of a speech tonight in the warm up, Laura. 
INGRAHAM: I already heard about it. Congressman, congrats. Great night tonight. We really appreciate it. 
And the final sprint to the midterms is on with 98 days to go -- can you believe it -- a critical question looms. How will Bob Mueller and the Russia probe impact voters, if at all? There's no sign of it wrapping up but will the surging economies sweep the investigation to the side of the ballot box? Joining us now, are the polling heroes. Frank Luntz and Doug Schoen. Great to be with you. 
DOUG SCHOEN, DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT: Great to be with you.

INGRAHAM: Your reaction, you heard THE ANGLE tonight -- 
SCHOEN: I did. 
INGRAHAM: -- my four pieces of advice as to how to avoid impeachment and win the midterms? 
SCHOEN: Well, as a Democrat and a conservative centrist Democrat, sort of wish you kept your opinions to yourself -- 
INGRAHAM; Oh good. SCHOEN: -- because the rant was exactly right. Running on the economy, a middle-class tax cut, is the pro-growth message that the Republicans need. If they get distracted shutting down the government over immigration, that's the stone-cold loser. You asked about the Mueller investigation -- Trump's numbers have gone up, the Republican numbers have gone up, as that investigation has carried on. 
So I don't think that issue, frankly, is going to be relevant unless and until something demonstrative and definitive happens, which shows no signs of happening before the election. It could change.

        }
      
INGRAHAM: Yeah. 
SCHOEN: But as we sit here today, I think the Democratic advantage has as much to do with 40 open Republican seats, which are either open or retirements, than it does with any groundswell for the party. 
LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Frank? 
FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: It's a simple question. Are you better off today than you were two years ago? And so many Americans are and the country is. 
INGRAHAM: So why these numbers with independents, suburban women, you talked about it two weeks ago on the show? You put up the warning flag. And I know it is easy for Republicans to say the pollsters were wrong last time, you can discount the pollsters. I think you do that at your own disadvantage this time around because the resistance is so powerful, they are mad that they were wrong last time and they want to prove themselves right this time. 
LUNTZ: I agree with you 100 percent. And the problem is that some of the language is ineffective, the words they are using and the way they presenting it doesn't work with women. And there is a backlash because of exactly what you said. Middle-class, middle income, middle America women, Republicans have to do a much better job. 
And then there's one more thing. I actually think that it's not enough for them to say, hey, you have got a 4.1 percent growth rate, because nobody understands what that is.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
INGRAHAM: Personalize the stories, correct? 
LUNTZ: Personalize it, and I want you to look two years ahead from now. What will America be like with Speaker Nancy Pelosi? I think they actually have to use her in the campaign. 
INGRAHAM: Yes, you undo the gains that we have made in the last two years. Separate what you don't like about Trump's tweets, undo it all. And then how are you doing? 
There is a new poll out, by the way, the Harris poll that came out just an hour ago or so, about Mueller, going to your point. They believe the bias has hurt Trump, the Mueller, the way the FBI handled the investigation. And so that demonstrates again that people don't think this process is fair. I don't think it ultimately has much of an impact in the November elections. 
SCHOEN: I agree with you, I don't think it well. And Frank's point is an important one and it's one of the reasons why I think the Democrats have a better than 50 percent chance to win the House. Women, suburban, white voters, middle-class voters on both coasts are really reacting to the rhetoric of the Republicans. 
INGRAHAM: Because when they go to the country clubs, we're talking about suburban women, country clubs, they hang out, have coffee with their friends, is it just that they are embarrassed, they feel embarrassed to say they support Trump's results? Do they want to feel there is a way for them to support Trump because he shows empathy or compassion on an issue? Oh, he's good on this. How does he message that, Frank? You're the message guru. 
LUNTZ: You stay on the tax cuts. You stay on the jobs report. You stay on everything that is economically based because in the end, that matters to more to them. There will be some people who will vote based on Donald Trump. This election, you won or lose based on whether they think their income level will be better two years from now than it is today. 
INGRAHAM: That story Trump told at the rally tonight, my 401k, firefighter in New York, up 42 percent, 44 percent that was smart. I want to do a whole hour with you guys. Can we please? I guess we can't. We're going to do it black if we do that. Thank you so much. 
SCHOEN: Thank you. 
INGRAHAM: Is the president using sports to divide Americans? Why is Ruth Bader Ginsburg groupies rejoicing? A lot more to get to. Arroyo next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
INGRAHAM: A Supreme Court justice refashioned into a pop culture superhero, while a sports giant claims the president is dividing us. To explain further in his special Tuesday appearance -- what's going on? Let's bring in Fox News contributor, "New York Times" bestselling author of the "Will Wilder" series Raymond Arroyo. 
Raymond, over the weekend, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said she would stay on interestingly, she chose five years. Why five years on the high court? She's 85, 86? 
RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: She's 85. And I noticed something culturally is happening with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I am at a children's store this weekend, a bookstore, and I'm going through the racks, and there are not one, not two, but three children's books on the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. "Notorious RBG," "I dissent," and "The Ruth Bader Ginsburg Story." There they are. 
INGRAHAM: What? 
ARROYO: I also noticed, there are dolls, action figures. 
INGRAHAM: Dolls? 
ARROYO: And a new documentary that I caught is distributing to theaters everywhere called "RBG." And here's a little glimpse. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG: I ask no favor for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off of our necks. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We welcome today Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
(APPLAUSE) 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She's become such an icon. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you mind signing this copy? 
GINSBURG: I am 84 years old and everyone wants to take a picture with me. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Notorious RBG. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you come right down to it, the closest thing to a superhero I know. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
ARROYO: The closest thing to a superhero, Gloria Swinem -- Steinem -- sorry about that. 
(LAUGHTER) 
ARROYO: That was truly a slip of the town. Many on the left who were upset with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. They thought she should have retired when Obama was still the president, and now they say she is just holding on. I believe she is trying to give them a reason to rally during the midterms. Now you have a reason to vote because Ruth is going to hang on for another five more years. 
INGRAHAM: I understand that people -- I saw this last night on Twitter -- are offering up their organs, their internal organs, to keep her going. Is that true? She's in good health. You see here with the barbells? She's in great health. 
ARROYO: The woman survived pancreatic cancer. 
INGRAHAM: She's amazing. 
ARROYO: She's unbelievable. 
INGRAHAM: I actually have known her for almost 30 years. 
ARROYO: You are going to get another five years. 
INGRAHAM: She's a delightful person. 
ARROYO: We're going to move on here. Basketball superstar LeBron James just opened a brand-new, state-of-the-art school in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. And during a media tour, he had this to say about the president. Listen. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
LEBRON JAMES, NBA PLAYER: This race thing is taking over, and because -- one, because I believe our president is trying to divide us. He's using sports to kind of divide us, and that is something that I can't relate to. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
ARROYO: Dividing us. Look, you got to say right off the bat, LeBron James, this is school he opened it Akron is incredible. At risk kids -- it's food, its STEM and math-based. It is a fantastic school for at-risk kids. This comment, though, that the president is dividing people with sports, I think that goes too far. The president capitalized on what he saw and amplified it. 
INGRAHAM: Why is the president dividing us along sports line? People kneel at the national anthem -- 
ARROYO: Colin Kaepernick did that, not Trump. 
INGRAHAM: The people in the stands reacted to that. Trump spoke about it, but the fans didn't like it. So how was that the president -- look, when you are an athlete and you comment on politics, that is fine, you have every right to comment on politics, you are an American citizen. But don't expect they aren't going to be half of the country who disagree with you. 
I think what we find is that when you go to sporting games, people just want to enjoy the sport, they want to enjoy LeBron. And it doesn't mean he doesn't do great things. He does great things. 
ARROYO: We've said this. They want their movies, they want their sports, they want their films and theater free of politics. It divides and it should be uniting. 
LeBron stands in stark contrast to this new Dallas quarterback, Dak Prescott, who had this to say about the same controversy. Watch this. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
DAK PRESCOTT, NFL QUARTERBACK: I never protested during the Anthem and I don't think that is a time or the venue to do so. The game of football has always brought me such a piece and I think it does the same for a lot of people. When you bring such controversy to the stadium, to the field, to the game, it takes away from that. It takes away from the joy and the love that football brings a lot of people. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
ARROYO: The love and the peace that football brings, I think he is on to something. 
INGRAHAM: I adore him. He's the new Tim Tebow. I love him. 
ARROYO: When you go to a game, you just want to bond with one another and cheer the tame on. I don't want to think, he voted for Trump, he voted for Obama -- 
INGRAHAM: Redskins, Redskins, Redskins. Forget the Saints. 
ARROYO: Who dat? 
INGRAHAM: All right, another celebrity was speaking out about her Trump just last night, Kim Kardashian. Listen to the way that she handled Jimmy Kimmel's questions. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
KIM KARDASHIAN: I have nothing bad to say about the president. 
JIMMY KIMMEL, LAST NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: Right. You still have people on the list. 
(LAUGHTER) 
KARDASHIAN: I'm very focused. But I don't agree with everything either. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
INGRAHAM: She just has something bad to say. She probably has something good to say but she is afraid to because Hollywood will descend on her and call her a hater, a racist, and everything else. 
ARROYO: But the president commuted the sentence of that woman -- 
INGRAHAM: Hannity just had a great interview. 
ARROYO: For 22 years she served on a drug offense. He released her. 
I think what you are hearing from a Kardashians here and Kanye before her, it's a struggle to come to terms with being fair to the good things the president is doing while disagreeing in the areas where you think he's wrong. There's nothing wrong with that. 
INGRAHAM: Everyone can disagree, let's just be a little more polite about it. 
ARROYO: Aren't you kind and sweet here in New York tonight? 
INGRAHAM: And good for LeBron for opening those schools. 
ARROYO: It was a good move. 
INGRAHAM: And Raymond, we'll see you tomorrow. 
ARROYO: Tomorrow night. 
INGRAHAM: We just want you to shine in this beautiful studio. 
ARROYO: It is a pretty studio. 
INGRAHAM: Apparently. 
A House candidate, by the way, hurling a horrible slur at Melania Trump, and now House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wants him banned from Twitter. What is that all about? McCarthy joins us exclusively to press the case next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
INGRAHAM: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is helping lead the charge against destructive behavior and language on social media, perhaps none more so than on Twitter. Case in point, this Oregon House candidate, Mark Roberts, he has called himself an interdependent, he's a leftist. He's facing backlash after this disgusting tweet directed at Melania Trump, quote, "Did you know the first lady works by the hour?" And I'm not going to read the hashtags. You can read them for yourself. Can you imagine if someone said that about Michelle Obama, what they'd be doing tonight? 
And now Leader McCarthy is calling on Twitter to suspend Roberts. The congressman joins us now exclusively with more on that and other issues. Congressman McCarthy, this is so low, but it's one of the many things the left has said about conservative women over the last few years that have gone on with impunity. No repercussions, no boycotts, they say it, they get away with it, and they are celebrated for it, congressman. 
REP. ANDREW MCCARTHY, R—HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: Exactly right. That is why he saying it. And this is inappropriate on any platform to say about a first lady, this first lady, or any other first lady. And Twitter is treating people much different. You look what they did to conservatives. They shadow banned them. And when you shadow ban somebody, everything you put up on Twitter is invisible except to yourself. 
And you know what they did to the RNC chair, Ronna McDaniel? They shadow banned her. Congressman Devin Nunes, they shadow banned him. They just said it was a glitch. It was just an algorithm. But there was not one of the 78 Democratic progressive liberal members who ever got shadow banned. They are going after conservative speech. 
INGRAHAM: So Jack Dorsey is a big liberal who founded Twitter. He's a big fan of Barack Obama. That is fine. That is fine if he is a big liberal. 
MCCARTHY: He even apologized for eating at Chick-fil-A, which I found unbelievable that process. But here is an individual that said a speech that in my belief, is hateful. It is does not belong on that platform. He should suspend his account. He goes on to even speak more about the first lady, but he bans conservatives, but not this instance. 
INGRAHAM: But he wasn't banned from Twitter, correct? I learned about -- 
MCCARTHY: He got suspended. 
INGRAHAM: I learned about this because I saw your retweet. Not to get you into it, but it was a response to something our friend Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA had written. And this freak responds to his tweet and says the h-word, hoebag, I don't even know what that is. It's so stupid. It's something you read or hear it some kind of lame, gross hip-hop thing. I don't know. But if you said about Michelle Obama, what would be happening? What would be happening tonight? 
MCCARTHY: This person would be shut down. They would be no opportunity for him to ever be on Twitter again. But listen to why he responded to Charlie. Charlie simply pointed out that our first lady is running a thinner, leaner operation where there are fewer people working there. And he responds this way to her. 
But what goes farther is this is happening on social media in a lot of different places. Remember what Google did to the Republicans in California a week before our primary. They said our philosophy was Nazism. Remember what Twitter continues to do to conservatives, a shadow ban. This has got to stop especially before we go into this campaign. How many other individuals are sitting out there that want to have a communication or talk about a conservative subject get banned or their views are never being seen? But individuals can talk like this and they never got suspended. This is what is wrong. 
INGRAHAM: And the problem, congressman, is that when young people do basic searches for information, they do basic searches on "capitalism" or on "tax cuts," and it is interesting to see what comes up on those searches. And invariably, the most leftwing, progressive, even socialist views, which are couched in the most beautiful terms, come up first. That is a problem when you have companies that get so big their market cap is larger than most countries. And they have such an outsized influence, it's a problem. 
MCCARTHY: It's a major problem because we found Facebook prior to the last election was suppressing conservative views that were going out there. It's exactly what you are talking about. They are only allowing other views to come forward. That is why they have to have a very clear policy. They have to be held accountable of what we're moving forward -- 
INGRAHAM: Is there anything you can do on the congressional level? On the Congressional level there's nothing you can do, right? 
MCCARTHY: We brought them in for hearings. What I fundamentally believe is they have to stop the bias. And ever since I came out with us, I simply did a tweet one time of what I found had happened, stop the bias. It even happened to my own wife in the process. But I was able to speak up for it. I am getting many people across the social media showing me what has happened to them. And they don't have a voice. 
INGRAHAM: Good. Good. We have to have the evidence. 
MCCARTHY: This is has got to stop, and I want to get it cleared up. 
INGRAHAM: I did my opening "Angle," congressman, on four ways to avoid impeachment and avoid losses in the midterms. And I focused on the economy, and the focus has to be relentless on economic growth and how Pelosi will reverse the gains that have been made. At the same time, there is concern that we will have a risk of a government shutdown. Now President Trump said at his rally tonight that he is considering, quote, "drastic measures" if necessary to get the funding for the wall. He campaigned on the wall and Congress hasn't delivered on the wall that he campaigned on. And I believe the American people want this enforcement done. What is your read on this? Would a government shutdown hurt Republican chances in November? 
MCCARTHY: I think timing is everything. If you shut down in the 30th and you've got 60 votes in a Senate, the Democrats would take advantage of that right before the election. Let's be very clear, we have put money into the wall. We are currently building the wall, but we have to finish it. 
INGRAHAM: It's $25 billion, congressman. 
MCCARTHY: We put more money forward. 
INGRAHAM: We need the money. 
MCCARTHY: We have got a lot further more to go. In the House, it's not a problem. It's the Senate and the rules of where we go. We have got to pick the right timing when we have this. But you are correct when it comes to the economy. Think for one moment -- there's three entities you really want to watch and a selection. Women, independents, and seniors. If you watch and you look at from all the Democrat open seats, when it was a race between a woman versus a man, a woman won 71 percent of the time. 
INGRAHAM: Getting killed, Republicans are getting killed. 
MCCARTHY: But you know what happened since this tax cut went through? One million new jobs. Women in America, the unemployment for women at the lowest point it's been in 65 years. 
INGRAHAM: But congressman, don't the women want things to calm down? Women want things calm and peaceful, more happiness. 
MCCARTHY: They do. 
INGRAHAM: So I think Trump has to be the happy warrior. 
MCCARTHY: They want less dysfunction. 
INGRAHAM: He was happy warrior tonight. We want happy warrior Trump because it is very charming and very -- I think it just makes people happy. We want that. Do you agree with me on that or am I overstating it? 
MCCARTHY: No, I agree 100 percent. If people really saw the president Trump I always see, he is a happy warrior. He's a lot like when you watched Ronald Reagan. If you believe your policies bring people more freedom and liberty, you should be a happy conservative. 
INGRAHAM: Absolutely. 
MCCARTHY: Because want to know about it more often. That's exactly what should go out. 
INGRAHAM: And we know what's going to happen if the Democrats -- if the Democrats get control, it's going to be mired in investigation mania on Capitol Hill. It's all going to be undone. Congressman, thanks for joining us exclusively tonight. We really appreciate it. 
Up next, seven illegal Mexican immigrants attempt a brazen robbery in Texas, but why do the local authorities not tell us about it initially? Stay with us. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
INGRAHAM: OK, a viewer warning to all of our liberal viewers. You're not going to like this story because we have yet another example of crime committed by illegal immigrants. This is brazen. This time it's coming from the border town of McAllen Texas where on Saturday masked men stormed a jewelry store in a botched robbery attempt. As you can see the surveillance video, at least some of the men appear to be armed. Thankfully, authorities quickly took the man into custody. There were no injuries. 
According to customs and border protection, all seven of the suspects were in the country illegally. What a shocker. A fact that the local police neglected to disclose in their initial statement. Joining me now for reaction, Christopher Cabrera, a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council. Chris, I always find that it's like pulling teeth to get immigration status out of local authorities or reporters who are covering these stories. But this was amazing. You have some background information in at least a few of these robbers. Tell us. 
CHRIS CABRERA, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL: Yes. A couple of these individuals that attempted that robbery had been arrested in California in 2015 for a similar robbery, a smash and grab type operation, where I think 10 people went into a jewelry store in the Los Angeles area and two of them ended up, two of them from this group were part of that previous group. 
INGRAHAM: And Chris, what I think American people get frustrated by is that these people coming to the country illegally, some of them get arrested for crimes, they do some time in California, then they are released into society because it's a sanctuary state. They are released into society. They are not really deported. Some of them are but then they come back over. They commit yet another crime. And then they do time here, we pay for three square meals a day, we pay for their incarceration, and then perhaps they'll be deported into Mexico. 
How bad is it right now at the border, and what in your mind has to be done immediately to stop this flow across the country? 
CABRERA: I think we need to be tougher on the prosecutions, tougher on the sentencings, and make it a real deterrent against coming over here. Also we need more agents in the area, on the ground. However we manage to do that, it remains to be seen. But it needs to be done because right now, it is wide open out there. And the American public deserves security along the border. 
INGRAHAM: I have a friend of mine who actually used to work for me years ago, but he works in McAllen, Texas. He loves the people of McAllen, Chris, but it is in some ways, it's the Wild West as a border town. Is that accurate? 
CABRERA: It's a nice community, it's a great community. There are times where there is crime out here. There's a lot of home invasions. Usually, those are done -- I guess those are within the drug community, those guys fighting against each other. But it's just a matter of time before something breaks off. We have had cross-border violence for some time. Unfortunately, the local authorities, whether it is the city or the county municipality, they don't want to admit that we are having spillover violence from Mexico. And it is coming slowly but surely, it has increasingly gotten worse. It's just that people are pretending it's not there. 
INGRAHAM: Obrador, the new president of Mexico, this is going to end. There is no more thruway from Central America through Mexico or Mexico into United States. Not going to happen anymore. Chris, thanks for that insight. It's fascinating. 
We're going to be right back, close at this hour. Do not go anywhere. Stay there. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
INGRAHAM: By the way, our earlier guest made this point about Trump's approval rating, it is so low. Trump's approval rating is at about 48 percent. OK, Obama had about 46 percent at the same time in his presidency. Don't be making those points on the show. There he is. He just got off the plane. He had a raucous rally in Florida talking about the economy, getting the troops all psyched up for the midterms and this gubernatorial race. Focusing on the economy, Mr. President, and it's all going to be coming up roses. 
That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the great "Fox News @ Night" team are up next.
