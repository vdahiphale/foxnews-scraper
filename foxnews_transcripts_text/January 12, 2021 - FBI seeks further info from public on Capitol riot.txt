But we'll come back tohaunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration. As the expression goes, becareful what you wish for.EMANUEL: Lawmakers argued back and forth preparing the bill for the floorvote.REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): That it's up to the vice president and we're nottrying to usurp his authority in any way. We're trying to tell him that thetime of 25th Amendment emergency has arrived. It has come to our doorstep;it has invaded our chamber.REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): His actions will only again continue to divide thenation.

LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX): He is here for mass distraction, not because hehas any real accomplishment in the wall that Mexico never paid for and thathe really could not build.STEGALL: The 15 billion was designated to construct 738 miles. Dollars thatcame from a combination of U.S. Department of Defense, Homeland Securityand Treasury Forfeiture Funds.(END VIDEO CLIP)STEGALL (on camera): President-Elect Joe Biden has vowed to both haltconstruction of the border wall and also to undo many of President Trump'simmigration policies by executive order.However, the Biden team says that that will not happen on day one right outof the gate to try and avoid preventing a further crisis down here, Bret.BAIER: Casey Stegall along the southern border.

The move ultimately led to both state and national emergencydeclarations as the water supply for the city of 100,000 people becamecontaminated with lead from old pipes along with bacteria. It was blamedfor a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that claims 12 lives.Snyder has faced heavy criticism for his handling of the crisis but ismaintained he responded to it as best as he could.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICK SNYDER, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN: If you were involved in somethingthat didn't go right, if you had people beneath you that didn't do thethings that could have avoided this or dealt with this problem, that firstof all, you should take responsibility if they work for you.

Asenior State Department official says U.S. intelligence shows Al Qaedareorganized and Iran in 2015 and enjoys operational freedom and support, asIranian officials even allow Al Qaeda leaders shopping trips and use of apool in Tehran to swim laps.POMPEO:  We ignored this Iran-al Qaeda nexus at our own peril. We need toacknowledge it. We must confront it. Indeed, we must defeat it.EDSON:  Though officials have been warning for years that Al Qaeda leaderswere operating in Iran. In his speech, the secretary also confirmed theassassination of Abu Muhammad al-Masri, Al Qaeda's second in command, whogunman killed August 7th on the streets of Tehran.

Bush called Adelson an American patriot anda strong supporter of Israel. Adelson died last night from complicationsrelated to treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Sheldon Adelson was 87-years-old.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The 25th Amendment is ofzero risk to me, but will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Bidenadministration. As the expression goes, be careful what you wish for. Theimpeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witchhunt in the history of our country, and is causing tremendous anger anddivision and pain.We believe in respecting America's history and traditions, not tearing themdown. We believe in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  President Trump along the southern border, touting theaccomplishment of the border wall, and also talking about the 25thAmendment, and what will be coming soon, and impeachment vote in the house.Meantime, leadership, one of the leaders in the Republican Party in theHouse, Liz Cheney, now saying she will vote for impeachment. The presidentof United States history, she writes, summoned this mob, assembled the mob,and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.None of this would have happened without the president. There has neverbeen a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his officeand his oath to the Constitution. I will vote to impeach the president."Also during this show, Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican fromIllinois, has also spoken out about the president's speech, will forimpeachment. As for Senate Majority Leaders Mitch McConnell, the word isthat he has not decided how he will vote, but he is in favor of the actionof impeachment, and that he committed, the president did, impeachableoffenses, according to Senate majority leader.Let's bring in our panel, former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr.,Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com, and "Washington Post" columnistMarc Thiessen. Marc, I guess there is a sense, I had Senator Joe Manchin onlast night, he said it was ill-advised as far as the timing and what thefocus should be for the incoming administration to focus on this. But theseRepublicans are standing up on principle, saying what happened needs to beadjudicated essentially.MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  So there are two differentissues here, Bret. One is, did the president commit an impeachable offense?And second is, is it prudent to impeach him with nine days left in hispresidency? On the question of whether he committed in impeachable offense,I think it's undoubtedly true that he did. If you play with matches andstart a forest fire, the fact that you didn't intend to start the forestfire doesn't absolve you from the destruction, the responsibility for thedestruction. The president played with matches, he ginned up his base tobelieve that the election was stolen, he brought them to Washington, hefired them up, and he told them it's all up to Mike Pence. And they went tothe capital chanting "Hang Mike Pence."And at the same time, he tried to use a mob to coerce the vice president ofthe United States to commit an unconstitutional act, which was to rejectthe legitimately cast electoral votes in favor of Joe Biden. That's anabuse of power. So I just think it's a slam-dunk case for whether hecommitted an impeachable offense. The question is, if there was nine monthsleft in his presidency, of course he should be impeached and removed. Withnine days left, is it going to cause more division? Is it going to turn himinto a martyr? Is it going to help rather than hurt him? And it's alsopossible he would be acquitted and claim vindication. So there's a lot ofprudential questions here, but I think the case is open and shut.BAIER:  Yes, thoughts about what Marc just said, Harold, on those twosides, and more focus on whether it should go forward in the Senate, forexample?HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE:  So thanks for havingme on. I think Marc raises the two points that have to be analyzed. But thefacts are so overwhelming here, and the developments this evening suggeststrongly that when you talk about impeachment and conviction, I was inCongress when Bill Clinton was impeached, he was eventually acquitted. Youdidn't have Democrats coming out voicing support for impeachment or votingto convict the president.Liz Cheney, there's not a name in American politics, in Republican politicsover the last 40 years, other than Bush, that resonates more broadly in aforeign policy and domestic policy in the Republican Party than Cheney. Forher to do that, it sends a powerful message.I think the president is realizing, number one, that he lost this election.And two, for the first time, I think, in his political and maybe businesslife, he may be held accountable in the most punishing and devastating ofways. Now, I'm sensitive to what Joe Manchin and Marc is raising. Does thispoison the well, does it make it difficult, too difficult for the nextpresident? I think it may be a risk that this Congress is willing to take,because had one of those thugs or terrorists got their hands on MitchMcConnell, Joe Manchin, Lindsey Graham, gotten their hands on Jim Clyburn,Mike Pence, would we having this same conversation? Of course we wouldn't.It would be a very different one because violence would have probably beeninflicted upon them.This president has shown no remorse. He's apologized not once, and in fact,never called his vice president during that whole ordeal. I think Congressis right to consider this, and I think Senate Republicans, for MitchMcConnell not to say that he would vote no on this, Bret, this is a sad dayfor the country and for this presidency, but it's a step that might have tobe taken.BAIER:  All right, Katie, your thoughts?KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM:  Yes, the Republicans that arevoting for impeachment, whether in the House or the Senate, are arguingthat this is a culmination not of the ultimate horrific event last week,but of the last couple of months with the election. When President Trumpran out of legal options, he continued to say the election was stolen, andthen, of course, the aftermath of how he handled Wednesday, not callingMike Pence, not getting out in front of President-elect Joe Biden, formervice president Joe Biden, with a statement to tell the mob to stand down.Now, if you look at, yes, what he said in his speech on the ellipse aboutorganizing and going to Congress, he said do it peacefully andpatriotically. But in the grand scheme of what he's been doing over thepast two months that's outside of his right of challenging the process,going through the court system, that's what it comes down to for theseRepublicans.And for Mitch McConnell, he probably won't run for office again. He lovesthe Senate. He's an institutionalist. I would assume that he took whathappened last Wednesday very, very personally in terms of the attack onCongress. Of course, Elaine Chao, who was the transportation secretary forPresident Trump, was the first cabinet member to resign. So for MitchMcConnell to come out and say he's interested in hearing the evidence afterbacking the president on the first impeachment, I'm not surprised givenwhere this situation took place.BAIER:  Yes, these Republicans are making compelling cases. They're talkingabout principle, that Trump supporters look at this effort and see it as aneffort to stop him, President Trump from running again, obviously with thesecond impeachment. But there's a lot of emotion behind all of thesearguments.I want to turn quickly to the difference on China, and the twoadministrations, what we are looking at and something that developed today.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT:  As we compete with China, to hold China'sgovernment accountable for its trade abuses, technology, human rights, andother fronts, our position is much stronger when we will build coalitionsof likeminded partners and allies.DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  What we would've done inthe next four years, we have been on a footing like nobody has ever -- andnow we're giving it all away. But China said we will not deal with youunless you get rid of the America First policy. And you know what theDemocrats said? They said yes, we will do that. Can you believe this?(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  There's all kinds of questions about China's activities withDemocrats and there are allegations and investigations that have happened.Today, though, "Axios" reported that Joe Biden's inaugural committee willrefund the donation from former senator Barbara Boxer after the CaliforniaDemocrat registered as a foreign agent for a Chinese surveillance firmaccused of abetting the country's mass internment of Uighur Muslims. Marc,your thought on this and kind of forecast of what's ahead?THIESSEN:  And Barbara Boxer, who, by the way, in 2005 objected to theelectors from Ohio for George W. Bush as well, so that's a nice historicalfootnote to keep in mind.Look, it's the tragedy of what's happened here, which is you look at theNixon presidency and the tragedy of Watergate, but also the opening toChina. There were great foreign policy accomplishments. Trump has also hadenormous foreign policy accomplishments. The Abraham Accords, four MiddleEast peace deals, the cracking down on China and on their intellectualproperty theft and all the rest of it. It's just a tragedy that thispresident, who has such good policies and accomplished so much for thecountry, has self-destructed by his inability to behave like a decent humanbeing.BAIER:  When we come back, the high-tech version of cancel culture.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think that big tech isdoing a horrible thing for our country and to our country. And I believeit's going to be a catastrophic mistake for them.JOHN MATZE, PARLER CEO:  I've seen a lot of people say that this is scary,but I've also seen a lot of people who are participating in the fiveminutes of hate and kind of egging it on and cheering. And it's disgusting.We will be back up eventually because we're not going to give up.MATT SCHRUERS, COMPUTER AND COMM INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION:  Free speech isn'tspeech free from consequences. It means speech free from governmentconsequences.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  There's a big debate right now, a company essentially being shutdown in its ability to use the Internet, but they are companies, and thequestion is where is the push now on this battle on social media and bigtech? You had secretary of state this week talking about wokeness.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE:  Censorship, wokeness, politicalcorrectness, it all points in one direction -- authoritarianism cloaked asmoral righteousness. Similar to what we're seeing at Twitter and Facebookat Apple and on too many university campuses today.It's time that we simply put woke-ism to sleep.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Secretary of State on Monday. We're back with Katie and Harold,working on Marc getting back here. Katie -- we got him. Katie, yourthoughts on this? There's all kinds of elements to this story, and peoplewho point out that these are private companies. And then you have theParler situation where a company essentially is taken off. What about this,where is it going?PAVLICH:  I don't think it's going to a good place or a place where theywill be more tolerance and open speech on these platforms considering thatJoe Biden has hired a number of people from these big tech companies whoare justifying kicking off dissenting voices on their platform. And theyhave argued that they are clearing out Twitter accounts on the rightbecause they are inciting violence. Well, OK, if that's the standard,that's fair, but they're not doing it to both sides. We've repeatedlytalked about murderous dictators who are still on Twitter. There are stillviolent leftwing groups organizing on the platform. So there certainlyisn't a standard of fairness.But in terms of where we go from here, in terms of legislation, a number ofthese tech CEOs have been on Capitol Hill multiple times, testifying underoath that they don't coordinate their actions when it comes to what they doas a company, but it's pretty clear that this week taking down of Parler,there was coordination between Twitter and Amazon to completely removetheir servers.And it's one thing to say, OK, go build your own platform if you don't wantto operate within our private business, but it's another for these bigcompanies to then coordinate to eliminate competition and eliminate anotherspace where people can speak freely.And the last thing I would say is today, Twitter unironically in theirpublic safety policy tweet feed is tweeting about how elections in Ugandaneeds to be fair and therefore they should not be shutting the Internetdown because open debate, free expression, and access to the Internet,meaning also Twitter, is essential to the democratic process. So if that'sgood enough for differing opinions in a place like Uganda, it should be aplace for people in America as well.BAIER:  Harold, a lot of Trump supporters, a lot of Republicans arepointing to hypocrisy as far as what has happened in the past or what ishappening now, and you just heard Katie's comments. But there's also thislack of liberal outrage about free speech, too. Where is the ACLU and othergroups speaking out? Understanding the security environment we're in, butusually they're very vocal.FORD:  I think that we shouldn't confuse cancel culture and politics. Whenpoliticians complain that big companies stop making donations to them, andthey believe that's part of the cancel culture, that's not cancel culture.That's called politics. They have the right to give to whom they want togive to.If you spread misinformation and lies, and those lies can lead to violence,private companies have a right to act. I don't condone what any of thedeath threats and the violent threats any person gets, including John Matzeor anybody. They out to find those people, law enforcement should find themand prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.But we to understand, we have reached a low. This is a sad point for thepresidency, for politics in the country, and canceling out legitimatepolitical discourse you just disagree with, not discourse that promptviolence, but discourse you disagree with, that's cancel culture. What ishappening right now, I don't define it as cancel culture.BAIER:  All right, Marc, final word, quickly.THIESSEN:  I'm glad to see Harold embrace Citizens United. This is thewhole point. Shutting down Parler or taking away the president's Twitteraccount, that is suppressing free speech. But Citizens United found thatindividuals, including corporations, have a right to free speech. And socorporations can exercise their right to free speech by denying politicaldonations if they want to. That's what conservatives believe.BAIER:  We're going to follow this. It's not going to end here, andobviously we have the inauguration next week. Panel, thank you very much.When we come back, a pair of farewells.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, two farewells.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I will be out of service, end of watch.
