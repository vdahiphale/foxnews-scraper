Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. You will not believe -- well, maybe you will -- what President Obama's national security advisor, Susan Rice, just said about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's upcoming speech to Congress.

SUSAN RICE, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: On both sides, there has now been injected a degree of partisanship, which is not only unfortunate, but I think it's destructive of the fabric of the relationship.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

Really? She thinks his speech is the problem, that his speech is the destructive to the relationship? Apparently, Susan Rice has a spotty memory, or a politically convenient one. Or maybe she is drinking something weird.
How could she possibly forget that her boss, President Obama, got caught on a hot mic trash-talking Prime Minister Netanyahu? Trash-talking? That's destructive. Or that President Obama skipped going to Paris after a terror attack on a Jewish deli. Destructive. Or how about that Obama administration official who called Netanyahu a chicken you-know-what and a coward. Name calling? That's destructive. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, of course, President Obama never disavowed those insults, nor apologized for his staffer. His silence? That's destructive. Or how about the former Obama campaign staffers in Israel right now working to defeat Netanyahu in his upcoming election. Destructive. Or President Obama refusing to meet with Netanyahu next week? Destructive.
Well, Susan Rice let us know who she thinks is destructive in this relationship. I will keep it a secret who I think might be delusional. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
