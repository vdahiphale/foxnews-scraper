SEAN HANNITY, HOST: Alright, buckle up. Welcome to "Hannity."
Tonight, we start with mourning the loss of Lori Kaye and pray for those who are injured, a heroic action in the face of horrific attacks at a California synagogue over the weekend. We'll have full coverage of the senseless act of violence coming up, including how the media is even politicizing the shooting and many in the media blaming -- yes, you guessed it, President Trump. Why? The actions of a deranged, sick, twisted evil individual who said and what was his own manifesto, he hated Israel, and he hated Donald Trump himself.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an academic, and we have a president who will not -- not only will not acknowledge that we have an epidemic of white nationalism after New Zealand. He is providing the mood music for it.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He himself talked about being a nationalist. When he says in this language, xenophobia, hatred about immigrants, this seeps into the culture. This emboldens people.

But, first, we start tonight, we turn to our Hannity watch on investigating the investigators. And breaking tonight, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is officially resigning on May 11th. Best known for presiding over the Russia collusion witch hunts after then Attorney General Jeff Sessions needlessly recused himself.
Now, Rosenstein hired Robert Mueller and allegedly offered to spy and secretly record an incoming president and wear that wire, and may be even work to invoke the 25th Amendment. But in the end, even Rosenstein realized collision was a hoax. When it came to Russian interference in our elections, it was in fact the Obama administration. Yes, the Biden-Obama administration. This all happened on their watch. They dropped the ball.
Take a look.

ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: Previous administration shows not to publicize the full story about Russian computer hackers and social media trolls and how they relate to Russia's broader strategy to undermine America. The FBI disclosed classified information about that investigation to selected lawmaker and staffers. Someone selectively leaked information to the news media. The FBI director disclosed at the congressional hearing that there was a counterintelligence investigation that might result in criminal charges.

HANNITY: Now, predictably, Democrats refused to see the writing on the wall. As we speak, yes, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler is desperate to besmirch President Trump and everyone around him. Instead of actually legislating, no, that's not a part of their agenda. Nadler, his Democratic colleagues, they are now dedicating nearly 100 percent of their time to a never, ever, ever, ever, ever ending investigation surrounding an actual hoax. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });

            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, despite four separate probes now -- four, proving zero evidence of Trump Russia collusion, Nadler still frantically trying to conduct Capitol Hill interrogations on everyone in Trumps orbit. This week, Nadler wants to haul the attorney general, Barr, before the Judiciary Committee lawyers, not them, the lawyers.
Now, the attorney general wisely declining that invitation, said look, I'll only appear for an actual hearing with real committee members that I have oversight. Not some cross examination with your government lawyers on a mission to destroy President Trump. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And while the left continues to obsess over their sick collusion fantasy and their conspiracy theories, well, they are more than happy to ignore serious claims of corruption at the highest level of the federal government under Obama, and then thereafter. And tonight, Vice President Mike Pence, he is demanding an investigation into whether or not former Trump-hating lovebirds from the FBI, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, were plotting to infiltrate his staff in the West Wing.
And according to new text messages obtained by the senators, Chuck Grassley, Ron Johnson, high level FBI officials discussed the possibilities of, quote, developing potential relationships at a November 2016 briefing where presidential transition team staff -- in other words, Strzok and Page, well, they were trying to spy on incoming members of the Trump White House. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We had a report from Sara Carter now out, revealing that Pence's former chief of staff, Joshua Pitcock, actually was the top target for the scheme because his wife worked as an analyst for Strzok during the Clinton investigation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, Pitcock released a statement denying he ever had any contact with Strzok or Page. He emphasized that he never took any actions on their behalf.
Now, of course, that is just the latest example. High ranking FBI, Obama, DOJ officials aggressively investigating, and yes, spying, on the incoming president and his staff. And, of course, then candidate Trump before that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Of course, that's after they gave a rigged investigation into Hillary Clinton -- real crimes, Espionage Act, destroying subpoenaed emails.  Nobody ever heard of Bleach Bit before, and nobody ever heard about hiring aides to bust up your iPhones and your BlackBerrys and rip out the SIM cards. You did that? That would be called obstruction. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, from using informants on the campaign trail as well, rampant FISA abuse against Carter Page, spying on the Trump campaign that way, using that dirty Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier. Even "The New York Times" is now saying, oh, it might have been Russian disinformation. Bob Woodward is saying this dossier needs to be examined.
By the way, a little late, guys. We have been doing this for over two years.
That to the nearly 300 percent increase on unmasking requests in 2016 carried out by Susan Rice, oh, and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Powers. Why would she be unmasking anybody? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And as we mentioned at the very center of all of this, yes, Hillary Clinton's dirty, phony, unverified bought and paid for Russian lies, used as the basis for almost all of the deep state spying operations. Look at this Grassley letter from over a year ago. We know that President Obama, James Comey, Susan Rice, and others held multiple meetings in January 2017 about the misinformation, as "The New York Times" is suggesting, dossier.  Joe Biden even attended one of those meetings. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
As I told you last week, by the time this is all said and done, Creepy Crazy Uncle Joe and Obama himself will need to be answering some questions.  For example, what did they both know, and when did they know it? Just how long were they using campaign opposition research to spy on a candidate of the opposition party? Recently, former Obama deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, who looked pretty nervous when pressed about these very serious questions. Watch this bit. Take a look.

REPORTER: Do you think they are going to find anything with their investigation?
BEN RHODES, OBAMA DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: No, no, no. Look, I can be clear enough about this. We didn't know that there was an FBI investigation of Trump. I didn't. President Obama didn't. Like we don't -- we actually abided by the firewalls. If there were any investigations that took place, those decisions were made in the Justice Department, in the FBI, not in the White House. They will find nothing that suggests there was any political White House involvement in any of that.

HANNITY: Uh-huh, I'm going to take your word for it?
We'll have more on my opening monologue in just a minute. But, first, joining us with the very latest development surrounding the deep state's rampant abuse of power during President Obama's final months in office, our very own investigative reporter Sara Carter.
Sara, a lot breaking here. And as all of this information slowly now gets revealed, it is going to be a very different story.

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely, Sean. What we know now is that Senator Grassley, Senator Johnson had sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr, asking those very questions. They want him to probe deep into what was going on between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and the text messages that went between them, basically, looking to recruit potential sources within the White House. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think this is something that also other committees are looking into as well. Ben Rhodes, he spoke at Georgetown University. Nicholas Ballasy wrote that story, asking him very significant questions. What did the Obama White House know?
Now, Ben Rhodes has denied this completely. He is saying that the White House knew nothing, just as you said, but there's going to be a significant investigation. Remember, John Brennan, James clapper, James Comey, the former FBI director, are all very well aware of what was going on. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And according to sources that I have spoken with within the intelligence committee, there would be no way that Obama would not have been briefed on some of this, considering this was a potential candidate for the presidency during the beginning of the investigation, and then after he became president. So I think that there's going to be a lot of questions being asked and a lot of people having to answer them.

Remember, we promise you on this program, we will not stop. All of these bad, corrupt actors must be exposed. It cannot happen to future presidents. This abuse of power -- You cannot have rigged investigations with the FBI and DOJ.

        }
      
You can't have an attempt to spy on opposition party candidates using Russian lies all bought and paid for, but not tell FISA court judges.
That, and of course, using unverified material. There is no shortage of high-ranking government officials plotting to take down Donald Trump, clear Hillary Clinton, rigged the election in her favor. She did steal the primary from Bernie Sanders, yet with seemingly never-ending investigations into the Russia hoax still ongoing. The Democratic Party is fast becoming -- well, pretty much a laughingstock. The problem is it's serious.

BILL MAHER, HBO HOST: But this was our big gun. Now it just looks like you are stalking him.

HANNITY: Pretty much what is happening. Schiff isn't the only obsessed hater stalking the president. Recently, two-time presidential election loser Hillary Clinton, how ironic this is, appearing on Comedy Central to do some stalking of her own with the dramatic reading of the Mueller report. Well, rather a selective reading. Take a look.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Secretary Clinton, feel it. Feel it. Imagine like you have a history with this.
HILLARY CLINTON, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: OK. The investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and work to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally. The president slumped back in his chair and said, oh, my God, this is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I am (EXPLETIVE DELETED).

Now, by the way, I wonder what Hillary Clinton said when she found out that James Comey was reopening the case into her private email server? I wonder why Hillary didn't read the part in the Mueller report that cleared the president of all and any collision, or the part indicating that her dirty dossier, Russian lies, "The New York Times" is suggesting as part of a Russian disinformation campaign. And she spread it and her friends spread it, that rigged her investigation was total garbage. She didn't read that part. Pretty unbelievable. Pretty selective.

While the left continues to try and distract, we do have a president that is interested in keeping the progress of the country moving forward -- yes, to make America great. Don't wear a hat if you are a 16-year-old kid in Washington. The results are palpable.

Now, this is -- the media mob will never show you this, but our economy is booming. And the news you will not hear anywhere else, we know that in the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at an impressive 3.2 percent, outpacing all expectations. Oh, with a government shutdown.
Keep in mind, Obama never averaged at least 3 percent GDP growth in a single year, the only president ever to achieve that. This quarter of consumer spending increased to its highest levels now in nearly ten years.  In Pennsylvania, the unemployment level is now so low that some employers are going to local jails, hoping to fill vacancies when these guys get out of jail.

        }
      
And the president has slashed regulations. The biggest tax cut in history.  Finally, we are energy independent and a net exporter of energy for the first time in 75 years.
Our economy is breaking records. American lives are improving. President Trump is fulfilling his promise to make the country great again, and of the media mob is nowhere to be found except -- what does shiftless Schiff have to say again?
With us now, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan.
You know, there are 53 -- and I will start with the boss, Jim, although you used to be the boss until the (INAUDIBLE) took over. No pun intended. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Congressman Meadows, we got so much information. It really was the two of you, when you read these closed-door sessions. Strzok, and Page and Nellie and Bruce Ohr and all of these other people, and I thought Priestap was pretty revealing. And also, the White House counsel that actually thought Hillary should be indicted, information we didn't have. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But we have 53 more of those? Those closed-door testimonies to reveal?
REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: Yes. There's a lot more closed-door testimony, Sean. I think probably the biggest thing, very flattering to give Jim and I credit, but it's certainly a bigger team than that. I think what we will find is you had Ben Rhodes on there. We will find that he gets four Pinocchio's for his performance today, because the evidence would suggest that not only was he aware of it, but certainly the Obama administration was aware of it.
We know ten days after what we now know as Hurricane Crossfire, the investigation into Trump, that there was a briefing at the White House with Obama's chief of staff, and so to suggest that they didn't know anything is just not accurate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: You know, we learned in those closed-door sessions, Jim Jordan, even Strzok and Page, they're like, we can't make any decisions on the Hillary investigation. None whatsoever because the attorney general at the time, Loretta Lynch, odds matter, not an investigation. She was making all the decisions.
REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO: Right.
HANNITY: Now we are in the Department of Justice, at the head of the Department of Justice. How many meetings took place in the Oval Office?  One I know Biden was in, and when did Mueller know that there was no collusion, do we know that answer?
JORDAN: No, but what we do know is what Bill Barr said two weeks ago in front of the Senate Finance Committee. He said he is convinced that spying took place. There is a basis for his concern. He also said he felt that there was a lack of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI, and he used a term that we really haven't heard much, and that was unauthorized surveillance. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, I am convinced the attorney general wants to know the same thing that you and I, Mark, want to know and so many Americans. How did this all start? What was really the catalyst for this investigation? And did things happen in the realm of spying that were not authorized and should not have happened?
And I -- that's what I want to get to the bottom of, and that's where the American people want us to go.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: What are we going to get? We have the 53 other closed door sessions. We got the Horowitz report, Huber report. Now the attorney general investigates. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Jim, give us the list. You are a good list guy.
JORDN: Well, look, well, I say this about Ben Rhodes, him saying there is nothing there, I don't think Bill Barr thinks that, based on what he said a few weeks ago. And also when it comes to Ben Rhodes, remember, he is the same guy who told us that catalyst for Benghazi and the attack that took place there where four Americans gave their lives for our country. He's the same guy who told us it was all caused by a video, so I don't put a whole lot of weight and what he says.
What I do know is that this thing started clear back in July 31st, 2016.  And all kinds of crazy things were going on. What I do know is that an opposition research document was the basis to go get a document to do what?  Spy on a prison associated with the Trump campaign. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I do know those things happened, and it seems to be based on what Bill Barr said a couple of weeks ago, he thinks there maybe more there and he is putting it together to investigate that.
HANNITY: There are two ways that they spied that we know of because the dirty dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for was used as a backdoor, Congressman Meadows, into all things Trump campaign world through Carter Page. But they never told the FISA court and they never verify the dossier. Now, even Woodward and "The New York Times" are saying, that may have been Russian disinformation.
So, they got in that way before the election and used after the election to bludgeon the president. What about Stefan Halper? Who empowered him to meet Clovis, Papadopoulos and Page? Wasn't he spying on those people?
MEADOWS: Yes, listen, Sean. It's not -- it doesn't stop there. The real key to what Jim is talking about is the American people want us to get to the bottom of it. But more important than that, they want us to hold people accountable. And we are committed to doing that.
When we look at this, I think it goes back even before July 31st in 2016.  That much of this investigation, and the surveillance -- you can use the word surveillance. I use "spying", because I think at this point, that's more applicable to this particular situation. And it goes beyond infiltrating the vice president. You know, we see these text messages.  They were looking for intel each and every day to find what they could find, and ultimately, all they found was dossier that was not Russian information. It was Democratic Party disinformation. I think we ought to be clear about that.
HANNITY: Who are the other players besides Strzok, Page and Comey? Who were the other people? Now we know the attorney general has questions to answer. Now we know Biden was in these meetings. Obama was.
And we know that a high-ranking official that was writing Hillary on the secret email server was actually Obama. Does it go to him? Does it go to Biden? Does it go to Rice, Clapper and Brennan? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JORDAN: Well, we don't know. We certainly know I call the Comey cabal.  We certainly know Comey, McCabe, Baker, Scott, Page, I think Brennan and Clapper are in on this in some way. So, I think you have to look at those people, but it may be others. I just don't know.
HANNITY: What about Lynch?
JORDAN: Well, certainly, she is the head of the entire Justice Department.  She is the one after all who told James Comey to call the Clinton investigation a matter.
I think it's interesting, Sean, she told him to call the Clinton investigation a matter, when it was obviously an investigation. He complied with that. But he wouldn't tell the truth to the American people when the president said tell the American people, I'm not under investigation after Comey had told this to President Trump in three different times, and he wouldn't say that to the American people.
So he is willing to mislead them on the Clinton matter, and not on the Trump-Russia investigation. We will see, but I think all those people need to be examined.
HANNITY: Last question, Congressman Meadows, when do we get this information? When do we get FISA application? When do we get 302s, Gang of Eight?
MEADOWS: Yes, the president has guaranteed that he is going to declassify those things. I think Barr will set the time frame, but I think we finally looking at weeks, not months.

HANNITY: All right. And the Horowitz in May.
OK, thank you both.
I told you, it's coming cascading down. It can't be stopped at this point.  An avalanche.
Directly ahead, is Obama giving his former V.P. the cold shoulder? Newt Gingrich has reaction.
Later, Kellyanne Conway feuding with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez.  Kellyanne gives us her side of the story.
And how do they blame the single biggest pro-Trump, pro-Israel president in our history and how do they literally attack him for what happened in the synagogue and The New York Times treatment of Jewish people, their anti- Semitic cartoons? We will get to all of that tonight.

HANNITY: All right. The Democratic primary is off to a pretty rocky start, and the two front runners, Joe Biden, creepy Uncle Joe and Bernie Sanders are facing a little bit of reckoning as questions were all now about the coveted Obama endorsement. "The New York Times" is reporting that Obama had urged, well, crazy Uncle Joe not to run in 2016.
Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders is in some hot water tonight. New documents and footage reviewed by foxnews.com reveal that he has a history of praising violent socialist revolutionaries and policies such as forced land redistribution, like in Cuba.
With reaction and much more, the author of a brand-new book just out today, it is on hannity.com, Amazon.com, bookstores everywhere. It's called "Collusion." If that is not ripped from the headlines --
NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sometimes you get lucky.
HANNITY: By the way, if you're in New York or New Jersey, you're going be at Ridgewood book ends at 6:00 tomorrow Eastern.
Good to see you. How are you? I don't see you in studio much.
It was collusion. It was, now, "The New York Times," two and a half years of lying.

HANNITY: Now, they're saying, it looks like it was probably Russian disinformation.
GINGRICH: Is this going to be wild? It turns out that entire dossier was a plant by the Russians?
HANNITY: Mr. Speaker, they never verified it, and they used it in four FISA, and it was a backdoor of all of Trump campaign.
GINGRICH: If you knew Trump was bad, why would you verify it? It fit all of your previous beliefs.
HANNITY: You say that with a smile. That's an attempt -- remember, they leaked at "The Washington Post", David Corn --
GINGRICH: It's a coup d'etat. Trump's language when he interviewed you, you interviewed him I guess.

HANNITY: He interviews himself.
GINGRICH: It is sort of a two-way street. But his comments, the news media reacted to as they did because they are his enemies. This was an attempted coup d'etat. This was an effort by a group of people to undermine the choices of the American people because they had arrogated to themselves that they were morally superior and they had the right to deny us the constitutional system. That's what it was.
HANNITY: Here's -- I look at it in three different phases. Phase one, Hillary's investigation we know was rigged.
GINGRICH: Right.
HANNITY: Strzok and Page are laughing about it. The attorney general, it's a matter. It's not an investigation. And then the tarmac.
And, look, they are saying tough, they're all Democrats, the fix is in.
GINGRICH: Yes.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: They are saying that. Now, the next piece of it, the attempt to spy in the campaign to rig an election, with their favorite candidate that got off the hook, and then aftermath of which is to then undermine a duly elected president and bludgeon him with those Russian lies.
GINGRICH: I think that's exactly right. To have the nerve to calmly and methodically get everything out in the open. Let the American people see how sick the system has gone.
HANNITY: We know the people are going to have to be held accountable. You can't rig an investigation for your favorite candidate. You can present to a FISA court, one candidate's bought and paid for Russian dossier not verified, not tell the court that Hillary paid for it. They knew it. They didn't tell the FISA court.
GINGRICH: Right. You know, there was a report out I think today or yesterday, that 53 percent of American people think corruption is a major problem. Well, they are right. This is all a corrupt behavior by a power structure, part of the bureaucratic, part of a news media, part of the politicians and lobbyists, but of power structure that decided it could protect its favorite. It could destroy the person it dislikes. And it could do all of it all outside the law in a way that is clearly a total violation.
HANNITY: You are a great historian. How did this happen in America?
GINGRICH: The system has grown steadily and steadily more corrupt.
HANNITY: Do you --

HANNITY: Well, he was in the room.
GINGRICH: I think he was in the room. I think he knew it. And I think the fact is that Joe Biden and Barack Obama consciously sought to lie to the American people and to undermine the results of an election.
HANNITY: So you see this this cast of characters, many of which are even supporting the New Green Deal - eliminate the combustion engine, oil and gas, cows--

HANNITY: Don't tell anybody, it's our secret. But that's 2020 candidates are saying they support this.
GINGRICH: That's because nobody yet has gone to their districts and said let me explain how really stupid this is.
HANNITY: Well, OK. But you got to--
GINGRICH: Which I'm, frankly, lot of--
HANNITY: You got 100 Democrats in the Senate and the House that like it. You've got Presidential candidates that liked it. Who do you think it's good to--
GINGRICH: They're crazy.
HANNITY: --two question. Who's going to win this primary? Who do you think do you think - do you think it's Biden, do you think it's Sanders, do you think it's somebody else?
GINGRICH: Well, I actually, I am there to consider - I think is it Buttigieg--
HANNITY: OK. Yes, it's Buttigieg. Yes.
GINGRICH: Buttigieg.
HANNITY: Mayor Pete.
GINGRICH: I'm trying - I'm trying.
HANNITY: OK.
GINGRICH: I think he has the best chance, because he's the most like Jimmy Carter. That is, he's a blank slate. Everybody can pretend they like him without ever knowing what he really stands for. And he's clever. He'll always be like #3 or #4 until they'll - until they get to the vote.
HANNITY: OK. Who do you think would be the toughest for President Trump? Look, we always vote peace and prosperity. We've never had a better economy. Are you better off than you were four years ago?
GINGRICH: I know how much the President likes you and so I'm a little cautious to say this, because he would probably see this.
HANNITY: Oh, boy.
GINGRICH: Now, the biggest challenger to Donald Trump's reelection is Donald Trump.
HANNITY: Why?
GINGRICH: Because with a little bit of discipline and a little bit of focus, he would become unbeatable.
HANNITY: Have you - there's never been - and you're the great historian, you can correct me if I'm wrong. Somebody that is this much of a disrupter, iconoclast, I think his greatest gift is keeping his word. He fights - everything he said he would do, he's doing.
GINGRICH: Look, I keep telling people, Biden wants to run is Mr. Likable pleasant guy.
HANNITY: Yes.
GINGRICH: Trump is going to already run as Mr. Tough Guy who gets things done. The country's got to decide in real world. Do you want this nice, pleasant, doofus, who's not going to anything done? Or do you want this tough guy who has weaknesses, but by god, he gets things done?
HANNITY: What about the Biden-Obama record? 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, you heard me say that.
GINGRICH: I doubt if we'll get to that with Biden, because it's going to fall apart first.
HANNITY: So you think it's Buttigieg. If you had to guess today - Buttigieg.
GINGRICH: If I had to guess today its Buttigieg. Now you can play this later on the spot.
HANNITY: No, I'm going to play forever.
GINGRICH: --and laugh at me.
HANNITY: Well - OK we might do that just for fun. Well, collusion ripped up right out of the headlines. If you're in New Jersey book and 6:00 p.m. tomorrow, it cracks me up. This is a novel, but it's real life.
GINGRICH: That's right.
HANNITY: Mr. Speaker always good to see you.
GINGRICH: I do.
HANNITY: Thanks so much for being with us.
GINGRICH: Thank you.
HANNITY: All right. You won't believe. The New York Times it took them - what - four days to admit what they put in their newspaper was anti- Semitic, Joe Concha and Brooke Goldstein will be here. Also later Kellyanne Conway in a feud - yes, in Twitter spat with Congresswoman Ocasio Cortez. Kellyanne responds, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Tonight The New York Times facing wide condemnation. Look, at this. After publishing a beyond disturbing anti-Semitic cartoon - President Trump and Bibi Netanyahu in their international print edition - this was last Thursday.
Now in a weak note of apology Saturday - they waited till Saturday, meanwhile everybody saw this for what it was immediately - the paper blame "One editor working without any supervision or adequate oversight".
And then just this weekend, after more widespread condemnation, well, an anti-Semitic cartoon appeared in the international edition of the paper, also depicting - again, this is in the past. One of those back in, I believe, May.
Now Alan Dershowitz, is writing column for "The Hill" says "One of the weapons of hate against Jews deployed by Nazi Germany were cartoons and caricatures that depicted Jews as subhuman animals - often as dogs or spiders". And even worse, is the media's effort to lay blame on President Trump for Saturday's tragedy - what happened at the synagogue in Southern California.
How do you blame Trump when the guy wrote a manifesto that he hates Trump, hates Israel, hates Jews? Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOY BEHAR, HOST, THE VIEW: He's provocative. He gives dog whistles constantly to these people. Take responsibility for your actions Mr. President. You are the culprit.
BRET STEPHENS, SENIOR POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR, NBC NEWS: The whole tenor or the whole spirit of his politics gives these people what they see as a kind of permission.
MEHDI HASAN, COLUMNIST FOR THE INTERCEPT AND AL JAZEERA ENGLISH PRESENTER: We have a President who will not - not only acknowledge that we have an have an epidemic of white nationalist terror after New Zealand - he said just a few people. He's providing the mood music for it.
WALEED SHAHID, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, JUSTICE DEMOCRATS: This President has emboldened neo-Nazis and white nationalist in this country. And I think it's, frankly - that's it's time to say that.
JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST MSNBC: White nationalist say he has inspired them to take up for more public and aggressive stance in Trump's America.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now, we know about the suspect. In a pure act of evil, revealed in his manifesto - again, he hated Jewish people, the State of Israel. And all these people blaming Trump - hey, this guy hated Trump. We're continuing to pray, by the way, for the people of the synagogue, their community as well and the brave woman that stepped in front of a bullet to protect their rabbi.
Joining us now with reaction Media Reporter for The Hill, also a Co-Host of a - well, a Co-Anchor on WOR Radio in New York--
JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: Host.
HANNITY: and a co - yes, exactly, Joe Concha; along with Human Rights Attorney Brooke Goldstein. Dershowitz is right. What I got to do is Google Nazi, Germany cartoons and they all pop up - this caricature.
When Mohamed Morsi became the leader of Egypt after the Arab Spring initially, Former Head of Muslim Brotherhood, I kept saying, this guy once said, "Jews are descendants of apes and pigs. Obama is giving them cash and weaponry". And thankfully el-Sisi took over. How do you read this?
BROOKE GOLDSTEIN, HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY: I think what is so pathetic about The New York Times cartoon is that they're trying to have it both ways. On the one hand you have everyone in the liberal media who's saying, "Trump is inspiring this neo-Nazi movement.
And then you also have the same media publishing anti-Semitic cartoon showing that Trump is a blind Jew being led by a Netanyahu dog. We'll, get it you know straight, either he's a neo-Nazi or he's pro-Israel. Either he's fomenting anti-Semitism--
HANNITY: He's never been a--
GOLDSTEIN: --or he's the best friend that Jews never had.
HANNITY: He's never been a Pro - a more Pro president than Trump, as evidenced by the embassy, recognizing the Golan Heights as Israeli territory.
GOLDSTEIN: Totally indisputable. And what I find so incredibly offensive is that people are using this terrible tragedy against Jews praying and turning it into a partisan issue. Anti-Semitism is not a partisan issue and we have to resist politicizing it at every angle, whether it's fascism, neo-Nazism, Islamism, communism. It is a global epidemic. It has risen to the level of a global emergency.
HANNITY: By the way, The New York Times just responded to the second cartoon that we're talking about in the print edition of The New York Times last Thursday, "Clearly was an anti-Semitic, indefensible. We apologize as the publication. While we don't think this cartoon falls into that category, for now we've decided to suspend the future publication of syndicated cartoonist".
Does anyone - again how do you - look at this. This was - again they're running this stuff.
CONCHA: This isn't a blog that's being run out of somebody's basement. All right. This is the paper of record that has plenty of resources to make sure that these things don't get out into the public domain. And I keep hearing that they've apologized, I don't see anything Sean, in there, that's an apology to President Trump, that's an apology directly to the Prime Minister of Israel.
And, look, this whole thing around blaming President Trump for the synagogue shooting, the media needs to look at the way they're dividing the country. Morning Consult poll last year, 64 percent of voters say, the press is helping to divide the country, including 8 and 10 Republicans and even a majority of Democrats. Bad things happen under different kinds of Presidents.
HANNITY: This is the same media that lied to the American people for over two years, peddling bizarre conspiracy after conspiracy, breathlessly, hysterically reporting things that were not true.
CONCHA: It wasn't reporting--
HANNITY: Look what they did to Nicholas Sandmann, a 16 year old. They didn't make one phone call to see if it was true. And they went days. By the way Lin Wood is going to destroy these media outlets. He's - this kid is going to be a billionaire by the time this is done.
CONCHA: But the money that he is suing for - certainly. But bad things happened under Presidents - Republican and Democrat. The Boston bombing, Sandy Hook, Ferguson Baltimore riots under Obama; Virginia Tech under Bush; Oklahoma City and Columbine under Clinton.
And now we're trying to connect the dot back to this President when a bad thing happens, no I'm sorry. Social media fuels this stuff far more than anybody who's sitting in the Oval Office, Sean.
GOLDSTEIN: I think the bigger point here also is that you have the extreme Right and the extreme Left and now the mainstream media converge on one thing and that's Jew hatred anti-Semitism. And if there's anything we've learned from the rise of the Nazis in Germany, is that's how it starts - with the cartoons, with the laws.
HANNITY: Look at - well, there was an article in one of the European newspapers. Jews are leaving Europe because of the rise of anti-Semitism. Look, nobody here would condemn, by name Congresswoman Omar--
GOLDSTEIN: Right.
HANNITY: --for her virulent anti-Semitic statement.
GOLDSTEIN: Right. They are so quick to blame Trump, but they won't call out rising anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party.
HANNITY: Is your friends in the media that you cover?
CONCHA: They're making excuses or Ilhan Omar and my - our friends in the media were Alan Dershowitz he wrote this for "The Hill".
HANNITY: That was a powerful piece today.
CONCHA: --tremendous column. He's more passionate about this subject than anything.
HANNITY: Honestly, you're just standing apart in what you do. And great work by you as well. Thank you both.
GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.
HANNITY: Sad we got to keep our eye on this. All right. When we come back Kellyanne Conway in a feud with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, well, she will explain what that's all about and her side, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez now accusing Kellyanne Conway of questioning her faith following a Twitter exchange over the Congresswoman's alleged silence in the immediate aftermath of the Sri Lanka attacks. Here's now with reaction Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway.
You're never shy about responding, which I like, because when I was on social media I did the same thing a lot - maybe more than I should have even.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, Sean, I usually leave her alone. I'm not as prolific a tweeter as she is and some other people. I choose to live my life offline. I usually leave Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and some of these other freshmen like Ilhan Omar and Tlaib alone.
Because basically when they speak, it's a gift to conservatives and the Republican Party, when she holds forth about, "We can't have any more gas, we can't have any more cows, we can't have any more gas coming from cows". She says the world is going to end in the next 12 years. Doesn't seem to understand the way tax incentives work.
She got rid of Amazon and the 25,000 jobs is going to bring to New York and then said, "Well, we can't give away $3 billion to them". Meaning, she really didn't understand the way the tax incentives work. She said that the unemployment rate is so low because people have two jobs.
I mean all of this is, which is crazy, and she's being brushed back by none other than the Speaker Pelosi. Saying, "Hey, this class of voter can win in those safe Liberal Democratic districts". And "What are they? They're just five of them" - really brushing back some of these progressive freshmen.
Because Pelosi of course is under enormous pressure to actually produce and perform. And has a lot of more centrist moderate members who came to Washington and try to get things done.
But I really had a call her out here, because I'm on television shows and I'm asked constantly, "Why didn't Donald Trump say this? Why did you use that word? Where's this semicolon in his tweet, where I believe it should be".
And I said. "Hey, why - does anybody ask Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who you give the hero's welcome to?" All you fan girls ever bothered to ask her, why she is being completely silent on the massacre against Sri Lankans on Easter Sunday?
And I only asked that, because I had noticed that she had tweeted many times about the killings in the mosque in New Zealand. She had tweeted about other things. And I was on the same show condemning violence against people of all faiths.
I said specifically by name, the mosque in New Zealand, Emmanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, the Christians in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, the synagogue in Poway, California and on and on it went.
So we - and my boss, the President of United States and me and others we're condemning attacks on people of all faiths. People should feel safe at all times, but particularly when you're in your place of worship.
HANNITY: Yes.
CONWAY: So I'm not questioning her faith or anyone else's. But why was she silent? So she said on Twitter - I said it on a TV show on a different network. She said on Twitter, "Hey, I was away from tech. I was visiting my grandmother for Easter". I think that's wonderful. But the very next day, they were still picking through the rubble in Sri Lanka, looking for survivors or the deceased. She had time to tweet about her Netflix documentary about her.
And so I think that we all choose what we weigh in on. I'm the first to say people are not compelled to weigh in on everything--
HANNITY: No, I think you did the right thing.
CONWAY: --but those who seem to have opinion about all those things.
HANNITY: Look, the problem - there is problem though with her.
(CROSSTALK)
CONWAY: So it's not about her faith. It's about her selectivity.
HANNITY: Look, the problem is her New Green Deal. It's the fact that there's over 100 Democrats in the House and Senate and these presidential candidates are supported and everything's going to be free, and get rid of cows and airplanes and the combustion engine oil and gas - it's insane.
But the problem is, they play the innate fear of people. I have less than a minute. And the fear is - we promise - every worry in your life is gone. And I'm like, remember, keep your doctor plan and pay less, they never fulfill that promise, that's the scary part.
CONWAY: I think people are too smart for that. And by the way, speaking of the Green New Deal, she got a lot of - again, fanfare and hero's welcome for that. And then when they went to the actual vote in the United States Senate, not a single Democrat voted for it.
They were so cowardly, they voted present, including those, who are running for President said, "We must have a Green New Deal. This is the future. Yay". And then they didn't have the guts to even give an affirmative vote to it.
So a lot of these ideas sound great. They are sugar high, empty calories, free this, free that - Americans are too smart for that. When they hear that you're going to have free housing, free college, free health care, they know they're going to be the ones paying the bills someway, somehow.
We don't want to take - government takeover in medicine. We don't want to uproot their private insurance system and Medicare for All choices for none and so on.
HANNITY: All right, Kellyanne, I always great to see you. And thanks for what you're doing. When we come back, according to reports Kim Foxx, Chicago's top prosecutor, now being subpoenaed over her handling of the Jussie Smollett case, a new development breaking tonight, Trace Gallagher has a full report.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Chicago's top prosecutor Kim Foxx being asked to answer why she dismissed the Jussie Smollett case. Trace Gallagher has the latest. Well, that was after the Grand Jury moved expeditiously to move forward and pulled it back, Trace.
TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And now former Appellate Court Judge, Sheila O'Brien, Sean, is pushing for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the handling of the Jussie Smollett case.
O'Brien who says, "She has no agenda except finding the truth and restoring public confidence", has subpoenaed Cook County state's attorney Kim Foxx and her top deputy Joseph Magats to a hearing this Thursday.
O'Brien is trying to compel Smollett to appear at the hearing, but his attorneys are pushing back. And court documents show Sheila O'Brien is requesting that Kim Foxx, Joseph Magats and Jussie Smollett produce their files and documents to make sure they've not been altered or destroyed.
O'Brien's petitions as Foxx's actions created "An appearance of impropriety, a perception that justice was not served here. That Mr. Smollett received special treatment". Smollett's attorney say, "A prosecutor can only be appointed if the case is pending and this one is not", Sean.
HANNITY: All right, Trace, thank you for that update. Let not your heart be troubled. We will never be the destroy media mob. We will tell it straight. Oh, I guess Jason Chaffetz - no, no, no, maybe Ray Arroyo -- well, no, no, who is filling in for Laura tonight?
