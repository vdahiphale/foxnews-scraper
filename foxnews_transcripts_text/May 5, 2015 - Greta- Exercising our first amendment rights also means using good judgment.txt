Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. My message is simple: Protect our police. Do not recklessly lure them into danger - and that is what happened in Garland, Texas at the Muhammed cartoon contest.
Yes, of course, there's a first amendment right, and it's very important. But the exercise of that right includes using good judgment. Here is what Donald Trump told Neil Cavuto about Pamela Geller, the organizer of the Mohammed cartoon contest in Texas: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DONALD TRUMP: She's a provocateur. All she is doing is provoking and taunting people and this country has enough problems right now. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
NEIL CAVUTO: All right.
(CROSSTALK) 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRUMP: We have to be tough and we have to be strong. But you know what, Neil? We have to be smart, not dumb.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Donald said the event's organizer IS provocateur, but I have something else to add. It's one thing for someone to stand up for the first amendment and put his own you-know-what on the line. But here? Those insisting they were defending the first amendment were knowingly putting officers lives on the line - the police. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Everyone knew this event would unglue some who might become violent. And the police had no choice but to do their job and be there to protect against the violence. Police are like that. They do their jobs.
But was of it fair to the police, to knowingly put them at risk by this unnecessary provocation? I say no, and we are lucky none of the police officers lost his or her life. And that's my "Off the Record" comment.
