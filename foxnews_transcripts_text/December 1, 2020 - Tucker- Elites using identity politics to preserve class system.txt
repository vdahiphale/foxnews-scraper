TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. Happy December 1st. The year is almost over and thank heaven itis, 2020 has been tough on everyone. Americans are tired, frustrated, divided and angry. Eight months of non-stop crisis will do that to a country. Everyone could use a break.Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we're getting a break anytime soonbecause there's a new crisis on the horizon. We learned about it today.It's a bad one, we're sad to tell you. This is a threat that imperils the very existence of our nation. No, it'snot a mutated form of the coronavirus newly arrived from Asia. It's not anexotic new painkiller that will suddenly kill yet another hundred thousandAmericans in unfashionable little towns. It's not even another exodus of middle class jobs to China. It's worse thanany of that. The crisis is you and your sinfulness, your indelible personalbigotries. You are the threat to America. That news came today from the Mayor of Louisville, Kentucky. That mayor'sname is Greg Fischer. As a civic leader, it's fair to say that Greg Fischerhas not been a success. Louisville is a much worse place to live than itwas when he took over. So as a mayor, Greg Fisher has failed. It's undeniable. So he has found anew calling now. Greg Fisher is a public health expert. That's a job withfar fewer requirements and a much more lenient grading scale. Listen to Dr. Fisher describe our new pandemic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR GREG FISCHER (D), LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY:  Our systems are more thanbroken, they must be dismantled and replaced. That's why I'm announcingtoday I'm signing an Executive Order declaring racism, a public healthcrisis in Louisville. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So racism is a public health crisis says Greg Fisher. Dr. Fischerplans to attack this crisis with an Executive Order. Will masks helpcontain the spread of racism? They certainly haven't before, but we'll see.Maybe we won't see. The beauty of fighting racism, like fighting sadness or alienation orexistential dread is that there aren't very good measures of progress. Youcan't really know when you've won. The battle goes on forever. You'realways justified in fighting it, of course, by definition. In the war against racism, you are always the good guy. No one cancriticize your motives or even your competence. Compare that to normalpolitics, much easier. By conventional political standards, Greg Fisher isa disgrace. Two of Louisville's biggest employers just left his city. Huge numbers ofpeople are still dying from drug ODs. They had race riots over the summer. Louisville is a mess, and it's fair to say that Greg Fischer is at leastpartly responsible for that mess. Not surprisingly, Greg Fischer has nointerest in talking about that. He much rather talk about your racism. Sothat's what he's doing. It's an old trick, obviously. Al Sharpton doesn't pay his taxes, then hecalls you a bigot for asking him about it. But the tactic suddenly seemsmore popular than ever. You see it everywhere, all of a sudden. And there'sa reason, the more obvious it becomes that the people in charge are stupidand selfish, the more time they spend attacking you and the country they'resupposed to be leading. They divide us to keep us from noticing how awful they are. Andunfortunately, it works pretty well. And that's why they do it. Let's say you were incompetent, and you didn't want anyone to know youwere, what would you do? Well, your first task would be to destroy themeritocracy. That's a system that rewards people in this country for theireffort and their talents, as opposed to rewarding them for irrelevantcriteria like how they look. A meritocracy is the main threat toincompetent people. It keeps the incompetent from getting rich andpowerful, and so they hate it above all. That's why they're tearing itdown. So what does it look like in practice to tear down a meritocracy? Well, itlooks a lot like Joe Biden staffing a presidential administration. A recentpiece in POLITICO tells the story. According to POLITICO's account, theCongressional Black Caucus is demanding that Biden's select a blackSecretary of Defense, not a Secretary of Defense who is good at defendingAmerica, a Secretary of Defense with the correct skin color. Now, feminist groups are mad about this, says POLITICO, not mad because itwould leave the country vulnerable. No. Mad because they want a femaleSecretary of Defense. What do they want a female Secretary of Defense?Because they're females. The Secretary of Defense should look like them, because it's all aboutthem. Not about The Pentagon or the country or the military threats wemight face in the future. It is about identity, which is to say it's aboutnarcissism. When I see people in power, I must see myself. That's the demand. And not just the demand at The Pentagon. Here is how Vox covered therace to replace Steve Mnuchin at the Treasury Department, quote, "LaelBrainard, who is white is seen on Wall Street and by her skeptics on theleft as the most likely Treasury Secretary. Raphael Bostic, who would bethe first black and first openly gay Treasury Secretary is also receivingsome consideration." Vox went on to note that some quote, "HispanicDemocrats" are upset that there are, quote, "no Hispanic candidateslegitimately in the mix for the other three top jobs in the Bidenadministration." Got that? Hispanic, black, gay. Those are categories. They're not people,they're not individuals. This is about identity, not country. It's aboutbalkanization not unity. Straight white men are the enemy says the party led by one, and so it goes.It's hard to imagine anything uglier than this. It's hard to imagine a moreabrupt cul de sac. This doesn't go anywhere that you'd want to go. It endswith discord and worse, but it continues. Listen to "The Huffington Post's" account of the struggle to fill KamalaHarris's Senate seat in the State of California, quote, "Three main campsAND their subgroups are trying to influence California Governor Newsom,those advocating for a black woman, those advocating for a Latino and thoseadvocating for a member of the LGBT community," end quote. In other words,certain jobs for certain identities, certain skin colors have pre-prescribed roles. How is that different from a traditional test system? How is that betterthan the Jim Crow South? Those are fair questions, but no one ever askedthem. Instead, the media just applaud. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT REICH, AUTHOR, "THE SYSTEM: WHO RIGGED IT, HOW WE FIX IT":  I don'tremember a Cabinet or a senior appointment that are this diverse. JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST:  I suspect, he may well have one of the mostdiverse Cabinets in the history of this country. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The most diverse staff that a transition has everhad. DAVID AXELROD, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  He promised the mostdiverse Cabinet in history. AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST:  The most diverse ever assembled -- DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  And it could be the mostdiverse ever -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Assembling what is essentially the most diverse Cabinetin history. WENDY SHERMAN, FORMER ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE DURING OBAMAADMINISTRATION:  President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect KamalaHarris has the most diverse and competent team, a President and a VicePresident could possibly have. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So obviously, those people are unimpressive despite theircredentials, mindlessly repeating the latest corporate slogans, but listento what they're saying: diversity. That is the overriding goal of everyappointment. Notice what they don't say. No one ever explains what exactly diversity is,not with any precision or justifies that definition. No one dares to, andyet diversity is now required by Corporate America. Their definition ofdiverse, the NASDAQ, for example, has proposed new listing rules thatrequire companies to quote, "Have or explain why they do not have at leasttwo diverse directors, including one who self-identifies as female, and onewho self identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ plus."End quote. Not to be outdone, the bank, Credit Suisse announced today it has createdan index of 350, quote, "LGBTQ inclusive companies," and they will, ofcourse, be rewarded accordingly. Now think this through for a minute.There's a lot of money at stake here with these definitions and a lot ofpower that attaches. At some point, we're going to need highly specific ways to verify that thepeople who are benefiting from these categories deserve to, that they'reindeed women, whatever that now means or that they are legitimately LGBTQPlus. So what will that verification look like? Blood tests? Home monitoring?We'll find out at some point, unfortunately. Janet Yellen doesn't seem worried about that. Yellen is Joe Biden's pickfor Treasury Secretary and she is on board with all of it, mindlessly. Sheis rich enough to be. Yellen just explained that eliminating socialdisparities -- hard to define -- is a central goal of Federal economicpolicy going forward. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JANET YELLEN, BIDEN PICK TO BE TREASURY SECRETARY:  We risk missing theobligation to address deeper structural problems, inequality, stagnantwages, racial disparities in pay, job opportunities, housing, foodsecurity, and small business lending that deny wealth building tocommunities of color, gender disparities that keep women out of theworkforce, and keep our economy from running at full force. It's a convergence of tragedies. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Yes, so the idea is everybody pays money into the FederalTreasury, they will put you in jail if you don't. It's compulsory. They'lluse force if they need to. But only some people benefit, depending upon who Janet Yellen thinks shouldbenefit. So there's that. We should debate that. It's worth debating. But step back a few feet. What's more interesting is that everything youjust heard is the opposite of the actual truth. And if you're actually infavor of diversity, real diversity, you'll notice that. The diversitymeasures they are proposing won't make anything more diverse, just theopposite. These proposals are merely a way for the people in charge to hiremore of their friends. What you're seeing is an attempt to preserve and codify the class systemthat is already in place and unfortunately, that is growing more rigid bythe day. If you really wanted to flatten America's social structure, and we wantthat, and you should, too, because again, class systems are bad, and we nowhave one -- if you wanted a flatter society, you would demand a return tomeritocracy. You'd want a system where anyone, no matter where they wereborn, or what they look like, or who they slept with, could succeed. That'swhat we used to have. It's why we were proud of America. But it's the opposite of what the left is now demanding. So if you reallywanted to make companies more diverse, and again, we are for that, youwould try to actually diversify them. That means you would hire people whoare not in any sense, like you, people with different backgrounds, actuallydifferent backgrounds. You'd hire more people with technical degrees, for example, and fewer whohad studied marketing or communications. You'd find people who lived inrural zip codes, deep in rural zip codes. You'd seek out employees who aredeeply involved in their churches or owned guns, or who had close familymembers who died of opioid ODs. And more than anything, on day one, you would put a cap on the number ofemployees who went to elite colleges. Let's just start with the top hundredon the U.S. news annual list. You would outright ban Harvard, Yale,Princeton, and Stanford graduates completely. They've got enoughrepresentation to last for the next half century. You'd make any previous employment at McKinsey & Company or any otherabsurd consulting firm, instantly disqualifying. You would look beyond raceand sex to the cultural markers that actually matter and that actuallydetermined later success in a class system. You would subtract points from any applicant who had ever spent the nightin Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard or St. Bart's and you would add points toapplicants who vacation in Branson or Lake Mead, or the Florida Panhandle. You would start an aggressive Affirmative Action Program for fat people,for deer hunters, for anyone who drives an American car or eats dinnerwhile wearing a hat. Are those people represented on corporate boards? Idon't think so. Find a fat person in Corporate America, there's not one.Why is that? You know why. Our leaders are doing precisely the opposite of any of that, and it tellsyou everything. What you're seeing is the ruling class, pulling up theladder, as they always do, as all ruling classes do. How many of the peoplelecturing you about diversity come from exactly the same elite background?Well, pretty much all of them. So what they're advocating for is people just like themselves. We can giveyou a thousand examples. I'll just pick one, take Marcus Mabry. He runsGlobal Digital Programming at CNN, he has been in journalism forever. He's now one of CNN's most energetic diversity enforcers. Mabry never endsa sentence without using the word diverse. That's his job. And here's theinteresting part. He himself went to high school at Warrensville Academy.He got two degrees from Stanford. Then he spent decades at "Newsweek," "TheNew York Times" and Twitter. So naturally, he claims to be highly concernedabout inclusion. Listen to him from just a few years ago, lecturing histhen employer about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARCUS MABRY, VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL PROGRAMMING FOR CNN DIGITALWORLDWIDE:  There is a lot of work to do at Twitter and throughout tech,and it is one of the reasons I came to Twitter was I think it's soimportant that we're at the table. It was true at "The New York Times" too. We have to make more of us. We have to create more of us. Not just African-American, but also Latino and Hispanics who are very much alsounderrepresented in technology and at Twitter, and Twitter can -- I'mconvinced our current leadership is committed to improving that diversity,but there's a lot of work to do. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  There's a lot of work to do to make sure that more of us are atthe table. People who went to Lawrenceville and got a Master's degree atStanford. They're not enough. We're underrepresented. Marcus Mabry, now on the Board of one of the most expensive boardingschools in the world is fighting the man. Of course, he is. It's workingfor him. It's working for all his friends. It's just not working for you and it's not intended to. You are excludedfrom their inclusion. But you knew that. Saagar Enjeti is chief Washington correspondent at "The Hill." We're happyto have him on tonight. Saagar, I just can't stop marveling at how thediversity efforts are all designed to harden the pernicious class systemthat we already have in place, to reward the friends of the people incharge and hurt people who aren't in the in-group. SAAGAR ENJETI, OPINION HOST, "THE HILL":  You absolutely nailed it, Tucker.So here's something that they don't want you to know, the racial wealth gapin America is almost entirely concentrated between the top 10 percent ofwhite people and the top 10 percent of black people. In fact, 75 percent ofwhites and blacks make approximately the same amount of money. Now, they don't want you to know that because that would have be dealingwith people like Mr. Mabry, who you just talked about, and the wealth gapsbetween him and maybe somebody like Jeff Bezos. Now they're both probablyin the top one percent of American incomes. But they want you to think thatsolving the racial gap between those two individuals is actual progress inAmerica. Meanwhile, average American whites, blacks, Hispanics, everybody is leftbehind in the cold. They want everybody to think in false economic terms inorder to keep everybody down, divide everybody by race, so you don't evenask a question about class. CARLSON:  That's exactly right. And if you really wanted diversity, and Ijust can't say this enough, I'm for it. I'm for workplaces. I'm for asociety where people are judged by what they do, where people havedifferent experiences, I'm totally for that. What we're seeing isuniformity. But if you wanted diversity, why wouldn't you just say, I'm not hiringanybody else who went to an Ivy League school. Period. Why won't they dothat? ENJETI:  Well, they can't do that, Tucker, because that's how they preservethe neoliberal order that we have right now. Take Joe Biden, for example.Right. Let's see his three historic picks for Secretary of Defense. MicheleFlournoy, well, she had an influence peddling firm here in Washington inorder to help expand Fortune 500 companies market access to China. Je Johnson. Oh, he is a Board member over at Lockheed Martin Corporation. Lloyd Austin, historic black general, right? Yes, he's also an adviser toPine Island Capital Partners, which is a hedge fund, which raised $218million after Joe Biden was elected on November 3rd. And guess what? That$118 million is staked on betting on expanded market access in the militaryand artificial intelligence space. So if he was Secretary of Defense, he would literally create newopportunities which the hedge fund that he advises would then go and makemoney from. What did I just tell you there? They're all historic choices,right? CARLSON:  A hedge fund general is a victory for diversity. I don't thinkI've heard it explained more succinctly or better than you just did and Iappreciate that. Saagar Enjeti, great to see you. ENJETI:  Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON:  So one of the hallmarks of incompetence is a total refusal toabide by your own standards or even acknowledge that universal standardsexist and we see that everywhere. Gavin Newsom, governor of our biggest state just violated his owncoronavirus rules to attend a dinner at one of most expensive restaurantsin the world, we should say it's a great restaurant. We are learning tonight, he was not the only politician in California tobreak those rules. Bill Melugin, one of the best reporters in the state. Heis with FOX LA has a story for us tonight. Hey, Bill. BILL MELUGIN, REPORTER, FOX LOS ANGELES:  Hey, Tucker, good evening to you.We're talking about LA County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, and I was tipped offabout this by several people in the restaurant industry who are less thanpleased because they say this is yet another glaring example of hypocrisyfrom our local politicians. So talking about Supervisor Kuehl, rewind the clock to last Tuesday. That'swhen she voted to outright ban all outdoor dining here in LA County for all31,000 of our restaurants and the reason she did so is she said it was justtoo dangerous to continue allowing it. Take a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) SHEILA KEUHL, LA COUNTY SUPERVISOR:  And then there's the issue of the sixfoot distance. It's a bit of magical thinking on everyone's part to thinkthat at any restaurant anywhere, the server keeps a six foot distance fromthe table where he or she is taking an order. So the servers are not protected from us, and they are not protected fromtheir other six tables that they're serving at that particular time, plusall of the hours in which they're working. So it is a most dangeroussituation for them. (END VIDEO CLIP) MELUGIN:  A most dangerous situation she describes it. Well, evidently shedidn't think it was that dangerous because we confirmed that just hoursafter she made those statements and hours after she voted to shut downoutdoor dining, she came right behind us here to Il Forno, a restauranthere in Santa Monica where guess what? She dined outdoors doing exactlywhat she had said three hours beforehand was too dangerous to do. Can youbelieve it? We reached out to her staff about it. And she told us that yes, she atethere. But she went there because she felt bad for the restaurant becausethey're losing their finances during the pandemic and she wanted to stop byone last time to support them before the ban went into effect on Wednesdaynight. But that's entirely beside the point, because just hours before she hadsaid it was just too dangerous to eat outdoors, and then few hours later,she is eating outdoors. As you can imagine, restaurant owners out here areabsolutely furious about this. They say this is just another example of theongoing hypocrisy with our leaders. They say, look, she either believes outdoor dining is dangerous or shedoesn't. She isn't listening to her own messaging and that's why there's somuch frustration with the public tuning folks out. So to wrap this up, we've been trying to get an interview with SupervisorKuehl all day long today. And they've been telling us, her camp has beentelling us, she is too busy. She's in meetings all day long. Well, it turns out that's not true because she just had an interview withanother affiliate here in LA where she is playing the victim andessentially said she is getting death threats and that she came herebecause she wanted to personally deliver the news to the restaurant thatwas going to put them out of business. Strange explanation. Tucker, we'll send it back to you. CARLSON:  Oh, it's so good. Bill, I hope your reporting gets the attentionit deserves in California. It's just devastating. Thanks for joining ustonight. So the people in charge are buying $60.00 entrees in restaurants you're notallowed in. Major American cities are actually falling apart. Crime now hithistoric levels across the country. No one is following this more closely than Heather Mac Donald. She joins usafter the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  The City of Seattle, one of the nicest places in our country isbeing destroyed by the people who run it. Seattle marked its 55th murder ofthe year yesterday, that's set a new 10-year record, but that hasn'tstopped the mayor of Seattle, Jenny Durkan from supporting a new citybudget that will reduce the budget for the police department by nearly 20percent. Hard to believe that. Meanwhile in San Jose, California officials have learned that an illegalalien who allegedly went on a deadly stabbing spree at a local church hadbeen deported three times in recent years, and apparently came back to stabpeople. In a lot of places in this country, the violence is completely out ofcontrol. It's crushingly sad, and it's causing massive demographic changesin this country. People are fleeing. We've got to stop this. How can we dothat? Heather Mac Donald is a Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, author ofthe book "The War on Cops," we're happy to have her always and especiallytonight. Heather, thanks for coming on. What do we do about this? HEATHER MAC DONALD, SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE:  Well, we changethe narrative, what we're seeing with these -- we're going to see thebiggest one-year increase in homicides and shootings in this country,Tucker, in decades and that's a predictable result of a fatal lie whichholds that policing is systemically racist. Joe Biden embraced that lie during his campaign. He has embraced it afterthe election and it will become the touchstone of his Justice Department. It is completely untrue. The problem in this country is criminals, notcops; cops are the solution. But as long as you go about telling copsincessantly, as we heard in Seattle, as we've heard in Louisville, inChicago, New York, you name it, that cops are racist for going aftercriminals, they are going to back off. Cops in this country aredemoralized. They are defunded. They are being assaulted on a daily basis, and when cops back off ofpolicing, you don't get some Pacific Nirvana, some post racial Nirvana, youget anarchy and chaos. Last month in November, there was a five-year-old boy in Chicago who wasshot in the head in his home by a thug who drove by and just sprayedbullets willy-nilly at the house. You had a cop last week who was draggedafter a car stop fracturing his skull in three places. This is not going tostop, Tucker, unless more people stand up and say the cops are not theproblem, they are the solution. CARLSON:  It seems like any politician who is awake and not a guilty, whiteliberal as so many of them are in both parties would understand that peopleof all colors and background support order and hate violence. So, whyaren't there more politicians rushing forward to take advantage of thisopportunity? MAC DONALD:  It is completely bizarre. It turns out that ideology trumpscommonsense, and it trumps for a very long time people's own sense ofcomfort and their own desires because a lot of these politicians who havebeen demonizing the cops have been re-elected because people would ratherembrace the idea that they are alone in fighting racism. It makes them feelvirtuous. And frankly, the other reason Tucker, is the vast majority of crime ishappening in inner city neighborhoods. It's the class divide that youtalked about before. It's also a race divide. This isn't going to changeuntil white kids start getting shot in their homes at night. CARLSON:  Yes, it's really a sick religion. It's all over the Anglo world,too. It's not just the United States. There's something really dark goingon. Heather Mac Donald, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thank you. MAC DONALD:  Thank you, Tucker. CARLSON:  You might not be thrilled about the prospect of a Joe Bidenpresidency, but the Communist Party of China is. We have the tape thatproves that. We'll discuss with Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North who joinsus after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  A man called Jake Sullivan is Joe Biden's pick to be the nextNational Security adviser, unlike General Michael Flynn, it's likely hewill not be targeted for destruction by the F.B.I. anytime soon. JakeSullivan is a veteran of the Obama administration and the Hillary ClintonCampaign so we are safe. He's also made it very clear that he's not going to upset our corporatemasters in China. He likes them. They probably like him, too. In 2017, Sullivan said that what's good for China is good for Americans.Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, BIDEN'S PICK AS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  So I think thatthe Europeans do have to think very hard about taking a larger role in aproject that the United States has been engaged in for some time, which isdoing everything we can to both facilitate and encourage China's economicrise and to support it because a thriving China is good for Europe. It'sgood for the United States. It's good for Asia. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  He is a child: unimpressive, unwise, a mediocrity, like so manyof them. Based on that, potentially a real problem for the country. Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North's publishing company just released a bookthat assesses the threat in its totality that we now face from China. Thebook is called "America's Number One Adversary and What We Must Do about itnow." We're happy to have Colonel Oliver North join us tonight. Colonel, thanks so much for coming on. So this is a long topic, a bigsubject. LT. COL. OLIVER NORTH (RET), U.S. MARINE CORPS:  Good to be here, Tucker. CARLSON:  But to sum it up for us, what is the threat that you think weface from China? NORTH:  Well, there's a whole bunch of them. The fact is Communist China isdominated by a guy who happens to be the Chairman of the Communist Party ofChina. Behind him, he has got a politburo that guides him. But this guy isa major threat to the United States and instead of encouraging the rise ofChina, what they ought to be thinking about and doing in thisadministration, if they come to town is conferring with a man who wrotethis book because they know what it's like, they helped bring down the evilempire, the Soviet Union for Ronald Reagan. Now, Xi Jinping is probably very happy that Biden is preparing to move into the White House. With the backing of his politburo, he has absolutepower. He runs everything in Russia and everything in Russia is aimed atdomination of the rest of the planet. The PRC now has more naval combatantsthan the U.S. Navy. The theft of intellectual property threatens our national security. That'show they got the Navy they've got today. It allows tons of illicit drugs tobe exported to other nations around the world. He has set up a globalString of Pearls going all the way back to the 1980s. All of this has beendone with these guys in Djibouti, Panama Canal, and Gwadar in Pakistan. Thefalse territorial claims over open seas and the erection of manmademilitary bastions provide visual proof of his determination. But even more menacing is the PRC's overt and covert actions to thwart U.N.sanctions against Tehran. That basically ensures that the ayatollahs ofIran are going to obtain nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them. There's credible evidence that the Communist Party in China wasinstrumental in the worldwide spread of COVID-19. Religious freedom inChina is non-existent. Democracy in Hong Kong has been crushed. Theeconomies of dozens of developing countries, particularly in Africa, arethreatened by Beijing's so-called Belt and Road Initiative. And here at home, the PRC's campaign of disinformation to these ConfuciusInstitutes near major universities provides disinformation that encouragesMarxist and anarchist vandals to loot and burn. As the authors of this book make very clear, 70 recommendations by thesethree God-fearing men who wrote the book, bring decades of matchlessexperience regarding the question. And what Jake ought to be doing istalking to these guys instead of the Communist Chinese because if Xisucceeds, this is going to be a planet run just like George Orwell said,with all their surveillance and our kids deserve better, Tucker. CARLSON:  They certainly do. Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North for ustonight. Thanks so much. Good to see you. NORTH:  Pleasure, Tucker. CARLSON:  So there's evidence tonight that not everybody is on board withcontinuing the lockdowns, given the degree to which they've destroyed thecountry already. Some Republican lawmakers in the State of Ohio have justfiled impeachment articles against their Republican Governor over therestrictions he is imposing. We will speak to one of those legislatorsafter the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. MIKE DEWINE (D-OH):  If the current trend continues and cases keepincreasing, we will be forced -- we will be forced to close restaurants,bars and fitness centers. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So that's the Republican Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, a formerUnited States Senator. A lot of people in Ohio didn't like what he saidtoday. What's so interesting is that the reaction didn't break alongpredictable partisan lines. That's why we're telling you about it tonight.Today, four of DeWine's fellow Republicans in the state filed a dozenArticles of Impeachment against him. They say the Governor violated stateand Federal law by forcing people to follow his corona laws with nooversight. John Becker is a State Representative in Ohio. He's a Republican, he isleading the impeachment effort and we're happy to talk to him tonight. Mr.Becker, thanks so much for coming on. Tell us why -- I mean, it takes a lot, I would think in a state like Ohio,a Republican state for a Republican to file Impeachment Articles against aRepublican Governor. Tell us why you're doing that. JOHN BECKER (R), OHIO STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  Well, I think first off,Tucker, hey, thank you for inviting me on to the program. Really appreciatethat. CARLSON:  Of course. BECKER:  Yes, I mean, this was hard to do. I mean, what we found are thingsare kind of flipped in Ohio where the Democrats are in lockstep supportbehind this Republican Governor, and it's the Republicans and theconservatives that are all up in arms with what he is doing and that's alot of unconstitutional mandates and, you know, violating constitutionalrights, civil rights and statutory rights. You know, we tried to work with the Governor. He has threatened to vetoevery bill that interferes with the power that he has seized and he hasn't-- he has vetoed one bill and he has promised he's going to veto anotherbill this week that has been passed by the General Assembly. It is unclearif we have the votes to override those vetoes. And then I thought, well, the only thing we can do is impeachment. It iscertainly not something I want to do, but it is something he can't veto andit only takes a simple majority in the House to get it over to the Senatewhere it takes two thirds for removal. CARLSON:  So you're a state legislator, you're in the State House, and itsounds like your Governor, like so many governors doesn't think that he issubject to legislative oversight, that he is all of a sudden capable ofmaking any rule he wants, just because he wants it. BECKER:  Oh, you're absolutely right. I mean, he has taken dictatorialcontrol. He's kind of known as the Imperial Governor. And he's going tocontinue to, you know, stick his thumb in the eye of the General Assemblyand for as long as he can get away with it. So you know, for as long as I'ma State Representative, I'm going to be trying to stop him. And as a private citizen, something we've been doing in Ohio and 20 of the88 counties so far is filing what's called private citizen affidavits.That's seeking criminal charges against the governor. So you know, we'reputting pressure on him every way we can. CARLSON:  Well, it's clearly coming from principle not partisanship. So wewanted to highlight it tonight. Representative Becker, thanks for comingon. BECKER:  Oh, thank you, Tucker. Really appreciate it. CARLSON:  We saw kind of a shocking story today that the Pastor at theCommunity United Methodist Church in Pasadena, Maryland, got a citationlast month from state officials concerning his compliance with corona law.So we reached out to the Health Department in Anne Arundel County inMaryland for an explanation. They told us they'd receive complaints of quote, "hand shaking, high fives"and get this "fist bumps by the congregation." Now, that's illicit worshipin the State of Maryland -- hard to believe this is American, but it is. Sothey swooped in to put an end to that, the fist bumps especially. Is it legal for our government, to police how Americans still protected bythe Bill of Rights, worship their God in church? Reverend Dennis Jackson is the Pastor at Community Methodist Church. We'rehappy to have him on tonight. Pastor, thanks so much for joining. REVEREND DENNIS JACKSON, PASTOR, COMMUNITY METHODIST CHURCH:  Tucker, thankyou so much. And let me just say this is the first I've ever heard or seenof anything like that going on in the context of our church services orworship, I mean, we are very much sticking to social distancing, everybodyhas to wear a mask. We have hand sanitation stations, right as you come into the lobby, andalso right before you went to the sanctuary. We have pews marked off tomake sure that we keep distances. We have pews marked out that I think it's20 or 30 feet from the pulpit to make sure that we stay far enough away. I mean, I'm not sure who saw what, but I wonder if they were in a differentplace than the church that I serve in. CARLSON:  Well, I mean, it is a church and you are explicitly protected:worship, religious worship is explicitly protected in the First Amendmentto the Constitution. So I'm wondering, did your Governor Larry whatever hisname is, jump in on your side here? JACKSON:  The Governor, I've not heard anything from nor from the AnneArundel County Executive about anything like this, I was told there was ananonymous complaint filed to the Arundel County Health Department, theofficial that came out was very authoritarian and never referenced any ofthe things that you highlighted. And if I had seen something like that, I would have encouraged verystrongly people not to, to participate in such a thing is that. That'sclearly for many reasons not appropriate. But we want to maintain religious freedom and the ability to worship. Imean, I'm preaching at nine o'clock in the morning in the back of a truckin the parking lot just so people can gather to worship. CARLSON:  Yes, I know you're doing your best and it's shocking that you'rebeing harassed like this, so many Christian churches are and OrthodoxJewish congregations as well. Reverend Dennis Jackson, I appreciate you coming on. Thank you. JACKSON:  Thank you. CARLSON:  Well, just before the election, a well-known businessman by thename of Tony Bobulinski came forward with some hard evidence, actualevidence, including documents and phone conversations that told us a lotabout the Biden family's lucrative overseas influence peddling operation,including in China. It's real and significant. But the story went nowherebecause no one else reported on it. We will tell you what we've learned,next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  In the days before the presidential election last month, aninternational businessman called Tony Bobulinski came forward with anamazing story. It corroborated verifiable evidence about the Biden family'slongtime overseas influence peddling operation. According to one among many e-mails produced by Bobulinski, Joe Bidenhimself may have personally received equity in a company directly linked tothe Communist Party of China. No one else in the media wanted to talk toTony Bobulinski. Here's part of the interview that we did with him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TONY BOBULINSKI, FORMER BUSINESS AFFILIATE OF HUNTER BIDEN:  In that e-mail, there's a statement where they go through the equity. Jim Biden isreferenced, as you know, 10 percent, it doesn't say Biden, it says Jim, andthen it has 10 percent for the big guy held by H. I, a thousand percent sit here and know that the big guy is referencing JoeBiden. That's crystal clear to me because I lived it. I met with the formerVice President in person multiple times. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So the news media along with Silicon Valley disappeared thatstory immediately. If you're looking for election interference, there yougo. It is claimed it was Russian disinformation, and they censored it. But there are new reasons to believe the blackout cannot last forever.Steve Krakauer is the founder and editor of the "Fourth Watch" podcast. Hejoins us tonight to explain. Steve, thanks so much for coming on. It seems to me that the story ofBobulinski told, which is true, raises a lot of questions that afunctioning news media would now be taking up and exploring, will they? STEVE KRAKAUER, FOUNDER, "FOURTH WATCH":  Yes, I mean, you would think so.Right? I think one of the worst traits we've seen in the last few years andthis actually predates the Trump era, I would say is this lack ofcuriosity? You know, one of the most noble traits the media used to havewas they were curious. They would go and explore and find out. Well, this was a story that was -- really the timing was not right for themedia to start exploring it. So okay, fine, you know, we got basicallyblacked out. Will they go back and do it? I don't know because one of themost interesting things about that story was like this tell that I saw withit. This media loves fact-checking. They are obsessed with checking facts now.That story wasn't really fact checked. It was just ignored. And that'susually a sign that there's something there that they're just not going toreally start to touch on because it can't be, you know, fact checked away. So it would not be shocking if six months, nine months down the road, weget a little bit of coverage of it, because then all of a sudden, it's not-- you know, the story -- the heat is off a little bit, and they canactually go explore it and actually find out the truth about it. CARLSON:  I mean, at the heart of the story is the communist government ofChina, which by any analysis is America's chief global rival. It seeks todisplace the United States as leader of the world. So how could you ignorethat story under a Biden administration? KRAKAUER:  Right, yes, I mean, you look at the last four years, the Russiacollusion story. You couldn't get thinner information to start putting outthere to the public and to find all kinds of threads to start to weavethere. All of it turned out to be completely, you know, not true. Well, this is a story that, you know, now we're dealing with China, nowthat we're dealing with a Biden administration. I do wonder if there is some media outlets that start to explore it as theyget going into the into 2021, as the heat is off from the election,because, you know, clearly this is a story that's going to be relevant forthe American public and it should be. And, you know, we saw what happened during the election and the lead up tothe election with the way that this the story was handled, and essentiallyignored. Now, do they go back and do it now that the heat's off a littlebit and actually explore the Hunter Biden story? I certainly think theyshould and I wonder if they do. CARLSON:  I can't resist asking you this. It's probably a longer answer.But four years from now, how many of these media organizations still exist?How many go under between now and then? KRAKAUER:  Yes. No, it's such an interesting question, because, you know,Donald Trump, for all of idea that they were in this existential fight withDonald Trump, man, he was good for business. And if Donald Trump is gone, and you know, January 20, 2021, and isessentially not, you know, out of public life, but certainly out ofpolitical life, what happens here between that, between the changing waysof, you know, legacy media is just losing power, left and right, the riseof tech companies, and that's certainly hurting business as well. No, I think the establishment media starts to go under, and I also thinkoutlets that are more digital first that maybe saw a nice little bump overthe last few years, but really can't sustain in the way that it needs tobecause, you know, you've got these large media operations that you know,half of them were like, resistance reporters, what are they going to donow? I mean, they have literally no beat anymore. So I do think that they're going to see absolutely a decline in that. Wheredo they go from there? What is the interesting story? Where is thecuriosity going to be when it comes to the next four years? I don't know. Ithink we're going to have to find out. CARLSON:  Institutions that corrupt can't continue forever. The Ottomanscouldn't. Hopefully "The New York Times" follows in their path. SteveKrakauer, great to see you. KRAKAUER:  Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON:  Thank you. Well, that is it for us tonight, another hour gone. Thank you for joiningus. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the total andsincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Coming up next, from New York, the Great Sean Hannity. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
