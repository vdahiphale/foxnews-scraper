TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. I hope you had a great and relaxing Thanksgiving weekend, away from theendless drone of news. If you somehow managed to pull that off, a few daysof peace and happiness with the ones you love, you found it was like a spatreatment. You're obviously better off for it. But you also may be wondering what happened? What did you miss over theweekend? And we're here to tell you. For starters, Joe Biden broke his foot in a couple of places. It soundsserious, but don't worry about it. Biden was just out playing with his dogas healthy, vibrant adults in full command of their faculties are not atall fragile and fading often do. It could have happened to anyone.Seriously, it's totally normal. CNN, in fact wrote a piece congratulating Biden for it. Biden's injuriesare far better than Donald Trump's. So don't ask questions. You've gotbigger stories to worry about in the news landscape. For example, did you hear that Joe Biden picked women to lead the WhiteHouse Communications Office? That was a historic moment. Nothing like thathas happened in this country since the presidency of Donald Trump. Anothertriumph for the forces of identity. Systemic sexism finally in retreat.Nothing can stop Joe Biden from smashing the glass ceiling, not even hisdog. So that's what you missed. Oh, and one other thing. The country's public health establishment hastortured your children for eight months for no apparent reason. Thathappened. That story has not received a lot of coverage, but it has beenconfirmed tonight. The authorities have admitted 60 million Americanchildren languishing in their rooms since spring, sitting in front ofscreens, learning nothing, isolated from human contact, in many casesdriven to mental illness. We can now report there was no reason for any of that. The experts werewrong. They had no idea what they were doing. But the most amazing part --and this really is the headline of the story -- is that they knew they werewrong when they did it. But they kept lying about it, even as Americanchildren began to kill themselves. On Sunday in New York, city officials all but admitted this. They announcedthe reopening of elementary schools. Those are the same schools that theyclosed fewer than two weeks ago. Now, from a medical standpoint, nothinghas changed. New York didn't get an early shipment of the Pfizer vaccine.There wasn't some groundbreaking new research paper that revolutionized ourunderstanding of the coronavirus, nothing like that at all. In fact, parents simply had enough and they forced Bill de Blasio to admitthe obvious. This virus is not a threat to children. As de Blasio put it inthat weird euphemistic way that dumb people speak, quote, "We know that thehealth realities for the youngest kids are the most favorable." Well, yes,we do know that. We've known it for a long time. We knew it when Bill deBlasio shut down New York schools. And Tony Fauci knew it, too, though he didn't say anything about it. Now,he has decided to say something about it eight months late. Here's AnthonyFauci on Sunday. And as you watch this, keep in mind that this man on thescreen is leading our response, America's response to the coronavirus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES:  Close the bars and keep the schools open is what we really say.Obviously, you don't have one size fits all. But as I've said in the past,and as you accurately quoted me, the default position should be to try asbest as possible within reason to keep the children in school or to getthem back to school. If you look at the data, the spread among children and from children is notreally very big at all. Not like one would have suspected. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Oh, I've always said you should keep the schools open says theman in charge of America's coronavirus response to a nation whose schoolshave been closed for months. Right. Yes, I always said that. Check thetape. Because, quote, "If you look at the data," says Anthony Fauci. But wait a second. Why is this just now occurring to Tony Fauci? Isn't thisFauci's entire job to quote, "look at the data"? Yes, it is. And yetsomehow he never thought to do that. That's our corona czar. Over the summer when the data look the same as they do tonight, Fauciexplained that he couldn't really say, if kids should be allowed to go toschool, it was quote, "complicated." Except it wasn't complicated. Itwasn't complicated then, it's not complicated now. In April, many months ago, a study by the "Journal of the American MedicalAssociation" found that school aged children who get the coronavirus,quote, "Develop only mild symptoms and typically recover within two weeks."Months later, same story, in June, a study in "The Lancet" affirmed this,quote, "COVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including ininfants." Other studies found the exact same thing. No studies foundanything but that. There was never much question about it. But if you're looking for more evidence, check the death rates. Those arepublicly available. Deaths are not hard to track. Consider the State of NewJersey. That's one of the states hit hardest by the coronavirus. So far inNew Jersey, not a single school aged child has died from the coronavirus,not one. Many children have died from car accidents and fires and drug ODsand suicide. None have died from COVID-19. In California, the biggest state in the United States, 40 million peoplelive there, a total of two people under the age of 18 have died from thecoronavirus -- two. The numbers nationwide according to the latest C.D.C.numbers, 123 Americans under the age of 18 have died from the coronavirus,123 out of 350 million. We shut the schools anyway, crushing millions of kids, affecting theirfutures in ways we can't even understand at this point. But it's clear it'sbad. Really bad in some cases. So the question is, why did we do this? And the answer is to save theteachers. The teachers unions pushed this and their servants in theDemocratic Party obey. They're the single largest donors to the DemocraticParty, so of course they did. So unionized teachers get to stay home collecting checks, while you'relosing your jobs because classrooms are just too dangerous. It's like theBattle of the Bulge five days a week. And that's exactly what they've done. But what does the data say about this? Well, for teachers under the age of50, and that's the vast majority of them, the odds of surviving acoronavirus infection are roughly 99.98 percent. But we should tell youthat for teachers under 70, the risk of dying escalates to a terrifying99.5 percent chance of survival. And by the way, teachers do get sick, itlikely won't be from teaching. Children appear not to spread thecoronavirus, surely not effectively. We've done this for a long time. Back in May, researchers in Europe found, quote, "Children do not appear tobe drivers of transmission. And we argue that reopening schools should beconsidered safe accompanied by certain measures." Again, none of this isnew. Tony Fauci, that data guy knew it at the time. And so did anyone inthe news media who could read which is still most of them, and yet theykept lying about it, all of them. In July, here is just one example, a panel of physicians and experts oninfectious disease went on television to explain that going to school isn'tdangerous for anyone, they would send their own kids. Watch the newsanchors' reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Would you let your kids go back to school? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I will. My kids are looking forward to it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes. Period. Absolutely. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Absolutely. As much as I can. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Without hesitation? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Without hesitation. Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I have no concerns about sending my child to school inthe fall. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I would let my kids go back to school. JOHN TORRES, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Dr. John Torres, NBC News. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  They all said yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  "They all said yes," says the news reader, feigning shock. Canyou believe that? Doctors have concluded their own children should go toschool. They must be crazy. They are crazy. What do doctors know aboutcoronavirus? What was this about? And of course you know the answer. It was about DonaldTrump. Donald Trump in this case agreed with the doctors. Therefore, the doctorshad to be mocked and ignored. Here's what the President said about schoolsin July. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have to open ourschools. Open our schools. Stop this nonsense. We open our schools. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  "Stop this nonsense. We reopen our schools." Now in point offact, as a scientific matter that turned out to be sound policy based onsound data. But the media told us the exact opposite of that. One headlineat CNN warned of quote, "The very clear dangers of Donald Trump's push toreopen schools." Google didn't censor that as misinformation, it shouldhave. Another headline called out quote, "Donald Trump's mind bending logic onschool reopenings." Mind bending logic. Those damn data again, Joe Biden'scampaign didn't want to hear it. They didn't want you to hear it either.School was dangerous. Period. Donald Trump claimed the opposite. Therefore, it was too dangerous to sendyour kids or for you to decide to send them. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ignoring how the virus spreads, risking teachers andparents' lives, going against the advice of experts. TRUMP:  It's had very little impact on young people. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you trust him to do what's best for our children?Because this is not a test. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Yes, going against the advice of experts. In this country, that'sno longer allowed, even and maybe especially when the experts arecompletely wrong. What's the message? The message couldn't be clearer.They're not your kids anymore. If they were your kids, you could make thekey decisions about their lives, but they're not. Those kids, your former kids belong to Tony Fauci now. Tony Fauci,America's parent. He'll make the decisions about your kids, thank you verymuch, in conjunction with the nation's uber mom, who by the way, is also 80years old, Mrs. Nancy D. Pelosi. Watch Mrs. Pelosi fret about the health of our children. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Are you confident thatstudents and teachers will go back safely to school in the fall? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  No, I think what we heard from the Secretary wasmalfeasance and dereliction of duty. This is appalling. They're messing.They're messing -- the President and his administration are messing withthe health of our children. Going back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of thecoronavirus. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  If that's not criminal, what she just said, we may need toredefine what it means to commit a crime. Sixty million school agedchildren affected by a decision that was wrong and many of them hurt forlife, but we just blow right past it and allow political leaders like thatto blow right past with phrases like the health of our children. What happens when you lock children in their rooms in front of screens andprevent them from experiencing human contact? Has Nancy Pelosi ever beenasked that question? Has she ever wondered about the answer? According to the Centers for Disease Control, a total of 522 childrenbetween the ages of five and 14 died of suicide in 2017. And that same agegroup, only 42 children have died from the coronavirus so far this year.What are those suicide numbers going to look like if we continue to takeNancy Pelosi's advice about the health of our children? We're going to havesome indications of that. Future years will reveal the whole picture andyou can be certain it'll be horrifying. But for right now, with incomplete data, here's what we know. In St. Paul,Minnesota, for example, 40 percent of all grades given this year have beenFs, and you can be certain they are grading lightly, but it's still doublethe normal amount of failures. In Fairfax County, Virginia, the number of middle and high school studentswith failing grades in two or more classes has increased by 83 percent. Thenumber of students with disabilities who are failing two or more classeshas increased by more than 100 percent. In a lot of school districts, huge numbers of kids never even registeredfor online classes. Do you have kids? Do you know anyone who does? They arelearning nothing. Those are real consequences. If you want to know the health of a society, look at its young people. Lookat its schools. These are obvious points that are being roundly ignored andanyone who makes them is attacked for making them. We're going to look backon this woman in shame. Back in June, we interviewed Dr. Scott Atlas. He was then a member of theWhite House's Coronavirus Taskforce. He was one of the very few people thenor now brave enough to make a simple point. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. SCOTT ATLAS, FORMER MEMBER OF WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASKFORCE:  Butthe point about the schools is really critical because this is the mostirrational public policy probably in modern history. Children havevirtually zero risk of getting a serious complication, virtually zero riskof dying. You don't lock down the children because you are personallyafraid. It is totally outrageous. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Dr. Scott Atlas was attacked as a monster for saying that. Reallyattacked. Dr. Tony Fauci, by contrast, was deified. Signs throughoutNorthwest DC said I believe, Dr. Fauci, but the truth is that Scott Atlaswas right and Dr. Fauci was revealed as a power mad incompetent. That's not our opinion, by the way, the data prove it. Dr. Atlas resignedfrom his advisory role in the administration today. He is now a SeniorFellow at the Hoover Institution. We're happy to have him with us tonight. Dr. Atlas, thanks so much for coming on. This does seem like a vindication. ATLAS:  Thanks for having me. CARLSON:  Dr. Fauci's remarks seem like a vindication and the opening ofthe New York schools as well of your point that you made many months ago,and I'm just wondering how you're feeling as you watch that? ATLAS:  Well, you know, I was just speaking about the data as I always didand it's true that the data was correct then and that children haveextremely low risk of a serious illness and do not frequently spread thisinfection that was known then. And we also knew the harms, the serious harms to children from closing in-person schools and nothing has really changed. It's just that some of thesethings are now being acknowledged, including, you know, other things likefor instance, people have protection beyond what an antibody test show, etcetera. But the point isn't that I was right. The point isn't that the advice Igave the President was right. The point isn't that the President was right.The point isn't that the President was right, although those things aretrue. The point is that we really need to open up in-person schools ASAP,because it's so destructive, so harmful to children, and there's reallynothing more important for a country that I can think of than educating ourchildren. CARLSON:  Of course, and we still claim to believe that. We clearly don't.Our leaders clearly don't. But before we move on to the solution stage ofthe program, and I hope with you that that comes soon. Explain, if youwould, why did people who had access to that data, which is everyone with acomputer, people like Dr. Fauci could have ignored what they were seeingfrom the studies? Like, how could they not have acknowledged this sixmonths ago? ATLAS:  Well, you know, I find myself asking that question. But, you know,again, we're living in an extremely polarized time, you know, this as muchas anybody. It's an election year. We have social media, where people gosort of ballistic and feel empowered to do so. And, you know, I don't know, I think it's there's a serious problem,honestly, in the country, because there's a bigger issue here and that isthat America and its universities really need to allow, without attack,without rebuke, without intimidation, the free exchange of ideas, becauseit is from the free exchange of ideas that scientific truths follow andthese scientific truths are critical for us to solve this crisis, everyother crisis. And in fact, the free exchange of ideas is honestly thefoundation of every civilized society. CARLSON:  Does it make you nervous for our future that the people incharge, people with long list of credentials who should know betterpresumably, aren't stupid, embrace the kind of witchcraft or superstition,and said things that are provably untrue for many months? What does thatportend for our future if we continue to allow that? ATLAS:  You know, I think we've -- this is very important, I think. We seethat objective journalism is nearly dead, and I think we now saw thatscience has been politicized and it's very, very dangerous. You know, Ithink we should all be very concerned about it. Let's put it that way. CARLSON:  Yes, I think so, too. Dr. Scott Atlas, who we should say resignedtoday, in the normal course of events after 130 days, I believe, servingthe Administration. Congratulations on being a part of it. ATLAS:  Okay. Thank you very much. CARLSON:  Thank you. So schools as we just told you a reopening in thecountry's biggest city, New York, but many businesses are facing newcoronavirus restrictions this week, including bans on the indoor dining. In response to this, total economic destruction of an entire sector of theeconomy. One restaurant in the borough of Staten Island, Mac's Public Househas declared itself quote "an autonomous zone." A sign on the door of therestaurant reads this way, quote, "We refuse to abide by any rules andregulations put forth by the mayor of New York City and the governor of NewYork State." Keith McAlarney is the co-owner of that restaurant, Mac's Public House, andhe joins us tonight. Keith, thanks so much for coming on. So tell us whatmade you decide to become our own country on Staten Island. KEITH MCALARNEY, CO-OWNER, MAC'S PUBLIC HOUSE:  Thanks for having me.Basically, what is taking place is the food industry and bar industry, weall end up wanting to work with the government when we've decided that this-- they decided that we could start reopening. And they never came to theprofessionals, the ones that own the bars and the restaurants andeverything. They never came to us to end up asking how to do that in a safeway. Basically all they did was dictate to us what we're supposed to do. Andwith doing that, you still weren't able to survive. So it brought us to apoint that they're saying that they were shutting us down again, that theyweren't allowing inside dining. And I was put against the wall. It's either I took a stance and ended up opening my cantina, keep myestablishment open, hoping that people end up coming to spend money, so Ican pay bills, and then providing for my family. I'm so behind on billsthat I really felt I had no other choice. And I was -- with doing this, it was to tell the governor and to tell themayor that you need to work with us, but you didn't want to work with usand we're forced into the situation that I don't know what else I can do. CARLSON:  Yes, I feel for you. It turns out your white privilege isn'tpaying the bills automatically. You're coming on the show, you're taking astand. You're clearly going to enrage the people in charge of New York Cityand New York State. Are you worried they're going to come after you? MCALARNEY:  They're coming after me already. I already had the State LiquorAuthority. We caught the radar of the mayor right away. The Sheriffs cameout as a bully tactic to fine us and they were very professional, theSheriffs, but at the same time, they were coming on the orders of themayor, because of the fact that I was remaining open and still remainingopen past 10 o'clock. It brought the attention of the other agencies out there and you knowthey're coming after me. CARLSON:  Your tax dollars at work. Well, you're a brave man and we wishyou Godspeed, and I hope you'll come back and tell us how it goes. Keith,thanks so much. MCALARNEY:  Thank you very much. CARLSON:  So a coronavirus vaccine is on the way, many reports of that.When it does arrive, who gets it first? The states are in some places,apportioning it, depending on your skin color, for real, and other highlynonscientific criteria. How is this going to work? We will explain that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  So the vaccine is coming, apparently. Will you take it? That'sone question. Who should get it first? That's another question. Advisers to the CDC are holding an emergency meeting Tuesday, tomorrow, tovote on who they think should get the vaccine first. Now, you might assumethis would be based on -- I don't know, science. So the most important criteria would be your age or your state ofimmunodeficiency. But in some states, officials have another idea, yourskin color should play a role in this. So if you assume that identitypolitics are just a harmless annoyance that people couldn't actually diebecause of it. Think again. Watch this clip from the Governor of California. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA):  Experts in safety, as well as experts looking atequity and looking at the distribution from a direct perspective, lookingat distributions, again, along the spectrum of making sure black and browncommunities disproportionately are benefited because of the impact theyhave felt disproportionately because of COVID-19. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Man, and that's just one way to look at it. Of course, if JoeBiden's advisers get to decide how to administer this vaccine, we could seea whole different set of criteria at the Federal level. A top Biden coronavirus adviser, Dr. Zeke Emanuel wrote a famous 2014 piecein "The Atlantic" called "Why I hope to die at 75." So how many people overthe age of 75, the most vulnerable population would Zeke Emanuel out to getthis vaccine? That and many other questions like it are the concern ofCharles Camosy. He is the author of "Resisting Throw Away Culture" andsomeone who thinks about the stuff an awful lot. Professor, thanks so much for coming on tonight. So, I'm concerned thatthis vaccine will be yet another way that the country is divided alongvarious lines, and that's kind of the last thing in my view that we needright now. Tell us from your perspective, how this vaccine should be apportioned? Whoshould get priority and why? CHARLES CAMOSY, AUTHOR, "RESISTING THROW AWAY CULTURE":  Well, I'd startwith nursing home residents, number one, Tucker and you and I have talkedabout this a lot. You've talked about it with Janice Dean a lot. You'vebeen a hero for this, frankly, in moving the needle. And it looks like the C.D.C. tomorrow, a very important meeting on Tuesdaywill in fact, prioritize nursing home residents, thank God. CARLSON:  Good. CAMOSY:  But there's another disturbing piece of news, frankly, Tuckerabout this. And it's related to the package you just did on California.They apparently are going to -- they're going to put essential workers whoare important, don't get me wrong -- they are very important -- ahead ofthe old and ahead of the sick who are not in nursing homes. Now, if there's one thing we know about coronavirus, it's that the old andthe sick are the most at risk. And the idea that we would apportion thevery limited vaccine, especially here in December and January, in ways thatwould abandon them is a whole new disturbing thing to think about. CARLSON:  Especially since the reason of course is that essential workers,so-called and some are essential, of course, but they tend to be unionized,and they have political power. Whereas the old and sick do not. CAMOSY:  Yes, don't get me wrong. I think we should prioritize in duecourse, essential workers. They should be ahead of, say professors or talkshow hosts. CARLSON:  I agree. CAMOSY:  But they shouldn't be ahead of people with diabetes and asthma,right, who are over 65 years old. That's nuts. That's nuts. And it actuallycomes from a good place, maybe an understandable place, essential workersare disproportionately poor. They are disproportionately people of color. But the way to focus on those populations is to focus on those populationsin a way that focuses on those who are sick and those who are older. Thoseare the people who are most at risk, and that's where our focus needs tobe. CARLSON:  So just purely on the science. We know from the data, it's veryclear who is the most likely to die from a coronavirus infection, so itsounds like you're saying those people should get first dibs. CAMOSY:  Yes, it's not complicated. I mean, we're going to go with nursinghome workers first and probably, you know, people working in hospitalssecond, and then we're going to have to decide in January and February andit seems obvious that we would pick those who are most at risk. But that's why I think your listeners really need to pay very closeattention to this meeting tomorrow and let their local state and municipalrepresentatives know if they disagree with the decision the C.D.C. comesdown with. CARLSON:  I think that's fair and smart. Thanks so much for joining us.Charles, great to see you. CAMOSY:  Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON:  Now people who describe themselves as sovereign citizens are nowseizing homes, not their homes, other people's homes by force in severalstates. What is this exactly? Is it real? It appears to be. We'll tell youabout it after the break. Plus new documents show the consultants, McKinsey & Company told Purduepharma -- that's one of the companies that drove the opioid epidemic -- tooffer discounts to distributors when customers died of ODs. It's really oneof the most shocking stories of the year. We have the documents straightahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  If you sense that property rights are eroding, you're notimagining it. Authorities say people describing themselves as sovereigncitizens are trying to forcibly evict homeowners from their own homes inthe suburbs north of Seattle, a bizarre story. Jason Rantz, a radio host in that city has been on top of it and joins ustonight to explain. Jason, what is this? JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST:  Well, it's a group called theMoorish Sovereign Citizens out in Edmonds, it is about 20 minutes north ofSeattle. It is a group of people who are essentially extremist squatterswho believe that the laws of the land do not apply to them and they'vedecided to go into neighborhoods, waterfront properties, very nice homes,saying that they actually own the land and they should take it over. The homeowner usually is like, what are you talking about? Please leave.And it's just very bizarre. It's not just happening in the Puget Sound.It's happening all across the country. Most recently in Georgia, forexample, a man named Joel Fedd decided to literally take ownership, decidehe is not going to pay rent on property that he doesn't actually own. It'spart of, I think, this nationwide trend of laws not really applying tocertain folks in this case. They're not activists, they are just kind ofnutty. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is illegal. Once you see that, that mean, you wantto -- is your -- I want it. It is mine. I'm about to start, you know, theprocess on reclaiming the land. Hey, you all can keep paying rent. You allcan take this again. You all can think we are just a character, but really,the talk, we're taking the land back. (END VIDEO CLIP) RANTZ:  It doesn't quite work that way. I can assure you. CARLSON:  Not Harare, not Bulawayo, suburban Seattle. All right. JasonRantz, I hope you'll keep on top of this for us. RANTZ:  I will. Thank you. CARLSON:  A story that didn't get enough attention, Purdue Pharma, thepharma company that made opioids pleaded guilty last week to criminalcharges for its role in causing the opioid epidemic, which has caused asyou know, hundreds of thousands of deaths of Americans in this country. We now have internal documents that show how Purdue's consultants atMcKinsey & Company -- you won't be surprised to learn -- saw those deathsas nothing more than the cost of doing business. Transaction costs. Gerald Posner has been on top of this longer than almost anybody in media.He is the author of the book "Pharma." He covered McKinsey's work withPurdue Pharma long before anyone else and he joins us tonight to explainwhat these documents show. Gerald, thanks so much for coming on. This is a really a stunning story.What have we learned? GERALD POSNER, AUTHOR, "PHARMA":  Yes, you know, there are very few thingsafter spending five years on looking into the American drug industry, thereare very few things that shock me anymore. This was a shocking development, I had to read that document twice to makesure that I really understood it and what it really is, is that in 2017,McKinsey who had been advising Purdue already at that point for eight yearson all different aspects of their business. It was tough to sell OxyContinbecause of the fact that it had become America's biggest prescription drugabuse crisis and lethal crisis ever. They had to come up with something different than before, and what theycame up with was an idea of why don't we encourage the insurance companieslike Anthem, CVS, United Health and others who are paying for OxyContinunder insurance plans, give them some incentive to make sure they don'tknock Oxy off of the insurance plans. And so we'll give them bonuses based upon the number of people who eitherget addicted to Oxy or die of OxyContin overdoses between $6,000.00 and$14,000.00 a person so they came up with this fancy 42-page presentation,PowerPoint that they gave to the Purdue executives who loved it and said,look, it's going to cost you anywhere between $3 million and $35 million ayear to some of the big insurance companies, but it'll be some incentive sothat you make sure that they keep you on their formulary and you cancontinue to get paid out. It's one of the most outrageous and cold calculus pieces of business, youknow, from the people who brought you Enron, the best and brightest atMcKinsey advising Purdue in the heart of the opioid crisis. It's somewhatnot surprising but at the same time, still very disturbing. CARLSON:  So McKinsey, as you suggest, it really is the incubator of ourruling class. Chelsea Clinton's former employer. Did anyone at McKinseysay, hold on a second. This is morally grotesque and I'm resigning? POSNER:  No, as a matter of fact, Tucker, not only did they do that,listen, in 2007, Purdue pleaded guilty to misbranding OxyContin and paid a$600 million fine. Who did they go to the next year to make sure that thereweren't any more regulations from the F.D.A.? They went to McKinsey then.Nobody at McKinsey raised an eyebrow about it. As a matter of fact, in 2012, it was McKinsey was able to get Purdue to goforward to the F.D.A. and get a new and improved tamper resistant formulathat blocked out all generic competition. Then the next year in 2013,McKinsey again presented these great plans to Purdue called Turbocharge theSales and helped them through it. And what happens in 2018? When the Attorney General of Massachusetts filesa lawsuit against Purdue, for the first time, you start to see e-mails inMcKinsey saying, oh, by the way, maybe we should get rid of all our e-mailsand documents about our help with Purdue. So that's where they went. Theywent from helping them make money, millions of dollars to suddenly thinkingabout maybe we should cover it up. It's unbelievable. CARLSON:  Gerald Posner, thank you. POSNER:  Thank you. CARLSON:  If you're wondering what happened to America, McKinsey and YaleLaw School. They're not responsible for everything, but a lot of it. We'lllearning tonight another story that won't surprise you. The #MeToo Movement actually made a lot of people, some people anyway, veryrich. Not who you'd expect by the way. Candace Owens here to explain, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  When we first started the show four years ago, we scoffed at theidea of UFOs being real, it seemed kind of insane. And then we sawdeclassified video footage of objects that seemed to defy the laws ofphysics. We showed it to you and our minds became a little more open. And that's why on November 18th, we took notice when helicopter pilotscounting sheep over a remote part of the desert in Southeastern Utahsomething new and weird. An unidentified stationary object, it was amonolith of sorts standing up, apparently made out of stainless steel. They got outside, took pictures in front of it and then they left. Then afew other people trekked out to the monolith and did the same. Then on Friday night, the monolith, no one knows where it came from,suddenly disappeared. Around the same time and nearly identical structureapparently surfaced in Romania. What does all of this mean? We have noidea. But we'll be the first to tell you if we find out because who knows? Well, here's one thing we do know for sure. We know that social justice isa real concept. But in effect, it's very often a scam designed to make someof the most powerful people in the country even more powerful and richer.The latest example comes from Hollywood and the Time's Up organization thatwas part of the #MeToo movement. Do you remember? For a while, it was pretty famous and it hauled in $3.6 million in 2018?What did they do with the money? Well, they spent $1.4 million on salaries.How much did they spend supporting people who said they've been sexuallyharassed? $312,000.00. How is that legal exactly? Candace Owens joins us tonight to assess what exactly just happened.Candace, great to see you. Well, those numbers don't seem like they'reserving women, do they to you? CANDACE OWENS, AUTHOR, "BLACKOUT":  Of course, they're not serving women,and we see this so much and I love this story, because it ultimately pointsthat it's just the intellectual bankruptcy of Hollywood. They loved thismovement. You'll remember Time's Up. They all wore the black dresses to theOscars, because time was really going to be up and it was starting inHollywood, and then it was going to benefit all of women. But people have to understand, anything that's being perpetuated byHollywood is nothing more than a trend. You have a bunch of actresses andactors that want you to think that they're more substantive, right? Likethey have a lot more going on. I'm not just a dumb actress #MeToo. I really care about social issues.#Time'sUp. #BlackLivesMatter. Look at what I put on my Instagram, don't yousee that I'm much deeper. And at the end of the day, they have no idea what they're talking about.They just want people to think that they're more complex than they are, andwhat they do is they lead a bunch of sheep behind them to donate to causesand nobody knows where the money goes. It's always a black hole. Black Lives Matter. No one can answer billions of dollars. Are there blackschools being built? Are there black universities? Has anything been donethat's been beneficial for the black community? No. But you know what? Abunch of models put it on their Instagram, Tucker, so it must be good. CARLSON:  Why does nobody ever follow the money in this story and BlackLives Matter is a perfect example. I mean, tens of millions, God knows howmuch money has been shoveled from Corporate America into the coffers ofgroups calling themselves Black Lives Matter. No one ever seems to followup to find out where the money went. If these were televangelists, someonewould be looking. No one is. Why? OWENS:  You bet, it would because they don't want you looking and that'sthe point and I've said this over and over again about Black Lives Matter.I'm going to correct you at one point, Tucker. It wasn't millions, it wasbillions in the days and the weeks following George Floyd's murder, BlackLives Matter raised billions of dollars and they had never been made toaccount for where those billions of dollars went. And they want us to just look the other way and to not ask questions andhere's that -- at the end of the day, it is emotional manipulation. Ofcourse, all of us, we care about these issues. No one ever mocks sexualassault victims. No one would ever mock the black person who is beingactually victimized by a system. But what we are asking is, where is this money going? CARLSON:  No, we're not asking that. You're asking it. Almost no one elseis asking it and bless you for asking because it's an important question. OWENS:  I am definitely asking. CARLSON:  Amen. Candace Owens. Great to see you. Thank you. So Joe Biden says he is picking someone called Neera Tanden to head theOffice of Management and Budget, O.M.B., not a small job. Who is she? Andwhy is he picking her? Glenn Greenwald knows the answer. He joins us afterthe break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Joe Biden says he is naming someone called Neera Tanden to headup the Office of Management and Budget, a very big job in the White House.So, who is Neera Tanden? Well, there's a lot to know about her. We'll bebringing you that in future episodes. But the key thing to know about Neera Tanden is that she is ultimately ahandmaiden to the billionaires who pay her salary. Tanden runs a think tankcalled the Center for American Progress. The Center for American Progress has taken millions of dollars from WallStreet financiers, Silicon Valley executives like Mark Zuckerberg,lobbyists, banks and defense contractors. She has censored her own researchers' criticism of Mike Bloomberg whilegoing on television to hyperventilate about Russia collusion that neverexisted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NEERA TANDEN, CEO AND PRESIDENT, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS:  You see itin detail that Russia interfered with this election to help elect DonaldTrump. And you see it in detail after detail, and I think most importantly,it sets the predicate. You know, we've had a long discussion over last yearof collusion. This sets the predicate there was criminality behind what Russia was doing.And the next set of questions that Bannon and other people, includingDonald Trump can answer is what kind of collusion the Trump Campaign waspart of. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So in case you don't follow the White House carefully, this job,Director of the Office of Management and Budget is one of the key jobs inWashington. Glenn Greenwald is probably the most independent of ourindependent journalists. He joins us tonight to explain why Neera Tanden.Thanks, Glenn, for coming out. Why Neera Tanden? GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST:  Well, first of all, that package that youjust did, as critical as it was of her was incredibly generous. She's somuch worse than that. Why Neera Tanden? She's totally unqualified for this position. Like she'snot an economist, she went to Law School. She worked for Hillary Clinton.And then all she has done at this think tank for the last 10 years is raisemillions of dollars from Silicon Valley, Wall Street, despots in the GulfStates, which is the real base of the Democratic Party, so they want her tooversee the regulatory and budgetary and economic policy of theadministration on behalf of their real constituencies, which is all thosepeople from whom she has been raising millions of dollars from. But the thing is, Tucker, that just makes her an ordinary Democrat. She'sjust a swamp creature in that regard. She is a deranged and dangerousperson. I don't mean just politically, I mean, like behaviorally. When shewas working with Hillary Clinton to get Hillary Clinton elected, one of herown reporters at this think tank was arranged to have an interview withHillary and ask Hillary about the Iraq War and Neera Tanden was so angry,she punched him, and then later she claimed she merely pushed him. When she was running an all-staff meeting about three years ago, a womanwho works at the think tank had filed a confidential complaint about sexualharassment against one of Neera Tanden's male allies, and this is somethingthat would ruin anyone else's career in Washington, she outed this woman atthe all-staff meeting out of vengeance. When the Obama administration was bombing Libya into oblivion, shesuggested internally that the way we should reduce our deficit as a nationis to use Libya's oil to make them pay us back for the favor of havingdestroyed their entire government. But here's the worst thing about her, Tucker. That video you showed had hertalking about Russian collusion, she didn't just push the most maximalistversions of Russia collusion. She pushed this conspiracy theory that iscompletely reckless and wild that Russia hacked into the voting machinesand the reason Hillary lost in 2016 is because the Russians changedHillary's votes to Trump's votes and that's the real reason Hillary lost. That is a conspiracy theory that in 2018, two thirds of Democrats believe.How can you have somebody in a position like this, who is this derangedbehaviorally and in terms of the conspiracy theories they contaminatepeople's brains with. CARLSON:  I think the real question is why didn't we do an entire showtalking to you tonight about Neera Tanden? We totally blew that. I want toknow more. Glenn Greenwald, please come back. That was amazing. GREENWALD:  Always happy to talk about Neera Tanden. CARLSON:  I appreciate that. Thank you. She punched someone for questioningHillary about the Iraq War. That's a committed staffer. Sounds a littlecrazy, too. We'll be back tomorrow night, we can promise you, 8:00 p.m., the show thatis the total and sincere, sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness andgroupthink. Up ahead, we have great news for you, Sean Hannity takes over from NewYork, seven seconds early. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
