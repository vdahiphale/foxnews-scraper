     Video  Men taking their shirts off in public: Who's Right and Who's Wrong? 
Many viewers were up in arms over Adam Levine's shirtless Super Bowl halftime performance; reaction from FOX Nation's Abby Hornacek and FOX News 24/7 Headlines reporter Carley Shimkus. 
This is a rush transcript from "Watters' World," February 9, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Welcome to "Watters' World." I'm Jesse Watters. A dumpster fire on the left - that is the subject of tonight's "Watters' Words." The media won't tell you, but the Democrats had the worst week they have had in years. Let's take a look.
Elizabeth Warren, top tier Presidential candidate busted for racial identity theft. Here is a Texas State Bar registration card where she claimed her race was American-Indian. She is toast. A plagiarism scandal rocking the top echelons of the liberal media. The former executive editor of the "New York Times" Jill Abramson. Her new book is about the press, apparently riddled with sloppy errors and rampant plagiarism. She got smoked by Martha MacCallum earlier this week.

          });
        } else {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
MARTHA MACCALLUM, ANCHOR: The paragraphs are very similar in your writing. Do you have any comment on this? Is there another way -- Lizzie Widdicombe, the bad boy brand. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JILL ABRAMSON, FORMER EDITOR OF "NEW YORK TIMES": I don't --
MACCALLUM: I am mean, you're going to be asked to respond this at some point and I'll put the mic in front of you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
ABRAMSON: Sure. You know, all I can tell you is, I certainly didn't plagiarize in my book.

        }
      
WATTERS: No, sure you didn't. It makes me think what kind of operation was she running at "The Times" all these years? And the media fact checkers are lying to you. The President at the State of the Union said violent crime in El Paso, Texas dropped after the border wall was built. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But, the next day, fact checkers claimed the President lied. Look at this Vox headline here, "A border fence did not lower crime rates in El Paso, in fact, crime went up a bit." Now, that's a total dishonest distortion of the facts. The media cherry picked the timeline from the time money was authorized for the wall and until only 2011 to make it look like crime went up.
But the facts are, when the wall was completed in El Paso in 2009, there were 3,300 violent crimes reported that year, and in 2016, the latest year data was available, about 2,600 violent crimes were reported. Crime dropped 20% since the wall was erected in El Paso. Now, the fact checkers have become fake news.
Socialism on the rise. Here is the president at the State of the Union.

WATTERS: Notice how all the Democrats sat, and by the way, Democrats refused to stand against infanticide as well. Also this week, the Democrats unveiled a Green New Deal. It's Marxism. Here is what it call for. You ready?

Abolish fossil fuels, free housing, free healthy food, free money for those unwilling to work, free education for life, abolish air travel, rebuild and upgrade all existing buildings in the United States of America, and we're going to have some have fun with that with our next guest in a second.
Blackface scandals continue to humiliate Democrats in Virginia. The Governor and the State Attorney General both appearing in black face. Yet, no one has resigned. The number two Democrat in Virginia has been accused of sexual assault and he's riding it out, too. What a mess. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

So Democrats had a hell of a week. Infanticide supporting socialists, blackface, identity thieves, and Kavanaugh hypocrites, all supported by the lying plagiarizing media. Trump is going to feast on these people.

Here with reaction, Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, Republican Congressman Mark Meadows. So Congressman, what did you think about my commentary at the top?
REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: You know, you are spot on and we can laugh about it, but the American people need to sit up and take notice. The Democratic Party is shifting to the left, and they are serious about many of the things that you were talking about.

And I mean, when we talk about getting rid of air travel in the United States and rebuilding every building, I can tell you, here's the interesting thing, Jesse is this --

        }
      
WATTERS: Just one thing, Congressman.
MEADOWS: Yes.
WATTERS: It was a great reaction by the Senator from Hawaii who is a Democrat when she was asked about this. She goes, "Well, that's going to be a little bit of a problem for people living in Hawaii." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
WATTERS: A "chunnel."
MEADOWS: I mean, come on. We have gotten to the point where we see it as ridiculous. The American people see it as ridiculous. Nobody here on Capitol Hill is looking are really looking at this and taking it seriously, but they should. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
WATTERS: Well, okay, so you are saying no one on Capitol Hill is taking it seriously, but I believe three Presidential candidates -- Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren -- they have all endorsed the Green New Deal. So I guess they are for abolishing air travel and my favorite is free income for those unwilling to work.
MEADOWS: You know, let me just tell you, there is a whole lot of people that if they could get a paycheck and not have to go to work, I think they would opt for that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
MEADOWS: No, I'm not. Well, I'll tell you what, I love work. I believe that you ought to be paid according to the effort that you put forth, but here is the interesting thing -- Kamala Harris, Senator Harris, when you really look at that, she wants to come after your insurance, your private insurance, your guns, now they are saying, "Well, we want to come after your airplanes, your money, your buildings," I mean, what else is next?
WATTERS: Yeah, you know, you mentioned buildings, okay, so they want to upgrade or completely knock down and rebuild every single building in the United States. Now, here in New York City, just to build a new building takes about three years to get a permit. I don't see how they can do this across this land.
MEADOWS: Well, they can't do it all across the land. It's ludicrous to that, even the permitting process and they are talking about doing this in the next 10 to 15 years. I mean, wow, you know, where are they going to get all of the money from to even implement it?

        }
      
WATTERS: I know where they are getting it from. One of the people supporting this says we can just print money, Congressman. You know, like Zimbabwe did. Remember what happened with Zimbabwe? Like $1.00 is worth 3 trillion of their currency. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
MEADOWS: And when we take a grocery bag of dollar bills to buy bread, they will understand, you know, it's just like in Venezuela. You know, it starts out with socialism is a good idea, eventually, you come to are there enough rabbits to feed the people? I mean, come on.
WATTERS: Yes, we want to walk our dogs in America. We don't want to eat our dogs in America.

        }
      
WATTERS: You know, you're bringing up animals. I am still looking, I am astounded by this stuff. They say they want to eventually abolish cow flatulence because there's methane in that. When I read to be - because you can't stop cows from flatulating, you've got to eliminate cows, which means, they are coming after our hamburgers, Congressman.
MEADOWS: Well, there's a lot of bull here on Capitol Hill. I can tell you that getting rid of some of that cow would be okay, but this is really just ridiculous. So they are going to come after your money and now your cows? I mean, listen, America should take notice because there are people here in Washington, D.C. who are dead serious about putting forth this extreme agenda and making sure they take their money and give it to someone else.

WATTERS: It's Soviet communism and, I believe, I am sure you believe, too, the Trump White House must be licking their chops to run against these people in 2020, I'll give you the last word.
MEADOWS: Well, they are and when you look at the extreme nature of what they are putting out there, that's why this President does so well. He connects to the union worker in Ohio and to the farmer in the Midwest. And he knows what makes this country work. It's hard work, sweat and tears and obviously, he supports them.

REIMAN: Yes, well, when you do something like that, first of all, what she did was intentional, right, she got really close to him, as close as she could. She tilted her head, he had on that smirk and then she clapped as loudly as she could, and it was a powerful aggressive clap. So of course - -
WATTERS: An aggressive clap.

WATTERS: What I found interesting, you know when the President says something that he knows is going to land, he steps back then looks around like this. And you notice Pence clapped and Nancy stayed seated.
REIMAN: Well, two things. He does do that, but he looks primarily to his base. So when you're watching him, notice, he pulls away from the podium and then he faces who he knows is going to give him the bigger applause and then he lifts his chin up, and that's a power move. So it's like, he's absorbing the energy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: He is receiving the applause.
REIMAN: Yes, and so he doesn't bother looking at the Democrats because he knows that they are not standing instead, and that's an anchoring movement. You do that, so it's almost like you anchor your positives, and then you anchor your negatives, so every time he talks about good stuff, it's always towards his people and then when he talks about bad things, he thinks it's about, you know, "I am going to anchor it towards the people who don't like me that much."
WATTERS: Oh, anchoring your positives. I like that.
REIMAN: That's a powerful move and he does it often.

WATTERS: I am going to start anchoring my positives a little bit more right now.
REIMAN: Okay, make sure they're towards me.
WATTERS: Okay, sounds good. All right, finally, we're going to go to another moment when I think all of the Democrat ladies in white got some love. Let's listen.

REIMAN: This was powerful for two reasons. The first reason is, people - they want to get rid of Nancy, but you see, she was the one who got those people up. So don't --
WATTERS: Did she rise them up?
REIMAN: Oh, yes, that was her. That was her. She is more powerful than people want to give her credit for, but more importantly Donald Trump initially didn't realize -- the face is like an emotional transmitter.
WATTERS: There she is.
REIMAN: Yes, see.
WATTERS: She is conducting the orchestra right there.
REIMAN: Yes, she is. So he didn't realize initially that that was mocking. So the emotional transmitter facial expression took a few seconds. Then he realized, it was sarcasm and he turned around and he said, "Thank you." Because he has to save face, but that was truly against him and a lot of people didn't get that either.

WATTERS: Okay, all right, Tonya. I'm going to be emotionally anchoring all weekend. Thank you very much. All right, coming up, taking a closer look at celebrities in blackface. Wait until you see the list.
And later O.J. Simpson back on the scene talking politics.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Virginia's top three officials -- all Democrats -- standing their ground as the state is totally swept up in controversy. Governor Ralph Northam, identified as the person in blackface or draped in a Klan robe in his medical school yearbook. He denies that, but who knows? The state's Lieutenant Governor has been accused of sexual assault, and the State's third in line, the Attorney General, he admits he once more blackface at a college party.
So, are people calling these people to step down or do they want them to stay? What's going on? Joining me now, conservative commentator, Rob Smith and liberal commentator, Wendy Osefo. All right, ladies first, Wendy, we'll start with you. I know what's going on here. It is an identity politics pretzel that you guys have wrapped yourselves into.
Okay, because you have the Governor in blackface. If he resigns, you have the black Lieutenant Governor accused of sexual assault and if he steps down, then you have another white Democrat in blackface. So if the Lieutenant Governor, he steps down and you replace him with a guy that was in blackface, that is going to make the black people angry and if you let the Lieutenant Governor stay, accused of sexual assault, that's going to make the women angry.
WENDY OSEFO, LIBERAL COMMENTATOR: Well, Virginia is in a pretzel. I don't think it's anything that the Democrats did per se. I always say that when it comes to issues of racism, it's not a GOP problem, it's not a Democratic problem, it is an American problem. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: Well, it's a Democratic problem in Virginia.
OSEFO: No, it's not. So to speak because we've had other issues in Virginia, Charlottesville, hello that has not been a Democratic problem. So racism --
WATTERS: Okay, so we're just talking about the blackface and I get your point.
OSEFO: So racism is as American as apple pie and that's not something that we can argue.
WATTERS: What are you calling them to do?
OSEFO: I am asking that they step down.
WATTERS: All of them? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OSEFO: I believe that the AG, as well as the Governor should step down.
WATTERS: So the two guys in blackface, you want them out.
OSEFO: Should step down.
WATTERS: And you want the black Lieutenant Governor accused of sexual assault to be Governor?
OSEFO: No, I want the claims brought against him to be substantiated. We need to see this substantiated.
WATTERS: Okay, I agree with that. Rob, what do you think?
ROB SMITH, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: I think that it's very funny when you see Democrats being racist, basically, then racism is all of a sudden an American problem. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OSEFO: It's always been, Rob.
SMITH: And whenever there is a racial issue on the Republican side, then it's an example of some sort of deep rooted issue with racism in the Republican Party.
OSEFO: Look at the policies you guys put forward.
WATTERS: Let me just ask you, would you forgive any of these Democrats for being in blackface, or is it something they can't recover from, they have to resign immediately?
SMITH: I think for me, you know, look, I don't think that it's something they can't recover from. I don't know if I necessarily want people to resign immediately. We were on here, I was with you when we talked about Roseanne when the whole incident happened with her.
And I feel that in situations like this, we always lose the opportunity to have a learning experience. I think that people realize that blackface is bad, but when we have these opportunities to tell them why it's bad, they just don't get it, and we don't teach them that. I think that it's absolutely crazy ...
OSEFO: People don't realize blackface is bad. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb18', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SMITH: ... that these people wearing black face, and by the way, that yearbook was when he was 25 years old. So he was an adult.
WATTERS: Okay, well, this is a learning experience on "Watters' World" as it always is. Let me ask you, Wendy, about some of these comedians and entertainers. Let's take a look at some of their blackface episodes. We had Ted Danson, famously, in black face many, many years ago at an event. There he is right there. I mean, that's pretty outrageous. You had Jimmy Kimmel not too long ago dressed up as Karl Malone. I mean, he's a big Karl Malone fan. I can't believe you can even find this online. Jimmy Fallon, I think was Chris Rock at one point.
Does it make a difference if it's a celebrity in an entertainment capacity to do blackface? Because I don't think it should make a difference.
OSEFO: It doesn't make a difference. And to go back to Rob's point. We do not know as a country that blackface is bad, because if we did, people would not do it. People only admit blackface is bad once they get caught. That is an issue.
WATTERS: I think 99% of the country thinks it is bad.
OSEFO: I do not think so because, honestly, what you always hear from people is they say, "I was not trying to make offense to anyone. I was trying to represent a culture. That's ridiculous.
WATTERS: So but if Wendy thinks that the Governor and the AG should resign for being in blackface, what do you think should happen to the celebrities? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb19', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OSEFO: I absolutely think that there should be ramifications for their --
WATTERS: Ramifications.
OSEFO: Absolutely. They can't resign, they are not in the political --
WATTERS: No more late-night shows?
OSEFO: No more. No, seriously.
WATTERS: Okay.
SMITH: So I was watching Jimmy Kimmel do Karl Malone, and for me, the most of offensive part of it wasn't him being in blackface, it was like the black voice that he used in that affectation, and you find so much with the liberal comedians that they are given a pass. Ted Danson, Jimmy Kimmel -- all of these people are given a pass. Sarah Silverman has done blackface as well. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb20', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OSEFO: Yes, she has blackface as well.
SMITH: And so you never really see that outrage from the public for this - -
WATTERS: Well, I think Robert Downey, Jr., he was in blackface. He was nominated.
SMITH: For an Academy Award.
OSEFO: Yes, he sure was.
WATTERS: When he was in blackface, what was that movie?
SMITH: "Tropic Thunder." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb21', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: "Tropic Thunder," right. Juan Williams was on "The Five" the other day and he made a differentiation when celebrities do it because he said that when these celebrities and entertainers were doing it, they liked the people that they were imitating in blackface. They were fans of Karl Malone. They were fans of Chris Rock. So he got into the intent. Do you make a differentiation?
OSEFO: It's not about the intent because everyone knows the history of blackface - where it comes from - the 1830s, making fun of African- Americans and stereotypes that have been juxtaposed to African-Americans as being lazy and of being ignorant.
Those things, you cannot take that away. Blackface represents that. It does not matter what the intent is. It is wrong.
WATTERS: Well, I can't believe people don't know that.
SMITH: And I definitely - yes, and I agree with you on that. I think that people just don't know. There are so many people that I talk to --
OSEFO: I think they don't care.
SMITH: I think that people don't know the history behind blackface and why -- and how it has been used to dehumanize African-Americans.
OSEFO: Absolutely.
SMITH: And how these things come up again, again and again. And I think that whenever this happens, we never really go into that conversation, so people can understand why it is so hurtful to African-Americans and to black people, and I think that missed that moment and I don't want to miss that moment this time because I think that this is a teachable lesson.
WATTERS: All right, well, Wendy, I think your mom would be proud because you didn't yell at anybody this time.
OSEFO: Hey mom, I don't yell.
SMITH: Because we can agree that blackface is wrong.
OSEFO: Absolutely.
SMITH: Liberal conservative.
WATTERS: All right, guys, thank you very much.
OSEFO: Thank you.
SMITH: Thank you.
WATTERS: All right, coming up. Chris Christie makes his first splash into "Watters' World." And later, "Who's Right and Who's Wrong." "Watters' World" is debuting new segment. Don't miss it.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
TODD PIRO, CORRESPONDENT: Live from "America's News Headquarters," I'm Todd Piro. A major storm batters Washington State with snow. At least 8 inches filled north of Seattle on Friday. Much of that state covered, causing its Governor to declare a state of emergency. Authorities are urging residents to stay off the roads due to dangerous conditions. Snow also prompted a rescue effort in California. Crews there had to travel by snowmobile after 7 feet of snow left 120 people trapped at a resort in Sierra Nevada for five days. Forecasters say a storm like this one hasn't been seen in many years.
And Prince Philip has given up driving for good. In a statement, Buckingham Palace says the 97-year-old has decided to voluntarily surrender his license. The decision comes less than a month after the Prince was involved in an accident which left two women injured. I'm Todd Piro. Now back to "Watters' World."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J., FORMER GOVERNOR: Sit down and shut up. Get the hell off the beach. It's 4:30, you've maximized your tan. Get off the beach.
Are you stupid? On topic. On topic. Next question.
A thousand things I will do tonight. Going to dinner with you is about 1,0001.
Your rear-end is going to get thrown jail, idiot.
You're a big shot.
Either sit down and keep quiet or get out. One or the other. We are done with you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: That's the Chris Christie that everybody remembers from back in the day, basically just telling people what's going on. In 2016, the Governor ran for President, and now, three years later, he is the author of a new book, "Let me Finish." Detailing his rise in New Jersey politics and his insight into the Trump presidency, Chris Christie joins me now.
Governor, I used to get drunk with my friend and watch you on YouTube just laying people out.
CHRISTIE: I am glad I was entertaining when you were drunk, that's good. Well, you're my entertainment now. I love your show.
WATTERS: Well, thank you very much. You have a great taste. Now, unlike a lot of the other people that interviewed you, I actually read this thing.
CHRISTIE: I know and I am going to be able to tell right away. I can tell the people who didn't read it.
WATTERS: Well, I skipped the New Jersey part, I went straight to the 2016 campaign.
CHRISTIE: Okay.
WATTERS: All right, I confess. Now, in the campaign, you really went after Marco Rubio hard.
CHRISTIE: I did.
WATTERS: You -- actually, a very famous moment of the campaign was when you got him so flummoxed, he started repeating himself in the New Hampshire debate. Let's roll that and then talk about it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R-FLA.: But I would add this. Let's just start with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he is doing. He knows exactly what he is doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don't want to be like the rest of the world. We want to be the United States of America.
CHRISTIE: You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington, D.C. does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information, and then the memorized 25-second speech. That is exactly what divides this nation.
(Cheering and Applause)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: And the crowd loved it and then I think he repeated the same line --
CHRISTIE: Three more times.
WATTERS: Three more times. Now, do you guys talk after that? You guys are friends?
CHRISTIE: Yes. We are fine. Listen, in fact, after Marco had his debate for his Senate seat then that he ran for reelection for, he called me the next day and he said, "By the way, thank you." And I said "Why?" And he said, "I did great in my debate last night and all I was thinking about what you did to me in February and I am never going to let anybody do that to me again."
WATTERS: So you warmed him up.
CHRISTIE: We did. And I think that Marco understood. We were competing with each other. We were in direct competition with each other in New Hampshire and I did what I thought I needed to do.
WATTERS: And you got some big endorsements in New Hampshire and your poll numbers really started to rise and you were really the attack dog for a lot of that primary campaign, and then you dropped out, endorsed Donald Trump. Tell us about the endorsement. You went down to Texas.
CHRISTIE: Yes, we want to Fort Worth. I flew down there the night he was having a debate in Houston. I met him in Fort Worth and we did the endorsement, and I remember, we kept it so quiet, no leaks that when we walked into that room that you are showing on the air right now, a reporter saw me walk into the room with Trump and said, "Oh, my god." They were stunned.
But here is what I knew. I knew he was going to be the nominee.
WATTERS: Because you endorsed him before almost anybody else.
CHRISTIE: Before anybody.
WATTERS: Before Jeff Sessions.
CHRISTIE: Yes. Before anybody. I endorsed him. He was my friend for 15 years at that point. But also, I had campaigned against him. I knew he was going to be the Republican nominee and my job, as I saw was to endorse him and to go in there and make him the best candidate he could be because we did not want Hillary Clinton to be President of the United States.
WATTERS: Right, then so you're a big part of the campaign at that point, moving on to the fall and the "Access Hollywood" tape drops. What went through your mind when "Access Hollywood" drops?
CHRISTIE: Listen, I think we were all stunned and worried and concerned. But one of the things I said to the then candidate at the time was, he said, "Is it over?" And I said to him, "No, because you are running against the single worst presidential candidate in my lifetime."
So we got time to recover, but we've got to do this the right way. And he went into that debate that Sunday night and he dealt with the issue, and he really, really performed well in that debate and that plus Jim Comey's little letter, I think turned momentum and now, we have Donald Trump as President.
WATTERS: That's right, now, so there is some controversy about you in that second debate. There are people in the campaign that say, "Chris Christie had the opportunity to fly on the jet with the team and go to that debate in Houston," and you decided that morning maybe not to go, and people thought that was a little disloyal.
CHRISTIE: Yes, well, listen, that's Steve Bannon who is just making stuff up telling me, you're either on the plane or you are off the team. Typical Steve drama that was completely made up. I made it really clear, I called that morning and said, "Listen, I'm only elected official here. And you haven't yet answered these questions. And if I go there, they are going to be all over me to answer these questions. I want you to answer them first."
The same reason I didn't go on Sunday morning shows that Sunday before the debate. The president knew full well I wasn't going and that night, after the debate was over, 10 minutes after it was over. He called me and he said, "I won the debate because of you. You are the best campaign debate prepper I have ever seen. Will you still run the debate prep for debate number three?"
So this whole idea that I was off the team, I was there and then on election tonight, I was in his apartment with he, and Melania and Baron and the rest of the family watching election returns. So, another Steve Bannon fiction.
WATTERS: Okay, and that was a great night, that election night.
CHRISTIE: It was an amazing night.
WATTERS: Amazing historic comeback.
CHRISTIE: No one thought it, Jesse, no one thought it was going to happen when the exit polls came in at 5:30 showing Hillary Clinton was going to win 350 electoral votes, believe, me down the street at Trump Tower, there was a lot of consternation. But it made it only better when those returns came in and it went all away and he was one very happy man that night.
WATTERS: You were in the running for, I believe, it was Attorney General and maybe another Cabinet position and you were also in charge of the transition. Now, Chris Christie is out writing books. He is not in the White House at all, what happened?
CHRISTIE: Well, I was in the running for Vice President and it came down to me and Mike Pence and he selected Governor Pence, and I love Governor Pence and I think he was a good choice. I was then in the running for Attorney General, he picked Jeff Sessions.
WATTERS: Oh, imagine if Chris Christie had been AG.
CHRISTIE: There would be no Bob Mueller if Chris Christie was AG. That you could be sure of, and on the transition stuff, two days after the election, I started writing the book. Steve Bannon called me in and fired me as Chairman of the transition and when - I knew it wasn't his doing, so I said, "Whose decision was this?" I thought, perhaps, it was the President-elect, and I said I wanted to talk to him directly. And he finally said to me, "No," as he referred to him, he said, "It was the kid." Referring to Jared Kushner.
And he said, "It's the kid. He's been taking an ax to your head ever since I got here with the boss." Ancient bitterness. And so, you know, this goes back to, as I detail in the book, the time in 2004 when I prosecuted Jared's father.
WATTERS: Yes, I'd be pretty mad, too.
CHRISTIE: Well, you know, I am sure you would be at the time, but then 12 years later, Jesse, once you knew that your father had committed those crimes, that your father had pled guilty, not been found guilty, but admitted to the crimes, what else was I supposed to do as a prosecutor? Turn my head and walk away?
WATTERS: I understand.
CHRISTIE: I took an oath, and so in the end also, we're supposed to be serving the President and by throwing me out and throwing the entire six months of transition work out, the President is still trying to recover from that with a lot of empty tests and a lot of people got picked for jobs like Mike Flynn and Tom Price and others who had no business being there and served the President poorly.
WATTERS: Well, that would have been a lot of fun having you as AG, telling people to sit down and shut up in the press corps, that would have been --
CHRISTIE: Let me tell you something, you know what happened, too, Jesse.
WATTERS: That's right. All right, Governor, thank you very much.
CHRISTIE: Thanks for having me on.
WATTERS: Appreciate it. Coming up. Our new segment, "Who's Right and Who's Wrong?" But up next, Diamond and Silk, on O.J. Simpson making some news.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Liz Warren's past coming back to bite her. "The Washington Post" unearthing the Massachusetts Senator's card for the Texas Bar. In '86, she signed it herself listing her race as American Indian. The 2020 hopeful issuing yet another apology for her ancestral claims.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS.: I am sorry that I extended confusion about tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty and for harm caused. I am also sorry for not being more mindful of this decades ago. I am not a member of a tribe.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you dropping out of the race?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Bye, Warren. See you later. Diamond and Silk join me now. Ladies, this is bad. This is really bad.
DIAMOND, VIDEO BLOGGER: Yes. It is bad, Jesse. You know, I don't think that she should drop out. She is not going to win, no way. But here is the deal. A little lie turns into a big lie, and then a big lie turns into a well-dressed lie.
Just remind Rachel Dolezal, remember that when she walked out and she said she was African American and come to find out she was white.
SILK, VIDEO BLOGGER: That's right.
DIAMOND: So, I don't know why Elizabeth Warren keeps running away from her race. Maybe she should embrace it. She should take this time to step down and embrace really who she is so that she can stop lying to the public.
SILK: That's right.
WATTERS: Yes, she is white. Look in the mirror. She is pale. She is white. Her name is Elizabeth Fleming Warren. I mean, I had my DNA tested. I'm 0.1% black. She is 0.09% American Indian. I'm more black than she is Indian.
DIAMOND: Just like Silk is more Indian than she is.
WATTERS: You are?
DIAMOND: Look at her high cheeckbones.
WATTERS: That's what got Liz Warren in trouble with the cheekbones. Oh, boy. All right, let's go on to O.J. Simpson. You know, he was talking about Roger Stone who complained about the FBI using some brutal tactics in the raid at his house early in the morning. Here is the Juice on Roger Stone.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
O.J. SIMPSON, FORMER FOOTBALL PLAYER: I got raided by the FBI in Miami. During this time, FBI agents, 5:00 in the morning. I had more than dogs. I had kids there. They were traumatizing my friend. He got raided, too. For nothing. Interesting task force. They were wrong. You never heard another word about it after the media made a big deal out of them in there.
So the FBI can be wrong, but to try to compare it to El Chapo and bin Laden. Hey, man, bin Laden was carried out in a bag, not walked out in handcuffs. So you know, man up. Stop crying.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: When O.J. tells you to man up, I say, "Okay, whatever you say, O.J. Whatever you say."
DIAMOND: Yes, maybe O.J. should go and out squeeze himself. You know, telling him to man up, maybe O.J. should have manned up and continued to do the rest of his years in prison instead of out walking around. The deal is, Roger Stone, I thought it was excessive as to what happened to him.
SILK: That's right.
DIAMOND: Agents raiding his house, walking up to his house, bum rushing his house to arrest him and then he goes to sign the stuff out. It was ridiculous. A waste of taxpayer's money. Listen, he has already pleaded not guilty. So let this here be, go to a trial and be judged by a jury of his peers.
WATTER: All right, now, one of the other controversies this week. Do you guys remember this scene from "Mary Poppins?"
(VIDEO CLIP OF "MARY POPPINS")
WATTERS: Okay. So the "New York Times" now claiming Mary Poppins is racist because they had some soot on their faces during the chimney sweep.
DIAMOND: Okay, so why do we allow these people to manipulate our language and say it's racist? Or what we say is racist? Our TV shows are racist? Now Disney movies are racist? This is crazy. But I didn't see them mentioning anything about Jimmy Kimmel dressing up in black face, I didn't see them mentioning anything about Joy Behar dressing like a beautiful African-American woman. I just wish that the left would stop attacking everything and making everything racist. Because it's getting out of control.
That "Mary Poppins" movie was not racist. So stop it "New York Times" stop it.
SILK: That's right, and understand what racist is. It is whenever a person thinks they are more superior than another group of people. That's what it is. So stop calling everybody racist because the definition of racist is just going away. You are not understanding what the definition is.
WATTERS: And you remember what the "New York Times" called blackface when the Democrat had it on. They called it dark makeup. So they are always trying to shade something one way. What was Elizabeth Warren's middle name? Herring. I said it was Flemming. I do not want to misidentify Elizabeth Warren.
DIAMOND: No, we got it.
WATTERS: All right, ladies. Catch them on the "Chit-Chat Tour."
SILK: Chitchattour.com.
WATTERS: There is it is. Up next, "Who is Right and Who is Wrong?" Probably me.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Last week's Super Bowl, pretty boring, including the halftime show. Although many people are up in arms over Adam Levine's shirtless performance.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ayesha Tyler tweeted quote, "Why is it okay to see Adam Levine's boobs and not Janet Jackson's? Asking for a friend." So do you think there is a double standard with male and female nudity?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: So we thought we'd ask who is right and who is wrong. Joining me now, the newest addition to the Fox Nation family, Abby Hornacek and Fox News 24/7 Headlines reporter, Carley Shimkus. All right, so in my opinion, is it okay for men to take their shirts off in public? When is it okay and when is it not okay?
ABBY HORNACEK, HOST, FOX NATION: I feel like it really depends on the situation. See, I am kind of proponent of if -- did you see all of the memes and stuff that came out that people released on Twitter, they were like, the beard gut guys that were kind of mimicking Adam Levine. That I think is okay. I think it's hilarious.
WATTERS: Wait, you like fat guys when they take their shirts off? That's okay.
CARLEY SHIMKUS, REPORTER: There's a lot of guys out there right now and you're their favorite on TV.
HORNACEK: I think it's hilarious. I am not a huge fan of gym selfies.
WATTERS: Oh, so you are making fun of them.
HORNACEK: Yes.
WATTERS: Okay, you're making fun of fat guys.
HORNACEK: I am not making fun of them. They are making fun of themselves.
WATTERS: Do you agree? Do you think fat guys --
HORNACEK: Do not twist my words.
SHIMKUS: I cannot believe that this not only was a question after the Super Bowl halftime show that it actually went viral. And people were outraged talking about there being a double standard with men and women.
WATTERS: Yes, the male nipple is it equivalent to the female nipple?
SHIMKUS: That is when you know that things are going well in this country when you are actually outraged by Adam Levine being topless at the Super Bowl halftime show.
WATTERS: You liked it, Carley, is that what you're saying?
SHIMKUS: No, you know what? I didn't like the fact that he took his shirt off during the Super Bowl halftime show. I thought it was a little cringe worthy. A lot cringed for it actually.
WATTERS: Because of the tattoos.
SHIMKUS: Yes, the California tattoo above his belly button is --
WATTERS: So you guys are anti-tattoos.
HORNACEK: I don't have any tattoos, but that would really hurt, right?
SHIMKUS: Terrible choice.
WATTERS: Okay, so we're asking the audience ...
HORNACEK: Or tickle, I don't know.
WATTERS: Is it appropriate for men to take their shirts off in public? Not including the beach or jogging, just generally. We're going to ask you guys, and then we'll report next week. Okay, this is the next topic. We are going to get into this right now. When cities win championships such as Boston, New England, they won the championship. There were some brawls going out on the streets. They shouldn't even be fighting because they win every year, but is it okay when cities riot a little bit? When the Eagles --
SHIMKUS: A little bit? Do you remember what happened last year? People were burning couches and flipping cars. That is not okay.
WATTERS: What if they haven't won a championship in many decades?
SHIMKUS: No, I will never understand why people get destructive after a win.
HORNACEK: Right, I don't -- that's exactly what I was going to say. I don't understand it. You should be happy, you should be celebrating. You should be climbing up light posts like the Eagles fans. You shouldn't be rioting. You shouldn't be getting mad at each other.
SHIMKUS: And they be hugging.
HORNACEK: You know what this is --
WATTERS: Well, no, it's exuberance. They are not trying to destroy property because they are angry. They are destroying property because they are happy.
SHIMKUS: In the first -- that doesn't -- in the first segment ...
WATTERS: Men like to break things.
SHIMKUS: We established that there was a difference between men and women, this is a prime example of it.
HORNACEK: Definitely.
SHIMKUS: Where men go to destruction and crazy town and women just, you know, kind of want to have a little bit of fun.
HORNACEK: I'll say this, I was so excited to meet Carley. She is also tall. She is a lot more beautiful than I am, but I was so excited, but I am not going to go beat her up. I am going to be happy and I hug --
SHIMKUS: I feel much more comfortable --
WATTERS: Okay, yes, ladies, please don't fight. We can't have that on "Watters' World." Okay, lastly, you know when you're in a plane. Have you guys ever been on an airplane waiting to take off and someone loses it, someone has to get hogtied off by marshals or someone starts letting loose on one of the fellow passengers.
HORNACEK: We were on the same plane the other day, I think that was you.
WATTERS: No, that was David Schwimmer. What is your move, in your opinion, if you are a fellow passenger and you see someone go bananas?
SHIMKUS: I have never -- this has never happened on a flight of mine, but I've always wanted it.
WATTERS: You want to have this sight.
SHIMKUS: Yes, because then it's a topic of conversation.
WATTERS: Do you take your phone out or do you try to intervene.
SHIMKUS: Absolutely phone out, not intervening whatsoever.
WATTERS: And then do you put it on "Fox and Friends" first.
SHIMKUS: Hundred percent.
WATTERS: What do you do? Do you try to wrestle them away?
HORNACEK: Let me ask you, I mean, was this after the Patriots just won the Super Bowl? Are these Patriots fans?
WATTERS: This is not a riot.
HORNACEK: Is this a sequel to the first video we watched.
WATTERS: No, I think she is just angry because she has been waiting on the plane for a long time.
HORNACEK: It's not okay because then you have to sit next to that person and they are obviously getting -- taken off the plane, but I mean, why make a scene? You are not going anywhere. You are literally on the ground
WATTERS: But if you are next to them, what's the move? Do you sit quietly and try not to get injured? Or do you try to break it up? Break it off?
HORNACEK: I will tell you this, I was on an elevator once in my building and there were two dogs that started fighting and I kind of reached down there, I still have a scar on my hand because the dogs bit me and I am like, if these are people, I think I am never going to try to break people up. I've learned my lesson. I'm going to stay out of it.
WATTERS: All right, so you say stay out of it. You say stay out of it.
SHIMKUS: Stay out of it or intervene. I am going with -- I will be a hero, I will intervene --
WATTERS: And you're going to videotape.
SHIMKUS: And I will videotape.
HORNACEK: I will videotape while you intervene.
SHIMKUS: I wear many hats in this fight.
WATTERS: All right, "Who is Right and Who is Wrong." We'll let the audience decide. Ladies, thank you very much.
HORNACEK: Thank you.
SHIMKUS: Thank you.
WATTERS: All right, up next the five things you didn't know about me. Get ready for this, up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Time for "Last Call." People seem to think they know a lot about me since they see me on TV. But I bet you didn't know this. I used to play the flute. You probably didn't think I had any musical talent anyway because you have seen my dance moves in the breaks. But I was really good. Just ask my mom.
And if you want to know some more things about me. Head over to Fox News Insider, "The Five Things You Didn't Know About Jesse Watters." That's all for us tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and remember I'm Watters' and this is my world.
