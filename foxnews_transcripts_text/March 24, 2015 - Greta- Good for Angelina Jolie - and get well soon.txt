Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. My hero today? Actress Angelina Jolie.
Now, I have been a big fan of her humanitarian work, but today she did more. She went public with something very personal. She had her ovaries removed because a blood test showed signs she might be in the early stages of ovarian cancer. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Some of you are thinking, "Yeah. At least she has the money and power to get checked early." This is true. That's a big advantage. But give her some big credit for going public. It's not fun to have very personal matters splattered all over the Internet and every tabloid. But she went public for the right reason, using her personal problems to help others. Her celebrity puts a big spotlight on this medical option. It educates others, which can save lives. That's a big deal. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And as an aside, don't forget Angelina Jolie's fame is from working hard and helping others. That's real success. Her fame is not because of some trashy event in her life, like bad behavior. So my message to Angelina: I don't know you, but good for you and get well soon. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
