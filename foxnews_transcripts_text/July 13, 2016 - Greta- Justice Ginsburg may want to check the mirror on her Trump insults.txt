Greta's 'Off the Record' comment to 'On the Record' viewers: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has the first amendment right to criticize Donald Trump. But she is not hiding her bias and will have to recuse herself from cases if Trump wins the presidency

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
When I heard that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg went off on Donald Trump calling him, a "faker" and saying Trump just says what comes into his head, my thought was "Oops. Justice Ginsburg might want to check the mirror because that's just exactly what she did. Saying whatever comes into her mind."
Now we all know she hates Trump. Hates him big-time, even threatening to move to New Zealand if he's elected. And, of course, she has a first amendment right to sling insults just like Trump does. And, again, she might want to check in the mirror on that one. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But if Trump does become president, she better recuse herself on all cases involving the White House. Because no one, not even the "New York Times" editorial page could ever think she could be fair. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And now I wonder what other biases are consuming her. And, by the way, she also took a slap at the press for being too gentle on Trump about not disclosing his tax returns. Meanwhile, she has no criticism for the press for being too gentle on Secretary Clinton for not disclosing transcripts of her speeches to Goldman Sachs. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, what's with that? Double standard? Bias? And that's my 'Off the Record" comment.
