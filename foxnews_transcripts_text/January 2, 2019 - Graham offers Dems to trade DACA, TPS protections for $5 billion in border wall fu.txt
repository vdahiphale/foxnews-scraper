SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: This is amazing. You start the year with 14 extra seconds for "Hannity". I love it, making it up for last year.

HANNITY: And happy New Year to all of you.
Welcome to "Hannity".

Yes, it's New Year. America is at a tipping point. I'm going to explain all of this.
I start the year with a promise. Over the next 12 months, we are going to, on this program, fight harder than ever to protect what makes this country great: our Constitution, our values. Yes, the forgotten men and women, the people that get up every day, pay their taxes, work hard. You, the American people, you're the people that make this country great. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, in a few moments, I'm going to introduce what is a new mission statement for this program, which will serve as a guiding light all throughout 2019. Plus, we're going to reveal a brand new segment tonight that we are calling "Hannity" watch. And it's going to help us look out for you while the rest of the media spends every second of air time just spewing nonstop hate against Donald Trump. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, of course, we'll address all the breaking news of the day, the crisis at our southern border, the ongoing government shutdown which is not really a shutdown, Mitt Romney's feckless flip flopping, and Elizabeth Warren's embarrassing run for the White House.
So, buckle up, we're glad you're with us, happy New Year, and each and every night, we will be here with you every step of the way, standing up for what is right for America. With every breaking story you won't see anywhere else, and fighting back against all the hate that is 24/7.
And it's time for our New Year breaking news opening monologue.

HANNITY: So, happy New Year to you and your families. Now, I have been off a couple of weeks.
And after watching news over vacation, it's very evident, it is transparent and it is clear that America is facing the biggest informational crisis we've ever faced. We have a duly elected put of the United States that is just truly hated by very powerful forces. And they have the united goal.  They want to destroy the presidency and this president. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It is so bad that the president, the first lady can't even visit our brave troops in Iraq or talk to kids about Santa Claus without what is brutal character assassination, personal attacks, and just pure hatred. This is why we are introducing new segments on this program. We're going to call them "Hannity Watch". 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We're going to have a "Hannity Watch" on media bias where we will expose all the hate Trump news coverage.
There is going to be a "Hannity Watch" on the economy -- things and how they impact your family, your pocketbook. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
"Hannity Watch" on healthcare. What is best for your family?
"Hannity Watch" on Hollywood, how they have an agenda that is both political and biased and designed to indoctrinate. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We'll have a "Hannity Watch" on campus where political correctness and indoctrination of our kids has gotten way out of control. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We'll have "Hannity Watch" on the deep state prediction, huge, stunning news this year that will expose biggest abuse of power, corruption of our own government.
We'll have "Hannity Watch" on socialism. That means the push to destroy free market capitalism. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
"Hannity Watch" on national security. How who protect our homeland and efforts by some to undermine these protections. We'll have Hannity on border security. We'll be watching there as well, as the country needs to stop the flow of drugs and human trafficking. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And every night, we're going to be asking this question: is what we are talking about good for America? Is it good for you? Is it good for your families? Is it good for we, the people?
Now, we plan to expose all the hatred that is out there every day. People that hate our Constitution. People that would shred our bill of rights, First, Second, Fourth Amendments.
Along the way, we're going to offer solutions to protect the interests of every American. This is not Republican or Democrat. This is not conservative or liberal. This is about what is right for this great country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, we begin -- that's my mission, the mission of this show going forward.  We want to look out for you, protect you, protect your family, fight daily to ensure this constitutional republic stays strong and vibrant for future generations. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And sadly, that's at risk. We have powerful forces and you can see them every day in society that have now aligned to destroy the president that we, the people have elected. It's a clear and present danger to every American, our Constitution and our future.
So, we are inviting you in every week night at 9:00. I can assure you and I promise you, there'll be no other show on television like this. And I hope you tell your friends and I hope you'll join us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All right. Tonight, we start our "Hannity Watch" report on the hateful forces that are determined to destroy Donald Trump and his administration.  Let me be clear. They hate this president. And they also deep down they hate we, the people that voted for him. They can't believe we made that decision.
You don't believe me? All right. Just listen to long serving Democratic Congressman Hank Johnson. This just happened yesterday. Take a look.

REP. HANK JOHNSON, R-GA.: Americans elected an authoritarian, anti- immigrant, racist strongman to the nation's highest office. Donald Trump and his Make America Great Again followers who want to return America back to a time when white men and white privilege were unchallenged, and where minorities and women were in their place. Much like Hitler took over the Nazi Party, Trump has taken over the Republican Party.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: These type of ignorant, hate-filled analogies are happening every day. And when they are not comparing us to Nazis, well, remember, we're the smelly Walmart people as FBI agent Peter Strzok called us, or the irredeemable deplorables that Hillary Clinton called us. Or remember when Obama referred to us he's the bitter, angry Americans that actually cling to our god, our guns, our bibles and our religion.

Now, many of these forces are forces of hate. We know that many hate the president. They hate we, the people.

        }
      
On this show, we are not going to be hating them back. Instead, every night on this program, we're going to be exposing them and what is the corrosive politics of division. This is what I call out five major forces of hate. You have the Democratic Party. If Donald Trump cured cancer today and gave every American millions of dollars today, every one, and they still try to destroy this man. As he represents to them the biggest obstacle to them regaining power.
Second, perhaps the most obvious haters in America, we have the hate Trump media. It's now on TV every newscast every second of every minute of every hour of every day. A never ending nonstop Trump hate-fest, it's on a loop.  And newspapers in this country, they are actually trying to outdo each other, showing how much they hate Trump the most. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, when is the media ever told you about these things, for example. This is what "Hannity Watch" is all about. What about the president's success over the last two years? What about the accomplishments that are scrolling on your screen that we are showing you tonight, night in and night out?  Things they never talk about. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Don't expect the mainstream media to show this report from Real Clear Politics. Look at this, detailing the president's top ten accomplishments of the year. Promises made, promises kept.
His successful appointment. He promised a guy like Brett Kavanaugh. Last year, he got it done for the Supreme Court. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Or the squeeze on China for unfair trade practices, intellectually property theft. That's changing.
The middle class wage increase, the highest in 12 years. The middle class that the Democrats claim to care about.

When he moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Smashing ISIS. Increasing jobs, the lowest numbers -- unemployment numbers for minorities. Keeping members of the migrant caravan from pouring into the country.
And we can't forget, this is my favorite -- America is now the largest oil- producing nation in the world. Not Russia. Not Saudi Arabia, the United States of America. And that doesn't include the pipelines being complete.  That doesn't include ANWR. That's going to be millions of high paying career jobs to our fellow Americans.
Now, third, forces of hate, the deep state. We already know Hillary Clinton play multiple felonies. She violated the Espionage Act, with top secret classified information on a private server.

We know she obstructed justice. We know she destroyed subpoenaed emails, erased hard drives, broke up phones and BlackBerrys and iPhones, et cetera, with a hammer.
We also know powerful people in the FBI and the DOJ purposely rigged the investigation to give her a pass that nobody else in America would ever get. That is not good for America. That's what we're asking tonight. Is it dangerous? The answer is obvious.
Now, all of this allowed Hillary to continue her pursuit of the presidency.  Remember, they thought she should win 100 million to zero and allowed her to funnel money into a law firm. Hire an op research firm, hire a foreign national, use dubious Russian sources, collusion, to create a phony debunked dossier on Donald Trump. Now, that's the collusion I guess they were looking for but don't want to find.

And those same Russian lies never verified were then used by top people at our intelligence community in the FBI, in the Justice Department, to get four FISA warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate both before and after the election. All signed off by top officials.
Here's a question tonight. Is that good for America or is that dangerous for America when you have fraud perpetrated on FISA court judges repeatedly? No arrests, no report yet, nobody held accountable? The media ignores the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in modern history?

Now, if this is allowed to continue, the United States of America will become a banana republic. We might as well shred the Constitution because it would be rendered meaningless. The principles of due process, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws, are similarly rendered meaningless.
The deep state has been and is out to destroy the president. They hate the president. And they are doing it by any means necessary, obviously, and that's based on what we know today.

Now, imagine if any American tonight like you Robert Mueller scrubbed the phones of Trump haters and Russian investigators Strzok and Page, clean, wipe them clean. Imagine if like James Comey that you bragged about tricking a 33-year war hero into an FBI interview by bypassing all the normal protocol and procedures that would -- that you would use in past administrations. Imagine the deputy FBI director telling General Flynn he didn't need a lawyer and then charging him for lying.

Now, on this show, moving forward, we are looking to protect you, protect this great country against forces of hate that would shred our Constitution. This will be your show. We will be your watchdog. We plan to expose all of this corruption. All of these lies, all the double standards when we see it.
Oh, you mean like hypocrisy when Democrats supported building a wall and don't any longer because Trump wants one? We're going to expose that there really is hit in miracle. Real hate. And that hate is aligns forces are trying to destroy the president. They hate the president and hate us for voting for him. They hate traditional core conservative values that we hold near and dear to our hearts.
Now, I'll admit, this one hour news program to be very blunt, this show will be an island unto itself. There will be no other show like it. I promise you. We are dedicated to protecting these deeply held American values, these principles, we are dedicated to telling you the truth about what's really happening in the country.
All right. Now we turn our "Hannity Watch" on border security tonight.  Look at this. A 5-month-old boy will never see his hero father again.  Newman, California police officer, legal immigrant, Ronil Singh, viciously murdered by illegal immigrant with a very long criminal track record and ties to violent gangs.

ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY SHERIFF: I simply want to focus on the fact that this is a criminal, illegal alien with prior criminal activity that should have been reported to ICE. We were prohibited, law enforcement was prohibited because of sanctuary laws and that led to the encounter with Officer Singh. I'm suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law enforcement wasn't restricted, prohibited, or had their hands tied because of political interference.

HANNITY: We're going to show you more of this later in the program tonight. But sadly, what happened in Newman, California, is all too common an occurrence. Over the weekend, a 22-year-old man in Knoxville, Tennessee, killed by suspected illegal immigrant who swerved into oncoming traffic. Just before Christmas, three illegal immigrants were indicted for the murder of a man living in Long Island.
So many lives have been senselessly lost at the hands of people who never should have ever been in this country ever on the federal level.
Let me say these statistics really slow so even Nancy Pelosi, who doesn't want to fund a wall and protected borders, she can understanding. Since 2014: 51 murder convictions have been handed down to illegal immigrants, 228 federal assault sentences, nearly 20,000 drug trafficking sentences.
On the state level, it's even worse. According to the GAO, and their estimates since 1964, 27,300 arrests for murder have been carried out by illegal immigrants. Over 120,000 sex offenses. Nearly 400,000 assault charges. Over 1,000 acts of terror.
Here's a tough question. I want people to fully understand this.
If people keep getting killed, this 5-month-old boy will never see his father, his father the hero that got killed this weekend, because would have people in custody, we know they are here illegally. They commit other crimes. We don't hand them over to ICE, we won't enforce the law and deport them -- well, is Congress going to pay to raise the children of those killed like in the case of this California officer? Will Congress pay for the children's college education? Will they at least pay for the funeral?
Because at some point, they bear some of the burden because these failed government policies are now aiding and abetting criminal activity that otherwise would not happen if we enforce the law, if we protected our borders. And Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats, they are now willing to shut down the government to prevent even a partial funding of a border wall that protects people on both sides. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, this wall is designed to give border agents more time to apprehend those that want to cross illegally. I will be the first to concede, probably the vast majority, 99 percent, of people that want to cross into our country, they are looking for better life for themselves, their families, their children and an opportunity that they don't have in their own country. I don't blame them.
We have a right to know who is coming into in country. We support legal immigration.
On New Year's Eve, you got 150 individuals, there's the video, attempting to break across California's border with Mexico. Again, rocks, other projectiles thrown at border agents.
And keep in mind those who successfully cross our border illegally on average, if they get across, criminal justice system, educational system, healthcare system, it's costing we, the taxpayers around $70,000 per person.
Even top Democrats a few years ago realize the importance of stemming the tide of illegal immigration. Many of them sounded like Donald Trump. Take a look.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: People who enter the United States without our permission are illegal aliens and illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the U.S. legally. The American people will never accept immigration reform unless they truly believe that their government is committed to ending future illegal immigration.
FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Those who enter our country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law. And because we live in an age where terrorists are challenging our borders, we cannot allow people to pour into the U.S. undetected, undocumented, and unchecked.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Oh, they sounded like Trump. Now because Trump wants it, they don't want it.
Make no mistake. This battle is important. It's about saving lives. It's about stopping illegal immigration and drug trafficking and human trafficking. The president must stay strong on his promise, get that wall fully built. They started, but we've got more to go.
I personally would declare this a national security issue. And the commander-in-chief, my vantage point, he could allocate $5 billion from the military budget and get the job done. Government stays shut down, essential services, don't let the media scare you, that continues. Social Security check also go out. The Coast Guard is on duty. Our military branches are on duty and the people will be taken care of.
But the cost of unfettered of illegal immigration is too high. The risks are too great.

How would you feel new everywhere family member of this young officer with a 5-month-old son killed this weekend? This is an issue literally of life and death. Those drugs, they're headed to small towns and big cities all across America.
So, to my weak Republican friends in Washington, hold the line, have a backbone, have a spine, you are there to serve the American people. We must give our border agents the tools they need, including the wall so they can end human trafficking, drug trafficking, violent criminals, each some terrorists or anybody else who plans to break our laws and hurt our fellow American citizens. We support legal immigration.
On this program Republican, Democrat, I don't care. We will call you out, especially Republicans who don't hold the line and fund a border wall.  This is worth fighting for.
And, by the way, the president has promised to make Mexico pay for the wall -- well, it wasn't Mexico ever going to write a check? And we got a "Hannity" flashback from then candidate Trump on the campaign trail. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: You don't expect Mexico to say, yes, Mr. Trump, here's a check of $10 million.
TRUMP: It's not feasible. It wouldn't look good.
HANNITY: So, you think the deals that you'll make would more than compensate for the wall.
TRUMP: Yes, even if we tax them, we may tax them, it doesn't make any difference.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Now, that's a key reason the president renegotiated our trade deal with Mexico. We'll have more on this throughout the show.
All right, let's turn our attention just briefly to Mitt Romney. He's not been sworn in as senator. And Romney is already launching a feckless attack against the president, following his op-ed slamming President Trump for so-called character and leadership issues. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Well, the RNC chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, his niece, tweeted: well, for an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack President Trump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and the media want. And it's disappointing and unproductive.
Our friend, the great one, Mark Levin, issued an even dire warning, writing: It's clear Romney will be the destructive force in the Senate, playing to the liberal media, which will praise him and seeking to create a pathway to the presidency.
And I'll add, by the way -- and I supported Mitt Romney. That's the same media that brutalized him in 2012. It's sad that he has more interest in cozying up for those people on the left that hated him than sticking up for protecting American citizens.
Record low unemployment, American energy independence, securing our borders, issues he claims about this president. Democrats continue to pursue those radical left agenda. In 90 days, you will know how left they are.
All right. We got to take a break. We have a new mission statement. We hope you will join us each week night at 9:00.
When we come back, we'll check in with Congressman Steve Scalise, who's with the president today. Senator Lindsey Graham, Rudy Giuliani for an exclusive interview and much more "Hannity Watch" every night, right here on the Fox News Channel.

TRUMP: People have been fantastic. You have headed it up. I have to say they really have done a great job.
And again, we want to finish it. We want to complete it, because you can't have a partial wall. Those people come through the area it's not built.  But the areas that are built, nobody is getting through. You can't get through.
Unless you are a world class pole vaulter in the Olympic team, it's very hard to get through. Very few people are able to get through.

HANNITY: All right. As we continue our Hannity watch on the border crisis. That was President Trump from earlier today during his meeting with cabinet officials. Now, this afternoon, there was a briefing inside the Situation Room with congressional leaders about the border.

It's interesting and we go back a couple years ago, all these Democrats supported building wall, now they don't support building a wall. But the problem is people like this officer in California are dying because we are not enforcing the law.
How does Congress justify what I believe is aiding and abetting by releasing people that we know broke our laws and should be sent back?
REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA.: Well, Sean, it's good to be back on with you. And what you saw today in the White House with the meeting we had with the president was an example what we've seen for a long time. A lot of these Democrats who -- as Chuck Schumer did back in 2006 voted for a wall, voted for, by the way, $25 billion for the wall. Now, the president is saying we need $5 billion next year and they are opposing it because of Donald Trump. Not because of any policy issues.
What do they say to Officer Singh and his family, which a horrible heartbreaking story and unfortunately live it happens over and over every single day at the border?
By the way, our Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was getting ready to give a briefing on all of the problems, the crisis at the border, at the beginning of this White House briefing and Pelosi, Schumer, kept interrupting her because they didn't want to hear the numbers. The numbers, Sean, by the way are alarming. You've seen these.
Last year alone, over 3,700 known or suspected terrorists were stopped from entering our country. Thousands of criminals, not just people coming over to seek the American dream like many would have you believe, but people who are actually convicted criminals were stopped, and those are the ones we stopped. How many got across where we don't know about, where we don't have walls?
And when we have walls, by the way, there's over 90 percent decrease in that kind of criminal activity and illegal crossings. So, this is a national crisis we have. The question is going to be, are they for border security or not, because they can't say they're for border security and then oppose the very things our experts say they need to the secure the border. And that's what this funding battle is all about. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
HANNITY: Do you think based on what their prior position was, versus where they are today, that this is all personal, that this is all politics? Because at the end of the day, if you have a criminal alien that's supposed to be deported, but you don't hand them over to ICE as a matter of a sanctuary city or state policy, aren't they aiding and abetting whatever future crimes are committed, in this particular case murder. Did they aid and abet?
SCALISE: Well, clearly you've got some of that blood on your hands if you are okay with that kind of policy. You can't deny what it does, because here in a sanctuary city like you saw in California sanctuary state, they are not allowed as the sheriff said. They're not allowed to turn those kind of criminals over when they're released from prison - over to ICE. They're not allowed to share some of that information with our border agents who are tasked with keeping our country safe.
And look, a lot of these democrats appear in Congress, they don't even want ICE. Last year alone Sean, our ICE agents, our border agents on the interior of our country stopped and saved over 900 kids from being sexually assaulted and human trafficked.
That's going on at our border and they're stopping it, but they're surely not stopping all of it, and so why would they oppose this kind of funding it's because they're not for border security. You can't say you're for border security and then oppose the very things that everybody - all of our experts are saying it's going to take to keep this country safe.
HANNITY: All right, Congressman Scalise. Thank you for sharing your thoughts what's going on in the House, what happened with the President. Joining us now with more on the battle over the border the so-called big government shutdown, which is never really a shutdown, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is with us.
Senator it makes my blood boil because this has happened time and again. We have people that didn't respect our laws or our sovereignty, come to America, commit more crimes. They are in custody and then they are literally - like a state like California they are protected from the laws of the land and they commit horrific crimes.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Right
HANNITY: Now is California, are they going to pay the funeral cost, are they going to pay the college tuition. How do they explain to this five month old little boy that daddy's never coming back again?
GRAHAM: Well these policies that make it more likely that terrorists, drug dealers and criminals can come to America and have safe haven. So you said before, I think, Steve is a great guy. He said democrats are not for border security. Yes, they are except when Trump's President. I've seen them in action.
They have all voted for 25, $42 billion you name the number for border security. They won't give a dime to this President, because they want him to fail. Walls work. Trump said, let's make a deal. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer said go to hell. We'll see what happens.
HANNITY: You offered a compromise. Now, Democrats also say they care about the dollar--
GRAHAM: Yes.
HANNITY: What is your compromise?
GRAHAM: Compromise is give President the $5 billion we need for wall/border security as a down payment to securing the border. The DACA population, about 700,000, give them work permits - three-year work permits so they don't have to worry about getting deported any time soon.
The TPS people who came here years ago from war-torn areas, hurricanes and floods, we know their legal status, no pathway to citizenship and call it a day. It's called compromise. The President said, let's make a deal. The press - the Democratic response is basically, go to hell.
They're going to send a bill from the House to the Senate that has no money for the wall. It's not going to see the light of day. Mitch McConnell is never going to bring the bill onto the floor of the Senate that doesn't have money for the wall. We need the wall. They've all voted for the wall--
HANNITY: Let me ask you this.
GRAHAM: --and the only way we're ever going to get the wall is to fight for it.
HANNITY: This is a battle to me worth having and I know it's inconvenient - by the way I support.
GRAHAM: Yes.
HANNITY: All those furloughed employees, I don't want them caught in a political crossfire. They deserve their back pay it's through no fault of their own that that they are not viewed as essential services.
But will the President - does the President have other options for the wall? For example, why is this not viewed - he's the Commander in Chief. He's in charge of national security of this country, why couldn't defense department funds be used to secure our border to stop the drug trafficking, human trafficking and even the criminal gangs and the 3,700 terrorists that Steve Scalise mentioned that were caught trying to cross our border. Why is that not a national security Defense Department issue?
GRAHAM: You can't move some money around, but he'll get sued. There'll be lawsuits in California to stop any effort to have other agencies fund the border. But there's some money you could use for sure. But why should this President have to play that game? Why should Donald Trump have to do that when Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents in the past were able to get money to secure the border on Democrats.
HANNITY: OK. Last question.
GRAHAM: He shouldn't have to do that. We're going to fight.
HANNITY: I agree you. I support--
GRAHAM: I don't know how this money (coming) in, but we're not giving up till we get the money.
HANNITY: If this takes 150, I think the Republican Party needs to stand united with the President. I don't - I have confidence in you. I don't have confidence in some of your colleagues. But saving lives, stopping drug trafficking and human trafficking is worth the fight. Will the President hold the line? Will he have the Republican support he needs to hold the line?
GRAHAM: Well let me tell you how our government works. Any bill passed from the House has to come to the Senate, has to get 60 votes, and for it to be signed into law the President has to sign it. He's not going to sign a bill that doesn't have money for the wall.
I'll tell you exactly how this is going to end. The President is going to challenge the Democrats to compromise and if they continue to say no, they're going to pay a price with American people. Most Americans want to do two things, they want to secure our border and they want to be reasonable to people like the DACA population. If he gives in now, that's the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective President, that's probably the end of his Presidency.
Donald Trump has made a promise to the American people, he's going to secure our border. Every Democrat in the past--
HANNITY: I agree with you--
GRAHAM: --has stuck with the border funding. Now they're changing their mind.
HANNITY: It's too important, too many lives at stake, too much danger to the country. Senator good to see you. Thanks for being with us.
GRAHAM: That's the end of us if we give on this issue as Republicans.
HANNITY: I'll get your--
GRAHAM: I hope Mitt Romney and everybody else.
HANNITY: --hope your colleagues, some of them are pretty weak, help them grow a spine, will you. Anyway thanks for being with us. Happy New Year.
GRAHAM: This good man.
HANNITY: When we come back Rudy Giuliani live in studio. Later Lawrence Jones went to California asking people what they think about that state sanctuary policies, our special Hannity Watch report on the border's will continue and much more, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. It's day 595 of the Mueller witch-hunt and The Hill's John Solomon out with a huge bombshell report tonight, exculpatory Russia evidence about Michael Flynn that the us intel kept secret.
John Solomon reporting on Rudy Giuliani's call for Mueller to be investigated over obstruction of justice, President's attorney, Former New York City Mayor, Rudy Giuliani joins us for our Hannity Deep State Watch tonight. Mr. Mayor how are you?
RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Welcome back.
HANNITY: I wish I had that ring. By the way, which is the Yankee Championship ring that you have, deserve. All right. So let me start with this first report which is Mueller's should be investigated for the destruction of evidence. Ken Starr agrees with you as well. And that is the erased text messages of the lead investigators at the start of this investigation.
GIULIANI: Well, this would be a massive scandal if it happened to us, if it happened. If we were producing documents for them, we said, we have 19,000 texts, right, are relevant period that--
HANNITY: The relevant period--
GIULIANI: Yes. That we had erased. It was erased by Mueller, by the way. Was erased by Mueller's record officer, who claims that he or she looked at them and they don't contain anything pertinent. Now how can that be?
Strzok and Page were texting every day about how much they hated Trump, how much they wanted to get him out, how much they wanted to stop him, how they had an insurance policy to get him out.
All of a sudden they went to work for Mueller and they stopped texting back and forth. It makes no sense. What makes sense to me is, there are some highly damaging texts about the - about the way this investigation began as a completely illegitimate attempt to destroy Donald Trump.
This is an investigation in search of a crime and they haven't found one yet. Collusion is not a crime. It's not a crime.
HANNITY: Firing Comey is not a crime.
GIULIANI: Firing Comey is not a crime. The campaign contributions are not criminal. They're not even a violation of the campaign finance law. They're paying off a possible civil judgment. This is - make up a crime, make up a crime, make up a crime, hoping to find one eventually.
HANNITY: And they get everybody on press--
GIULIANI: And then they frame certain people. Look what they did to a Flynn. What they did to Flynn is outrageous. He told them something. They had the paper in their drawers--
HANNITY: No, no, by the paper, you mean the transcript?
GIULIANI: The transcript--
HANNITY: That they surveilled him, they amassed him, they leaked raw intelligence.
GIULIANI: If they were searching for the truth, they'd put that in front of him and said, "General, does this refresh your recollection?" I know this game. I used to play it, a lot more ethically than they do.
HANNITY: But it's even worse than that, because you had the Deputy FBI Director, McCabe say, "Oh, you don't need a lawyer". And then you had the FBI Director said, "Oh, it's four days into the Trump administration, we're not going to follow the normal process and go through the White House counsel".
GIULIANI: Yes. We think we can get away with it, because he is not experienced enough.
HANNITY: Wow.
GIULIANI: Get away with what?
HANNITY: Four day.
GIULIANI: Get away with unethical behavior, possibly illegal behavior, totally reprehensible behavior on the part of a prosecutor. If General Flynn was sympathetic to the liberal media, they'd be outraged about this. They'd be demanding that this case be dismissed just to teach the prosecutor a lesson.
HANNITY: Will Hillary ever get in trouble for the violations of the Espionage Act? Will she ever get in trouble for the destruction - obstruction of justice by destroying subpoenaed e-mails? Will the FISA - we know now that the top officials in the FBI and DoJ lied and presented unverified information to FISA Court Judges to obtain a warrant on a Trump campaign adviser.
GIULIANI: Yes, that - those four affidavits of false. They're false affidavits.
HANNITY: What would happen if I did that?
GIULIANI: You'd be under investigation possibly indicted by now.
HANNITY: Would you - if you're my lawyer, could you get me off?
GIULIANI: I don't think so, not unless there was one - an explanation I didn't know about. But the reality is it has to be investigated and it's not being investigated. And Mueller has to be investigated for wiping out those texts at an extremely relevant period of time.
They say it's part of the Justice Department retention policy. Garbage. It's not part of the Justice Department retention policy to destroy evidence. You can't supersede the law and say I'm going to have a -
HANNITY: The people that said Hillary should win a 100 million to zero. That said the Trump voters, he could smell, because they're smelling Walmart people. That had an insurance policy and a media leak strategy.
GIULIANI: Well, here's the mentality, I know these people. I knew him when I was Mayor. I knew them before I was Mayor. I grew up in a liberal city. These people are on a moral high ground. They can justify any means for their end, which is to save the country from Donald Trump and put us in the hands of Hillary Clinton or somebody else.
HANNITY: Here's a question. Do you see a day where Hillary's held accountable? Those that sign those phony FISA warrants are in trouble? Comey is in trouble, McCabe is in trouble? Legally - Lisa Page and Strzok, are they ever going to get in trouble?
GIULIANI: Everything you're describing is more serious than any crime they've looked at - the peripheral crimes they've looked at. A false statement by General Flynn, in which they're asking for no time in jail, how could he have been a traitor or committed treason--
HANNITY: That was awful.
GIULIANI: And then they don't ask for time in jail? The prosecutor is not asking for time in jail?
HANNITY: When does this end?
GIULIANI: It ends when he files his report and we can answer it. Whatever garbage he has there - I'm ready to answer.
HANNITY: Will there be a Giuliani report?
GIULIANI: Damn right, there will be a Giuliani report, and I think it'll be the definitive. Our report will be the definitive report, because it'll be the truth. The President did nothing wrong.
HANNITY: Mr. Mayor Happy New Year.
GIULIANI: Thank you.
HANNITY: Good to see. I want that ring.
GIULIANI: Next Christmas.
HANNITY: When we come back Lawrence Jones went to California to find out what people think of that state sanctuary city policies in light of this brave officer being murdered and he's going to speak with police officials in Newman, California, that's after the death this past weekend. Sanctuary city laws, what role did that play? In this case, a huge one. Hannity Watch continues.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Earlier today, illegal immigrant Gustavo Perez Arriaga was formally charged with the murder of Newman, California police corporal Ronil Singh during a traffic stop last week we sent Fox News Contributor, Lawrence Jones to Newman, California to see what the people thought of that state sanctuary policies and much more. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You heard about the shooting of officer Singh. How do you feel about it.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, it's really unfortunate. I feel really sad about it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm going to try and keep it together, it's very emotional for me. He was a friend.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We knew him and he was a great man.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It shouldn't have happened here and that stuff shouldn't happen anywhere.
JONES: A lot of people are blaming the California sanctuary state policy, do you agree with that?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's the worst thing California has done in long time.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not the big wall person.
JONES: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But I think, a sanctuary state is crazy.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we didn't have that policy this would have never happened.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sanctuary city policy, it's the stupidest thing that Democrats could have ever done in this country.
JONES: The President says he's going to keep the government shut down until they can figure out this immigration policy, do you agree with the President on that?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not the way he's going about it, no.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Somebody's got to do something and he's got the guts to do it.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If that's what it takes to protect our country, our state, our nation, that's what we need to do.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Some of us agree with him and some of us don't, but he's the President. He's going to do what he feels is right for the rest of us here.
JONES: The local town sheriff said that he believed that he could have prevented this if he could have notified ICE about the two DUI charges from the illegal immigrant.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mm-hmm
JONES: How do you feel about it, do you agree with him?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I agree with him, yes. I agree with him a 100 percent, we do, yes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right now with more on our Hannity border watch investigation tonight, County Sheriff Adam Christianson and Newman Police Chief, Randy Richardson. Guys, I don't even know what to say.
Sheriff, I'll start with you. This man was a hero. He had a five month-old son. Wasn't this man already in custody and if they didn't have sanctuary city laws, wouldn't he been deported by this time well?
ADAM CHRISTIANSON, STANISLAUS COUNTY SHERIFF: I would hope so Sean, and that's why we are trying to spirit a positive dialogue and find resolution to the issue of unlawful, illegal immigration.
This is really simple. If you set aside for a moment, what we call, political interference, what the sanctuary policies that have been discussed. And you set aside the media's effort to convince people that the Sheriff's wrong. This really wasn't preventable, that we could have reported this individual to ICE.
Set that aside for a moment and ask yourself the question, why are we allowing criminal illegal aliens into this country and why is there any political interference in the first place in our ability to protect our communities and to have a communication or at least work with ICE?
HANNITY: Police Chief, I look at this my blood boils, thinking about this five month old kid. And from everything I've heard, Corporal Singh was just an outstanding officer. When you know that we have these criminal aliens in custody and as a matter of state law, we don't follow our national laws. At some point isn't the government aiding and abetting whatever else they do?
RANDY RICHARDSON, NEWMAN, CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEF: Ron, like you said, was a great man and you do look at his son and his family, they came here the right way. They came to America--
HANNITY: Legally.
RICHARDSON: Ronil had a dream, and his dream was to be a police officer, and he fulfilled that dream. And I heard his brother say today and that his brother died doing what he loved to do, and he died a hero, and I couldn't agree with that more.
HANNITY: But is the government - at some point does the government, by not enforcing what are our immigration laws and forbidding you as law enforcement officers, as a matter of state law from enforcing federal immigration laws, don't they have culpability here? Sheriff?
CHRISTIANSON: I believe they do, Sean. And remember, government's number- one priority is to protect its citizens. That includes border security, it includes knowing who is here and knowing who needs to be removed.
HANNITY: And I'll give you the last word, Police Chief.
RICHARDSON: You know, it's tragic that we actually have to stand here today and have this conversation. I'm well aware that this is a very political situation. A, you couldn't script it any more political, you have a legal immigrant and an illegal immigrant that we're talking about.
But I want everyone to remember the family. What this man came here to do--
HANNITY: I want that too--
RICHARDSON: --he wanted to be a police officer. And it's time it's time we start talking about, having discussions about making communities talk to each other and getting back to where we were years ago, where we weren't fighting amongst each other all the time.
HANNITY: All we got to do is enforce the law. Enforce the law and lives will be saved. This can't happen anymore. We owe it to these families. This man was a hero. My prayers to his family, my prayers to you officers and fellow sheriff's out there and we deserve better. Thank you for being with us.
When we come back you won't believe a segment over fake news CNN what they ran over the holidays, unbelievable. Hannity media watch next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. In tonight Media Watch segment - in Hannity Media Watch segment, CNN ran a segment, so ridiculous, we had to share it with you. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you a witch?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm a practicing witch. That's how I make my living, yes.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And which kind witch are you?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm initiated to into Wicca, which is a religious side of things.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Witches tend to side with liberals. And you know what they wish? President Trump would stop saying about the Mueller investigation?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's a witch hunt.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: I don't even have words. All right. We have a new format.
