Let's all go "Off the Record" for minute. The Associated Press has some explaining to do. The AP is supposed to be the gold standard - just the facts, no agenda, no opinion. But now AP's bias is showing. It's leaking into its reporting.
First, it was the two very different ways the AP tweeted about Secretary Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina's presidential campaign announcements. For Secretary Clinton, the AP tweeted Hillary Rodham Clinton, in kickoff to 2016 campaign "embraces her potential to make history." That sounds big. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And Carly Fiorina? "Former technology executive Carly Fiorina says she is seeking GOP presidential nomination." You could hear the collective AP yawn with that one. Carly Fiorina, well she's just running. But Hillary Clinton, she's embracing her potential to make history. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And now, check out these pictures the AP took of a Republican president candidate, Senator Ted Cruz, and look at the picture framing with the gun. The AP says that it was an accident, that the pictures were not intended to portray Senator Cruz in a bad light. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But if the frame shots were accidental, why did the AP send the pics out to everyone in the news business? Yes, disappointing. It turns out the AP is not just the facts.
And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
