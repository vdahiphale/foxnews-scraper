MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Good Sunday morning. Welcome to "SundayMorning Futures." I'm Maria Bartiromo.Down to the wire. President Trump's legal team presses on with charges ofvoter fraud with exactly three weeks before the official state-by-stateelection certification, and amidst demands of evidence from Democrats andthe media.Today, no politics, just the law, with outside legal analysis on whetherTrump has a path to victory and the evidence to prove it in court.Renowned attorney Alan Dershowitz is here on the evidence, the charges, andthe Supreme Court.Plus: the only other race that matters right now, razor-thin margins in twoSenate run-off races in Georgia that will dictate policy for America foryears to come. The man leading the recount in Georgia, Congressman DougCollins, on the back-and-forth recount on what it means for the Senateraces on January 5, as outside money pores into Georgia, and some Democratsthreaten to move there to affect the election.Also, the wins keep on coming. Fresh off of his own victory in California,the new face of the House Republicans and the man staring down thespeaker's gavel in 2022 midterm elections, GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy ishere, as he sits atop a larger and more diverse membership.Plus, the ranking member of the GOP Intelligence Committee on the crimesthat will not go away, no matter who is president, Congressman Devin Nuneson the whereabouts of John Durham and Bill Barr on a case that is stillpending for the former leadership of the FBI.It's all coming up right here, right now, as we look ahead on "SundayMorning Futures."And first this morning, Congressman Kevin McCarthy was unanimouslyreelected as leader of the House Republicans this week, after the GOPflipped 12 seats and diversified victories for incoming women, veterans andminorities, these wins putting him on track to retake both the majority andthe speaker's gavel in 2022, something he says will likely happen.Leader McCarthy joins me right now.Congratulations, Congressman, and good morning to you.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  Good morning, Maria. And thanks for having usback.BARTIROMO:  So, first, assess the situation for us after 12 flipped seats.What does the new face of the House Republicans look like?MCCARTHY:  Well, the face looks very tremendous.I mean, we have had more women than at any time serving in Congress. TheRepublican Party really had made great gains. Not only did we flip 12.There are four more races out there, and we're ahead in all four of them.So, I'd expect, as the week progresses, that we will end up somewherearound 212, 213 seats. And it only takes 218 for a majority.This will be the closest of a majority that at any time since World War II.And, really, nobody saw this coming. The American people have now rejectedNancy Pelosi and the Democrat socialist policies.The next two years are going to be about the Republican commitment vs. theDemocrats' agenda.BARTIROMO:  So, how does that play out in real time then? Tell me aboutwhat that gives you as a party in terms of potential votes, in terms ofactually impacting policy that will impact the rest of us?MCCARTHY:  Well, when we talk about policy, another reason why theDemocrats lost, their agenda to defunding the police just didn't play,where the Republicans had a Commitment to America, to make our streetssafe, to defeat this virus, to rebuild our infrastructure, to end ourdependency on the China infrastructure.That's the agenda we will move forward. And we will be looking to get fiveto six more Democrats to join with us, and then we will be able to run thefloor. That's the difference. We have a commitment. Theirs has a simpleagenda that defunds the police, discredits and just -- the American public.And I just don't see that that sells going forward, this socialist agenda.BARTIROMO:  So, tell me about what this means for your potential ofbecoming the speaker in 2022.First of all, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly over these last couple ofweeks that they have a mandate. Do you believe there is a mandate? And,Congressman, have you spoken with Speaker Pelosi?MCCARTHY:  Well, there is no mandate.If there's a mandate, the American public has rejected the socialist agendaand defunding of the police. Remember, we are five seats away from winningthe majority.But what you will find at the end of the day is, there are 18 Democrats whohave won reelection with 52 percent of the vote or less. I believe, at theend of the day, we will gain the majority next time, and we could actuallyrun the floor this time through our Commitment to America.I have not spoken to the speaker. I have called her and left her a message.I have spoken to the majority leader numerous times. And this is the realproblem. Here we have a COVID challenge out inside this country.Nancy Pelosi, for the last six months, has said, it's better to do nothingthan something. Her own members lost over her policies. There were 23Democrats who have signed a letter back in September who said, if NancyPelosi would not come to an agreement, that they would cite a dischargepetition.And what that means to your viewers is, we could actually bring legislationto the floor around Nancy Pelosi. That would be the PPP for the smallbusiness. Those people who are employed by small businesses can get paid,because there's $138 billion just sitting there.So, instead of Nancy Pelosi holding everything up, just as she won't let itgo through the American public, she doesn't want to talk about coming to anagreement, something that would be stronger for the American public, theDemocrats have just lost in this election.And the Republicans, come January, have the momentum to actually run thefloor, because our ideas are stronger and reflect the American public'sviews.BARTIROMO:  Well, we're going to talk about that, because now there's a lotof worry about voter fraud, as you know. And there will likely be anotherrecount in Georgia.If we were to see voter fraud and then the Democrats take the Senate,you're going to see a very different policy agenda than the Republicansbeing in charge, right?MCCARTHY:  Yes, a very big challenge here, what's happening in Georgia.Everybody should be paying attention.And to watch the Democrats publicly say they want to cheat, that they wantto move into the state just to vote to determine an outcome, that shouldnot be allowed.What else we should find is, all these irregular activities that havehappened in this election, we should correct and not allow this to moveforward. Every voice should be heard. Every vote should be counted. Everyrecount should be verified. And every legal challenge has a right to beheard.We have done this for 200 years. Why would we stop now?BARTIROMO:  Yes.MCCARTHY:  And you have two U.S. Senate seats, and you have the Senatemajority in peril right now on this election that is coming up January 5.This is where the focus should be. And we should be able to win those twoseats, because what would that mean? Socialized medicine would end.Defunding the police would not move forward. Chuck Schumer, when he'sscreaming there, we have Georgia, then we control the world, or change theworld, that is really what is at play right here for the next few weeks.BARTIROMO:  Yes, he said, we take Georgia and then we change America. And Iknow that that would also lead to the world as well.But, Congressman, I want to go back to two things that you said. First ofall, you haven't spoken to Nancy Pelosi, I understand, in several months.Has it been a year that you haven't had a straight-on conversation withNancy Pelosi?MCCARTHY:  No, I have talked to her within the year.But -- and this is a real challenge. I have called her after the election.The majority leader called and congratulated me on the victories. And wehave talked about the agenda moving forward, Steny Hoyer and I. And that'swhat you need to have inside Congress.When the elections are over, you're going to have to find a way that youmove forward. We have different philosophies, and we're going to keep thosephilosophies, but we're going to find a way that we can work for theAmerican public.The speaker, just as she said in the past, that doing nothing is betterthan something, the only challenge that is being held up for those who areunemployed, for those small business workers who need the money, who have adream that they find that could end if they don't have resources and help,is really stuck with Nancy Pelosi.All the other times, we have been able to do a CARES Act and others. Butthe speaker wants to put that socialist agenda her way or no way. And shehas said it time and again. That's become a real challenge. But I believe,in this last election, they rejected that view. They rejected the view ofNancy Pelosi.BARTIROMO:  Right.MCCARTHY:  And, remember, she still needs 218 votes on the floor. And thereare 10 Democrats who got reelected who did not vote for her last time.BARTIROMO:  Right.MCCARTHY:  So, if 10 Democrats, the same 10, vote against her, she will notbe speaker.BARTIROMO:  So, real quick on the COVID relief.Do you expect anything this year during the lame-duck session? Should weexpect more stimulus coming?MCCARTHY:  Well, the American public should expect it out of their electedofficials.There are 23 Democrats who signed a letter in September who said they wouldsign the discharge petition if they had no recourse with Nancy's actions.Well, now is the time. I'm right here in D.C. today. If they signed it, wecould get it out in one day. That's the difference.We are ready to act, willing to act, and willing to work with anybody. Wejust have a speaker who believes nothing is more important than something.BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. Of course, we will befollowing it and watching you throughout.Congressman Kevin McCarthy, we will see you soon, sir. Thank you.MCCARTHY:  Thank you.BARTIROMO:  Coming up, we're going to take a look at this election, ofcourse, the media declaring Joe Biden president-elect. Is it still possiblefor Donald Trump to turn the 2020 election around in court, as his legalteam says?Constitutional scholar Alan Dershowitz is here. He will weigh in on theevidence after this short break.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.President Trump's legal team has just three weeks left to gather enoughevidence of fraud to contest the 2020 election results in court, somethingSidney Powell, one of the lead attorneys on the case, says she can do.Here is what she told me this week on "Mornings With Maria" on Friday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO:  Will you be able to present, are you planning to present actualevidence of all that you have said, Dominion voting machines swapping votesfrom Trump to Biden, as well as an effort to actually change the results ofan election? You will be able to prove that in court in the next two weeks?SIDNEY POWELL, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, I fully expect we willbe able to prove all of it in court within the next two weeks, although thefraud case itself doesn't have to be done within the two weeks.But we have more than enough evidence now. We have more evidence now thanhalf the prison population is imprisoned on.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now, outside legal analysis fromconstitutional legal scholar Alan Dershowitz. He was also part of PresidentTrump's impeachment defense team.Alan, it is good to see you this morning. Thank you so much for being here.ALAN DERSHOWITZ, ATTORNEY:  Thank you.BARTIROMO:  Alan, we want to get your independent opinions here, because weknow what Rudy Giuliani and what Sidney Powell has been charging.Can you tell us if you believe there is a path for victory for PresidentTrump, amidst these charges?DERSHOWITZ:  Well, let me give you my completely objective, not wishfulthinking, constitutional analysis.They have two or three legal constitutional paths. For example, inPennsylvania, they have two very strong legal arguments, one, that thecourts changed what the legislature did about counting ballots after theend of Election Day.That's a winning issue in the Supreme Court. I don't necessarily supportit, but it's a winning issue in the Supreme Court. And Justice Alito hasalready hinted that's a winning issue.They also have a winning issue on the Supreme Court on equal protection,that some counties allowed flawed ballots to be cured, while others didn't.Bush vs. Gore suggests that an equal protection argument can prevail.The problem with that argument is, they don't have the numbers necessarilyto support it. If it's right that Biden is ahead by some 70,000 or 80,000votes, they have to show enough contested votes, under those two legaltheories, to change the outcome.The other legal theory they had, which is a potentially strong one, is thatthe computers, either fraudulently or by glitches, changed hundreds ofthousands of votes. There, there are enough votes to make a difference, butI haven't seen the evidence to support that.So, in one case, they don't have the numbers. In another case, they don'tseem yet to have the evidence. Maybe they do. I haven't seen it. But thelegal theory is there to support them if they have the numbers and theyhave the evidence.BARTIROMO:  OK.And, of course, the media wants to see the evidence now, Alan.DERSHOWITZ:  Right.BARTIROMO:  But Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis continue tosay that they aren't going to litigate this in the public square, in themedia space. They are going to drop lawsuits.Now, I -- one of my sources tells me that one of the first suits that theyare going to bring is this week in Georgia. Let me show you a list of someof the things that the legal team of President Trump is charging and getyour thoughts on this.DERSHOWITZ:  Sure.BARTIROMO:  You just mentioned the computers.This is -- has to do with Smartmatic election software. They say, numberone, observers prevented them from seeing the ballots. Number two, there'sinconsistent laws of curing ballots. Number three, the in person voterstold that they voted already and officials told not to look for defects andto backdate ballots before November 3.Also, in terms of the computers and the software, Smartmatic electionsoftware was developed, Sidney Powell says, in Venezuela, with poroussecurity and built-in functionality allowing the administrators to overridesecurity features.We haven't seen this, so we don't know. But this is the kind of evidencethat they say they have. Your reaction?DERSHOWITZ:  Well, evidence is very difficult to bring within two weeks orthe three-week period. You need to have witnesses, experts subject tocross-examination, and findings by a court.I don't know what Powell means when she says they have more than two weeksor three weeks to prove fraud. Once the electors are certified, and oncethey cast their vote, I can't see any legal route to undoing that, even ifthey were to find fraud later on.There's certainly nothing in the Constitution about that. And so I thinkthey do have to get their evidence in. The public has the right to see it.They don't have the right to see it before the lawsuits are filed.But she said that she thinks the lawsuits will be filed by this Friday. Wehave to see the evidence.BARTIROMO:  That's right.DERSHOWITZ:  If the evidence is there, then there will be a trial.Remember also, these have to go to state court first. There's no such thingas a presidential election. There are 50 state elections. The Pennsylvaniacase is already in the Supreme Court. But these other cases have to gofirst through either the state or the federal trial courts before they getto the Supreme Court.It doesn't look like there will be enough time to bring the case to theSupreme Court before the safe harbor provision kicks in, before theElectoral College meets.BARTIROMO:  OK.DERSHOWITZ:  So, if you're asking me what I think the outcome is going tobe, notwithstanding the fact that there are legal paths to potentialvictory, I don't think that the election is going to be reversed, based onthe numbers that I see at the moment and based on the fact that I haven'tseen the evidence.Their strongest case, if they have the evidence...BARTIROMO:  Yes.DERSHOWITZ:  ... is that computers may have turned hundreds of thousands ofvotes. That's a wholesale argument, rather than a retail argument.BARTIROMO:  OK.DERSHOWITZ:  They can't turn the election around on retail arguments, oneobserver here, a few votes here.BARTIROMO:  Right.DERSHOWITZ:  They need to make wholesale constitutional arguments.And for that, they're going to need overwhelming evidence, and I haven'tseen it.BARTIROMO:  Alan, stay with us.I want to take a short break. I want to take a look at what the road to theSupreme Court looks like. You just laid out some of it, but stay with us onthat.We're talking with Alan Dershowitz this morning on the road ahead.Back in a moment on "Sunday Morning Futures."(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  And we're back with constitutionalist and legal scholar AlanDershowitz.And, Alan, we are talking about the road ahead.I want to get your take on one of the things that President Trump hasbrought up many times and that his legal team continues to push forth. Andthat is that Republicans were not allowed to watch vote counting in Detroitand Philadelphia.How significant is this to their case, Alan?DERSHOWITZ:  Well, they have to show that it affected numbers that aregreater than the margin of victory.Look, their route to the Supreme Court of the United States is rather easyin Pennsylvania, because the court has already taken that case. They split4-4. And then Justice Alito issued an order.The problem in Pennsylvania is, they have the law maybe on their side, butthey don't seem to have the numbers. The poll-watching thing is a retailmatter. You're going to have to go through each county, take evidence. Didthe poll-watchers get excluded? How many votes were impacted?That's going to be a very hard case to get to the Supreme Court, because ithas to go to the state court first. It then has to go to probably thefederal courts, and then the Supreme Court. I don't think they are going tobe able to do this in a timely fashion.So, they have the law on their side in some places, not the numbers. Theymay have arguments, but not the evidence. And they're not going to win onretail challenges here and there.BARTIROMO:  OK.DERSHOWITZ:  Their only -- the only chance they have of winning -- and it'sa perfect storm, and it's very unlikely to happen -- is if they can showretail, wholesale, constitutional arguments that affect a large number ofvoters, sufficient to be greater than the margin of victory.I don't think they're there. I don't think they can make that case.BARTIROMO:  And...DERSHOWITZ:  The Supreme Court is not going to take the case to give them aPyrrhic victory.They are not going to take the case to say, you're right on the law, eventhough the numbers aren't there to give you a victory. To get the case tothe Supreme Court...BARTIROMO:  Sure.DERSHOWITZ:  ... they are going to have to show that, if the Supreme Courtrules in their favor, as the Supreme Court did in Bush vs. Gore, wherethere were only 600 votes separating them in one state, in Florida, theSupreme Court will take that case.BARTIROMO:  Right.DERSHOWITZ:  But it's not going to take a case to give them a hypotheticalPyrrhic victory.BARTIROMO:  Of course.DERSHOWITZ:  They will only take the case if, by turning around the law, itwill give them enough facts and votes to turn around enough electoral votesto deny Biden the 270...BARTIROMO:  OK.DERSHOWITZ:  ... or, much less likely, give Trump the 270.Remember, if Biden is denied the 270...BARTIROMO:  And how does this -- how does this move through Congress?DERSHOWITZ:  ... then the case immediately goes to the House ofRepresentatives, where there's a Republican majority.BARTIROMO:  OK. Good.DERSHOWITZ:  But that's very hard, because, if certain votes are notcertified -- this is very technical. If certain votes aren't certified,then the number needed to reach a majority goes lower than 270.If, for example, 20 votes in Pennsylvania just aren't certified, then thenumber to reach a majority is less than 270. It becomes 250 or somethinglike that.So, it's very, very uphill. You -- they would need a perfect storm. And ifyou're betting widows and orphans' money, if you're betting money you can'tafford to lose, you have to bet that the outcome of the election will notbe reversed.BARTIROMO:  Alan, we want our viewers to know that a spokesperson forDominion will be on FOX News today at 12:00 p.m. Eastern.I want you to hear what the company's CEO, the Dominion CEO, John Poulos,told Congress about backdoors in the Dominion machines during his Housetestimony back in January of 2020. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN POULOS, CEO, DOMINION VOTING SYSTEMS:  I do want to draw a caveat.Some of our tabulators have the -- are designed around the ability to havean external plug-in modem to transmit unofficial results after polls close.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO:  An unofficial plug-in.Last Sunday on this program, Sidney Powell, who is leading theinvestigation into Dominion, told us how this makes the Dominion votingmachines vulnerable. Here is Powell.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)POWELL:  They can stick a thumb drive in the machine or upload software toit, even from the Internet.They can do it from Germany or Venezuela even. They can remote-accessanything. They can watch votes in real time. They can shift votes in realtime. We have identified mathematically the exact algorithm they used andplanned to use from the beginning to modify the votes, in this case, tomake sure Biden won.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO:  Now, unfortunately, Dominion is not making their CEO availabletoday. A spokesperson will be on FOX at noon. So, I hope you will watch it.And here are the questions that that spokesperson needs to answer.Do Dominion voting machines have the ability to fractionalize or weight avote? Do Dominion voting machines have exposed USB ports or memory slots?Is it on the Internet? Did poll workers use cards or codes to enter votersinto the voting machines to vote? Are your systems capable of countingvotes without properly identifying the voter? When were Dominion votingmachines last certified? Did Dominion acquire Smartmatic and its softwarefrom Sequoia?Alan Dershowitz, your reaction and what you think is most important forDominion to address?DERSHOWITZ:  Well, there are two issues here.One, was there the potential with Dominion for abuse and for turning votesfrom one candidate to the other? Was there the potential? The second, didit happen?And the issue that the courts are going to have to confront is the secondone. Did it happen?And Dominion and others will have to be subject to cross-examination. It'ssaid that cross-examination is the greatest engine of truth ever designed.We need to have cross-examination. We need to take evidence.This election can't be determined based on hypotheticals or possibilitiesor potentials. It has to be decided based on what actually happened. Forthat, you need a trial, not in front of a jury. This is not for damages.It's for injunctive relief, so in front of a judge.BARTIROMO:  OK.DERSHOWITZ:  But the evidence has to be put before a judge.So far, the judges have been very skeptical, because they haven't seen theevidence.BARTIROMO:  Right.DERSHOWITZ:  And it's time for the Trump team to put up. They have to comeup with the evidence.BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.DERSHOWITZ:  Maybe they won't show it to the media.BARTIROMO:  Right.DERSHOWITZ:  But let them go to court before Friday. There's no reason whythey can't put some of this evidence in Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.BARTIROMO:  Agreed. We all want to see -- that's right.DERSHOWITZ:  Let the public see it. Let the court see it.BARTIROMO:  OK.DERSHOWITZ:  Let's decide whether there was merely a potential for abuse orreal abuse.BARTIROMO:  Yes.DERSHOWITZ:  The American public is entitled to know that and to resolvethis election once and for all.BARTIROMO:  Absolutely. We all want clarity. And we all want to see thisevidence.Alan, before you go, I have got to ask you about these recriminationsagainst any lawyers who are working for President Trump. It's absolutelyoutrageous, what we have seen, where some law firms are bullying other lawfirms, telling them not to work with President Trump, a sitting president.You, yourself, in some ways, are getting bullied, because Harvard -- yousee what Harvard is doing. You are Harvard emeritus professor. And nowthey're saying anyone who helped Trump will not be able to speak atHarvard, will not be able to go back to Harvard.You have assembled lawyers because of this. Tell me what you're doing.DERSHOWITZ:  Well, it's pure McCarthyism.There are a group of bullying students at Harvard who have said they wantto put people who have worked for President Trump, whether they have beenin the administration or people like me who have made the argument on thefloor of the Senate against impeachment, basically subject us toreeducation camps like in communist China or the former apartheid Africa.And they won't let us appear or speak on campus or teach students or makelectures unless we kind of confess our guilt. It's pure McCarthyism. AndI'm putting together a legal team to pro bono represent anybody who isdenied their First Amendment rights to speak on the campus or the rights ofthe students to hear speeches on campus.There was a petition to try to takeaway my emeritus status because Idefended the presidency against impeachment. If I were a member of a biglaw firm, and I had agreed to represent President Trump, I would havegotten all kind of pressure. Fortunately, I'm independent. The only personI have to listen to is my wife, who basically told me not to do it, but weagreed that I would do it in the end.But the pressures are enormous.BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.DERSHOWITZ:  And the McCarthyism that we see today on university campusesis so reminiscent of what I went through in the 1950s.BARTIROMO:  Yes.DERSHOWITZ:  I was a virulent anti-communist in the '50s.BARTIROMO:  Yes.DERSHOWITZ:  But I defended the right of teachers to have different viewsfrom my own.BARTIROMO:  Alan, it's...DERSHOWITZ:  And that made for good education.BARTIROMO:  And, by the way...DERSHOWITZ:  Today, at Harvard and other universities -- and it's going tospread from Harvard...BARTIROMO:  ... everybody wants to see diversity.DERSHOWITZ:  There are efforts to stop this diversity.BARTIROMO:  Of course. Everybody wants to see diversity in universities.DERSHOWITZ:  They don't want diversity points of view on the campus.BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely unbelievable. And you have got AOC...DERSHOWITZ:  It's not what a university should be doing.BARTIROMO:  That's right.DERSHOWITZ:  And I think Harvard won't do it.But, if they do it, they will be challenged, and I will be suing them incourt under the Massachusetts civil rights law, if they dare to stop Trumpsupporters or other people from speaking on the campus. That's just totallyMcCarthyism and wrong.BARTIROMO:  OK.Well, you also have AOC with her Trump accountability project, like theGestapo. I mean, it's absolutely outrageous.Alan Dershowitz, thank you for your independent analysis. We so appreciateit.Check out Alan's podcast, "The Dershow," wildly popular podcast. You havegot to hear it.Alan, we will see you soon. Thank you.We will be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. DAVID PERDUE (R-GA):  We heard Schumer just last week say that, if wetake Georgia, we change America. We heard AOC say, we -- they have to havethese two seats because they don't want to negotiate. They want totalcontrol.And so what's at stake is this, is that Schumer will change the rules inthe Senate, so they can do anything they want with 50 votes, plus the vicepresident's vote as a tie-breaker.(END VIDEO CLIP)BARTIROMO:  That was Georgia Senator David Perdue on this program lastweek, explaining why the fate of U.S. policy hinges on both his and SenatorKelly Loeffler's run-off races in the upcoming race on January 5.Meanwhile, President Trump's attorneys have requested a second Georgiarecount, just one day after state officials certified Joe Biden's winthere.Here now to talk about all of this is Congressman Doug Collins. He isleading the recount efforts in Georgia.And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Good morning to you.REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA):  Good morning, Maria.BARTIROMO:  First, tell me what you found as you oversaw the recount inGeorgia, and your reaction to now Governor Kemp saying, oh, there should bean even -- another recount, because they did not match the signatures.What's going on in Georgia?COLLINS:  Well, number one, it's been good to go through this process. Ithink sunlight on this process is a great disinfectant.We found several things. If we -- one, if we had never asked for this andthe Trump team had never asked for this recount by hand that we just gotthrough, there would have been a lot of folks disenfranchised, because wefound four counties in which votes were not even counted.We found out issues of the signature verification match. I'm glad to seethe governor is now speaking up about this. We wrote a letter about 10 --over 10 days ago about this asking. I'm glad to see that he weighed in onthat, because that is an issue we are going to have to address here inGeorgia.But, also, we found out the secretary of state office did not give clearguidance to the different counties, 159 counties in Georgia, on how to setthe machines when they were actually making their final count.We found a lot of things that say that we need to continue to look intothis. But what we did find, and the legal team -- this is transitioningfrom me, away from the recount, down to more of the legal challenges thatyou have been talking about this morning.What we have got to remember is, is, this has highlighted the issues. We'rehoping that this will make sure that people do turn out to vote, because,here in Georgia, we have got that election that you just talked aboutthat's going to be so important.BARTIROMO:  So, I think what you just said, we need to underline for amoment.You're saying, if people feel like their vote does not matter because therewas fraud or irregularities, whatever you want to call it, then maybe theywon't come out on January 5. And if they don't come out, then, yes, theRepublicans certainly should worry about the run-off elections, becausethen the Democrats will win. Is that what you're saying?COLLINS:  Exactly.We have got to make sure -- look, we're doing everything we can to makesure we hold the elections process accountable in Georgia, from thesecretary of state's office to each individual election office that we havein this state. They have got to make sure that people believe that atransparent, orderly process is taking place.But I will also say this to the voters in Georgia in particular, becauseyou do hold a unique responsibility here. David Perdue and Kelly Loefflerneed to be reelected, no ifs, ands and buts about it.They have got to be elected to these seats, because we do not want ChuckSchumer. You and I have been fighting for so many years and I'm going tocontinue to fight to expose what we found in the last four years, as theyattacked unmercifully this president on Russia collusion hoax, the Steeledossier, the Mueller investigation.And now, with John Durham, they're hopefully going to start doingsomething. But if they give this to control of Chuck Schumer, thoseinvestigations go away.So, the voters in Georgia, the conservative Republicans, you have got toshow back up and vote any way you can and make sure that we send these twoback to the Senate.BARTIROMO:  OK.Congressman, let me just tell our audience that Senator Kelly Loeffler wassupposed to be on this program this morning. Unfortunately, she is not onbecause there was an inconclusive COVID test. So, that is why she is nothere.Do you believe that's going to impact her ability to campaign? That's oneissue.And the other issue that I want to get your take on is what Stacey Abramshas said, Congressman, because Stacey Abrams, who has taken credit fordelivering the Georgia victory for Joe Biden, now says she already hasregistered 600,000 votes by mail. These are mail-in ballots. She says youdon't need an I.D. to vote by mail. And she's got 600,000 of them already.Are we looking at another fight with these Senate races and questions abouta safe and secure election even before the vote takes place?COLLINS:  Look, I -- one thing, I wish Senator Loeffler the best, if shetests positive. I know she is going to get another test. She will do well.She will campaign as she needs to. And I'm looking forward to making surethat she will be able to -- she will do that through the TV. She will dothat through appearances hopefully through Skype and others, but if she is-- we want to get her better first.But then let's turn our attention to Stacey Abrams. I'm about tired ofStacey Abrams. I'm about tired of the false claims down here in Georgia ofvoter suppression. I'm tired of the claims that she didn't win in the othergovernor's race, and now making claims of absentee ballots.What she's doing is, again, trying to focus on getting people to doabsentee ballots. And, again, her organization in the Democratic Party werethe very ones who sued the state of Georgia and Brad Raffensperger and theother -- the attorney general and the others who signed the consent decreelast year that, in our opinion, weakened the signature verification rulesin the state of Georgia.This is one of the things the governor mentioned. It's one of the things wehave mentioned. That is why it makes it so more important that we have tofight back down here in Georgia.Look, people get out and run for election. They do the ground game. They dowhat they need to do. And Senator Loeffler and Senator Perdue are going todo that.But Stacey Abrams needs to remember, if she's actually encouraging peopleto vote illegally, if she's actually encouraging, as Andrew Yang and some,said to come to Georgia and register to vote, as if you're going to stay inGeorgia, that's a felony in Georgia.And I look forward to our law enforcement officers, if they come down hereand do that, putting them in jail. It's illegal to come in, in the state ofGeorgia and register with no intent to become a permanent resident inGeorgia.Stacey Abrams made a lot of claims over time, mainly for her own politicalbenefit. It's about time that those stop, because the elections in Georgiaare about the people of Georgia, and not about wild claims that she's madeon whose she's getting to vote.BARTIROMO:  Are you comfortable that you have the wherewithal and theinfrastructure to police all of this?Look, we expected that there would be irregularities going into thepresidential election. And now we're learning that the observers couldn'tget close enough to actually see what was going on. Why wasn't that policedin the beginning?And now you have got -- Stacey Abrams never even conceded for hergovernor's race, and the media celebrated it. And you're talking aboutAndrew Yang tweeting out a week ago, my wife and I are moving to Georgia.Do you have the infrastructure in place to ensure that you will be able tosee accountability if people just move to Georgia to affect this race?COLLINS:  I do believe we will, because we have been pitching -- throwthese out there.We have been fighting hard for this president, fighting hard during thisrecount, which is now transitioning to the legal phase of. But we have madeenough emphasis here. The governor pointed this out. Others have pointed itout.I think the election board is on notice. The secretary of state's office ison notice. The attorney general is on notice, because he talked about this.Again, we're fighting back with everything.But it's going to take conservatives. Remember, Maria, you mentioned thisbefore. We talked about it. Georgians need to realize, the reason theDemocrats are flooding the state of Georgia or even outside money isflooding into Georgia right now is because they want Chuck Schumer tofundamentally change the Senate.They want, fundamentally, to take away the investigative powers of RonJohnson and Lindsey Graham and others into the things that we know havebeen happening. They do not want big tech oversight. They do not want thesethings that are actually happening.That's why Georgia is so important. And we do believe that we're going tohave our folks turn out. We're seeing it. It's tough right now, becausethey are wanting to look forward and make sure the president stays.BARTIROMO:  OK.COLLINS:  But we are going to see it happen.BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you this morning. We will bewatching.Thank you so much, Congressman Doug Collins, this morning in Georgia.COLLINS:  Thanks, Maria. Take care.BARTIROMO:  Coming up: the congressman who President Trump famously calledthe other side's worst nightmare.And he's here with breaking news on John Durham's criminal investigation.Will there finally be accountability?Right after this short break. Stay with us for Congressman Devin Nunes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.Former President Barack Obama is out promoting his new memoir, in which heboasts about his White House avoiding scandal, without exception, hewrites, writing that he had zero tolerance for ethical lapses and thatpeople who had a problem with that didn't join us in the first place, saidPresident Obama.My next guest spent the last four years investigating the role that Obama'sFBI and CIA played in the Russian collusion hoax, where the entire countrywas up in arms.Devin Nunes is the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. Heis author of the book "Countdown to Socialism."Congressman, it is good to see you.REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA):  Always a pleasure.BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.NUNES:  Thank you.BARTIROMO:  I want to get your reaction to President Obama saying thatthere were no ethical lapses in his administration. And then I want to getyour take on where we are with those investigations you have been doing forthe last four years.NUNES:  Well, sure. And good morning to you, Maria.I would just point out to your viewers that President Obama is the onlypresident that I know that only moved about a mile from the White House,set up shop, has all of his people there. Most of his people were promotingKamala Harris to run, before she bombed out, wasting millions of dollars,hundreds of millions of dollars. And then they propped up Joe Biden.So, it's not just about how this is the first president that oversaw usinga political campaign, using the FBI and DOJ to open an investigation intoyour rival campaign. That's as big of a fraud as you get in the history ofthe United States of America.So, he's not giving up power. He investigated his opposing party. Heallowed it to happen. If he was so high and mighty and aboveboard, heshould have told Clinton, Comey, McCabe, Brennan, all of them, no, we'renot doing this. You have no evidence that Trump is some type of Russianagent. Stop it.He didn't do it. And here we're left with this aftermath of four years ofthis nonsense. And now we're sitting, waiting for Durham to complete thisinvestigation. I think people are getting not only very frustrated, but,also, there's a growing concern that Durham is not going to come out withanything, and then Biden and Obama are going to be back in, and they'regoing to shut this investigation off.So, I have been very clear about this. Every day that ticks by, it's goingto become an absolute necessity that a special counsel is appointed on theway out. Now, that doesn't mean that Biden wouldn't fire the specialcounsel.But at least you would have a special counsel office set up with money, sothat this investigation can continue, because I'm not seeing theindictments that I should be seeing, when you take into the -- account thatI have made 14 criminal referrals involving dozens and dozens of people.BARTIROMO:  It's just extraordinary, Congressman, really.Do you think that the president will name a special counsel, so that thosepeople who understand what took place in 2016 at least feel like this willget a fair look?NUNES:  Well, yes, the way I understand it is, Attorney General Barr shouldbe the one to appoint this. He's been the one that has been out talking.And I have a lot of confidence in him. I think he's a straight shooter. Ithink he's probably also disappointed. I haven't spoke to him. But he wouldbe the one that would have to ensure that this investigation is continuedon to the end.And I think there's nothing more important than after -- we continue tohear about how people aren't accepting the election results. And here weare only a couple weeks after the election.BARTIROMO:  Right.NUNES:  We have six or seven states that are extremely close.It's almost laughable that anyone in the media or anybody on the Democraticside of the aisle is even saying this, when you have Joe Biden himself whowas still accusing just a month ago President Trump of being a Russianagent.BARTIROMO:  Yes.NUNES:  We -- this is not acceptable in this country.BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.Congressman, stay with us. I want to get your take on the irregularities interms of the vote for the presidential election and how social media playeda role.We're talking with Congressman Devin Nunes.And we will be right back on "Sunday Morning Futures."(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.And I am back with Congressman Devin Nunes, the ranking member of the HouseIntel Committee.And, Congressman, I want to get your take on Joe Biden and whether or nothe is getting intelligence briefings. A lot of these -- the critics ofPresident Trump are complaining that he's not getting briefings.Is he?NUNES:  As far as I know, he has been getting briefings since after theDemocratic Convention and the Republican Convention.Both presidential candidates get briefings. And this was the case fouryears ago, when both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were gettingbriefings.And, if you may recall, supposedly, reportedly, they actually used thosebriefings on Trump to actually spy on him, if you may recall.BARTIROMO:  That's right. I remember that.OK.NUNES:  Yes.BARTIROMO:  Congressman, what are your thoughts on these votingirregularities?You heard from Alan Dershowitz earlier.NUNES:  Mm-hmm.BARTIROMO:  You know what Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell have been saying.What's your reaction to all of this, from your role in the IntelligenceCommittee? And does social media play a role here?NUNES:  Well, a couple quick thoughts.Number one, in any close election, whether it's a local mayor's race or acongressional race, elections don't get called. We have several races inthe United States right now for Congress that haven't been called yet. So,that's the first issue.Secondly, if any of this technology is touching the Internet and the Web,that's very concerning. As people -- I have been drug through this fouryears of Russia, Russia, Russia. They interfered with the election.We worked hard to make sure there were paper ballots. Now, if some of thattechnology was touching the Web, that's a concern.Look, this is a very close election. It's in Joe Biden's best -- bestinterest and his overlord, Obama, that sits a mile from the White House,like we talked in the last segment. They ought to be the ones that areasking for every vote to be legally counted, because you have toremember...BARTIROMO:  Right.NUNES:  ... the Democrats got smashed in this election.They got destroyed at the state level, the local level, congressionallevel, and the Senate level, assuming that we win these two seats inGeorgia.BARTIROMO:  Yes.NUNES:  So, this is a guy who is limping into the presidency. He was thefirst guy to run a successful campaign from a basement, without actuallygoing out and intermingling with the people.BARTIROMO:  Congressman, I know you have seen a lot of changes, now thatyou have moved to places like Rumble and Parler, as opposed to Twitter.You're seeing many bigger numbers, indicating that they were keeping yourfollowers limited on the others.We will talk about that next time.It's great to see you this morning, Congressman. Thank you, CongressmanDevin Nunes.NUNES:  Thank you.BARTIROMO:  Have a great Sunday, everybody. Thank you so much for joiningus.And, from me to you, have a beautiful Thanksgiving. I will see you nextweek right here.Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
