BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): I think the ninja kid cut thefruit for the hippo. OK, Dana, thank you.Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, President Biden says the fight against the coronavirus isnow a wartime effort that the government is buying an additional 200million doses of vaccine. President Biden saying the vaccine program heinherited from his predecessor was in worse shape than he expected.Today, the president laid out several new goals for his COVID program andseveral harsh warnings a short time ago.We have Fox team coverage. Gillian Turner examines the mixed messagescoming from the government about the pandemic. Garrett Tenney highlightsthe contentious battle over whether students and teachers should return toclassrooms.But we begin with White House Correspondent Peter Doocy live in the NorthLawn with the latest on the new president strategy announcement. Goodevening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Goodevening, Bret. President Biden just explained how he plans to backup bigtalk about getting 300 million Americans vaccinated in part with these 200million new doses of vaccine the U.S. government just bought.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That's a hundred million moredoses of Pfizer and a hundred million more doses of Moderna. 200 millionmore doses in the federal government had previously secured, not in handyet but ordered. We expect these additional 200 million doses to bedelivered this summer.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): President Biden also says that for the next severalmonths, masks and not vaccines are the best defense against COVID. And thethings are going to get worse before they get better.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president and his team havebeen working around the clock over the past six days to make meaningfulprogress on vaccinating as many people as possible.DOOCY (voice over): And looking at the first 100 days yesterday, PresidentBiden appeared to officially raise the bar.BIDEN: I think we may be able to get that to 150 -- 1.5 million a dayrather than one million a day.DOOCY: But President Biden apparently wasn't officially raising the bar.PSAKI: The president didn't actually say the new goal is. The presidentsaid I hope we can do even more than that, and that is certainly of coursehis hope.DOOCY: White House announced they are increasing vaccine supply to statesby almost 20 percent to 10 million doses. HHS is buying an additional 100million Pfizer doses and 100 million Moderna doses and will give states athree week heads up about what's coming.It took the Biden White House days to sort current inventory out using agovernment database called Tiberius.PSAKI: We do have an assessment as a reference Tiberius, which is quite aname for this website I will say. Sounds like a magical creature a littlebit to me.DOOCY: Vaccine inventory isn't their only issue though.PSAKI: We are assessing every day where the holes are, where the gaps are,what the holdups are. It's not just supply, it is beyond that. It's alsohaving the number of vaccinators we need, the number of vaccinedistribution sites we need, those are all issues.DOOCY: President Biden addressed racial equity today.BIDEN: We are not just a nation of morally deprived because of systemicracism. We're also less prosperous, we're less successful, we're lesssecure.DOOCY: Signing four more executive orders to address racism in federalhousing policies, and Justice Department use of private prisons andxenophobia toward Asian American and Pacific Islanders.BIDEN: We need to make the issue of racial equity, not just an issue forany one department of government, it has to be the business of the whole ofgovernment.DOOCY: The point person will be domestic policy adviser Susan Rice.SUSAN RICE, DIRECTOR, DOMESTIC POLICY COUNCIL: These are desperate timesfor so many Americans, and all Americans need urgent federal action to meetthis moment.DOOCY: Biden had his first call with Russian President Vladimir Putin todayand the White House says Biden talked about the SolarWinds hack of U.S.networks, reports of Russian boundaries on U.S. soldiers and interferencein the 2020 election.PSAKI: His intention was also to make clear that the United States will actfirmly in defense of our national interests in response to malign actionsby Russia.DOOCY: And Biden told Fox News they talked about something else.Mr. President (INAUDIBLE)BIDEN: You.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): That is very kind of President Putin, thank you verymuch for having President Biden pass along the kind words. It's also thelatest example that we have from Biden's first week in office. But the newpresident despite the whole weight of everything going on around him is ajokester, Bret.BAIER: Peter, the Biden administration is dealing with something that is nojoke, a major setback tonight when it comes to the executive order onimmigration.DOOCY: Yes, one of those first week immigration orders last week the Bidensigned was a pause on deportations for pretty much anybody that came intothe country before November for 100 days. Texas sued and a federal judgesided with them telling the Biden administration they can't do this rightnow because they had not given enough concrete evidence that it issomething that is necessary.I just got a statement from a White House spokesman who is saying, we'reconfident that as the case proceeds, it will be clear that this measure waswholly appropriate. But Biden's whole immigration policy is not blownbecause construction on the southern border wall is supposed to stop bytomorrow, Bret.BAIER: Peter Doocy live in the North Lawn. Peter, thank you.There continues to be uncertainty tonight over when the new Congress willget down to work on a new coronavirus relief bill. Fox News has learned itcould be the first week in March before things get serious up on CapitolHill. But we do know there is division along party lines when it comes tospending.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): Anything we do related to coronavirus needs to betargeted, it needs to be fiscally responsible, it needs to take intoconsideration the fact that every dollar that we spend is a borroweddollar.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Time is of the essence to address this crisis.We're keeping all options open on the table, including using budgetreconciliation.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: The price tag for the president's current plan is almost $2trillion.There's a huge debate in many communities likely yours about whetherchildren and teachers should return to the classrooms. One of the placeswhere the controversy is very intense is Chicago. That's wherecorrespondent Garrett Tenney is tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GARRETT TENNEY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Across thecountry students are struggling.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My kids have really suffered through this process.TENNEY: Grades are down, attendance is down, and school officials say kidsneed to be back in the classroom to fix it.In many of the nation's largest cities, the push for return to in personlearning is facing stiff resistance from teachers' unions.In Chicago, K-8 public school teachers are refusing the city's order to bein their classrooms by tomorrow and demanding that all instruction stayonline until teachers are vaccinated.ALYSSA RODRIGUEZ, SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKER: Without being given access to avaccine quickly and timely, we are putting our students and more exposureand more risk and then we're bringing that home to our families. TENNEY: The science, however, tells a different story. New research fromthe CDC published today in the Journal of the American Medical Associationfound no evidence that schools transmit the virus at a higher rate than thegeneral community. And concluded: with good prevention, we can safelyreopen and keep open more schools.Despite that, teachers' unions across the country are refusing to return tothe classroom over what they say are safety concerns.CHERYL BOST, PRESIDENT, MARYLAND EDUCATION ASSOCIATION: There's nobody thatwants to get back into our schools more than our education employees whohave been doing a heroic jobs during this pandemic.TENNEY: In San Francisco, district officials were forced to scrap plans toreopen this week because they couldn't reach an agreement with the union.And in Baltimore, public school leaders are going ahead with a plan toreopen next month despite union protest after data showed more than half ofstudents in grades three to 12 failed the class during remote learning.LINDSEY BURKE, DIRECTOR, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: One thing that this pandemichas demonstrated, unfortunately, is the tremendous amounts of power thatteachers' unions continue to wield.TENNEY: The resistance from unions is complicating President Joe Biden'sgoal to have a majority of K-8 schools open within his first hundred days.Further complicating that effort, Biden's pick for Deputy Secretary ofEducation Cindy Marten has twice canceled plans to reopen the San DiegoUnified School District in her role as superintendent.(END VIDEO CLIP)TENNEY (on camera): Here in Chicago, negotiations are ongoing over teachersreturning to the classroom. If there is no agreement by tomorrow morning,the union says teachers won't show up. And if the district blocks them fromteaching online, they'll go on strike, Bret.BAIER: Garrett Tenney in Chicago. Gary, thank you.So, are there mixed messages about whether the nation is turning the cornerin the coronavirus pandemic fight? Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us itdepends who's doing the talking.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Time is of the essence.GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Millions ofAmericans nationwide are confused about when they can get vaccinated.The government's mixed messaging on when all Americans can expect to bevaccinated has persisted for months.BIDEN: I think we'll be able to do that this spring. And but it's going tobe a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we've ever tried in thiscountry.TURNER: But then Dr. Fauci said this:DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: Logistically, by the time you get doses into everyone who mightwant it, it will take several months which will go into the end of thesummer. And I've been saying that probably by the end of the summer, youcould get everybody vaccinated.TURNER: At the current rate of about a million Americans vaccinated perday, it would take the U.S. about 10 months to vaccinate all Americans.There's also worry the U.S. is running out of vaccine doses faster thanplanned. One Biden official sounded optimistic.KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: When we firstannounced, you know, a hundred million vaccine in a hundred days, it wascalled it was said to be too ambitious. We're probably going to exceed thatgoal.TURNER: But Biden CDC director acknowledged the problem head on over theweekend.DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL ANDPREVENTION: The supply is probably going to be the most limiting constraintearly on.TURNER: The reality is that as of today, the CDC has distributed 44.3million doses, but only about half 23.5 million have been administered.Moderna and Pfizer both committed to delivery of 100 million doses each bythe end of March.According to HHS, they've been averaging 4.3 million per week. At thisrate, Big Pharma would need to nearly double their weekly deliveries toreach their goal.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER (on camera): Experts today are telling Fox News that a certaindegree of confusion here was inevitable given this vaccine campaign is thelargest in U.S. history and a lot of the data really does vary by state.The problem is now that millions of Americans are left wondering whetherthe mixed messaging from public officials isn't making the situation moredifficult, Bret.BAIER: Gillian, thank you.Let's talk about where we are right now in the pandemic. Joining us, Dr.Marc Siegel professor of medicine at New York University Langone MedicalCenter and a Fox News contributor. Dr. Siegel, thanks for being here.You know, you heard the president today. Are you encouraged by what youheard from President Biden on the ramping up of vaccine production anddistribution?DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I am. And Ilike the idea of 600 million doses. And I like Moderna's promise to get ahundred million in March and Pfizer a hundred million in March.And I talked to David Kessler last week, who was overseeing Operation WarpSpeed under Biden, and he said, look, it's not like building a car here.The problem has occurred at the production plants. It's gone slow becausethis vaccine's never been made before but it's starting to ramp up now, andI think you're going to see more and more.Over a million doses a day in people's arms already. I think that can getto the 1.5 million a day that President Biden is suggesting.I think the key though, comes on the production side. And I think they'realso (INAUDIBLE) Bret, starting to iron out the problems on the other end,the administration part, making it more flexible, who gets the doses notdiscarding doses, making sure that everybody over 65 is prioritized. Thisis going in the right direction.And then, Johnson & Johnson says, hey, if we get approved in two weeks,we're going to have a hundred million doses by May. And you know what?That's a very easy vaccine to get into poorer neighborhoods to get topeople that you can't get to otherwise, that's another priority right now.And I think that we're really heading in the right direction.BAIER: You know, you have this concern among some officials, and I'vetalked to a few about vaccination hesitancy, and especially in elderly andblack communities.You have added to that some folks out there like Robert F. Kennedy, whotweeted out just the other day, Hank Aaron's tragic death is part of a waveof suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration ofCOVID vaccines. He received the Moderna vaccine on January 5th to inspireblack Americans to get the vaccine out the defender.So, he's somehow linking that to his death, which we have not found to betrue.SIEGEL: This is a deeply disturbing thing you're bringing up now. I wouldstart by saying, Bret, right now, there's so much excitement for people whowant the vaccine who can have it, that that's leading the way. But whenthat's overcome and everybody's at the front of the line, then we're goingto get hit with this message from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., this message ofvaccine hesitancy and fear when in fact, it's COVID that we need to beafraid of, not this vaccine.The safety datas on this vaccine as Dr. Kessler told me has beenincredible. And look at Israel, 128,000 people, only 20 cases of COVID,once 108 -- 128,000 people had gotten the Pfizer vaccine. This is a veryeffective, very safe vaccine. And Dr. Fauci is right, it's the way out ofthis pandemic.The war is going to be between us who believed in this vaccine and thatit's the light at the end of the tunnel, and those who are trying to set upthese roadblocks based on fear and lack of science. The vaccine hesitancyor the anti-vaxxers is an anti-scientific movement.BAIER: Last thing, we just did a piece out of Chicago about schools andwhere we are. It's not just Chicago, it's in communities all acrossAmerica, about this battle to get back to school and the hesitancy to dothat. What do you say about that?SIEGEL: Well, the science says that there's very little spread in schools,you know, among children and from children to teachers. And one of the keysthough of overcoming the fear is going to be to get all the teachersvaccinated. And they're one beat (PH), meaning they're lining up now.Get the teachers vaccinated in Chicago. And Chicago spent $100 million onthe public school system. So, we need distancing. We need masking. We needreally frequent rapid testing, especially if teachers and we need everybodyto be compliant. And I think the school should be open because the cost,the tremendous cost to children in terms of socialization and everythingthey missed by not being at school needs to be factored in as well.BAIER: Dr. Siegel, as always, thank you.SIEGEL: Thank you, Bret.BAIER: Still ahead, is America becoming a surveillance state? What doesthat mean anyway? We'll take a look.And up next, the Democratic mayor of Portland pepper sprays one of hiscritics. We'll tell you why.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How dare you! You are ashamed! (INAUDIBLE), do you thinkthat we're going to forget about you? We never going to forget you, Teddy.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: You may have experienced trouble with your Internet today and youhave plenty of company. Millions of users across the northeast reportedwidespread outages. Verizon reported a cut fiber in Brooklyn, it's notclear if that was responsible for the entire outage or not.Stocks were off today. The Dow lost 23, the S&P 500 was down six. TheNASDAQ fell nine.Police in Portland, Oregon are investigating a hit-and-run driver accusedof killing an elderly woman and injuring at least five other people duringa 15-block rampage. Authorities say the man finally crashed the car and tryto flee on foot, but neighbors there surrounded him until officers couldwrestle him into custody.Speaking of Portland tonight, Portland's democratic mayor is defending hisdecision to pepper spray a man who confronted him about not wearing a maskwhile dining in a restaurant. Ted Wheeler says he feared for his safety.Chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt is in Los Angeles with the story tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Fornearly nine months since Portland has endured protest, riots, and thepandemic, Democratic Mayor Ted Wheeler has been front and center the faceof a city in turmoil. Tear gassed by federal agents as he stood with BlackLives Matter protesters. Later, criticized by some of those same protestersfor not doing enough to tackle police reform. Criticized too for strictpandemic lockdowns, targeted by others for not doing enough.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you having a good night on the town?TED WHEELER, MAYOR OF PORTLAND, OREGON: I think you need to (INAUDIBLE) --(CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're enjoying some -- I think you need to do your jobas a -- mayor.HUNT: That was on January 6th as the mayor was dining out. By this pastSunday, it seems the mayor had had enough and apparently fought back. Thereis an audio recording of the confrontation but no video that we have seenas yet.WHEELER: We were six feet apart and we were eating and drinking.HUNT: Wheeler told police he was confronted by a man outside a restaurantand berated by that man for not wearing a mask inside the restaurant. Atfirst, the mayor tried to explain that it is not required to wear maskswhile eating at a restaurant. The man continued to argue.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, mayor, thanks for ruining our city.HUNT: Moments later, the mayor, according to a statement he made to police,pepper-sprayed the man, whom the mayor alleges was getting very close tohim and not wearing a mask.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You just pepper-sprayed me for no reason at all.HUNT: Former Portland mayor, Sam Adams, who was with Wheeler argued withthe man.SAM ADAMS, FORMER MAYOR OF PORTLAND, OREGON: HE asked you to back away andyou didn't.HUNT: Mayor Wheeler has said little publicly about the incident.WHEELER: I filed a police report and that's all I can tell you right now.(END VIDEO CLIP)HUNT (on camera): Mayor Wheeler has consistently supported the rights ofanyone in his city to protest, but is also said he condemns violence in thename of any cause. Bret.BAIER: Jonathan, thank you.Up next, the real sign today of just how difficult getting a conviction onimpeachment may be, we'll take you to Capitol Hill. First, here is whatsome of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.Fox 6 in Birmingham, Alabama, a search and rescue efforts continuefollowing a tornado touched down that killed a 14-year-old boy shelteringwith his family in the basement of their home.The tornado left a swath of destruction 10 miles long in the suburbs northof Birmingham. 30 people were injured.Fox 2 in Detroit as the city says it will dismiss most misdemeanorcitations issued last spring during several days of protests against policebrutality following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Democrats need 17 Republicans to vote to convict formerPresident Trump.A short time ago, we should mention a spokesman for Senator Leahy said hewas taken to a local hospital for evaluation after complaining of notfeeling well. We wish him well tonight.The more than 3,000 members of the D.C. National Guard currently inWashington, D.C. will be extended through the end of March.

A report tonight from Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice over):Growing fears on Capitol Hill of overreach. One former Democratic lawmakerand one-time presidential candidate warns of a growing police state insidethe U.S.TULSI GABBARD, (D-HI) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Let's be clear, theJohn Brennans, Adam Schiffs, and oligarchs in big tech who are trying toundermine our constitutionally protected rights and turn our country into apolice state with KGB style surveillance are also domestic enemies, andmuch more powerful, and therefore dangerous then the mob that storm thecapital.TOMLINSON:  Tulsi Gabbard's comments come days after the former CIADirector John Brennan said the new Biden administration should focus oncrushing what he called a pro-Trump insurgency in the wake of the January6th riot at the U.S. Capitol.JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR:  It brings together an unholy alliancefrequent of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots,racists, nativists, even libertarians.TOMLINSON:  The White House outlined its first steps.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The rise of domestic violentextremism is a serious and growing national security threat. The Bidenadministration will confront this threat with the necessary resources andresolve.TOMLINSON:  This comes as FOX has learned the FBI is reviewingcongressional requests for investigations into the role Parler, Facebook,and Twitter played in the Capitol riot. In a letter to the FBI, New YorkDemocratic Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney wants the Bureau to investigateParler's part in acting as a potential facilitator of the violence."It is clear that Parler houses additional evidence critical toinvestigations on the attack of the Capitol. Questions have also beenraised about Parler's financing and its ties to Russia."(END VIDEO TAPE)TOMLINSON:  Parler says it welcomes any potential FBI investigation.Twitter, Facebook, and Google have not immediately responded to requestsfor comment about Gabbard's remarks. Bret?BAIER:  Lucas Tomlinson at the Pentagon. Lucas, thank you.Fox Corporation cochairman and NewsCorp executive chairman Rupert Murdochis condemning cancel culture as a quote, awful woke orthodoxy suppressingfree speech around the globe. Murdoch made those remarks as he accepted alifetime achievement award from the Australia Day Foundation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RUPERT MURDOCH, FOX CORPORATION CO-CHAIRMAN:  This rigidly enforcedconformity, aided and abetted by so-called social media, is a straitjacketon sensibility. Too many people have fought too hard in too many places forfreedom of speech to be suppressed by this awful woke orthodoxy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Murdoch also encouraged young people to be ambitious, but neversmug, in order to be successful.Up next, the panel reacts to President Biden's latest strategy on fightingthe coronavirus pandemic.First, Beyond Our Borders tonight, Iran warns the Biden administration itwill not have an indefinite period of time to rejoin the 2015 nuclear dealbetween Tehran and world powers. Iran also saying it expects Washington toswiftly lift crippling economic sanctions that former President Trumpimposed after withdrawing from the accord.Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte resigns after a key coalition ally pulls hisparty's support over Conte's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. ThePremier is hoping to get the support of Italy's president to try to form anew coalition government there.Just some of the other stories Beyond Our Borders tonight. We'll be rightback.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I can announce that we willincrease overall weekly vaccination distributions to states, tribes, andterritories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses. Webelieve that we'll be able soon to confirm the purchase of an additional100 million doses for each of the two FDA authorized vaccines, Pfizer andModerna. That's 100 million more doses of Pfizer and 100 million more dosesof Moderna. We expect these additional 200 million doses to be deliveredthis summer.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  President Biden late this afternoon talking about the COVIDstrategy and stepping up production and the purchase of vaccines. Let'sbring in our panel, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman, CEO ofEmpowerment and Inclusion Capital, Katie Pavlich, news editor atTownhall.com , and Charles Hurt, opinion editor for "The Washington Times."Katie, they are rolling out new efforts to get the vaccine to differentplaces around the country. And the question is, is this going to happenquickly? The timeline has kind of changed over the past few days.KATIE PAVLICH, NEWS EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM  :  Right, that's the big question.And now that the Biden administration is in charge of this massivebureaucratic process of different agencies having to get orders in for thevaccine and then distributing them, you see the Biden administration, thepress secretary, and Joe Biden downplaying expectations a bit, trying tomake sure that if it doesn't go as quickly as they have said, that theyhave something the fall back on.But it's interesting to look at this from the state perspective as well.You have the Biden administration saying that the Trump administration leftthem in a very difficult place without giving a lot of details about thedistribution process, and now you have Florida Governor Ron DeSantispushing back on the White House and what they have said about vaccinedistribution there. And of course, we've seen in recent weeks places in NewYork throwing away doses of the vaccine.So there is this partnership that has to happen between the federalgovernment and the states, and many states are doing a better job ofdistributing it to the people who need it the most. But when it comes tothe responsibility of who is in charge of making sure it gets distributedproperly and quickly, the old standard was that was the federalgovernment's job, that it wasn't necessarily the state's job to get thisdone quickly. It was up to the feds. So if the Biden administration isgoing to be held to that standard, we'll have to see how the rollout goesin the next couple of days. They keep saying that there is this ambitiousgoal of 100 million vaccines, but that's already the goal that we have now.So they are, again, downplaying expectations just in case they can't getthis off the ground quickly enough.BAIER:  Yes, and just to illustrate that timeline, take a listen over thepast couple of days.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think we'll be able to dothat this spring. But it's going to be a logistical challenge that exceedsanything we've ever tried in this country. But I think we can do that.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president didn't actually saythe new goal is. The president said I hope we can do even more than that.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES:  Logistically, by the time you get doses into everyone who mightwant it, it will take several months, which will go into the end of thesummer. And I've been saying that probably by the end of the summer, youcan get everybody vaccinated. But the availability for people in anycategory will likely be by April.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Bottom line, it's a tough job to get all those shots in arms,Harold, and it's a logistical challenge.HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE:  Without question.Thanks for having me on. I think this speaks to a couple of things. One, Iknow the Biden administration wishes they could have been a little bettercoordination and faster coordination with regard to a transition. Two, thisspeaks to and screams to why we need to pass a very targeted COVID reliefpackage. I would agree with those who argue that these stimulus checkshould not go to families earning over $150,000, a husband and wife or afamily and a households.And three, I think it yells to what you say, Bret. We all have tounderstand what roles we have to play, which makes me think even more sothat maybe they should be a coordinated federal effort. I hear GovernorDeSantis make some of the comments and statements he's making. He could beright. I hear Governor Cuomo and Governor DeWine making some of thestatements, Governor DeWine of Ohio. It might be best to have a federalcoordinated effort. That way we know who to hold responsible andaccountable, and if it's not happening at a faster rate, then maybe weswitch up.But I think we may need to rethink how we do this over the next severalmonths to ensure that we can make this less hard, because I would agreewith you, this is a hard, hard exercise, without question.BAIER:  Yes, in the meantime, Charlie, the numbers on the coronavirus are,at least in the short term, getting better. The cases are down, deaths aredown, trending in the right direction, at least.CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, "WASHINGTON TIMES":  Yes, well, of coursethat is the nature of pandemics. It goes in cycles. What sort of amusingabout this is, of course, for the past eight, nine months, we've beenhearing from Democrats who said that this is all about the federalgovernment, this is all about Donald Trump and his failure to fix thevirus, when in fact it is a lot more complicated than that.And as Katie pointed out, there is a lot of problems of distributions ofthe vaccines is at the state level, where it should be, by the way, becausewhen you have it at the state levels, you allow the different governmentsto try different things and to figure out the best strategies, and ifsomebody is doing it the right way, other states can follow suit and do andbenefit from that experimentation.But over the weekend we heard President Biden say, well, there is not awhole lot I can do about the trajectory, which I think he is to some degreecorrect, and certainly the federal government isn't the only answer andisn't going to be able to get us out completely of this entire thing.You're going to have to get, eventually get kids back to school, you'regoing to have to get people back to work, you are going to have to openback up and let the economy take care of much of this.BAIER:  It's interesting to listen to some Democratic governors and mayorswho were pro-big lockdown now saying it's not feasible economically fortheir states or cities.Hold on, I want to play the soundbite about schools and getting kids back,and this is just such a huge story for communities all over the country.Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TIFFANY CHILDRESS PRICE, CHICAGO TEACHER:  There is no clear plan for us.We want to return to school, but we want to return to school safely. Thisis a management and structural access issue, and it's inequitable.RANDI WEINGARTEN, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS:  Unless we have avariant like what happened in Great Britain or Germany that created thosekinds of lockdowns because of the transmissibility, I think we can actuallymake President Biden's goal real.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Hopefully, Katie, we can, but there are some communities where theteachers are getting bumped up in line to get the vaccine, and they arestill not opening those schools.PAVLICH:  I don't think we can underestimate how much damage the teachers'unions are doing to generations of children. The fact is that there are anumber of private schools around the country that have been open for monthsand months, teaching kids and having them in the classroom in a fashionthat allows them to thrive in their own environments. And you have teachersin Fairfax County, for example, demanding that they get put at the front ofthe vaccine line, ahead of seniors, for example, with the health careworkers, and they got vaccinated. Now they are still demanding that they donot go back to school in person this year.It really is quite amazing to watch, especially when you have a number ofteachers who are being held hostage by these teachers' unions who want tobe back in the schools. You have a number of school districts across thecountry reporting a severe increase in suicides from children who arecommitting suicide due to the results of this failed half-and-half or all-digital learning process. They are failing at a 90 percent rate. And yetyou have teachers' unions giving demands, for example with the vaccine, thedemand is then met so they can go back to schools, and then they move thegoalposts.And all the while the most vulnerable populations, special needs childrenand the poorest children in our country are going to suffer the most fordecades. This is not just going to be a short-term problem here.BAIER:  Yes, I understand the fears of teachers, especially those withpreexisting conditions, but there is a lot to go over here. It's a storywe'll cover for a long time. Listen, we will review the president's latestexecutive orders when we come back with the panel.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I've got to get the votes.I've got to get the votes. That's why -- the one thing, I have this strangenotion. We are a democracy. Some of my Republican friends and some of myDemocratic friends even occasionally say, well, if you don't get the votesby executive order you're going to do something. Things you can't do byexecutive order unless you're a dictator. We are a democracy. We needconsensus.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Well, yes. But when you win the presidency, we have seen in recenttimes, that you do issue some executive orders. This has been a flurry ofexecutive orders. President Biden issuing in the first week, January 20thto the 26th, 17 executive orders. And you see compared to President Trump,Obama and President Bush. Actually, if you add the actions in orders, it'sup to 35.So there has been a flurry of activity on a host of different topics. We'reback with our panel. Harold, what about this? It's obviously a very tightmajority for Democrats in the Senate and the House. The biggest things ingovernment happens through Congress, but these executive orders have runthe gamut.FORD:  So he's doing, as you've just stated, look at his three most recentpredecessors, every time you get a new president, what he does. The sign abunch of orders to undo some things and to try to jumpstart theiradministration. Without question, the sustainable legislation has to bedone in Congress.I am convinced that if you think of our last four presidents, there has notbeen a president more purpose built for finding compromise and consensus inthe Senate. There has not been a president that we've had in our last fourwho has had a better relationship with the Senate majority and Senateminority leader and the speaker then this president.So I'm not concerned too much that he is not going to try to work withCongress. There are people raising concerns about the kinds of things he'sdone. I've heard some concerns about the climate change efforts. I'llremind people that we're not going to move quickly away from a fossil fuelbased economy, but people and investors are shifting toward a clean energyeconomy and are rewarding clean energy producers. And in fact, the richestman in the world, Elon Musk, he builds electric cars and sends people tospace. He doesn't go drilling for oil and gas.I think President Biden is on to something here, and I don't think weshould interpret this to mean that he's not going to try to pass thingsthrough Congress. In fact, I think he's the best politician we've had 20 to30 years --BAIER:  But we saw this topic come up at the last debate. And this was,Charlie, the back and forth over are you going to kill the oil and gasindustry. Just today, Representative Jodey Arrington from Texas sent aletter cosigned by 36 members saying "At your inauguration, you spoke ofhealing, unity, and a path forward for the United States, but shortlythereafter you made several unilateral orders that will eliminate millionsof jobs for working Americans. The oil and gas producers across the countryprovide millions of high paying jobs and a safe and affordable supply ofenergy." He goes on. Charlie, besides the Keystone XL pipeline, there aregas permits and all kinds of things that are coming out of these actions.HURT:  Yes, and the drilling on public lands, and of course, the ParisClimate Accord, which does an awful lot to undermine U.S. energyindependence and companies that can give us that sort of independence. Andfor a guy who didn't run on -- he didn't lay out a particularly clearplatform in his campaign during 2020, but one of the few things that hemade very clear campaign promises about was about protecting our energysector.And the other thing, the other area that I think is disturbing about whatBiden is up to is literary with the flick of a pen, he has eliminatedthousands of jobs, whether it is the XL pipeline or the stopping of Trump'swall. That's literally thousands of jobs that people had two weeks ago thathave vaporized because of his executive actions.And I hope that Harold is right, and I think it would be very wise of Bidento try to work with Congress, but when I look at those things, I'm notterribly hopeful about it.BAIER:  Katie, I'll get to you next panel. When we come back, a sneak peekat tomorrow's headlines tonight. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, a look at tomorrow's headlines, maybe. We're backwith the panel. Harold, your thoughts?FORD:  I thought, with the country in peril, obstruction is bad politicsfor the reasons we stated tonight, but clearly tomorrow is going to saynobody got elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame tonight. So I missed thatone.BAIER:  How about that, nobody, 17 ballots. All right,, Charlie?HURT:  President Biden's halt of the border wall is illegal. And Congressappropriated $1.3 billion a year to build 300 miles of it, and if hedoesn't carry it out, he will be violating the same law that got DonaldTrump impeached.BAIER:  Katie, your headline?PAVLICH:  My headline is SPECIAL REPORT anchor Bret Baier wrestles analligator while trying to recover a golf ball in Florida.BAIER:  Wow, really, that's quite a headline. Fake news, but quite aheadline.HURT:  I want to see the video.(LAUGHTER)BAIER:  I did see that one guy in Florida, he got the dog out of thealligator. That's good stuff.PAVLICH:  The bar is high.BAIER:  All right, panel, thank you very much, I appreciate it. Maybe, younever know.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIALREPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. FOX NEWS PRIMETIME hosted by MariaBartiromo starts in about 15 seconds.
