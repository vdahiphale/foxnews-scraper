Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. It was stupid at best, and certainly cringe-worthy. I'm talking about Cleveland Cavaliers' in-game promo Wednesday night. It was supposed to be a spoof on "Dirty Dancing," but it was lame. Some even say that it was an attempt to inspire domestic violence.
What surprised me is this is not a brainchild of one tone-deaf person. It had to be a group effort. At a minimum, it required someone to come up with the idea, another to sign a contract and do it, two actors, I'm sure a producer, a cameraman or two, and a Cavalier marketing executive - or two or maybe three - and no doubt, other Cavalier executives green-lighting this video. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
No, it is not the worst. And the Cavaliers have since apologized for the video. But how do you find so many tone-deaf people in one place, at the same time, to agree to the same dumb idea? What are the odds? Apparently, pretty high in Cleveland. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's my "Off the Record" comment.
