Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Remember this?

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We are choosing hope over fear. We are choosing unity over division and sending a powerful message that change is coming to America. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Well, he got that right hope. We hope that he is working on ISIS and 24/7. He's entitled to a vacation, I agree. But not when the house is burning down. He should do his job first. He wanted to be president.
And the pictures are horrible. Grinning ear-to-ear at a golf course on Martha's Vineyard with former NBA Star Alonzo Mourning and that was just minutes after his statement about beheaded American journalist James Foley. The optics are bad. They are really bad. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But here is where the hope comes in. Back on April 30th, 2011, on a Saturday night, President Obama was entertaining a room of 2,000 plus journalists at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. All seemed fine, lots of jokes. But the joke was on the unsuspecting journalists. The president had just given the go sign to get Usama bin Laden, and not one journalist picked up on it.
So, my hope now is that we are all being fooled again and that while we watch him beeline to the golf course with big grin, he is really doing something big, and big about ISIS. If not, forget that "hope" business. We need the other part of his campaign slogan: change. And 2016 can't come fast enough for that. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
