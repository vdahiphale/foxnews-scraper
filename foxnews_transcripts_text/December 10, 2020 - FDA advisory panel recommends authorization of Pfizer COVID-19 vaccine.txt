BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Sorry, Emily. All right, good evening. Welcometo Washington. I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, we're following two major stories. We have newinformation about the government and the investigations of Hunter Biden,son of the president-elect but first, the day after the grim milestone ofmore than 3,000 Americans dying from COVID in one day. An advisory panelhas just recommended the approval of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine just inthe past few minutes. The Food and Drug Administration now takes up thatendorsement and could greenlight the distribution of the formulaimmediately with the first shots in the U.S. soon to follow.Correspondent David Spunt has the breaking details this evening. He's atFDA headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland. Good evening, David.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. This advisorypanel met for about nine hours. They were incredibly thorough. They voted17 yes's, four no's and one abstention to move this on to the full FDAcareer employees.But during this debate today, they talked about potential side effects froma mild fever that lasted for about a day, also the debate over the age.Some of these COVID vaccines Bret talked about nobody 18 and younger. Butthis specific vaccine the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine deals with 16 and 17-year-olds, that was an issue too if the full FDA career employees approvedthis. We could see vaccines going out in just a few hours or days.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT (voice-over): The majority of Americans won't be vaccinated until thespring, maybe early summer.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES: That'll get us really on the road very close to being normal. Thesooner we do that, the better.SPUNT: The new normal will take some getting used to for Americans who wantto get on a plane. IATA, the largest airline trade association in the worldis working on a mobile app that will show that you are COVID free andvaccinated before you board a flight.NICK CAREEN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTASSOCIATION: There is no database. This information is only kept by thecustomer, which is key. So, the customer shares it with whomever they wishto share it with. And if they want to delete it, they delete it.SPUNT: U.S. health officials believe the international airline industrywill continue to be at risk long after the United States achieves herdimmunity.DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION:The pandemic in the world is not going to be controlled for multiple yearsand so, most always have a global risk of reintroduction throughsusceptibles that they haven't been vaccinated.SPUNT: Jennifer Haller was the first person in the United States toparticipate in the original Moderna trial last March. Nine months later,she has no problem with sharing her information before traveling.JENNIFER HALLER, VACCINE RECIPIENT: It would be reasonable for me than Iwould hope that it would be reasonable for majority of people when we'retalking about trying to combat a global pandemic and keep people safe andsave lives.SPUNT: Business owners are also grappling with operating in a post vaccineworld. For some, an app sounds appealing.JOSH QUINN, OWNER, TIGERTREE: Should that technology exist? I wouldcertainly (INAUDIBLE)SPUNT: Josh Quinn owns Tigertree, a boutique shop in Columbus, Ohio. Wefirst met him in April. In August, he closed his brick and mortar store andis now online. Quinn hopes to open another physical store after themajority of Americans are vaccinated.QUINN: I'm an optimist and I honestly think by the summer between thevaccination efforts and some maybe increased measures coming our way, Ithink we're going to be mostly out of this by next October.(END VIDEO CLIP)SPUNT: Now, we're waiting to hear from the full FDA to see if they grantemergency use authorization. Millions of doses of vaccines are ready to goto nursing homes and hospitals to help those first line workers, Bret.And next week, one week from today, December 17th, Moderna, that is thesecond company to come before the FDA for that emergency use authorization.Big day, Bret.BAIER: Big day, David, but quickly, you know, this is the advisory panel,the full FDA has to greenlight it. I guess there's some people saying whynot just say boom, it's done? Why does it take a few days to do that?SPUNT: Yes, you know, it could take a few days, it could take a few hours.That's the process here at the FDA. I asked myself, I said what is thereason for having this advisory panel and then giving it to the FDA to makethat decision?But from what we know Bret, this advisory panel deals with pediatricians,scientists, vaccine developers, they make their recommendation to the FDAthen the FDA career employees that work for the commissioner, Dr. StephenHahn. Those are the ones that make that final decision. And it's possibleBret, it could happen in the next few hours. It could happen overnight. Andthose vaccines could be going into the arms of people just within a fewhours.BAIER: OK, David we'll watch for that. Thank you.Again, our other top story, new information about the federalinvestigations into Hunter Biden's taxes but sources telling Fox theinvestigation is actually bigger in scope.A Senate Committee report may out -- lay out a blueprint, it describes theson of the president-elect his business dealings with China and what isbeing called in the report the potential for criminal activity. Seniorpolitical correspondent Mike Emanuel starts us off with that part of theinvestigations tonight. Good evening, Mike.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening.This investigation according to a source familiar began in 2018. Fox Newshas learned not only are the feds digging into Hunter Biden's taxes, buthe's also the target of a grand jury investigation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (voice-over): The federal investigation into Hunter Biden's taxaffairs and business dealings was active in the final days of thepresidential campaign, but it was covert to avoid influencing the outcomeof the election. It's now in an overt phase.Fox has told his father the president-elect is not part of this probe. Buta Republican member of the Homeland Security Committee notes Huntertraveled overseas when his father was vice president.SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): What did Joe Biden know and when did he know it?He needs to answer questions.EMANUEL: A source familiar says the investigation was established onsuspicious activity reports regarding foreign transactions. Hunter'sbusiness dealings with Chinese nationals, including some flagged forpotential financial criminal activity are outlined in a Senate Committeereport.The chairman of Senate Finance, one of the two committees digging intoBiden business dealings says their investigation was justified.SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA): The liberal media and members of the otherpolitical party chose to dismiss our work even falsely claim that our workwas Russian disinformation.EMANUEL: The Senate report notes "Hunter Biden had business associationswith Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong, and other Chinese nationals linked to theCommunist government and the People's Liberation Army. Those associationsresulted in millions of dollars in cash flow." A point echoed by theHomeland Security chairman.SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): There have been reports of the Biden's cashing inthe Biden name for many, many years. You know, dating back to when JoeBiden was a Senator.EMANUEL: Joe Biden and his allies were quick to dismiss questions aboutHunter's business dealings in the final days of the campaign.JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: I know you'd ask it. Ihave no responses. It's another smear campaign. It's right up your alley.Those are the questions you always ask.REP. DAN KILDEE (D-MI): I think that's a question that's been pretty welllitigated in the last year as to whether or not the effort to bring HunterBiden's history into this whole situation is a smear campaign.EMANUEL: Fox News was first to report that the FBI opened a moneylaundering investigation into a laptop connected to Hunter Biden. It'sunclear if that portion of the investigation is still ongoing.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL: Some Republicans are now expressing concern that with a change ofadministrations on January 20th, a new president and his team could replacethe U.S. attorneys. Now, there's a call that those spearheading thisinvestigation must be allowed to complete their work without interference,Bret.BAIER: OK Mike, thank you.Hunter Biden is not the only member of the president-elect's family underscrutiny tonight. Some of the business dealings of Joe Biden's brotherJames also being examined. Correspondent Peter Doocy reports tonight fromWilmington, Delaware.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There's more than oneBiden caught up in a federal investigation, Hunter.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Dr. Biden, can I just ask you one thing on the news, areaction to the news of the investigation of your son, Hunter?DOOCY: And James, Biden's brother whose name has come up in the course ofan investigation into a hospital business he's linked to according to areport in Politico. This is the same brother who allegedly introduced thenformer Vice President Biden to a business partner.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was introduced to Joe Biden by James Biden and HunterBiden.DOOCY: James Biden didn't want to talk about any of that when approachedrecently by FoxNews.com.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you Mr. James Biden, I wanted to ask you about theChina deal.JAMES BIDEN, BROTHER OF JOE BIDEN: Will you please stop bothering me?DOOCY: Biden has promised distance.BIDEN: My son, my family will not be involved.DOOCY: But yesterday, the taxpayer funded transition team sent out astatement from Hunter Biden who doesn't work for the transition.Now, Mike Davis, former Chief Counsel for Nominations at Senate Judiciarywonders, why is Joe Biden using federal government resources to issuepublic statements for his son Hunter Biden, related to his personal legalproblems? Is this legal?That's happening as the Biden White House is filling up with three moreObama alumni Susan Rice, Obama's U.N. ambassador and national securityadviser will be director of the Domestic Policy Council. Eight years afterinfamously blaming the Benghazi terror attack on a YouTube video.SUSAN RICE, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: We are of theview that this is not an expression of hostility and in the broadest sensetowards the United States, or U.S. policy, its proximately a reaction tothis video.DOOCY: Denis McDonough Obama's chief of staff is the pick for V.A.Secretary upsetting the founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of Americawho tweets a stunningly strange and surprising pick. He is not a vet andnot a post 9/11 vet.Tom Vilsack, Obama's Agriculture Secretary is Biden's choice forAgriculture Secretary. Payback for help on the trail.BIDEN: These folks have helped me more than any candidates have ever helpedme in my whole career.DOOCY: And using history as a guide, Biden is going to try to talk policyand not his son's problems.BIDEN: We want to talk about families and ethics, I don't want to do that.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: The president-elect is scheduled to introduce Susan Rice and someother new White House staffers at an event in person in Wilmingtontomorrow.The closest that we've come to a reaction from him to the Hunter Bidenstory is a one sentence statement that was signed by the transition team.We have not seen Joe Biden since this story broke. He stayed home today,Bret.BAIER: All right, Peter, thank you.The president-elect is asking civil rights leaders not to promote thedefunding of Police Departments. Portions of a Zoom call to supporters havebeen posted by the intercept.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: They've already labeled us as being defund the police. Anything weput forward in terms of the organizational structure to change policing,which I promise you will occur. I promise you.Just think to yourself and give me advice whether we should do that beforeJanuary 5th, because that's how they beat the living hell out of us acrossthe country, saying that we're talking about defunding the police, we'renot. We're talking about holding them accountable.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Biden transition official tells Fox News on background. Thepresident-elect believes in supporting bold and urgent criminal justicereform while continuing to support law enforcement's mission to keepcommunities safe and that he says in public what he says in private.There are many questions still tonight about why a California Democraticcongressman was allowed to serve on the House Intelligence Committeedespite his relationship to a woman accused of being a Chinese spy. The topDemocrat in the House seems unconcerned by that. The House Minority Leadercalls this the tip of the iceberg. Correspondent Gillian Turner hastonight's update.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Democrat Eric Swalwellis facing a growing storm of criticism from his Republican colleagues inCongress over an FBI probe into an alleged Chinese spy he had ties toseveral years ago.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): This man should not be in the Intel Committee;he's jeopardizing national security.SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Until he comes forward and has a thorough andcomplete explanation for what happened, then he should not sit on the HouseIntelligence Committee and have access to classified information.TURNER: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi waved off the matter today saying bothDemocrat and Republican leaders were briefed in the past simultaneouslyabout this threat.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): I don't have any concern about Mr. Swalwell. I dothink that it's unfortunate that Mr. McCarthy is trying to make an issue ofthis when his leader -- we all found out at the same time.TURNER: We still don't know who briefed congressional leadership. At thetime, James Comey was the director of the FBI and a former senior stafferon the House Intel Committee tells Fox News the Comey briefing would havebeen "standard operating procedure"Swalwell's Republican colleagues on House Intel are lasering in on the rolethe alleged spy Christine Fang played in his California political career.REP. CHRIS STEWART (R-UT): This was a Chinese citizen, who was a hyperaggressive in developing relationships with politicians. We know that shehelped him get reelected, she helped him raise money.TURNER: Swalwell himself insists he did nothing wrong and claims the FBIactually thanked him for helping their investigation. He also saidWednesday the whole story is just political revenge.REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): At the same time this story was being leaked outis the time that I was working on impeachment on the House Intelligence andJudiciary Committees.They may think that they're going to silence me, they're not going tosilence me.TURNER: He was one of President Trump's fiercest critics during impeachmentproceedings.SWALWELL: He's a repeat offender. Crimes against our constitution and yes,crimes that one day may be prosecuted statutorily.(END VIDEO CLIP)TURNER: Swalwell insists he long ago cut off all ties with Fang thoughuntil Fox News reported it yesterday. He did have family members who werefriends with her on Facebook, his father and brother. They are no longer,Bret.BAIER: All right, Gillian, thank you.

Chief White House Correspondent, John Roberts, tells us wherethings stand tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At theWhite House today, President Trump hosting lunch for 12 Republican stateattorneys general. 11 of whom are asking the Supreme Court to overturnelection results in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin. TexasAttorney General Ken Paxton leading the effort.KEN PAXTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS: It seemed wrong to us that my votersare now disenfranchised but in a national election where other statesdidn't follow state law.ROBERTS: Paxton argues that a patchwork of inconsistent rules across thosestates harmed voters in Texas by electing Joe Biden. Paxton asking theSupreme Court to block electors in those four states from voting on Monday.PAXTON: We're asking that the court basically put this back in the hands ofthe state legislature to pick their own electors as was commonly done, youknow, for years in this country by certain state legislatures.ROBERTS: In total, 18 other states have joined Texas, filing friend of thecourt briefs, including Louisiana.JEFF LANDRY, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF LOUISIANA: There were states under whichnon-legislative actors that means like governors, secretary of states, orstate courts, basically modified election law in the midst of the game.ROBERTS: 106 House Republicans also filed so-called amicus briefs today,and President Trump himself joined in a statement his campaign saying, "Thepresident intervened because his rights as a candidate are affected by thedefendant state's failure to follow and enforce state election laws duringthe 2020 election.At a Hanukkah party last night, the president again insisting he won theelection.TRUMP: So, we're going to see what happens. We have tremendous cases rightnow. A big, big case. 18 states as of this moment. 18 states.ROBERTS: In their response to the Supreme Court, the four states pushingback on the petition, saying, "The State of Texas has now added its voiceto the cacophony of bogus claims." And adding, "Nothing in the text,history, or structure of the Constitution supports Texas's view that it candictate the manner in which four other states run their elections."While the majority of the focus at the White House is on the electionresults, business is still getting done. President Trump today announcingyet another normalization of relations agreement. This one between Israeland the North African nation of Morocco. This part of the deal, PresidentTrump recognizing Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed lands of WesternSahara.(END VIDEO CLIP)ROBERTS: Of course, the big prize still remains, a normalization agreementbetween Israel and Saudi Arabia. White House officials today told Fox Newsthat they believe that it is inevitable that such a deal will take place,it's just a matter of time but no prediction on when that time might be.Bret.BAIER: John Roberts live on the North Lawn. John, thanks.The top U.S. diplomat with some very pointed statements about the growingthreat from China. We'll have details when we come back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: What more bad decisions willschools make because they're hooked on Chinese Communist Party cash? Whatprofessors will they be able to co-opt or to silence?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: The nation's top diplomat issuing fresh warnings about the threatfrom China. National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has detailstonight from the Pentagon.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):Their fighter jets look remarkably like U.S. fifth-generation warplanes.Their hackers tried to steal the COVID vaccine from the U.S. last summer,and many of the 400,000 students sent to the U.S. from mainland China eachyear are actually spies for the Chinese Communist Party.POMPEO: They want to influence American students as well, professors andadministrators too. Look, they know that left-leaning college campuses arerife with any Americanism, and present easy targets for their anti-Americanmessaging.GRIFFIN: Earlier this year, the head of Harvard's chemistry department wascharged with lying to the federal government about his relationship withWuhan University of Technology, accepting $50,000 a month to be a strategicscientist as part of an aggressive Chinese attempt to recruit scientists toshare their work.Last summer, the U.S. government ordered the closure of China's consulatein Houston for its role in economic espionage.POMPEO: The Chinese Communist Party was using their consulate in Houston asa den of spies.GRIFFIN: After a half dozen suspected Chinese spies were arrested lastsummer, 1,000 Chinese researchers on university campuses suddenly left theU.S.JOHN DEMERS, UNITED STATES ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, NATIONAL SECURITYDIVISION: Those five or six arrests were just the tip of the iceberg. Andhonestly, the size of the iceberg is one that I don't know that we or otherfolks realized how large it was when we began down that road.GRIFFIN: Since the U.S. election, Chinese influence operations targetingthe Biden administration have been on steroids according to the nationalcounterintelligence chief.WILLIAM EVANINA, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND SECURITYCENTER: We've also seen an uptick in which was planned, and we predictedthat China would now re-vector their influence campaigns to newadministration.(END VIDEO CLIP)GRIFFIN: Today, the FCC designated China's top telecommunications firmHuawei as a national security threat. Bret?BAIER: Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon. Jennifer, thank you.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SWALWELL: It is not the view of the intelligence community that China andRussia are equally acting in this election. And I can say in open sessionthat is false. And it's false for the American people to walk away andbelieve that there's any equivalence between what Russia and China aredoing.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell, all his statements about Chinanow being looked at again after the investigation he's facing. And seeingnow, let's get into more detail about the China threat.Joining us tonight, Bill Gertz, national security correspondent for theWashington Times. He is the author of the book, Deceiving the Sky: InsideCommunist China's Drive for Global Supremacy. And retired Air ForceBrigadier General Robert Spalding, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute,author of the book, Stealth War: How China Took Over While America's EliteSlept.Gentlemen, thank you. When I say investigation, the House minority leaderMcCarthy wants Eric Swalwell off of the House Intel Committee. The HouseSpeaker, Bill, saying she doesn't see a problem with this. How do you putthat in context to what we just heard about the threat from China?BILL GERTZ, NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, firstof all, I think it shows extremely poor judgment on the part of CongressmanSwalwell. Anytime a Chinese national shows up at your office and says shewants to help you fundraise and place people in your office. Certain --certainly, you know, the FBI would call that a clue. I think that's whathappened. And also remember, Swalwell for a short time last year ran forpresident.We've seen this playbook in the past. The Chinese funneled cash into theBill Clinton reelection campaign back in the 90s, and then there was thecase of Katrina Leung in Los Angeles, who was sleeping with two FBI agentswho were handling her as a double agent.BAIER: General, I talked to Chris Wray in the summer, the FBI director, andhe told me at the time that the FBI was opening up an investigation,counterintelligence investigation, somehow tied to China every 10 hours. Idon't think people fully understand the length to which China is trying togo to infiltrate all elements of the U.S.BRIG. GEN. ROBERT SPALDING (RET.), HUDSON INSTITUTE: Nor did they reallyunderstand how many are actually operating here. When I got to the embassyas a senior defense official in Beijing in 2017, the embassy told me thatwe had some 4 million 10-year visa holders in the United States at any onetime. So this is a big problem, and I'm glad we're finally starting to pickat it.BAIER: Bill, the incoming nominee for secretary of state, Tony Blinken, hassaid that it's unrealistic to decouple the U.S. from China, something thatPresident Trump had talked about. He said recently, trying to fullydecouple, as some have suggested, from China is unrealistic, ultimatelycounterproductive. It would be a mistake. As you get ready for this nextadministration, how it deals with China is really going to be front andcenter.GERTZ: Yes, the presumptive president-elect has said that he is going towin the competition. Of course, early on in the campaign he said we can'tcompete with China, we shouldn't try, they are nice people, and all that.Everybody is going to be watching very closely. I think it's going to bevery difficult to undo a lot of the hardline policies that have been put inplace under the Trump administration, and I think we're going to be seeingmore of that in the final weeks as the administration winds down.They have done some tremendous things. On the intelligence front, I cantell you a retired CIA counterintelligence official told me that what theChinese are doing is an intelligence assault that hasn't been seen sincethe Cold War days of the Soviet Union. And I would make the point that wereally, really need a much better counterintelligence system then we have.Let's go back, this case that we are talking about with Swalwell happenedaround 2015, and that's when the FBI was at its worst in terms of what wefound out to be politicized counterintelligence people. We really need tobeef up our counterintelligence capabilities.BAIER: General, where do you see the biggest threat from China? You havethe military buildup. You've got their cyber capabilities. They are nowreally going into space significantly, and we have been talking about thecounterintelligence efforts and intelligence efforts inside the U.S.SPALDING: It's really on their collection of data. They seek to become theSaudi Arabia of data. Data drives artificial intelligence. They seek to usethe same tools that Silicon Valley developed to harvest data and theninfluence consumers. They want to influence not only our consumptionpatterns, but also our social and political beliefs. So it's a real threatto our democracy going forward when the population doesn't know where thetruth lies, or they're following the dictate of the Chinese Communist Partythat has access to their data through modern telecommunications systems andcan use that data with advanced artificial intelligence, some of the bestalgorithms in the world today, to influence them in ways that are counterto our own interests.BAIER: Economically, Bill, Republicans on the Trump administration had saidthe trade efforts that they have made weekend China. Democrats were sayingit wasn't, it didn't. Do we have a sense of where China is, was, as aresult of the trade actions of the Trump administration?GERTZ: It's hard to tell. Because of the pandemic their economy hascontracted significantly. But all questioning aside, I think that clearlyit has had a tremendous impact on forcing China to back off. Now, thatdoesn't mean they're going to end their technology collection and theirspying efforts. And they may be waiting for a more conciliatory Bidenadministration. But clearly, during the Trump administration, they puttremendous pressure on the Chinese, and they didn't gain economically asthey have in the past.BAIER: Gentlemen, we appreciate your time. This is a serious subject thatwe're going to continue to follow across the board. Thanks a lot.Up next, star power for the Georgia Senate runoffs and harsh personalattacks and rebuttals.

I don't think -- and, bythe way --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here is your daily reminder that there is no evidenceof wrongdoing by the former vice president or his son in Ukraine.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The news that the family member of an incoming presidentis under investigation is a big deal.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Among the things they're looking at is whether or notincome was reported or underreported.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, the federal investigation we have confirmed looking intoHunter Biden, the president-elect's son. Some of the media coverage beforeand now after the election.Let's bring in our panel, former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr.,Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at "The Federalist," and MatthewContinetti, founding editor of the "Washington Free Beacon."Mollie, we know now there is a tax investigation. We know from sources thatit is broader than that and it deals with foreign exchanges of money, aswell. We know that the FBI had this laptop before the election. Big tech,other media, weren't covering the story and in fact blocked it from a lotof social media.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, "THE FEDERALIST": Yes, we hear about therigging of the election, and partly what people mean by that is targetedvote fraud, but partly what they mean is the meddling on the part of bigmedia and big tech to affect the outcome of the election. We had a Senatereport from the Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security Committees thatshowed suspicious money transfers to the Biden family business from foreigngovernments or people linked closely to foreign governments. It barely gotany coverage, or it was mocked. When "The New York Post" broke the storyabout these emails, even though they were verified and people who wererecipients of these emails verified that they were real, the mediasuppressed that story.And we actually also knew there was an FBI investigation into Hunter Bidenbefore the election, except that the media suppressed it so, so blatantlyand brazenly. The American people had a right to really have a thoroughdiscussion of the Biden family's involvement with corrupt foreigngovernment and how they benefited from that, and this meddling on the partof big media and big tech, which banned people from even talking about thison Facebook and Twitter, is a very serious problem and a huge threat to therepublic.BAIER: Harold, what do you think of this story, where it's going? It's noteven -- obviously Joe Biden hasn't even been inaugurated yet.HAROLD FORD JR. (D), FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE: Well, I think weshould all probably take a deep breath. Thanks for having me on tonight andcount our blessings on a lot of fronts.This story is disturbing. From the standpoint that Hunter Biden is going tohave to answer questions, it sounds like there is an investigationunderway, it may be broader than what we think. And I trust listening tohis statement today that he will respond and act accordingly.I do think some of the reaction around whether this should have beenreported before the election or after the election, to our knowledge I'venot seen any reports suggesting that Joe Biden had anything to do with thisor there was any involvement on his part. So, I don't know how or whatvoters would have to have considered about Joe Biden in this story. Therewere voluminous stories about Hunter and about some of his personalchallenges and things that he has had to overcome. I thought his father,the president-elect's statement today about his son was touching andheartfelt. And it's what a father would say about a son.But Hunter, and whatever he did, he will have to face whatever comes fromJustice Department, and I take him at his word today that he'll answerthose questions, and he believes he has done nothing wrong. We'll have towait and see.BAIER: Yes, a couple of things, Matthew. Tony Bobulinski obviouslyreferenced Joe Biden and meeting him, and he was blacked out of mediacoverage other than this network and a couple other places. The otherthing, Matthew, is it was interesting to see a Hunter Biden statement putout on transition, memo by the transition team that Hunter Biden's legalchallenges were going to be talked about by the Biden-Harris transition.MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, "WASHINGTON FREE BEACON": Right, andit shows how it does affect President-elect Biden, that they are related.What I find interesting, though, Bret, is despite the legacy media and thesocial media companies trying to suppress this story in the final days ofthe election, it seems to have broken through to some degree. You look atthe exit polls, it's actually the late deciders tended to break firstbefore. And one has to imagine that discussions of Hunter Biden played somerole in that.And more importantly, the fact that Joe Biden has never had an answer towhat Hunter Biden was doing in China and why he was able to get so muchmoney from Chinese entrepreneurs, or whatever, connected to the ChineseCommunist Party. He continues to not have a good answer, just givingoutright denials. And I think this is going to really come to hurt him inthe coming months.BAIER: All right, last, I want to turn quickly, Mollie, to the Swalwellsituation, what the House speaker and House minority leader said aboutthat. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): At the same moment, you have Republican andDemocratic leaders, and the leadership of the committee were briefed at thesame moment. Make sure you know that, because he keeps going around sayingwhen did they know. We knew when they knew.REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Speaker Pelosi was notified. I was not. I'masking for an FBI briefing now. But if she knew and maintained Swalwell onIntel -- wrong. He's a national security threat.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: OK, where is this story going, Mollie?HEMINGWAY: Stunning news that someone on House Intel Committee had thisrelationship with a Chinese asset, and that people knew about it and thathe was allowed to stay on this committee. I think there's a lot of concernthat the Democratic Party, that the Chinese have too much control over theDemocratic Party and its agenda, in the same way that they have too muchcontrol over Hollywood and the NBA. This is a big issue for the entire, theBiden administration, as we are talking about, and on the House side.I think it's important to note that Devin Nunes and the House Republicanstried to focus on China when they had control over the committee, and theseDemocrats, Swalwell and Adam Schiff, really pushed to change theconversation to Russia. That they were personally involved and that this iscoming out now makes that look even worse than it did at the time that theywere trying to dissuade House Intel from looking into China.BAIER: Harold, I guess we do sometimes look at the panel through the prismof what happens if this was the other way. Let's say Devin Nunes had arelationship with some Russian. How much coverage with this be getting ashim on the House Intelligence Committee and what we see today? Do you see adisparity here?FORD: It deserves a lot of coverage. I think that the panel you had onprior to us focused on at the right way, though. The increase, theproliferation of Chinese assets in our country, that's what we should befocused on. This is not a partisan issue, Democrat or Republican. I can'tbelieve that any member of Congress, Republican or Democrat, would openlyavow and want to work with a Chinese asset.Two, on the Hunter Biden thing, let's remember, COVID, the economy, andother matters are on the ballot, as well, and the president's decency. ButI hope we get to the bottom of the Swalwell thing, and I hope, moreimportantly, we focus on the number of Chinese assets here in our country,and we act as an American government to stop it.BAIER: Yes. And on the COVID front, the vaccine moving forward. We'll seeif the FDA moves in coming hours. Panel, thank you very much.When we come back, holiday season firsts and seconds.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Finally, tonight, some holiday glee.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(MUSIC)(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: That's Sergeant Robert Kirby, went viral this summer with hisquarantine quartet videos. Now the Georgia police officer returns to spreadsome holiday joy and encourage safety.And it was a joyful time for Margaret Keenan who was greeted with cheers asshe left the hospital. The 90-year-old was the first person to take thecoronavirus vaccine in the U.K. She departed hand-in-hand with her family,feeling good. So that's good news.Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIALREPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
