SEAN HANNITY, HOST: The country needs at least some conservative voices. They want 99.9 percent liberal voices on the air.
All right. Tucker, great job. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {

        }
      
All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All right. Buckle up tonight. I have a special message for Jim Comey. Now, for nearly two years, the United States of America, we have somehow managed to survive without the dedicated stewardship of our righteous moral savior, the ever so virtuous and honorable James Comey. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, thankfully, he's back and telling all of us, you know, we are the stupid, smelly, Walmart shoppers of America. And, of course, his colleague and friend Peter Strzok, that's how he refers to us.
He's now telling us how to behave as the Mueller witch hunt nears its conclusion. I will get to that. We're going to show you what the indignant, totally disgraced, fired FBI director had to say. And we're going to remind you of all about James Comey and why the president did the country a favor by firing him. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All right, but first -- we'll get to that in a minute. It's time for our ongoing “Hannity” watch on the radical, socialist Democratic 2020 candidates.
We start tonight with really more bizarre behavior from Robert Francis Beto Bozo O'Rourke. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, no countertop or table is safe in America. Why? Robert Francis seems to force his way into every restaurant, every diner in the great state of Iowa and appears that he's fallen in love with these elevated surfaces. As he moves, whatever he does. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, cover your food, cover your drinks because Beto is coming to a town near you and apparently he is stomping all over where you actually eat. Perhaps he's just trying to spread the magical healing powers of what we told you last night of eating dirt, which he did, a lot of it. After he lost to Ted Cruz and went to New Mexico and he thinks they have super natural powers.
And, by the way, he actually even brought some home for his family to eat. What a generous gift.
Now, of course, his behavior on the campaign trail, it pales in comparison to his extreme and nutty ideas. Take, for example, we now know that Beto, his all-out war against border walls, not only is he against the president's plan for expanding border o security, but he also wants to tear down existing border walls so our borders then would be completely wide open. And because, according to Beto, there are no problems, none, at our southern border. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Take a look.

BETO O'ROURKE, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We do not need any walls, $30 billion, 2,000 miles long, 30 feet high. It will not be built on the international boundary line, which is the center line of the Rio Grande River. The wall will be built well into the interior of someone's ranch, someone else's farm, someone else's home. You and I will be forced to take their properties to solve a problem that we do not have.

HANNITY: So, all the human trafficking we've chronicled, even young girls in prostitution, all the drug trafficking, violent gangs, cartels, the 2 percent, not the 98 percent. The 300 Americans killed every week from heroin, 90 percent crosses that border. I guess none of that seems to matter to Robert Francis O'Rourke.
And I guess the Angel Moms and Dads who we have interviewed who have lost their family members and their children from heroin overdoses, I guess he isn't paying attention to them. Maybe he needs a long conversation with them, because that crosses our southern border and I guess none of it seems to matter, or maybe he's just living in an alternative reality from ingesting too much dirt. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

Either way, he's in good company within his own party. For example, fellow Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, now the leader pushing the bizarre far left radical ideas. These are not based on reality.
Now, she wants to ban all air travel, get rid of the combustion engine, and all oil and gas in ten years and cows because of an impending apocalypse. She actually thinks the world is going to end in 12 years. But that didn't stop her from touring this massive $8 billion expansion of LaGuardia Airport in New York City. Well, hat's her district. It isn't that the very thing she wants to ban? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And here she is cheering on the expansion of that airport right in her home city. So, of course, this is the airport she utilizes we know an awful lot. You can take Amtrak between New York and D.C. But she prefers to travel via delta, the shuttle. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
Now, it's a "do as I say, not as I do," kind of like the socialist way. Right, Congresswoman? Glad you watch the channel so much.
Now, this kind of rampant hypocrisy doesn't matter to the mainstream media at all. Look at "Time" magazine. Just featured her on its cover, calling her, quote, the phenom. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, more on that radical far left socialist Democratic Party and their best friends in the media in just a minute.

Also tonight, the great one, Mark Levin, will be with us and the ever-so- brilliant Victor David Hanson.
All right. But, first, we do turn to some good news, before we get to our top story out of Syria. Now, remember in 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump made this promise. Let's take a look.

HANNITY: Very different politician. Promises made, and a lot of promises kept.
Now, those insane rules of engagement from the Obama era were lifted. President Trump has unleashed American airpower, bombing ISIS over and over and over again. And with the help of that air cover, the U.S.-backed Syrian forces just cleared what is the final strip of land once held by ISIS fighters, the one they took over originally.

Tens of thousands of radical jihadists have surrendered. Many other thousands have been killed, the so-called caliphate is no more. But, of course, the struggle against radical Islamic extremism and those sympathetic to ISIS, we must forever remain vigilant.

By the way, the president today recognized Golan Heights as Israel territory. Again, he was the only president to promise Jerusalem is the rightful capital. He made it happen.
We shift gears. We turn our attention to “Hannity” on Mueller's witch hunt, and this is our top story tonight.
The seemingly never-ending probe appears to be in its final stage. The president wants Mueller's full report released to the public. By the way, he doesn't decide that, but he wants everyone everywhere to see it with their own eyes. That after nine months, by the way, of investigations from Comey and his FBI, that was before Mueller, and then nearly 700 days of investigations from Mueller, while we know there's no evidence of any Trump-Russian collusion -- none, zero, nothing.

Remember, we learned last week, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok testified that the FBI's nine-month investigation before the appointment of Mueller came up empty. They had nothing. The House, Senate investigations, they also came up empty. Nothing.

Look at this, NBC News is panicking. They are worried. They recently ran a report entitled, quote, you may be disappointed by the Mueller report. In other words, the conspiracy theories that their network has been peddling for two-plus years might be about to be confronted with truth.
And meanwhile, the ever-virtuous savior of American morality, he's back and he's telling you exactly what you need to think about the impending special counsel report. In an op-ed in "The New York Times," the always sanctimonious, self-righteous Jim Comey writing that he's not rooting for President Trump to be guilty of a crime. Instead, he's, quote, rooting for a demonstration to the world that the United States justice system works. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
Really? Well, Jim Comey, I don't believe a single word you say. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Time now for a “Hannity” history lesson on James Comey and his role in all of this. He is the root of almost everything here. James Comey, he was the one who totally mishandled and helped rig the Clinton investigation.
He's the one that allowed Obama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch, remember, to dictate how his agency was conducting the investigation. Or should I say matter? Which he allowed her to say when he knew it was supposed to be an investigation. He was leading it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Jim Comey, the one who oversaw s Clinton's exoneration letter in May of 2016, three months before the investigation ended and three months before Hillary Clinton, other key witnesses, were even interviewed. What I call the exoneration before investigation.
And, by the way, it was he who allowed two other people in the room with Hillary when she was being interrogated, supposedly. Remember, he's the one that signed off on changing that all important language in that letter, in the exoneration letter. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
"Gross negligence" was taken out. That would be the criminal statute. The words "extreme carelessness" put in. And then, of course, they had the new standard intent that they just made up in the law, which was not all at the direction of Obama's DOJ, which we learned last week, right in Loretta Lynch's office, she's taking control of all of this, according to Page and Strzok. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And remember, Jim Comey, he is the one that lied about all of this on Capitol Hill. He testified that he didn't write the exoneration letter before interviewing Clinton. That was a lie. He was the one who allowed rampant anti-Trump bias to fester among his top officials including Page, Strzok, McCabe, and so many more.
Remember, it was Jim Comey who allowed the person that called Trump supporters, us, smelly Walmart people and vowed to stop Trump from becoming president. Well, he let him lead the investigation into the Trump campaign and, by the way, he's the guy who interviewed Hillary.
And, by the way, it was Jim Comey who purposely leaked sensitive confidential government memos about the president after he was unceremoniously -- well, fired, and he did it for the very purposes of ensuring that a special counsel investigation happened after his own nine- month investigation got nothing. And that his good friend Robert Mueller was appointed to lead the witch hunt, even though, again, they had found nothing.

JAMES COMEY, FIRED FBI DIRECTOR: The president tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there's not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally that there might be corroboration for our conversation. There might be a tape. My judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square, and so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter. I didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked them to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.

HANNITY: Jim Comey, he also signed the first FISA application. This was in October of 2016.
In other words, it was Jim Comey who clearly, we now know, committed fraud with his signature before a FISA court judge. What did he use? The bulk of information, Nunes, Grassley-Graham memo tells us Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It was Comey in fact who hid the fact that the dossier's contents -- small little detail -- Hillary paid for it, but they didn't tell the FISA court in big bold letters she paid for it that this was a partisan document, unverified, uncorroborated. And that would be called in my world fraud by omission. Small oversight, Mr. Comey?
Well, it was Jim Comey who signed off on that document that was completely, think about this, unverifiable. How do we know it's unverifiable? Because its author, Christopher Steele, testified in an interrogatory in Great Britain, he had no idea if any of that dossier was true. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And we now know most of it is totally debunked, but that's what they presented to the FISA court judge. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, I thought, if I remember correctly, a FISA application can only be obtained if a career law enforcement official swears that the information is true and correct. Or else there will be serious consequences. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Where did I learn that from? Oh, Rod Rosenstein. Take a look.

ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: FISA application is actually, a warrant, like a search warrant. In order to get a FISA search warrant, you need an affidavit signed by a career federal enforcement officer who swears that the information in the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. And that's the way we operate. And if it's wrong -- sometimes it is -- if you find out there's something incorrect, that person is going to face consequences.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Jim Comey put his signature, swearing that to the best of his knowledge, it's true and accurate. Well, even its own author doesn't believe that.
By the way, now he's going to lecture us on how we the American people need to judge the Mueller report that he set up? None of this would've happened, none of it, except Jim Comey allowed his personal ambition, his animus, his hatred of Donald Trump get in the way. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How do you sign off on a warrant that's impossible to verify? How do you do that? You know, when Steele said you can't verify it, he can't verify it, only 50/50 chance it's true, how do you hide from a judge Hillary paid for that dossier? The opposition party paid for it. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And three months after he signed the October 2016 warrant -- well, then he went to Trump Tower in January 2017 and told then President-elect Trump that the dossier exists. It's unverified. And it's salacious. The opposite of what he would've signed off on in October.
In other words, based on the garbage, being truthful three months earlier, what he swore to. That's called fraud. That's called lying.
That's called a fraud that also -- think about this. It denied one of our fellow citizens their constitutional right. That would be Carter Page. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Fraud that the media, because we know they leaked the dossier, Isikoff and Corn and "The Washington Post," so that was fraud leaked before the American people to influence the election with Russian lies, fraud that was used to elect a candidate that he and others obviously preferred, fraud to bludgeon a duly elected president to undo the election because he knew better, because he hated Trump, just like his disciples, Strzok and Page. In other words, first they rig an investigation. By the way, Mr. Comey, do you think if I deleted subpoenaed emails and I acid washed my hard drive and had somebody bust myth devices, do you think I would get away with that? I don't think so, but they cleared Hillary of all charges. They rigged that investigation.
Now, he thought he knew better than you -- we, the American people. And to this day, Comey thinks he's an American super patriot. He's not. This has nothing to do, by the way, with rank-and-file FBI people.
Jim Comey tainted what is the greatest law enforcement agency in the world. He did that. Thanks to his horrible leadership, his actions and decisions as the director of the FBI. We now have serious doubts in this country as to whether or not equal justice under the law still exists, because of what he and a few at the highest levels of government did in this case.
Here with reaction, he wrote the best-selling book, "The Case Against the Democratic House Impeaching Trump," Professor Alan Dershowitz, and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

By the way, for another night, Professor, I was very proud of the president today rightly acknowledging Golan Heights was Israel's territory, like many presidents have promised Jerusalem, the capital, never followed through. This president did.
Let me ask you about, Jim Comey --
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL EMERITUS PROFESSOR: He absolutely did and I had an opportunity to talk to the president a couple weeks ago about this and to explain to him how you don't give back a battleship that you captured from an enemy who is going to use it to fire at you. The Golan Heights is a battleship and you don't give it to Syria and Iran. So, he did a great thing. Congratulations to him for doing what other presidents should have done first.
HANNITY: They should have, and it shows once again he's bold. He keeps his word. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But let me go to this issue. So, we know he signed the first warrant. We are told by Nunes and Grassley and Graham, the bulk of information in the application was the phony Clinton paid for Russian dossier that Steele doesn't stand behind. Then in January, that would mean what Rod Rosenstein said, consequences if you don't tell the court. He didn't tell the court she paid for it.
Is that a fraud on the court? And why three months later did he tell President-elect Trump the opposite?
DERSHOWITZ: I think it is a fraud on the court and I think the court ought to look into holding the people who misled them in contempt. You know, the court is a trusted institution. They handle these applications ex parte, no opportunity for the other side to present opposing points of view. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, they depend on the credibility and the honesty of people presenting these warrant applications to them. I think they should have been told the source of this material. They should have been told that even the person who wrote it doesn't now stand behind it, and they were misled.
I don't think they would've granted that warrant if they had been told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
HANNITY: It's a lie by omission, Pam Bondi. How important a detail is it that Hillary paid for it and they didn't put that in there? How important is it that he is saying he verified something that is totally unverifiable?
PAM BONDI, FORMER FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: It's completely relevant and important and crucial, and as Professor Dershowitz said, as a prosecutor, I've done many, many state warrants and it's one of the most important things you can do as a prosecutor because it's your reputation on the line. You are swearing by affidavit what you are saying is true to the best of your knowledge.
And I think Comey is in trouble. I think he's going on a very poor offense now, trying to play offense. He's in trouble and I think Bill Barr is going to look at that and again, we love the great men and women of the FBI, 99 percent of them. It's these few that are doing a horrible, horrible disservice to all the great men and women.
HANNITY: I come from a law-enforcement family, Pam. My mom was a prison guard for 25 years. My dad, so many of my relatives were cops.
But the two deity in the family were my grandfather's brothers two sons, they were in the FBI. Deity, I mean, wow, it was like they were the highest of the high and I don't want others tainted by this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Professor --
BONDI: Exactly, nor does the president.
HANNITY: No, do you see a crime here, Pam? And then I will go to Professor Dershowitz.
BONDI: I see a very potential crime. I know that Bill Barr has got to look into. We know Mueller's not going to. We know Robert Mueller's not going to. We know that the report is going to go out.
I agree with the president that it should be released and I believe Bill Barr will release the report. That's totally up to him, but it's so important for the American people to see it, because all the horrible things they've said about the president that are not true. There was no collusion.
These have got to be released to the public and, yes, I think additional investigations have got to take place, as you have always said with Hillary Clinton, with Comey, and with many others, not many others, but the top tier in the FBI. Absolutely, Sean.
HANNITY: Professor, you are a great defense attorney. You really are. I want to call attention to the piece on thewallstreetjournal.com. "I want to be investigated by the FBI", which shows your character and the person I've known all the years that you are even though we might have political disagreements.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But as good as an attorney as you are and, Pam, and if I hired you, after I deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails and I leak government information and, oh, then I deleted my hard drive completely and busted up my devices, I would bet you couldn't keep me out of jail. Sorry. As good as you are.
(CROSSTALK)
DERSHOWITZ: I would try. I would certainly try. That's the job of the defense attorney and the job of the defense attorney is to fight for his client --
HANNITY: What are the odds I would get away with it?
DERSHOWITZ: That's what I do.
HANNITY: What are the odds I would get away with it?
DERSHOWITZ: If you had me as your lawyer, pretty good.

BONDI: Well, if I was a prosecutor, probably not.
HANNITY: Yes, Pam is a prosecutor.
DERSHOWITZ: That would be a good conflict. Pam as a prosecutor and me as a defense attorney. Let's have a moot court and see who wins.
HANNITY: I would hire a dream team. Joe diGenova, Sekulow, I would get all of you into this. So --
DERSHOWITZ: Right.
HANNITY: Thank you both.
Important information tonight, and I hope America now sees what went on here. A lot of bad stuff. But not the FBI rank-and-file. This was not them.

All right. President Trump stands up for free speech on college campuses, thankfully. Trace Gallagher with the report.
Also, the ever-brilliant Victor Davis Hanson.
And the great one, Mark Levin, is back. He is fired up. It's been, like, three months. He's coming back tonight.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. The president signed an executive order today in an effort to enforce freedom of speech, which you would think would be paramount on college campuses. You know, the free, open exchange of ideas, ideals, and opinions.
Well, joining us live with the very latest from our West Coast newsroom tonight, Fox News correspondent Trace Gallagher.
Important issue, Trace. And we know what goes on college campuses. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and the president said, Sean, during the conservative w political action conference that he would sign the campus free-speech directive and today he made it official, saying people who are confident in their beliefs don't censor others. Failing to comply with this order comes with a list of penalties including the loss of federal research dollars, although the White House did not provide specific examples of how the punishment would exactly work.
University of California president and former homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, called the order unnecessary, quote: The University of California is ground zero for robust exchanges of ideas and differing viewpoints. Well, tell that to right-wing speaker Milo Yiannopoulos, whose speech at UC-Berkeley was canceled because of safety concerns. And conservative activist Hayden Williams didn't exactly feel the robust exchange of ideas when he was attacked at Berkeley while trying to recruit conservative students.
You have to remember, young Republicans have complained for years that universities have been given wide latitude to cancel conservative speakers by citing things like security costs and threats of violence -- Sean.
HANNITY: All right. Trace Gallagher in our West Coast newsroom tonight. Thank you as always. Here with reaction, author of the brand-new book, "The Case for Trump," senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, frankly a genius professor in his own right, historian Victor Davis Hanson is with us.
You know, I look at how conservatives are treated on college campuses. It's amazing to me because supposedly, you know, you have open-minded liberal academia. They say that they are for free speech but not conservative speech. Why is there this inordinate fear of just allowing somebody to give a different point of view?
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW: I think universities think that the community, religion, the country at large is biased so that they are justified in being biased on their own right. So they feel they can be propagandistic rather than intuitive and inductive and that balances out right wing America.
But, Sean, there's no Fifth Amendment on campus if you are accused of harassment. There is no presumption of innocence, due process, cross examination. If you and I were to talk about global warming in a way that wasn't politically correct, I don't think we would get free-speech protection.

If we take a loan out, we are not subject to the same information that we are when we buy a car. Universities just assume the federal government will protect that loan and therefore they can jack up tuition above the rate of inflation.
So, this is a scab that we have torn off and we look at the wound beneath and, my God, it's been festering for a long time.
HANNITY: You know --
HANSON: And there is --
HANNITY: Yes?
HANSON: It's been given exemption from the normal audit because of their progressive, loud virtue signaling. And it's a--

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANSON: --pastime to cross-examine everything they do.
HANNITY: I want to ask you this. As a conservative, I've debated liberals for years. And frankly, it's gotten too frustrating at times, as so many people are locked into ideology and - but this is just the facts. JFK believed in cutting the top marginal rates and the economy boomed. Ronald Reagan doubled revenues to the government, 21.5 million new jobs are created. 13 million more Americans under Obama were on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty after eight years. Almost 6 million jobs Trump has created. Again, cutting taxes, deregulation.
Why don't we just learn the lesson that that conservatism, that limited- government works and it works for everybody instead of now a desire of a 70 percent top marginal rate for individuals, 90 percent for corporations?
HANSON: I think it's because of liberal progressive minefields, Sean, that they would all rather be collectively poor if there was no inequality than having some inequality and everybody being better off. And that's - and that's very ironic, because with this admittance scandal, we've seen about very willful liberal people who virtue signal about privilege inequality. They don't live by the consequences of their own ideology. They are buying admittances for their children that denies children of a welder in Bakersfield that opportunity.
And if you turn over the rock of college admittances, you're going to see some pretty frightening thing about admittance based on money given and one's race and all sorts of improper non-ethical mechanisms to brand your child or to get him into school as if that's going to help his career by having a good cheap bag with a BA on it and - from a Harvard or Stanford or Yale.
HANNITY: You look at Harvard. Harvard, $37 billion endowment. Wow! And I don't understand people want to help schools in higher education. I'm--
HANSON: Yeah.

HANNITY: I've done it myself over the years. But - all right. Victor Davis Hanson, thank you. We appreciate it.
All right. Buckle up. It's been months since The Great One, Mark Levin, has been on his program. He will talk about the Democratic's latest insane, wild proposals. And later, you're going to meet a man named Matthew Charles. He was the first person freed from prison because President Trump kept another promise, prison reform that so many other presidents didn't keep that promise. But he's having a hard time finding a place to live. We want to help him. Kim Kardashian is helping him. We'll explain.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you support getting rid of the Electoral College?
PETE BUTTIGIEG, MAYOR OF SOUTH BEND, INDIANA: Absolutely. It's got to go.
REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I myself have always been for lowering the voting age to 16. I think it's really important to capture kids when they are in high school, when they're interested in all of this.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What if there were five justices selected by Democrats, five justices selected by Republicans, and those 10 then picked five more justices, independent of those who chose the first 10?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Just a small glimpse of how radical, out-of-touch these new crop of 2020 Democrats have become.
All right. Joining us now to talk about that and much more is The Great One, I call him. He is the host of Life, Liberty & Levin, number one show, 10:00 p.m., Sundays, right here on Fox and LevinTV.
Mark, you look at our framers, you go back to 1787, and this is your wheelhouse. 16-year-olds to vote. They want to stack the Supreme Court with activist justices, and let's get rid of the Electoral College. So New York and New Jersey and Illinois and California will elect every President going forward. Dying to get your reaction on that and the New Green Deal.
MARK LEVIN, LIFE, LIBERY & LEVIN HOST: Sean, this is one of the reasons I oppose legalizing pot because obviously we have a problem on Capitol Hill. Look, the greatest threat to our constitution and economic system isn't any foreign power. It's the Democrat Party. It's the leftists within the Democrat Party because they use our liberty and our constitution, destroy our liberty and our constitution. And they're very good at it.
Look at this. You name some of them. They want to destroy the Electoral College. Now what would that mean? Why do we have an Electoral College? We have an Electoral College. And why do I have to explain this to people who want to run for President of the United States? Because there were states which had smaller populations that were not going to join the union if the most populous states were going to control the entire country.
We have an Electoral College that keeps peace in this nation. We've a farm belt that's less populated than urban areas. We have an energy sector that's less populated than urban areas. We don't want to be ruled by New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. We should all have a role in this. We are republic. We are not a democracy. We're not a mobocracy.
And what you see here, these aren't people running under the Democrat Party, they're running under the mob party. They want to get rid of the Electoral College. Well, how do they intend to - just think about this. If they want to get rid of the Electoral College, you have to amend the constitution. You only need 13 states to say no. You think there's 13 states that will say no? I think there's 20 states that will say no.
So they're absolute illiterates when it comes to the constitution. They want to pack the Supreme Court. Now we tried this. Franklin Roosevelt tried it. You know who stopped him? His own Vice President and the Democratic Party. They want to pack the Supreme Court. Why? Because they want to fix the outcome. They want to fix the outcome of elections. They want to fix the outcome of court decisions. This is very good banana republic of the Democrat Party.
They want to allow illegal aliens to vote. But why wait for them to come 1,000 miles into the United States? Why don't we send absentee balance to 7 billion people all over the world, tell them you don't need to struggle to get to the United States, you can just vote in our elections?
They want to lower the voting age to 16. Why not lower it to 12 or 14 or 15? How stupid is that? I mean, they raised the age for booze, they raised the age for cigarettes to 21. You - but at 16 you're going to help pick our President? Why are they doing that? Because they indoctrinate all these kids in high school and so forth, and they know how they're going to vote, Democrat. Every decision they make or everything they espouse is about power, controlling power.
Do you think if we had a million illegal immigrants coming across the border and 75 percent of them one day become United States citizens who would vote Republican? Do you think they would want to secure the southern border? You bet they would. They'd have sniper towers all over the place. They don't want Republicans coming into this country. The second amendment.
Now we have a knucklehead running for President who says we should actually start to confiscate weapons. The first amendment. They call this voter reform where they want to take away free speech. Now, we're only three or four weeks into this selection, and the kooks are in full display.
What about our economy? Nationalize energy. Nationalize energy? We're finally energy-independent and they want to destroy it. Nationalize health care. Single-payer. Wealth tax, 70 to 90 percent marginal tax rate. A VAT tax, free college, guaranteed minimum income from birth, guaranteed federal job, three months of taxpayer-financed family leave, expand social security while the trustee say it's bankrupt in 2034. That's the genius Bernie Sanders, by the way.
Eliminate existing border fences. That's Beto O'dork (ph), right there. Eliminate ICE. Reinstate the Iran nuclear deal. Cut military funding. And while we're at it, impeach the President, indict the President, indict the President's children, and let's go ahead and impeach Associate Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh. That is quite a policy planned that the Democrats have, and we're only three or four weeks into this.
HANNITY: Mark, you did forget one thing. And I never like to correct you because you're always right. During birth and after-birth abortion.
LEVIN: Oh, right.
HANNITY: Deliver the baby--
LEVIN: You're right.
HANNITY: --make sure the baby is comfortable, then let the mother decide. Wow! Did you ever think--
LEVIN: And look--
HANNITY: --in all your years you would hear this even be it all these things you mentioned ever--
LEVIN: No.
HANNITY: --being seriously discussed that 100 Democrats in Congress supporting this and 2020 candidates?
LEVIN: Listen to how crazy these people are. We're going to eliminate straws to save the wealth, but infanticide of human beings is a right, a choice between a mother and a doctor. No, it's not.
I just want to say one thing, before we go, to the President of the United States.
Thank you. Thank you for being a statesman. What you've done in Israel will be remembered for 1,000 years. The Golan Heights, moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, taking on the terrorists in the Hamas and the Palestinian Liberation Organization office you closed and the PLA, shredding the Iran deal, which was a threat to the United States as well as our allies, the Gulf Arab states and the Israelis too.
I mean, honestly, we have four Democrats running for President. Elizabeth Warren, Julian Castro, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, none of them will speak at AIPAC, which is a moderate left-of-center organization that supports Israel. That's how hardcore the Democrats have become, anti- Israel.
And when they have an anti-semite among them, they can't even pass a resolution specifically condemning the anti-semite by name. And yet the number-three Democrat in the House of Representatives yet again in that party compare the President of the United States to Adolf Hitler. This is a sick party. These are sick people running for President of the United States. There is no other explanation for this.
HANNITY: Mark Levin, we've missed you for three months. Please come back a little more regularly. We - amazing commentary tonight. Thank you for that.
Don't forget, Mark's show, Life, Liberty & Levin, Sunday night, 10:00 Eastern, number one show, on Sunday nights here at Fox.
When we come back, an incredible personal story. Our next guest was freed from prison. Why? Because the President kept another promise, and that's prison reform that no other President could get through the promise. Wait until you hear what Kim Kardashian is doing to help this man start his life, a compelling story, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT: In 1996, at the age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow inmates. Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Matthew Charles being recognized by the President in his State of the Union address earlier this year. Now, despite a very inspiring story of redemption, perseverance, he is still facing major hurdles due to his criminal record, like not being able to rent an apartment.
Now, famous actress and, I guess, famous person Kim Kardashian, she has now offered to pay his rent upfront for five years, as she continues to be a major voice in the prison reform movement, as she was with Alice Johnson who we've had on this program.
Joining us now is Matthew Charles.
Sir, thank you for being on the program. Wow! 40 Bible studies, 21 years in jail, and you get introduced to the country by the President. He got something done that no other President got done, that tried before him. How do you feel?
MATTHEW CHARLES, FIRST BENEFICIARY OF THE FIRST STEP ACT: I feel wonderful and grateful, sir.
HANNITY: I think - 40 Bible studies. I think I'm going to - I'm going to be the one asking you for the prayers. How did you change? I watched - well, you saw Alice Marie Johnson when she came out of prison and she embraced her family and said, "Thank you, America, for giving me a second chance, I won't let you down." Your story seems exactly like hers. You changed for the better in prison. How?
CHARLES: Prior to me going into (inaudible) prison and before sentencing, I ended up accepting that Lord Jesus Christ is my personal savior. And that commitment that I made to God as well as his spirit changed me inwardly that reflected outwardly.
HANNITY: Kim Kardashian personally lobbied on behalf of Alice Marie Johnson and for this legislation. And you're the first person released. She's offered to pay five years upfront for your rent, but you're having a problem getting a place. Why?
CHARLES: Because they're looking at it from the perspective of I still have a felony background and no credit. I was gone for two decades and therefore my credit report came back with no score, and the fact that I was incarcerated for 22 years, just that felony conviction alone bars me from most housing.
HANNITY: Yeah. Now, as I understand it, Kim has put up that if anybody lives in your area - you live in Tennessee, right?
CHARLES: Nashville, yes, sir.
HANNITY: In music city. Beautiful place, by the way.
CHARLES: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
HANNITY: To contact her, I'll put that up on my website, hannity.com. How has it been when you got out? We'll put it up right there. It's Kim Kardashian West. I think - what does it say? @kimkardashian, I think. I don't - I can't - I can't read it. But how is it - now that you're free, what do you want to do with your life?
CHARLES: I want to continue to speak about criminal justice reform. During my period of incarceration, there are a lot of people serving extensive sentences for non-violent offenses, as well as when I got saved, God placed it in my heart to help the poor and homeless and single-parent families. So I know that that's there. And the platform, the opportunity has availed itself for me to be also able to speak about criminal justice reform and try to see real changes made.
HANNITY: Even conservative - I've supported this legislation. And I've got to tell you, I was a--
CHARLES: Thank you, sir.
HANNITY: --a hard-line guy on law and justice over the years. There's a project that was headed up by Barry Scheck, where the - the Innocence Project. And when he showed so many people on death row that were not guilty, unless there's video, incontrovertible evidence, I won't support the death penalty unless it's that severe. We've gotten it so wrong and in your case. What is the best thing the country can do to help people like yourself when they get out? Like, for example, do you need a job? Do you need other support?
CHARLES: I would say that just zero tolerance that they have to rent houses as well as toward certain jobs, understand that a job that requires a security clearance, person coming out of federal prison or state prison is not going to be given that job, but some jobs, yes, those barriers that exist that society needs to remove our needs to be legislated because there are certain things that people that are incarcerated such as myself, once we're released, we can't overcome those hurdles because there's absolutely nothing we can do while incarcerated to make someone want to rent their apartment or their house to us once we're released.
HANNITY: Matthew Charles, I'm so happy for you. I wish you all Godspeed, best wishes. It's @kimkardashian where all the information is. If you live in Nashville and you can help out Matthew and his family, it would be awesome. We'll put it on hannity.com. And we wish you the very best in life. Great story. Good thing that the President got done.
When we come back, our Villain of the Day predicts a shocking winner in the next Presidential election. You won't believe it. Straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Our Villain of the Day, well, he is sort of like an NBC Republican, really a liberal, our old friend, Joe Scarborough. I don't hate Joe and Mika. We've had a little feud going on over the years. He just can't stop himself. He has to bash Trump every second of every day, but that's the network he works for. He wants his job. So he recently gave, well, his favorite candidate that he thinks will beat Donald Trump in 2020 if he decides to run. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE SCARBOROUGH, CO-HOST OF MORNING JOE, MSNBC: John Kerry, if he ran, would win. That's all I'm going to say. It's all I'm to say.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right. After--
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's pretty impressive to say that.
SCARBOROUGH: He would be the 46th President of the United States if he announced today he was running.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: I voted for the 87 billion before voting (ph) against him. All right, we'll never be the hate-Trump media. Let not you heart be troubled.
