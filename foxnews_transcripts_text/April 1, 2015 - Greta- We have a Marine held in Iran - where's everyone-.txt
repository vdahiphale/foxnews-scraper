Let's all go "Off the Record" for minute. Why is it just Montel Williams? Where is everyone?
We have a US Marine veteran Amir Hekmati being head by Iran in their worst prison, known for torture, and the only one I hear talking about it and showing outrage is Marine veteran Montel Williams. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {

        }
      
MONTEL WILLIAMS, TALK SHOW HOST: He has been put in 3 by 3 cells. He has been whipped on his feet. He has been addicted to drugs so that they can torture him through his withdrawal. This has been happening for three and a half years and there is not a person in this country knows that a US Marine has been sitting there in prison this long. I think this is an abomination. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

It's bad enough that we have a Marine veteran sitting in an Iranian prison left behind, but now we are leaving Montel behind. We should all be standing by and with Montel, helping him. Where is everyone? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The media is powerful. And unless there is enormous spotlight put on this Marine and, yes, also on Christian pastor Saeed Abedino, who's also held in the same Iranian prison just for being a Christian, they are completely forgotten, just left behind.
I'm not suggesting getting them out is easy. It is not. Iran is awful. The job of the media should include putting the spotlight on our fellow Americans being held in hostile territory, especially a Marine who has fought for us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
P.S., if I were in trouble, I would want Montel watching my back. How about you? That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
