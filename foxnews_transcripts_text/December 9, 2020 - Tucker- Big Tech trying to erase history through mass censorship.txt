TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. It is official, you are no longer allowed to mention voter fraudin public. If you don't believe us, go ahead and try it. Google willsilence you. In other words, the very people who rigged this election, withunprecedented mass censorship of the entire country are now covering theirtracks by erasing history, and imposing even more restrictive censorship onthe American population. Dystopia anyone? We will have more on this unfolding nightmare of tech totalitarianism injust a minute. But first for you, a FOX News alert. Joe Biden's transitionteam has just released a statement. It is attributed to Hunter Biden and itreads this way. Quote, "I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney'sOffice in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they areinvestigating my tax affairs. I take this matter very seriously, but I amconfident that a professional and objective review of these matters willdemonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, includingwith the benefit of professional tax advisors," end quote. Well, a few of us knew that already, to be honest. Shortly before lastmonth's election, we reported on this show that Federal prosecutors hadopened a criminal investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings withChina among other countries. We knew that was true, which is why we said it. Other news organizationsknew it was true, too, but they didn't say it. They said nothing. They hid that news -- critically relevant news -- from their readers andtheir viewers. They didn't want to hurt Joe Biden's chances of gettingelected. The Justice Department itself refused to confirm the existence of thatinvestigation for fear of being accused of political interference. So goinginto Election Day, most Americans had no idea any of this was going on. Allthey knew was that Joe Biden had dismissed the entire thing as a Russianplot, and that large numbers of senior officials in the so-calledintelligence community agreed with that assessment. That's what Joe Bidensaid at the debate. Again, what we're about to play for you is the sum total of informationthat most voters in this country got about the Biden family's businessdealings with China in the weeks before they made up their minds in thiselection. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  There are 50 formerNational Intelligence folks who said that what he is accusing me of is aRussian plant. They have said that this has all of the -- four -- fiveformer heads of the C.I.A., both parties say what he is saying is a bunchof garbage. Nobody believes it, except him. Him and his good friend, RudyGiuliani. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Oh, so 50 former Intelligence folks have decided that it'sRussian garbage. It's just more Slavic disinformation. Just another exampleof the Kremlin interfering in our sacred democracy. The Intel community hasdecided that so just throw it in the circular file. Well, that's a familiar line. You've heard it many times before. In fact,you've heard it every day for years. Russia. Yet, somehow you haven't heardit much recently. In fact, for about a month and eight days to be exact. Democrats have about zero interest in highlighting Russian meddling in thiselection. Assuming there was any Russian meddling, it was not veryeffective. Apparently, Vladimir Putin let down his closest friend just when itcounted, poignant. In fact, the whole topic of foreign interference nolonger seems like a priority for the Democratic Party. Have you noticed?Why? Because it's now clear to everyone whether they are willing to admitit or not, that the real threat to this country is not Russia, it hasn'tbeen Russia for 30 years since the summer of 1991, when the Soviet Unioncollapsed, and to claim otherwise is absurd, and was always absurd. The truth is that the real threat we face as a country is from thecommunist government of China, which and everyone knows this, too, has longbeen in bed with our Democratic elites, in some cases, literally in bed.And yes, we're looking at you, Eric Swalwell, you lying creep. More on himin just a minute. But back to tonight's news on the Biden family. How do we know for surethat Hunter Biden is under Federal investigation? Where did the news comefrom? Well, it came directly from the Biden transition team. They're the ones whotold us. The confirmation of this investigation was not leaked to "The NewYork Times." It came right from the top of the Democratic Party. In fact, in tonight's statement, it included a message from Joe Bidenhimself, affirming that he is quote, "deeply proud of his son." Joe Biden didn't specify why he was so gosh darn proud of Hunter Biden.Maybe federal investigations are a rite of passage in the Biden family, wecan only speculate. We can be pretty sure that Joe Biden didn't want to issue the statement inthe first place. Why would he? Who would want to issue it? He issued itbecause he was pushed. By whom? And for what purpose was he pushed? That'sthe question tonight. Now, we don't know the answer to that. We do know that there are powerfulforces within the Democratic Party that do not like Joe Biden. They believeJoe Biden is too male and too white and too wedded to the old ways, weddedto politics, as it used to be back when there was a functioningConstitution that provided checks and balances on power. People like that would like to displace Joe Biden and get right to the partof the story where Kamala Harris and her sponsors at Google run the UnitedStates of America, and it is hard to believe they are going to wait fouryears to do that. We'll see. You heard it here first. According to what we've learned tonight from the statement, theinvestigation into Hunter Biden is not related to his drug use, weconfirmed that as well. Instead, the investigation is based in part onsuspicious activity reports on foreign transactions. Now, keep in mind, in the weeks before the election, you were not allowedto go on Twitter or Facebook and discuss those suspicious foreigntransactions. You couldn't talk about them even after Hunter Biden's business associates,people like Tony Bobulinski came forward in public with evidence that thosewere real. You had to be quiet and not tell your neighbors about any of it.In case your neighbors might be tempted not to vote for Joe Biden once theylearned it. And they might have been tempted not to vote for Joe Biden hadthey known. On this show, Tony Bobulinski revealed that Hunter Biden made deals withgroups connected directly to the Communist Party of China and he made thosedeals with the blessing of his father, explicitly, the former VicePresident Joe Biden, who himself was profiting from those deals directly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  The former Vice President has said he had no knowledge whatsoeverof his son's business dealings and was not involved in them at all. Butthis sounds like direct involvement in them. TONY BOBULINSKI, FORMER BUSINESS AFFILIATE OF HUNTER BIDEN:  Yes, that's ablatant lie. When he states that that is a blatant lie. Obviously, the world is aware that I attended the debate last Thursday, andin that debate, he made a specific statement around questions around thisfrom the President. And I'll be honest with you, I almost stood up andscreamed "liar" and walked out because I was shocked that after four daysor five days that they prepped for this, that the Biden family is takingthat position to the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Again, that was Tony Bobulinski who is in business with HunterBiden, who met with Joe Biden to discuss that business with China. That'swhat he said on camera. And at the time, they called it a conspiracy theory. CNN rolled its eyesliterally. They dismissed it as Russian disinformation. Most media outletsdeemed unworthy of mentioning at all. Now it turns out, all of them were lying. Again, if you're looking forelection rigging, look no further. That's what this is. They kept information from the public in order to influence the outcome ofthe election. They rigged it. A few good reporters have been vindicated tonight, starting with the tough,but beleaguered staff of "The New York Post" who took a massive amount ofcrap for telling the truth. Miranda Devine is among them. She works at "The New York Post" and shejoins us tonight. Miranda, thanks so much for coming back on the show. So a lot of the things that you suggested in our conversations and inpieces that you wrote for "The New York Post," turned out to be vindicatedby the Biden transition team. How does that feel? MIRANDA DEVINE, COLUMNIST, "THE NEW YORK POST":  Well, it is so frustratingand the timing, of course of that peculiar statement today is perfect,because it comes a month after the election. So there's no realconsequences for Joe Biden. He just -- it's damage control. He throws out the garbage before Christmaswhen no one is really paying any attention. And I mean, it's interestingthat Hunter Biden has made this statement, and it's quite peculiar that ithas been released by the Biden-Harris presidential transition team. You know, an official press release with Joe Biden adding his little pleafor sympathy, which he has used so cynically and successfully in the pastto try and shield his family's dodgy business dealings overseas by youknow, saying, "Oh, my poor son, Hunter has a drug problem." Well, that justwon't wash. And, you know, I think also that the timing of this statement coming justone day after a really damning report from two Senate Committees HomelandSecurity and Finance Committees with plenty of evidence including fromHunter Biden's laptop and from Tony Bobulinski's revelations, which pointsto an influence peddling scheme being run by the Biden family around theworld, but most dangerously, in China, and China is our number one nationalsecurity threat. And we now have a man who is compromised by China, who is heading into theWhite House next month. CARLSON:  What do you make, and by the way, you make such a good pointabout the cynicism behind his - my son is a drug problem, be nice. Millionsof Americans have had drug problems, they don't get a pass. No one shouldget a pass for that. But let me ask you, what do you make of the fact that this story is beingcarried by media outlets that just a month ago refused even to acknowledgethat this was a story? DEVINE:  Well, they buried it. I mean, they very successfully suppressed itwith the help of Big Tech. But now, of course, it doesn't matter becauseJoe Biden, as far as they are concerned, has won the election. He doesn'tneed that kind of suppression of a story, so they'll report just what theBidens want them to report and then move on, I'm sure. And it just shows that our story was correct and your stories were correctduring the election campaign, but at that time, they were dangerous toBiden's re-election efforts. And we know that those suppression effortsworked, because there are polls showing that almost half of Joe Biden'svoters had no idea about the Hunter Biden laptop story. And 10 percent ofthem would have changed their vote, if they had known and that's inbattleground states, it would have changed the result of the election. CARLSON:  It's so funny. You see all of these Republicans jumping up anddown about voter fraud, there was voter fraud. There's no doubt oldfashioned voter fraud. But this is election rigging that took place inpublic by the Big Tech companies, and they are not saying anything aboutit. So it tells you something about their sincerity, I would say. I can'tresist editorializing. Miranda Devine, great to see you. I hope you'll come back. DEVINE:  Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON:  Speaking of censorship and rigging the election, in a blog posttoday, YouTube owned by Google vowed that its teams are working around theclock to stop what it called harmful misinformation and harmful content. They said they are deeply concerned about quote, "making sure our platformisn't abused to incite real world harm." Now what does that mean exactlycoming from a company that has caused so much quote "real world harm"? Well, YouTube explained, quote, "We will start removing any piece ofcontent uploaded today or any time after that misleads people by allegingthat widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020presidential election." The irony here is enough to make you dizzy. The company that rigged theelection, by suppressing legitimate information in order to influence theoutcome of the election, more effectively than any foreign government couldever do is now telling us to preserve our faith in the election, they needto censor us more. So how exactly are election related videos causing harm? Well, YouTubedoesn't explain that they would cause harm to YouTube's reputation andGoogle's reputation much deserved. We need to break this company up likeimmediately. But YouTube does go on to boast that its censorship campaign has alreadybeen underway for quite some time, quote, "Since September, we'veterminated over 8,000 channels and thousands of harmful and misleadingelection related videos for violating our existing policies." They used theword "terminated" by the way. That's not creepy or anything. Continuing the quote, "Over 77 percent of those removed videos were takendown before they had a hundred views." What in the world is going on here?Ask rational questions and you reach a dead end because there are norational answers. This is just flat out totalitarian control over thepopulation. So you can stream the film series "Loose Change" in its entirety onYouTube. It's not a hidden video, it pops up quickly in search results andappears high up on the page. The premise of that film is that the September11 terror attacks were a false flag operation and that remote controlleddrones not passenger planes hit the Twin Towers. YouTube's algorithms, one that can smite election videos before they manageto get a hundred views haven't shut that down. There's a lot of stuff onthere, by the way, on YouTube that's not only unsupportable, but fullycrazy. You can watch thousands of videos explaining how Russia hacked our votingmachines or mind controlled thousands of Americans with Facebook memes.That's how dumb we are. A Facebook meme can take over your brain. One YouTube video from PBS today, which we pay for by the way andshouldn't, goes into great detail about how Russia quote "swung the 2016election." You're paying for that crap, state media. It's not true, butwhether it's true or not, isn't the point. You think Google cares whetherit's true? No. They care whether it has the right political message. Thatdoes, so they allow it. There's another motivation here by the way, beyond helping their team,Silicon Valley is trying to destroy the evidence of their own misdeeds. Nosingle group perpetuated more fraud on last month's election than the techbillionaires who are now telling us there was no fraud at all. Harmeet Dillon is a Civil Rights attorney. She is one of the most doggedFirst Amendment lawyers, there are a very few left in this country andwe're proud to have her on tonight. Harmeet, this is enough to make you feel like, wow, things are fallingapart. If they can hide the evidence of their own misdeeds, what can't theydo? HARMEET DHILLON, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, LAWYERS FOR TRUMP:  Well, it is a newdevelopment, Tucker, that they are hiding the evidence of their ownmisdeeds, but anybody who has been watching what Google and the other BigTech giants have been doing for years is not surprised that theiralgorithms are so on point that they are able to, as you pointed out, smitethe very video before it even lands in a hundred computer inboxes and, andhow they do that as for years, they've been writing these algorithms whichtreat different things differently. So if you want to, for example, put out an anti-Semitic video or post onTwitter, they treat that differently than an anti-Muslim video. This isfrom evidence that has been leaked out of YouTube by its programmers. And you know, when you look at this situation, you understand, anybodywho's been there that for years, for 3.9 years, they have allowed falseinformation concerning the 2016 election to flourish, thrive and propagateand that will continue for years to come. When you talk about the harm of an election and any misinformation, what'sthe harm here? The election has already occurred. So why are they sodesperate to eliminate the evidence and eliminate discussion of it? CARLSON:  Exactly. DHILLON:  You pointed out one, some of these tech companies, Facebook hasbeen known to have sent reminders to vote or reminders to register only toDemocrats right before the election. I would argue that's a violation ofthe Federal Election Commission regulations. And you know, somebody needsto take that up. But they want to shame people, they want to shame all these YouTubecreators who make their living off of being on that channel, and maybe theyshould consider that, they want to shame them from ever saying anythingthat violates the orthodoxy. It is a Pavlovian response that they're trying to elicit here to keep youaway from the danger wire, keep you away from the electrical fence. So -- and people will do that, because people's livelihoods depend onthose, and nobody wants to be called a crazy person or somebody who wasbanned from YouTube. There's no pride in that and there goes your revenue. So this is about the next election and the next election. These are tacticsthat Google appears to have learned from its, you know, cash cow in China.They've been developing AI and intelligence over there. And in China,people are followed around with these social credit score. So we don't want to see that in here in America, but we're seeing it rightnow. Tucker, and it's very scary. CARLSON:  It's horrifying. Harmeet Dhillon, thanks for joining us tonight. DHILLON:  Thank you. CARLSON:  The message in case you're missing it, it is completely true, isthat Google in its present state is incompatible with our democracy. Youcan't have a democracy if Google exists as it does now. It's that simple. Well, also tonight, we're learning a lot more about Congressman EricSwalwell of California, his personal relationship with a Chinese spy. Someof the details of that relationship are apparently are so salacious,possibly so weird, that they're classified. But Mark Steyn is not fazed at all. He joins us to share what he haslearned about Congressman Eric Swalwell's personal relationship with aChinese spy, which is real. Straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  We learned yesterday that Congressman Eric Swalwell ofCalifornia, a very high profile though young Member of Congress who has gota seat on the Intel Committee carried on a personal relationship with aChinese spy called Christine Fang. But if you're wondering who is the real culprit here, who is really atfault for this obvious breach of our national security? Rest assured it'snot the government of China, it is not Christine Fang. It's definitely notEric Swalwell. He's blameless. No, according to Eric Swalwell, here iswhose fault it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA):  The wrongdoing here, Jim, is that at the sametime the story was being leaked out is the time that I was working onimpeachment on the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. And if this is a country where people who criticize the President are goingto have law enforcement information weaponized against them, then that'snot a country that any of us want to live in, and I hope it is investigatedas to who leaked this information. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  He doesn't want to live in a country where you can't sleep withChinese spies or let them put interns in your office. I don't want to --that's not -- that's not the America Eric Swalwell knows. Well, to be fair to Eric Swalwell, of course we want to be, he has beenpretty consistent on this point. Spending personal time with Chinese spieshas never been an issue for him or for anyone else in the Democratic Party.That's pretty common. But come within six feet of a Russian spy, that's where Eric Swalwell drawsthe line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SWALWELL:  Stated plainly, the President's son met with a Russian spy. Wenow have the best evidence of that. In our minority report, the Democratsput out that Ms. Veselnitskaya was going all over the world and bumpinginto Dana Rohrabacher, which is a sign of a spy, someone who tries tocreate, you know, a coincidence encounter. And now we know that she was working at the behest of the Russiangovernment. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Oh, okay. Just so you know the standards, ladies and gentlemen,get a pen. The President's son bumped into someone from Russia, therefore,he is compromised. Well, given that, we asked Eric Swalwell's office whether the Congressmanever bumped into the Chinese spy and kept bumping, if you know what wemean? They responded with the following statement, quote, "To protectinformation that might be classified, Swalwell will not participate in yourstory." So whether Eric Swalwell bumped into the Chinese spy repeatedly isclassified. Mark Steyn is a bestselling author and an expert on classifiedsexual encounters. He joins us tonight to declassify the story. Mark Steyn, it is great to see you. What do you make of Eric Swalwell'sclassification standards here? MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST:  Well, yes, I hadn't actually thoughtthat bumping into Dana Rohrabacher is actually the very definition of aspy. But on that basis, bumpity-bumpity-bumpity-bumpity bumper thing, Ithink it was a dance craze in the 70s called doing-a-bump. He was doing the bump with this gal all over town, and it's tempting to becomical about it. I mean, the actual F.B.I. eavesdropping where she ismaking out with that Ohio mayor in the car, and the mayor says, "Why areyou interested in me? I'm 87 years old, and I don't seem your type." Andshe says, "Well, I'm interested in improving my English." I believe that actually is from the pre-credit sequence of the 007 film,"The Spy Who Loved Me," where Roger Moore is putting it to the Sovietdouble agent and she says she's always wanted to improve her facility withthe English tongue. So there is an aspect of this that is just drawn from the most absurdheightened notions of a spy drama, but at core, there's something seriousgoing on. The F.B.I., for example, when they find out she is a spy, why don't theyturn her? Why don't they just put them in a room in a safe house and say,okay, you're working for us now. Instead, they go to Swalwell and tippedSwalwell off that his bumpity bumping with the Chinese spy has come totheir attention. And he tells her and she leaves the country. That's actually an F.B.I. scandal and a Swalwell scandal. CARLSON:  Well, that's right. STEYN:  And that's interesting to me is we have all these checks andbalances, and none of them work. It's illegal for a foreign national togive a hundred bucks to a presidential campaign. But it's not illegal for aChinese spy to be a bundler for Eric Swalwell and help take him from a nonothing councilman in San Francisco to the literal Manchurian candidate inthe 2020 election. This is a scandal, both for the F.B.I. and for Swalwell, too. CARLSON:  So we know that Christine Fang bundled for Eric Swalwell, theextent to which she bundled is classified. Is there some way we candeclassify this? STEYN:  Well, it isn't classified, is it? I mean, basically, Eric Swalwellis asserting that his bumping and bundling is classified. Now everything isover classified in this country. As you know, there is -- there are over four million people with topsecurity clearances. That's the population in New Zealand, wandering aroundAmerica with top security clearances. It is completely ridiculous. CARLSON:  Exactly. STEYN:  But I can tell you that the very one thing that is not bundled, isEric Swalwell's romantic life. That's not classified. That will be the lastthing to be classified. Everything is classified now, but the one remaining thing that isn'tclassified is Eric Swalwell's sex life. The difference between this and theCold War days you know, the minute this came out and you were linked to anespionage and you are on the Intelligence Committee, you are finished, likeMichael Straight. CARLSON:  Exactly. STEYN:  The American end of the Cambridge spies, he never recovered fromthat. Swalwell is a disgrace. He is on the Intelligence Committee. He hasbeen compromised by the Chinese. And in fact, he embodies the way theDemocrat leadership has been compromised by the Chinese because whatever --when you and Miranda were talking about Hunter Biden's laptop, whatever youthink that laptop discloses about Biden, you have to know Chairman Xi has azillion e-mails and texts even more compromising. CARLSON:  Of course. And Nancy Pelosi defended Eric Swalwell whileremaining on the Intel Committee today. It's hard to believe this ishappening, but it is. Mark Steyn, great to see you. STEYN:  No. Thanks a lot, Tucker. CARLSON:  So obviously, nobody trusts the people who run the countryanymore. But now in the middle of this endemic distrust, they are planningto force you to take the coronavirus vaccine. It's so safe, they have tothreaten you to take it. If they do that, that could lead to a legitimate crisis. Victor DavisHanson is here to explain, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Well, the very same people who scream "my body my choice" and putit on their t-shirts have identified a new cause tonight. A lawmaker in New York is proposing legislation that would quote, "mandatevaccinations" if any of the serfs are foolish enough to refuse to take thenew coronavirus vaccine. What happens if people refuse? We don't know. In New York, it might dependentirely on the color of your skin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY):  This has to be done in a way that protectssocial justice. The healthcare system discriminates against black, brownand poor communities; by effect, you have fewer healthcare facilities inpoorer communities. That is a fact. We want to make sure when we do the vaccine, that it is done in a just andfair and equal way. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So like most rational people, we're not against vaccines, werefor vaccines. The polio vaccine saved millions of children. But in thisvery specific case, let's be clear. If the people in charge force thepopulation to take this vaccine, we can have a legitimate crisis on ourhands in this country. Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. He joinsus tonight with his thoughts on where we might be going. Professor, thanks so much for coming on. What do you make of this? VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION:  Thank you. Well, Ishould say I'm not a doctor, I'm a historian. And I'm 67 and I have a fewhealth issues, so I'll probably eerily take the vaccine. But I think what they're trying to err on is that they want to encouragepeople to get as 70 percent, 80 percent, 90 percent either who have beeninfected with antibodies, but it's not as much as we thought, it's probably30 million. So we've got another 200 million to go, and so we can get so-called, you know, the taboo word, "herd immunity," and that means we'regoing to have to rely on a vaccination. And we didn't think when this thing hit us in March, we thought, well, in10 months, we'll have effective therapeutics that are coming, but they'renot here yet, that will just cure it or we'll have a vaccination early orwe won't have 300,000 dead. So they have to find the fine line, and behind all of this, Tucker is the1976 swine flu epidemic, and that's when we were told that it was going towipe out -- it's going to be another 1918. It started in a military base.Legionnaires' disease was attributed to it. We had to rush a vaccine. Werushed a vaccine in nine or 10 months. I got it. I remember getting it and being very ill as a student from it forabout 10 days, and it made a lot of people sick. In fact, some gotGuillain-Barre syndrome and after 25 percent of the population wasinoculated, they said A, it is too dangerous or it has too many sideeffects. And B, and more importantly, it didn't materialize. And that was unfortunate because it cast a pall over what's very necessaryfor vaccinations. So historically, the courts have ruled that states have a right to -- in19th Century put a quarantine on people, so sorry, you can't go to schoolunless you've had a polio vaccine or you can't go to work unless you've hadsmallpox and that was wise. But they usually adjudicated that by saying, are we in a pandemic and is ita lethal thing? So get a flu shot, but you don't have to. We recommendshingles, but you don't have to. And then COVID comes along and they don't know what to do because 99.5percent under the age of 60 are not going to die from it. But maybe 13 or14 percent over the age of 75 might and they don't know -- and it's veryinfectious, but it does -- they don't know how to calibrate it. So you have people like this sounding off, we are going to coerce peoplewhere the smart thing I think to do is encourage as many people as you canand keep flexible. So you don't coerce people and you don't go back to 1976and force people to do it or mandate it and then have it blow up in yourface, but hope that the 30 million that have antibodies or maybe it's more,it might be 11 percent or 20 percent, maybe not vaccinate them historicallywould say you might not want to vaccinate them first. Vaccinate people on the frontlines that are continually exposed to viralloads, people over 60 and then give other people the choice and hope thatthey vaccinate, but don't coerce them to and you're going to get close to50 or 60 percent, and maybe like wane a little bit why that last cohort,that's not as susceptible will make that choice for themselves, then youcan educate them, and hopefully they'll do the right thing and getvaccinated, if it's safe. CARLSON:  We hope so. You can't treat people like animals. You have to winthem over. Threatening people doesn't increase trust. HANSON:  No, you have to win them over, and we didn't do that in '76, andwhen the AIDS epidemic came out, people, I think were too hesitant becausethey thought we don't want to go and rush in a vaccine or a new treatment.Look what happened in '76. CARLSON:  No. That's a really good point. HANSON:  And that's what -- I think we are trying to balance the extremesof both coercion and then just laxity and so far, I think people will makethe right decision. CARLSON:  I think so, too, if you let them. Victor Davis Hanson, thank youfor that. HANSON:  If you let them. Thank you. CARLSON:  So all of a sudden, you wake up and identity politics is playinga role in the distribution of a vaccine that's not quite here yet. Identity politics also controls, to some extent, which businesses getcoronavirus relief funds they need to survive. In Oregon, for example, the state has created a $62 million fund that onlyblack-owned businesses can participate in. Business owners there have suedsaying they were denied stimulus money because they didn't quote, "identifyas black." So what's the effect on our society more broadly, of policies like this?Shelby Steele spent a lot of time thinking about this. He's a Senior Fellowat the Hoover Institution and writer of the documentary "What KilledMichael Brown." We're honored to have Shelby Steele on the show tonight. Mr. Steele, thanks so much for coming on. So what do you think -- SHELBY STEELE, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION:  Thanks for having me. CARLSON:  At a time when Americans in huge numbers really don't trust eachother, what do you think the effect of articulating policies like this outloud has on the country? STEELE:  I think it has a terrible effect. I mean, what we're -- policieslike this are basically where you are using racism, in order to somehowcure or repair the damage done by historical racism. And so, it is the same precise sin being used over and over again and itbegins to corrode the values and principles that made America strong astime goes on. It breaks our faith with our principles. CARLSON:  So you're saying that you cannot -- STEELE:  It can be corrupted by race. CARLSON:  You can't repair the damage done by historical racism bycommitting new acts of racism? STEELE:  That's right. It is a futility even on its face. But again, it'slike any -- the bad racial habit that we have in America is -- and we havealways had different one form or another -- is to pick up race and use itas a means to power. CARLSON:  Yes. STEELE:  It has no other function whatsoever. It is -- you can't work hardand become a race. It is something I use in order to gain power over you. And so when you see something like this, then somebody is looking forpower. My guess is the political left wants again, to see blacks castblacks as victims of racial persecution, and therefore deserving ofentitlements and so forth. And so that's really -- that's really what it's about. It puts blacks in aterrible position, because then they're stigmatized as inferior once again,and it's bad for everybody. CARLSON:  The bad habit that we have in America and have always had isusing race as a means to get power. That is a perfect summation of whatwe're seeing. Shelby Steele, I appreciate your coming on tonight. Thankyou. STEELE:  Thank you. CARLSON:  So you never hear it and the people in charge hate to admit it,but whether or not you get coronavirus, you're going to die in the endanyway, all of us are. How do you deal with that fact? Well, you start by confirming it becauseit's true. Mike Rowe has thought a lot about this. He joins us next toexplain his conclusions. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Death is inevitable. That's the one thing that's for certain,unfortunately a secular society and there has never been a mass secularsociety in all human history up until recently, maybe because a secularsociety has no answer for the most basic fact of life. And so the position of our society, the people who run it, is that lifemust be preserved at all costs, even if that means locking everyone intheir room for nine months and killing people as they do it. Mike Rowe is not a religious leader, but he is a very wise man. He is ofcourse an author and television host. He has an idea called safety thirdand we thought tonight would be a good time for him to explain it to us.Mike Rowe, great to see you as always. Safety third. I don't think you have it in the right, but isn't supposed tobe first. MIKE ROWE, AUTHOR AND TELEVISION HOST:  Well, top five, for sure. Safetythird really began as a good natured attempt on "Dirty Jobs" to inject alittle personal responsibility back into the prevailing orthodoxy, which isexactly as you have stated, safety first. And safety first, like so many well-intended ideas was a notion that simplygot a little ahead of itself. I mean, there was a real problem withoccupational safety in this country a hundred years ago, something had tobe done. OSHA came along, and a lot of people got behind it and introduceda phrase that has become a bromide and a platitude, and that phrase is"safety first." But of course, it can't really be true, right? I mean, no business existsfor the purpose of being safe. Businesses exist for the purpose of makingthings and paying people money to work. You can do those things safely,obviously. But so many companies spend so much time telling their employeesthat they care more about their own safety than they do that somethingreally interesting, I think can happen and I saw this on "Dirty Jobs." Safety third really began as a one-hour special to look back at theunintended consequences of what could happen on the job if safety wereovervalued. And this, of course, was very controversial, but it ginned up a greatconversation and allowed us to look at things like risk equilibrium andhomeostatic risk and all kinds of different things that impact our behaviorwhen safety is accentuated. And the levels of complacency, paradoxically enough that often infect uswhen we are in compliance, completely in compliance, whether it's wearing aseatbelt or a motorcycle helmet or a mask, you can be in compliance andstill not be out of danger. CARLSON:  Right. ROWE:  So, everybody on my crew was safe for the first two seasons, nobodygot hurt and we sat through dozens of mandatory safety briefings, all weheard was safety first. By season three and four, we were breaking fingersand toes and ribs. Everything went off the rails, we were all getting beatup. Fortunately, no one too tragically. But what happened was we simply bought into the idea that our safety wassomebody else's responsibility. I started saying safety third is a reminderto me and my crew that the minute you believe that you're in danger. CARLSON:  Well, I wonder and we're almost out of time, just give me in onesentence. Do you think you'd be allowed to make a TV show with the title"Safety Third" right now? ROWE:  No. That's the one word answer. But if you want a little moreinsight, Google C.S. Lewis, he wrote an incredible essay back in 1948,called "On living in the atomic age." And it frames the entire propositionperfectly. As you said at the outset, nobody is getting out of this alive. CARLSON:  I'm going to read that tonight. Thank you for that. Mike Rowe, itis great to see you. ROWE:  You too. CARLSON:  You remember CHAZ, of course. Are you ready for CHAZ, the sequel?Well, there is one. It's a new autonomous zone. It's got everything: armedguards, stockpile weapons, you name it. We'll tell you where it is and howit's going, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  CHAZ: the sequel is here. Where? Jason Rantz, our longtime CHAZcorrespondent, Seattle radio show host joins us now with details. Hey,Jason. JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST:  Hey, Summer of Love in Seattle. So Iguess the winter of discontent in Portland, North Portland specifically,it's the Red House Autonomous Zone. A group of activists within Antifamovement have set up basically a two to two and a half block radius arounda house that was lost to foreclosure after a two-year battle. The family is black and indigenous and so, the primarily white Antifaresidents believe that this is an example of gentrification. There's noactual evidence that this is gentrification. However, there is a lot ofevidence that there's been a lot of crime going on as the folks refuse toleave. Cops yesterday tried to remove them from the home. Finally, remove themfrom the home except they came under assault, the officers, from a lot ofpeople who set up camp there. As they retreated, it ended up giving a lot of room to the Antifaprotesters to set up a camp, and right now they are barricaded. They've gota stockpile of weapons. They've got armed guards. They've got a kitchenready so they are there for the long haul, as the Portland PoliceDepartment are trying to figure out what exactly they're going to do. But they are amplifying the urgency of the messaging saying, you guys dohave to leave peacefully. We're not going to put up with this. So we couldpotentially see action from the police in the next 24 hours. CARLSON:  It's happening because we are putting up with it. You get whatyou put with. If you let your kids smoke weed at the breakfast table, theywill. RANTZ:  Yes. CARLSON:  That's the lesson. Jason Rantz, great to see you. And with that,we are our out of time and Sean Hannity takes over. Have a great night. SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  I don't want to jump the gun here.Did I just hear what you said? Kids at the dinner table -- I think I heardit right. CARLSON:  You get what you put up with. That's the truth. If you let yourkids smoke weed at the breakfast table, guess what, they will. So don't letthem. How's that? HANNITY:  Listen to Tucker, mom and dad. Tucker is giving you good advicefor parenting.
