BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good evening, I'm Bret Baier. "BREAKINGTONIGHT", President Biden signs a pair of executive orders intended toaddress the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic. But some Republicansare unhappy with certain elements in the Biden plan, and there areincreasing criticisms of the new president's vaccination strategies,saying, the goals might be too modest.White House correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off tonight live from theNorth Lawn.Good evening, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Because Biden'steam has only been on the ground here for 48 hours, they are telling us,they don't have a handle yet on how much vaccine stock there is. PresidentBiden is planning to release more of it but he says, in the meantime,things are going to get worse.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The virus is surging.DOOCY (voice-over): The Biden White House wants doses of vaccine each for50 million people or 100 million shots in 100 days. That requires a pace ofa million a day. Not that much higher than the 850,000 a day average in thefinal days of the Trump administration.Now, a member of a federal vaccine advisory board is quoted by The New YorkTimes. "I love that he set a goal, but a million doses a day. I think wecan do better. We are going to have to if we really want to get on top ofthis virus by, say, summer."BIDEN: God will, He not only do 100 million, we're going to do more thanthat.DOOCY: Biden is betting, a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package will earneasy Republican support.BIDEN: This almost doesn't have a partisan piece to it.DOOCY: But some Republicans balk at including items like a $15 minimum wageor funding for public transportation.SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD): There are some added items in there that he'sgoing to have a real tough time getting through that really are part ofCOVID relief. He'll have to separate those out. But, when we talk aboutvaccine dollars, when we talk about testing dollars, and so forth, I thinkhe'll have pretty broad support.DOOCY: The Biden White House is working on it.BRIAN DEESE, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: We are doing all outreachthat the president has directed the team, to do outreach to members ofCongress, to business and labor organizations, to mayors and governors.DOOCY: Biden and Mitch McConnell are on the same page about waiting untilmid-February to start the Trump impeachment trial.BIDEN: The more time we have to get up and running and meet these crises,the better.DOOCY: Now, McConnell is trying to prevent Democrats from doing somethingthat would completely marginalize the Republican minority, getting rid ofthe filibuster.MCCONELL: President Biden has praised this distinctive feature of theSenate on many occasions.DOOCY: One of the ways Biden as trying to stabilize the economy, extendinga pause on student loan debt payments.BIDEN: I directed my administration to pause student loan repayments forinterest for -- the interest payments for Americans with federal studentloans until at least September.DOOCY: When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez heard about that, she asked for more."OK, now let's cancel them."Biden's not there right now, but he does want to move quickly.BIDEN: If we don't act, the rest of the world is not standing still interms of the competitive advantage of the competitive possibilitiesrelative to us.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: And to start keeping tabs on the rest of the world, President Bidenis working the phones tonight. He is going to dial Canada's Prime MinisterJustin Trudeau and Mexico's president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.These are his first foreign leader calls since becoming leader of the freeworld. And we believe he was making them from the Oval Office becausewalking out here, there is a marine posted outside the front door. Bret.BAIER: So, force is a sign that he is in the Oval Office of the West Wing.Peter Doocy, live at the North Lawn. Peter, thanks.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she will send the single article ofimpeachment against former President Donald Trump to the Senate, Monday.That will set in motion, the second impeachment trial against PresidentTrump, and a conviction could torpedo any plans he may harbor for anotherrun at the White House.Also, tonight, the current occupant of the White House is trying to gathersupport for his agenda for the first 100 days, at least. Congressionalcorrespondent Chad Pergram has details.Good evening, Chad. So, walk us through Monday.CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret.Well, Monday is the formal start of the impeachment trial. The nineimpeachment managers led by Jamie Raskin, the Democrat from suburbanMaryland, they will walk the sole article of impeachment over to theSenate.One article, incitement of insurrection. And they will read the article ofimpeachment before the Senate. Now, the question here is whether or notthey can work out some sort of a framework to get -- to sort of, you know,guide pose for this Senate trial here. Maybe they don't get to the meat andpotatoes of the Senate trial until mid-February.Lindsey Graham, Republican senator from South Carolina says the trial onceit starts, all other Senate business is off.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): We're not going to split the day, at least, Iwould. They're choosing to do this. We're going to do it the way we'vealways done it. We've never split the day.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM: Now, by rule, 1:00 p.m., six days a week. That's how you handle aSenate trial, but we might get some more information here in the nextcouple of minutes. The new Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is going tobe on the Senate floor and has an announcement about the parameters of theSenate trial. Bret.BAIER: That's any moment. We will see that, and we'll turn it around oncewe get it.Meantime, Chad, the Senate is also trying to get an agreement on how tooperate in this 50/50 environment. How does that impact the filibuster, the60 votes?PERGRAM: That's right. Well, Mitch McConnell, the new Senate minorityleader, he wants a power-sharing agreement like they had the last time theSenate was tied, 50/50 back in 2021.And, of course, because McConnell is now in the minority, he wants tomaintain the filibuster and the Senate democratic leader. The new majorityleader, Chuck Schumer says that is, "unacceptable".(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The Republican leader, however, has made anextraneous demand that would place additional constraints on the majority,constraints that have never been in place before. In fact, his proposalwould remove a tool that the Republican leader himself used twice in justthe last Congress.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERGRAM: Now, blowing up the filibuster for legislation is unlikely, youneed at least 51 votes to establish a new precedent to kill filibuster, andit's doubtful there are 51 senators who would go along with ditching thefilibuster. The right to filibuster is a hallowed Senate prerogative. Bret.BAIER: You've said or mentioned, you may have others. We'll see over thenext few days. Chad, where we stand with the president's Cabinet?PERGRAM: Well, just one confirmation today. Lloyd Austin, the defensesecretary, he was confirmed today. The vote there was 93-2. You had JoshHawley, Republican in Missouri, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, those ofthe two no votes. So, only two confirmations so far for President Biden.Now, we might have a confirmation on Monday for Tony Blinken to be thesecretary of state, may be Janet Yellen to be the secretary of thetreasury.In impeachment trial, though threatens to derail confirmations and that'swhy it may be in the interest of the Democrats to work out a deal for theimpeachment trial. Bret.BAIER: OK, Chad Pergram with the latest. Thanks.About 7,000 National Guard troops are going to stay in Washington, D.C.until the end of January following the massive protective missionsurrounding the inauguration. And while the rest head home, there areincreasing questions and accusations about how the troops were used andtreated.Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich shows us tonight from Capitol Hill.JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Bipartisan outrageover National Guard troops packed into a parking garage, resting onconcrete amid car fumes after defending the capital for inauguration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SCHUMER: It was utterly unacceptable.SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): I don't think a single senator feels that wasacceptable.HEINRICH: It's still unclear who's to blame. The National Guard tellingFox, Capitol police ordered the troops out as Congress was in session.Capitol police denying they gave the order.But Republican governors from Texas, Florida, and New Hampshire didn't waitfor answers to bring their soldiers home.GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): I don't know who is responsible. Frankly, I don'tcare. I just got to get, you know, protect my troops and do what's right.HEINRICH: Guard members told POLITICO, we feel incredibly betrayed, after agroup of 5,000 were directed to the underground lot with only two toilets,no Internet, and one electrical outlet.Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran and double amputee offered upher own office tweeting, "Unreal. I can't believe that the same servicemembers we've been asking to protect our Capitol and our Constitution theselast two weeks would be unceremoniously ordered to vacate the building."Senator Tim Scott called for accountability, tweeting, "This isunconscionable and unsafe."Safety questions are growing as defense officials confirmed more than 100troops now tested positive for coronavirus. The Senate Rules Committee isinvestigating if precautions were taken amid concerns the deployment isbecoming a super-spreader event.Troops maintained high spirits despite vetting for extremist ties andquestionable accommodations. FEMA only sending cots after these photos wentviral.SGT. ZACHARY HOLDEN, OREGON ARMY NATIONAL GUARD: Everybody is extremelyhonored to be here and part of this, and to help protect the process andprotect the country.JILL BIDEN, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: All I wanted to be -- ifeverybody could be --HEINRICH: The new president and first lady expressed thanks and gavesupport, Jill Biden in person, Joe Biden by phone.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He talked about his own personalcommitment and connection to the National Guard, given his son had servedpreviously.(END VIDEO CLIP)HEINRICH: Capitol police on the National Guard said in a joint statementthey are committed to the common goal of protecting the Capitol, but it didnot resolve the question of who gave the controversial order.The troops are now working eight-hour shifts, instead of 12, allowing themore time to get hotel rooms outside the city. Bret.BAIER: Jacqui Heinrich, live on Capitol Hill. Jacqui, thank you.There are also concerned tonight that the new president's rush to reversehis predecessor's foreign policy may not be in the nation's best interest,concerns from both sides of the aisle. An explanation tonight from statedepartment correspondent Rich Edson.RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Bidenadministration appointees are gradually staffing the state department'sWashington headquarters. The one nominee is missing, secretary designateAntony Blinken is still waiting for his Senate confirmation vote. When hedoes arrive, he'll face a series of major foreign policy decisions,especially on China.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE NOMINEE: President Trump was right intaking a tougher approach to China.EDSON: Blinken agreed with the Trump administration accusing China ofgenocide, and blocking Chinese products made with slave labor from the U.S.Though the Biden administration quickly moved to reverse President Trump'sdecision to leave the World Health Organization. As analysts say, theW.H.O. last year publicly applauded China, as the Chinese government wasrefusing to share information to help contain the virus.CRAIG SINGLETON, FOUNDATION DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES: How are we going tocall the W.H.O. accountable? How are we going to reorient U.S. taxpayerfunding to the W.H.O. to make sure that it doesn't just become some sort ofa patsy for China.EDSON: On inauguration day, China announced sanctions on more than twodozen former Trump administration officials, including outgoing Secretaryof State Mike Pompeo.A former senior Trump administration official tells Fox News that theprevious state department staff prepared sanctions on senior Chinesegovernment officials to give the Biden administration immediate options toretaliate.A current state department spokesperson says China sanctions arecounterproductive, and U.S. officials will work with American allies onChina-related issues. It's also unclear whether the Biden administrationwill maintain the Trump campaign against Chinese telecom companies, thetariffs on imports, and penalties for steadily increasing repression inHong Kong.(END VIDEO CLIP)EDSON: The Biden administration is also moving on Russia, proposing toextend for five more years the last remaining a nuclear arms treaty betweenthe two countries. The Kremlin says it welcomes the U.S. offer to maintainthe new start treaty, but we still waiting for more details beforeofficially signing off. Bret.BAIER: Rich, thank you.

So, we'll follow that just -- on theSenate floor.The Biden administration is going to review the peace agreement reachedbetween the Trump team and the Taliban last year. White House nationalsecurity advisor Jake Sullivan told his Afghan counterpart today in a phonecall, the deal calls for U.S. forces to leave Afghanistan by this May inexchange for counterterrorism guarantees.Well, if you smoke, drink, or eat too much, you may actually move to thefront of the line for the coronavirus vaccine. We'll explain how thatworks.One of baseball's all-time greats has died. Hall of famer Henry Aaron, whobroke Babe Ruth's career home run records, retired with 755 homers, died inhis sleep, according to the Atlanta Braves Organization. Aaron was one ofthe sports' first African American superstars and endured racist taunts andthreats as he approached Ruth's record.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What a marvelous moment for baseball, what a marvelousmoment for Atlanta and the State of Georgia.

The NASDAQ gained 12 for another record close. For the week, the Dowwas up six-tenths of a percentage point, the S&P 500 gained two, the NASDAQsurged 4-1/5.Now, to the controversy over the coronavirus vaccine, the shortages of thedrug and how it's being administered. In a few places, some questionablelifestyle choices are putting certain people ahead of others on the vaccinewaiting list. In several places, getting a shot means playing the longgame.Correspondent Casey Stegall explains tonight from Arlington, Texas.CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At this COVID-19vaccination hub in Arlington, Texas, today, thousands stood in line,anxiously checking their paperwork.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.STEGALL: After finally being cleared by county health officials to receivetheir coronavirus vaccine.PATTY WEAVER, VACCINE RECIPIENT, TEXAS: I have underlying healthconditions, and so, it just seem like the right thing for me to do.STEGALL: This one location will inoculate more than 3,000 on Friday alone.LT. RICHARD FEGAN, ARLINGTON, TEXAS FIRE DEPARTMENT: The moment you gethere, you can easily recognize that there are good things happening here.You know, this is the first step in the process to get us back toeveryone's work.STEGALL: State by state, the vaccine push moves forward with roughly900,000 Americans rolling up their sleeves daily, a number, a public healthofficials say needs to be much higher, with this week marking one yearsince the first case was reported in the U.S. 12 months later, almost412,000 Americans have died from the disease.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I never ask New Yorkers to be patient, we're not apatient people.STEGALL: Many states continue to hit speed bumps with vaccinating themasses.

Bret.BAIER: Casey Stegall live in Arlington, Texas. Casey, thanks.Twitter says it has permanently banned what it calls a fake account thoughtto be connected to the office of Iran's supreme leader. The New York Postreports Twitter took 17 hours to suspend the account linked to AyatollahAli Khamenei, after he posted an image of former President Trump playinggolf in the shadow of a giant drone with the caption, "revenge is certain"written in Farsi.The Post says that tweet included the same language found last month and aposting for what appears to be the leader's official account.Up next, just who the government considers terrorists could be a questionthat affects you, your neighbors, and your friends. We'll tell you why.First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country arecovering tonight. Fox Five in New York as the city's main bus terminalcould be in for a major overhaul.

Most health care workers who will getfree tickets on Super Bowl Sunday will come from the Tampa Bay area andcentral Florida.That's tonight's live look "OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'llbe right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Dozens of civil rights organizations are expressing their concernsover the possibility of a new domestic terrorism bill that would ostensiblyfocus on white nationalists and neo-Nazis. The issue is what groups areconsidered terrorists and whether that constitutes profiling. Here iscorrespondent Mark Meredith.MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In his inauguraladdress, President Biden vowed to combat hate groups which he sees as agrowing national security threat.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BIDEN: Now, a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domesticterrorism, that we must confront, and we will defeat.MEREDITH: This week, Democratic Illinois Congressman Brad Schneiderintroduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act which establishes domesticterrorism offices at the Justice Department, Homeland Security, and FBI.Would require Congress be briefed twice a year on domestic terroristactivity and examine if hate groups have infiltrated military and lawenforcement agencies.Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin says following the recent Capitol Hillriots, lawmakers should feel an urgent need to act.SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): The House passed this legislation last fall. WhenI tried to give a call to the Senate, unfortunately, the Senate Republicansobjected. I hope they have a change of heart now.MEREDITH: Critics fear the legislation may create more controversy andunfairly label some Americans as domestic terrorists.SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): We need to tread very carefully, and again, wehave laws on the books. The vast majority of Americans do not support thesegroups no matter what side of the political spectrum they're on.MEREDITH: This week, 135 civil rights groups sent Congress a letter, urginglawmakers to focus on hate groups, but not to enact a new domesticterrorism charge.Becky Monroe is with the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.BECKY MONROE, LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ON CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS: -- history,when we've had new criminal charges created, however well-intentioned, theyhave ended up coming back to harm the very same communities. In this casethat white nationalists are seeking to harm.MEREDITH: Their privacy concerns too with some lawmakers worried thegovernment already has too much power to surveil its citizens.(END VIDEO CLIP)MEREDITH: Starting today, the White House is directing the NationalSecurity Council to better focus on the threat violent extremists pose. Theadministration also wants a full review of how officials can disruptextremist networks. Bret?BAIER: Mark, thank you.Let's bring in pollster Frank Luntz, who got an earful from some Trump andBiden voters this week.Frank, good evening. I know you kind of went through all of this and youhad some tough times get them -- getting them to talk on issues, but I wantto play a couple of them. One is about the economy and their advice toPresident Biden. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that Biden needs to seriously consider notreinstating a lot of the regulations that were choking the economy before.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Biden needs to take control of COVID and get smallbusinesses -- get main street open, get our lives back to a new normal.(END VIDEO CLIP)FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER: And I'm looking for top (INAUDIBLE).(CROSSTALK)BAIER: So, consensus maybe there, Frank?LUNTZ: Yes, exactly. Which is the Democrats want to focus on COVID, theRepublicans want to focus on the economy. And that one respondent who votedfor Joe Biden is absolutely where the center of America is. Do both, let'sget through this disease right now, let's get to the virus, let's getpeople vaccinated, and then, let's open up the schools, open up the smallbusinesses, and get America back to normal which is what they really want.Even more than opening the economy, they want to return to normal.BAIER: Did you get down the road of impeachment? We are hearing from ChuckSchumer that the trial is going to happen in the Senate the week ofFebruary 8th. Doesn't seem like that's a move that's going to bring peopletogether.LUNTZ: No. In fact, it's going to inflame people. It's going to bring backall that negativity, all that division. And I didn't realize until you justtold me that that's the date that it's been scheduled. God help us, Bret,because it is impossible to get people to be civil when you raise the issueof impeachment, when talk about what happened on January 6th. We all agreethat what happened was horrific. People need to be held accountable.Just the raising of that topic, the raising of the election, bringing backTrump versus Biden is guaranteed to bring back that ugliness that we'veexperienced for the last two months, and in fact for most of the last fouryears.BAIER: And you experienced talking to these voters. Here's kind of oneplace where it starts to turn testy. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have worked for the GOP. I have never in my life notvoted straight party ticket. And I voted for Joe Biden for the first time.(APPLAUSE)LUNTZ: Everybody stop.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you go and listen to the Georgia hearing?LUNTZ: Everybody stop. Pamela stop. Everybody stop.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Any of the Georgia hearings?LUNTZ: Pamela, stop, or I will disconnect you.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: "Or I will disconnect you," Frank.LUNTZ: And that's not the worst part. That was an example of it. And bothsides. The Trump people do not want to hear that Joe Biden won. The Bidenpeople do not want to hear anything from Donald Trump. We are cancelingeach other. I've heard people try to reject the philosophy of the cancelculture, that it doesn't exist, it's a creation. No, Bret. It is not. It isvery real, and it is frightening. And it's happening in academia. It'shappening in the media. It's happening in entertainment. And it's going tohappen in business as well.And I urge people, if you want to see that two-minute clip, that entirething, to see the whole thing develop, if you go to my Twitter @FrankLuntz,you can see it. And it's ugly, it's horrible. We're not showing it becauseit really upsets people. But I urge you if you can handle it, watch it.BAIER: All right, Frank, we'll check that out. We like having you on withall the reaction from voters, and we'll continue to do it. Frank, thank youvery much.Up next, our "Whatever Happened To" segment on Puerto Rico and what isbehind the renewed push for statehood.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Beyond our borders tonight, the International Olympic Committee andlocal organizers are pushing back against reports that the postponed TokyoOlympics will be canceled. The games are scheduled to begin in late July.They were postponed last summer because of the pandemic.Authorities in Russia are taking elaborate measures to curb protestsagainst the jailing of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Demonstrations areplanned for Saturday in more than 60 Russian cities. Navalny's associatesin Moscow and other regions have been detained in the lead up to theserallies. Opposition supporters and independent journalists have beenapproached by police officers with official warnings against protesting.Google is threatening to make its search engine unavailable in Australia ifthe government implements plans to make tech giants pay for news content. AGoogle official says that his company is willing to pay media companiesfairly, but the proposed rules are unworkable in Australia. The AustralianPrime Minister Scott Morrison says he will not respond to threats.Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.In tonight's "Whatever Happened To" segment, Puerto Rico. Many there arehoping statehood is in the cards with the new government in Washington. Butas correspondent Phil Keating tells us tonight, that would come with ahefty price tag.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Now that Democrats control the House,Senate, and White House, many Puerto Ricans and Puerto Rican Americansbelieve this may be the best chance ever for the U.S. commonwealth tobecome the 51st state in the nation.JORGE DUANY, FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY: Biden actually haspersonally supported statehood for Puerto Rico.KEATING: Yet Florida International University's Jorge Duany is skeptical.DUANY: Especially because that would entail a significant increase in thefederal budget for Puerto Rico, and therefore an increase in the federaldeficit.KEATING: The territory of Puerto Rico came into possession of the U.S.after the 1898 Spanish-American war. The roughly 3 million Puerto Ricansare U.S. citizens, but they cannot vote for president and they have novoting representation in Congress. They also pay no federal income tax, butdo receive federal benefits. In November, the push to go from commonwealthto statehood passed on the island with 52 percent of the vote. FloridaRepresentative Darren Soto, the first Florida Puerto Rican elected toCongress, has introduced a bipartisan House resolution to support that.REP. DARREN SOTO, (D-FL): There comes a time when territories need to begiven the option to be a state, especially when there are millions, orhundreds of thousands of people who live in those areas.KEATING: If Puerto Rico became the 51st state, this nation would inherit anisland an economic crisis and a massive debt restructuring plan known asPROMESA. The federally appointed oversight board created in 2016 ismanaging Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt restructuring.And due to the devastation hurricane Maria caused more than three yearsago, U.S. taxpayers have already spent about $40 billion for repairs andinfrastructural improvements, especially to the power grid, which wasabsolutely crippled, leaving millions without electricity for many, manymonths.Last week, the Trump administration, which has blasted the island ascorrupt and inept, announced it will award a nearly $4 billion grant tohelp Puerto Rico rebuild water and wastewater treatment plans, pumpingstations, and reservoirs. Even today, thousands of homes remain damaged.(END VIDEO TAPE)KEATING: The last time U.S. added a state, it was Hawaii in 1959. ForPuerto Rico to become a state, it would take Congress, but Republicans areresistant as they believe a state of Puerto Rico would automatically addtwo Democrats to the Senate. Bret?BAIER: Phil, thank you.When we come back, the panel on President Biden's economic initiatives, theimpeachment trial plans, and battling the coronavirus pandemic.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This almost doesn't have apartisan piece to it.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There are some added items in there that he is going tohave a real tough time getting through.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Once the briefs are drafted,presentation by the parties will commence the week of February the 8th.JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I haven't heard the detail,look, but I do think that having some time to get our administration up andrunning with a -- I want to thank the Senate for passing out our secretaryof defense, looks like our secretary of treasury, looks like our secretaryof state is in place. So the more time we have to get up and running andmeet these crises, the better.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: The agenda the president wants to move that forward, but theimpeachment trial is moving forward, too, the week of February 8th, justheard from a Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for "The WashingtonTimes," former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., and Byron York, chiefpolitical correspondent for the "Washington Examiner." Charlie, what aboutunity and the impeachment trial, how does this all come together?CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, "WASHINGTON TIMES": I think it's one of themost colossal misplays in modern politics for Democrats to be going afterthis right now. Of course, the last time they went after impeachment it wasright at the beginning of the global pandemic, an actual global pandemic inwhich people were dying, and that ground the federal government to a haltfor them to focus on that, and still are.And then of course, you fast-forward to today, and if they were a mandateout of the election, I think there were a lot of people who voted for JoeBiden because they just wanted to stop hearing about Donald Trump, and theywanted to stop listening to all of the fighting about Donald Trump and thisand that. And so for Democrats to pursue an impeachment trial during JoeBiden's honeymoon when he could supposedly get anything he wants done, Ithink is so disastrous for Democrats. And it also looks like they are not -- they don't have any other agenda but that.And I think it's interesting to listen to Joe Biden punt the question. Hecan't punt the question. He can stop this if he wanted to. He is the leaderof the party. But then it also raises the other question, which is what areDemocrats going to do when Donald Trump is actually off the pages, out ofthe debate? What are they going to talk about then? And I think it's aterrible, terrible misplay by them.BAIER: Harold, what about that? And what do you think about Republicans,independents, maybe even conservative Democrats scratching their head aboutthis political move, as Charlie puts it?HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE: First, good evening,thanks for having me on. I think Charlie is largely right. I do think thefact that Senate Democrats have pushed off the start of the trial untilafter the Super Bowl, a lot can transpire. There are going to be fans allacross the country who will have different perspectives about sports andeven politics over the next few weeks, so there's still a chance that thismay not have been in.I think the important thing was to listen to Joe Biden talk about howpleased he was that cabinet secretaries, the important ones, all of themare important, but the important ones to national security are beingadvanced. I would caution people not to underestimate Joe Biden's politicalskills. He doesn't have the razzle dazzle of Clinton or maybe Obama, oreven Reagan, but this is a guy who respects the country and understands howgovernment works.So I'm hopeful that we can find a way out of this without distracting toomuch from COVID vaccination distribution, a COVID relief package, and evena whole array of foreign policy challenges this new president and manypolicies I hope he made continue, including how this president looks atAsia and looks at Russia.BAIER: Byron?BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, "WASHINGTON EXAMINER": First ofall, they won't be able to do a quickie trial if they have a trial. TheHouse threw out all the rules and impeached the president in about 10minutes. And at some point he has to have some due process.What I think you're going to see in the Senate is Republicans gettingtogether over procedural issues. You don't even have to go to the questionof whether Donald Trump incited insurrection if you believe that impeachinga former president was unconstitutional. Impeachment is the Constitution'smechanism for removing a president, and Article Two Section Four says thepresident shall be removed upon impeachment for and conviction of treason,bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors. And Republicans are going to say,what did the Constitution mean by president? It means the president of theUnited States. There's only one of them at a time, and that's not DonaldTrump right now. That argument is gaining a lot of support among SenateRepublicans right now.BAIER: It will be fascinating, not only the substance, but the politics, aswe've been talking about here.I want to turn the page to the National Guard and what has happened withthese troops that have been deployed to the nation's capital, the treatmentof them. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. JAMES INHOFE (R-OK) SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: There was oneuniformed police officer who issued an order without authority, or withoutgoing through the chain of command.SEN. JOHN THUNE, (R-SD) SENATE MINORITY WHIP: It breaks your heart. Theseare people who are here serving the country, protecting us, protecting ourfreedom and our democracy, and there's absolutely no excuse for that. AndI'm glad it got corrected and got corrected quickly.PETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY NOMINEE: I think that bothsides of the aisle can agree that we have to treat our troops better thanthat, because they did a phenomenal job of securing in the Capitol, andthey do a phenomenal job of securing the country.JILL BIDEN, FIRST LADY: The National Guard will always hold a special placein the heart of all the Bidens.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: What transpired, Charlie, was really sad.HURT: Yes, and I think it's telling that everybody on Capitol Hill isrunning for cover, nobody wants to take responsibility for any of thedecisions that got made that so obviously and clearly short-shrifted theNational Guard. But I guess we should take advantage of one thing, and thatis at least this is a unifying saying. I haven't seen this much unity aboutNational Guard troops or the police or basic law and order or anything outof Washington in a long time. And so I grasp at that little bit of an olivebranch that everybody is sort of rallying around the National Guard troops,as well they should.BAIER: Yes. Harold?FORD: I think Charlie nailed it. It is bizarre how that wasn't thoughtabout before they arrived in light of the COVID protocols, but so much washappening. I give those National Guards men and women great credit andappreciation for deterring further attacks, and for that matter, violencein and around the Capitol area and in and around Washington for theswearing of the new president.BAIER: OK, let's do winners and losers. Around the horn, Byron, let's startwith you, winner, loser.YORK: My winner tonight is Senator Bernie Sanders, who stole the show, thefashion show, at the inauguration with this ridiculous outfit featuringthese huge mittens and a look that said I don't want to be here.And my loser, actually, same story is a woman named Jen Ellis. And she isthe Vermont woman, big fan of Bernie Sanders, who made him those mittensout of recycled sweaters or something. And after the Sanders picture goesviral, she gets a lot of people asking where they can buy some, and she isnot making them anymore, she said, because taxes are too high. She's anantitax activist. So maybe Republicans can recruit her to run for office inVermont.(LAUGHTER)BAIER: Wow, that's a full story. The memes with that picture are reallyquite something. Harold, winner and then loser?FORD: Winner, someone that's been talked about a lot today, Hank Aaron, wholived his life and lived it the right way in the face of a lot of hardwork, because he worked so hard in the face of a lot of adversity, startingin the Negro Leagues, finishing in Major League Baseball, one of the greatheroes, one of the great American heroes. Bless him, bless his family, andrest in peace, Hank Aaron.My loser of the week are all those haters of Tom Brady who can't stand thefact that this 43-years-old is playing like a 23-year-old. Go Bucks. And heis a Michigan grad, so go blue.BAIER: All right, all those Patriots fans, they just can't come to gripswith the fact that he's doing so well. All right, Charlie, bring it home,winner and loser.HURT: I'm afraid the loser of the week is me because everybody had so muchbetter winners than me. The winner of the week is Mitch McConnell becausehe is running circles around Chuck Schumer. It got so bad today that areporter stopped to ask Chuck Schumer about with the plans were in theSenate. He said I don't know, ask Mitch McConnell. So he's no longermajority leader, but he's still acting like it.Loser of the week is the American worker. With the flick of a pen, JoeBiden has wiped out a couple thousand jobs between the XL Pipeline andstopping Donald Trump's border wall. And now there are hundreds of moremigrants at the border waiting to come in and take more cheap jobs.BAIER: You're all winners in my book. Have a great weekend.
