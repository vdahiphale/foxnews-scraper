Headline: Gutfeld: Berkeley thugs think only their speech is protected
Sub-headline: And if you disagree, you'll get hurt

 
In Berkeley last night, masked cowards with metal poles beat one guy unconscious, smashed store front windows, set fires, attacked cars and drivers claiming it was over at speaking appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos, a gay, Jewish Trump supporter. I bet ten bucks MSNBC calls the riots mostly peaceful. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
As the disguised thugs attacked women, threw bricks and fireworks at the cops, actress Debra Messing tweeted support and director Judd Apatow tweeted anti-Trump crap, all far away from the violence. I wonder if the feel differently if the rioters have made to their Tony homes.
Now the media keep saying protesters, but they're really hired ghouls who seize any opportunity for organized violence. This scum and their supporters cause violence to spread fear. They believe only their speech should be protected, not yours. And if you disagree, you will get hurt.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
As you watch these emasculated males roam in packs, cheered by smarmy celebrities, you realize one thing about these cowards: They never seek a fair fight. It's why they attack property and unarmed women.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think the people watching should look at the people protesting and look at what color they have wearing. It certainly is not red.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you surprised? Ma'am?

Do you support that, Ms. Messing? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But it's not about Milo, it's about Donald Trump. As Apatow tweeted, "This is just the beginning. When will all the fools who are still supporting Trump realize what is at stake?" Translation: You fools deserve the violence. And to that I say hooray for the Second Amendment. These beta male fascists might swing a pole, but we go to the range.
