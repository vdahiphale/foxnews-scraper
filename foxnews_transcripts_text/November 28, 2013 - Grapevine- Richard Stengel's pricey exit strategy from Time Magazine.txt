Exit Strategy
Here's an exit strategy that's drawing its fair share of criticism. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Washington Times reports shortly before leaving his job at Time Magazine for a role at the State Department, Richard Stengel announced that hundreds of people needed to be laid off. But the budget cuts did not extend to Stengel's quarter-million-dollar bonus. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In other words, he still got it on top of his $700,000 base salary. And he's reportedly due for another big bonus despite the layoffs and a pay freeze for those still employed. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Oh Fine
A Rabbinical Court in Jerusalem is fining a woman the equivalent of $140 a day for refusing to circumcise her son -- it's required by Jewish law. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The woman's estranged husband brought the matter to the court's attention amid their divorce proceedings. The woman says she has no right to mutilate her son -- who is now a year old -- and the court has no right to order her to do it.
Worldwide many countries have banned the practice of non-medical circumcision, and the court worries letting this go through unchallenged would set a precedent. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Cats Have Staff 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You may have heard the phrase, "Dogs have masters, cats have staff." In this case, cats have staff and a life of luxury.
A Tennessee man left his two cats a $250,000 estate and a 4,000 square foot home.
 The will -- which is legal -- instructs that Frisco and Jake are to be cared for with the money. When Frisco dies, the man's human heirs can take over the home and what's left of the cash. They can even move Jake out, but they have to keep caring for him.
The human family isn't talking to the media. The cats got distracted by a piece of string and offered no intelligible comment.
