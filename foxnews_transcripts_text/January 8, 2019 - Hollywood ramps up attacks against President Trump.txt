GREG GUTFELD, HOST: Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters and she high dives into a shot glass, Dana Perino. “The Five.”
If you were in New York today, you may be wondering why every journalist is walking around breathing into a paper sack. It's because Donald Trump is giving a major televised address about the border. Whatever he says, you know that it will be fact-checked by liberal journalists who under Obama, were mysteriously AWOL. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But none of it matters to Nancy and Chuck or Chancy, who have made the political personal. After all, if you had agreed to what Trump wants many times before, why are you rejecting it now? The border has only gotten worse since Democrats said this. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: American people are fundamentally pro- legal immigration and anti-illegal immigration.
HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier.

        }
      
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: But now their story has changed. Why? Has the situation improved? Hardly. But they recalculated. They can agree with Trump or decide that that is worse than human trafficking and drug smuggling. In 2016, more than 20,000 unaccompanied children were stopped at the Mexican border, a 102 percent jump from the previous year. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We don't know how many got past the border patrol and ICE, but that won't matter to Chancy because human trafficking may be bad but not as bad as cooperating with someone they hate. But this inaction isn't new. In 2014, Obama was criticized when in one month more than 10,000 unaccompanied kids were stopped and released at the border, doubling from the previous year.
The Dems were criticized for ignoring the warnings just as they should be criticized now. It wasn't an emergency then and the Dems did nothing. Now, Trump's actually trying to do something and they are just standing in the way. Why? They hate him. They can't let him win even if it saves lives of women and children which is why the only wall you're going to see is Chuck and Nancy.
All right, I guess we should just go around the horn here as they say.

DANA PERINO, HOST: OK.
GUTFELD: I will start with you, Dana.
PERINO: OK.

PERINO: Thank you.
GUTFELD: We are all wearing a little bit of a --

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: It's very collaborative -- collaborative?
GUTFELD: Oh, just stop it. What should he say tonight? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Well this is a big deal. If you think of the communications toolbox of a president -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: I do.
PERINO: This is the hammer. It's the strongest tool and he hasn't used it here to fore. So, he is obviously -- this is like his most important issue. He thinks this is the one thing that he wants to address the nation from the Oval Office on, and so there is significant in that. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's an eight-minute speech so you've got to pack a big punch into eight minutes. It is his chance to talk to all Americans. It's not a campaign rally. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: True.
PERINO: This is the chance for him to do all that. I don't know what he can say that will move the needle. I looked at polling from 2016, December 2016 to December 2018. We have talked about the wall and immigration nonstop for two years and still opposition to the wall is 54 percent. It hasn't changed at all. So can he do something tonight in these eight minutes to make a difference? It's possible.
GUTFELD: Interesting. Jesse, what are your thoughts on this matter? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JESSE WATTERS, HOST: Well, maybe opposition to the wall is how you phrase the question in the polling. I think when you talk about border security and fencing and things like that, you get a different answer. I think that media isn't scared that he is going to tell lies. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think the media is scared he's going to tell the truth and the American people are going to listen and he's going to be persuasive because as you said, these are very powerful speeches. It's his first one from the Oval Office. People are saying there's not a crisis. It's funny because this is from "The Washington Post," Dana, just a few days ago.
"After years of Trump's dire warnings, a "crisis" has hit the border but generates little urgency." And this is by their chief national security correspondent and chief border security correspondent. They say record numbers, migrant family streaming into the United States, overwhelming border agents and leaving holding cells dangerously overcrowded. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: What is the date on that? What's the date?
WATTERS: This is January 5th. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: All right, can I -- this is from December 16, 2015. Unaccompanied minors are crossing the U.S. southwest border in growing numbers again, sparking concerns that the new influx of children would eventually approach levels that last year prompted the Obama administration to declare a humanitarian crisis. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: And so here's why it's different because it used to be Mexican adult males coming.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: And you catch them and you send them right back. Now, it's adults with children coming from Central America and legally, you can't hold them together. Politically you can't separate them, and you can't send them back quickly. And there is about 60,000 coming across each month. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, we have declared crises, the left and the media. I mean, we had a global warming crisis. We had in income inequality crisis. How many people did that kill, Juan? I mean, opioid crisis, student loan crisis. And, you know, you can make emergency declarations -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Don't forget the financial crisis.
WATTERS: Right, financial crisis. Look at this, school shooting crisis, OK. Everybody would agree that that's a crisis last year. Twenty-nine people were killed in school shootings. In one year alone, just in Texas, there were 32 illegal aliens convicted of homicides. That's just in one state. It's more deadly in this situation than it is in almost any other situation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: Juan, to Jesse's -- Jesse is pointing out that he is going against the common assumptions on other networks that that there is no crisis. Do you agree with Jesse, which I think you should? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WATTERS: And "The Washington Post."
JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST: In fact, I don't understand how people who are smart and capable and thoughtful would even not see through this charade. The only crisis here -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
WATTERS: OK, Juan, the "Washington Post" said it's oppressive.
WILLIAMS: I tell you what. I tell you what, I'll just say this -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: No, Obama didn't declare a national crisis. Tonight, when the president speaks, one of the options in his toolbox, as Dana said, is that he would declare that this as a national crisis and apparently --
GUTFELD: Emergency.
WILLIAMS: -- that would give him some powers and he could try to take money out of the defense budget and the like. But is this 9/11? Is this Pearl Harbor? Is this the '09 recession, depression? No, this is nothing. The invasion from the people who have -- in the caravan before the midterms, did we see them exactly invade the United States? I don't know. . GUTFELD: Yes, but two children died.

        }
      
WILLIAMS: Oh, please. So what we have is by the way, the numbers are pretty clear. Apprehensions at the border are going down, down, down. In fact, the president and Sarah Huckabee Sanders were saying over the weekend, 4,000 people, these terrorists -- no, not true.
GUTFELD: Should nothing get done? Just like what happened in 2015? It's exactly what's Dems said. Nothing gets done.
WILLIAMS: In fact, you know, I think, what we have seen is Border Patrol - - they apprehend a terrorist at the border once. It wasn't on Mexican border though. It was back in the '90s and it was at the Canadian border.

WILLIAMS: So to me the big news here is the president is finally starting to talk about a humanitarian crisis because I think that's where he can get out of his box. He's in a box right now, a political box of his own making.
And the way that he's trying to get out of it was, you know, can I use this tool, can I use that tool? Maybe if he starts talking about the humanitarian suffering of people who are coming to this country and how we properly deal with it in comprehensive immigration reform. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD: I think he has tried to do that, Emily, but when you're constantly called a bigot for trying to create a stronger border, it's often a challenge when you have the entire media against you.
EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST: Absolutely. And I'll explain to you Juan how capable and thoughtful individual does think that this is a profound crisis which is the legal bar for this situation and for declaring a national emergency, which we don't know if he's going to declare or not. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But this is how -- for everyone on the left who is saying that there is some type of geographical situs (ph) containment that happens at the border, that's not true. For all the points the Dems say that they care about or that they do care about, they are all directly attributable to the southern border. So the opioid epidemic for example that killed 75,000 Americans per year, where do we think that comes from? What about drugs? What do we think -- 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
WILLIAMS: Most drugs don't come over the southern border. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
COMPAGNO: Can I just finish please? Actually, there's a significant amount of increase of heroine and opioids that do so over the southern border in addition to the fentanyl. And I just want to point out the fact that for example, human trafficking, which people throw around lightly. That is the third-largest criminal international industry on the planet behind only drugs and arms.
That is a $32 billion industry. And guess who pledged $50 million of our tax dollars to combat it this year, our DOJ. How is that not directly affecting every single person and what is a profound crisis? The criminal justice reforms that everyone on the left and hopefully the right too is supporting and talks about a disparate impact to minorities, to low income communities. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Where do we think the currency of these gangs on a low income communities are coming from? There are so much more. There are so many interwoven things that are, again, attributable to that southern border. Yes, to me it is absolutely a profound threat.
GUTFELD: I'm going to leave on that because we've got to move on. Well done, Emily, for summarizing it. Democrats recycling an argument from 2016. Apparently, you are sexist if you don't like Liz Warren. That's next.

DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN OF MARYLAND: Elizabeth Warren has put herself out there and those are the kind of arrows she's getting. Is it fair? No, I don't think it's fair at all and we've got to change that conversation. And women want that conversation to be changed.
GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI, NEW YORK MAGAZINE: And it's of course also true that Elizabeth Warren is going to deal with a lot of the criticisms that Hillary Clinton faced, largely sexist ones often, and some other ones that might be fair. But the point being that listen, no one is going to try and replicate what Hillary Clinton did.

According to recent polling, Warren is struggling with likability among voters which was something Hillary Clinton also faced. Here is Clinton defending Warren.

CLINTON: There's been a lot of talk recently about whether our country is ready for women leaders. Now, that really takes me back. I know many of you and can attest as to how smart, determined, effective and dare I say likable you all are.

GUTFELD: I don't.
PERINO: I kind of get what they are saying, but I was thinking like Al Gore was not likable.
GUTFELD: No, in fact, likability has always been an issue with Gore versus Bush, also with Nixon versus JFK. Before television, it was all about the stentorian voice that you could hear on the radio. But I'm just trying to figure out what is Hillary -- what channel is she watching when there are people saying America isn't ready for a woman leader. What is she watching? Has she tuned into some --

GUTFELD: Yes, it's crazy. By the way, what happens when, I mean, she might be racist because if Kamala Harris enters the picture and she chooses Liz, that's clearly because Liz is white. So if you're going to play the sexism card, we can play the racism card.
If you are going to choose Liz Warren over Kamala Harris, you are a racist. See, that's the problem with all these identity politics. This is where you go.

PERINO: All right, what do you think, Emily?
COMPAGNO: To me playing into this is what shifts the focus from tangible actual conversation. It's like hiding the ball. I mean, I agree with what you are saying that it becomes a slippery slope, but when you say you're just attacking me because I'm a woman, well then you are not actually engaging in talking about the thing that you're talking about.
You're not engaging with the actual source of the criticism. And to me it always felt cheap to do that. And it felt cheap on the reverse end to assume that I would vote for a woman because I was a woman. That to me was just as degrading and offensive. And why can't we just focus on the policy aspects? So to me, I wish they wouldn't play into that.
GUTFELD: Typical woman answer.
PERINO: Are you going to bail her out, Juan?
WILLIAMS: Yes. I mean, to me --
PERINO: AOC, she is likable.

        }
      
GUTFELD: Yes, she's likeable --
WILLIAMS: Yes, because the Republicans find her a convenient foil. I think what is, you know, to me the history is pretty clear. I mean, there has been -- how many we have -- this is 45. He is the 45th president of the United States.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: So we've had 44 white men and one black man. And so -- and women say, and women, the majority of the population say hey, so, you don't like her voice or you don't like the way she dresses or why does she wear these power suits and these pantsuits? I remember all of this about Hillary Clinton, or you know, she's pretty --
GUTFELD: Trump's hair. Trump's skin.
WILLIAMS: Yes.
GUTFELD: Let's see what else. Trump's manhood and the wall. Trump's hands. What about Trump's hands? That's the most sexist thing you could say about a guy, right, the size of his hands. That was 90 percent of the comedians' jokes for two months.

WILLIAMS: (Inaudible), but I am talking about this year (ph). I mean, let me just tell you something. This is where -- I may have told you this before that the guy who used to sit behind me at the NBA basketball games, an older black man once said to me, I couldn't vote for Hillary Clinton. I said, oh, I'm surprised, you know, because he's a Democrat.
So why is that? He said I just don't feel good about voting for a woman, you know. And I was like, wow! I didn't know this kind of attitude existed. And I don't think it's anything anybody is going to say or announce on television.
PERINO: That's why I said I think I understand where it's coming from.
WILLIAMS: Yes. I think it's very real.
GUTFELD: But it's from a dying generation because it ain't anybody I know.
PERINO: Right. Right. Your thoughts Jesse.
WATTERS: Well, I don't think -- it's not because she's unlikable. It's not because she's a woman. It's because she's a politician. Politicians are unlikable people. If you think about it, the only people elected president are the likable politicians, that's how rare they are.

        }
      
Being a politician rots your soul. You go and begging donors for money all day. You're taking polls on what kind of coffee to drink and want to wear. I mean, these people are not likable people. Look at the men. Ted Cruz? Chuck Schumer?
Do you guys want to have a beer with these people? Absolutely not. The reason AOC gets a lot of attention is because like wow, a politician with some spirit. They can't even believe it.
WILLIAMS: Well, I don't know. Have you -- did you meet George W. Bush?
WATTERS: Yes. Very likable.
WILLIAMS: He's a very likeable guy.
WATTERS: Exactly.
WILLIAMS: How about Ronald Reagan? Likeable guy. Bill Clinton --

PERINO: Soto is going to Wisconsin.
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: I think that's that thing that bothers me, right. The election was actually pretty close. If she had done a little bit more in Wisconsin and Michigan and may be Pennsylvania --
WILLIAMS: But it doesn't -- it doesn't negate what you were saying earlier.
PERINO: But that doesn't mean, no, but that doesn't -- but it was close. So, like she lost. Is it because she -- did she lose because she's a woman or because she just wasn't winning?
WATTERS: No, Dana, they're creating a sexism defense because they can't accept the fact that some of the women are running as Democrats are unlikable people. So they built this mechanism in to say if you are against them, it's because you're sexist.

GUTFELD: Mainly from her husband.
WILLIAMS: Remembe though, Dana, Hillary Clinton, when she was Secretary of States, one of the most popular politicians.
PERINO: Yes.
WILLIAMS: It's when she announced that she was running for president, it makes her seem power hungry.
PERINO: Go back to when she was First Lady to Bill Clinton --

WILLIAMS: No. Again, that's very (inaudible) because she was popular and then she got involved with that health care --
PERINO: Right. That's a good point.
WILLIAMS: -- which absolutely fell apart and her numbers went down.
PERINO: Well, we'll see. Maybe there is generational change coming. OK, raging bull against the machine. President Trump, this time calling him a white supremacist, the latest celebrity madness, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: "La La Land" is back at it. The celebrity madness hitting a whole new level with their latest attacks against President Trump. Here is a late-night talk show host, Seth Meyers.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SETH MEYERS, LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: Trump is totally incoherent and incapable of telling the truth. He shouldn't get to address the nation just to repeat his lies. If he calls up the networks asking for airtime, they should pick up the phone and say --
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: President Trump, we don't know who that is.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Tough guy Robert De Niro continuing his attacks, now calling Trump a "white supremacist and a real racist who is bad for the country." And actor Samuel L. Jackson jumping on the bandwagon, tweeting his endorsement of Congresswoman Rashid Tlaib's use of extreme profanity to describe the president. Dana, do you notice a difference in the assaults on the president of the United States compared to George W. Bush and now Donald J. Trump?
PERINO: It was pretty bad.
WATTERS: Pretty bad back then?
PERINO: It was pretty bad. But they didn't call him a white supremacist. That was not it. But it really had to do with the war and there was a lot of anger and frustration after the recount. I mean, I'm not excusing any of it, but I think --
WATTERS: Because that was policy driven it seems like because the war really agitated a lot of people in Hollywood.
PERINO: But the thing for George W. Bush is they said he was stupid.
WATTERS: Right.
PERINO: Right. Everyone thought they were smarter than he was.
WATTERS: Do they think that about President Trump too?
PERINO: I'm sure that they do. And this is interesting for like Hollywood, for me. I've never been enamored with it. Like, if you asked me like who would you most like to have dinner with? I would never choose somebody from Hollywood.
It just doesn't -- I don't want to actually get to know them. I don't think that what they have to say is all that interesting. In fact, what they mostly say, like for example, on the white supremacist piece or in repeating the expletive against the president last week, it just shows like a real lack of ability to think.
WATTERS: Greg, do you just like the fact that you have favorite actors, like a Samuel L. Jackson or Robert De Niro, who you love their movies, but then when they talk politics, you are like oh, my gosh. What is he saying?
GUTFELD: It's disappointing because it tells you two things, that the most outspoken in Hollywood think alike because it's lockstep. And the people you don't hear from, you can assume are conservative because they are not talking. So, it's all run. And this is not, to your point about Bush, this is not new, right.
I mean, it just -- Trump just happens to be the latest trigger in all of this and he's a proxy for half the country that Hollywood looks down. They don't like Trump. They don't like half the country.
PERINO: And the first one for social media.
GUTFELD: But I got to tell you, you know who should send roses every day to Donald Trump? George Takei, aka Sulu, who now has a new T.V. show. And it's not because of what his career has been because I don't remember him being in on anything since Star Trek, but it is his Trump-triggered tweets and that has breathe new life into George Takei. And he1's actually kind of funny, but my point is. A lot of these people owe it to Trump because they were nowhere and now they are somewhere.
WATTERS: Juan, do you think these kind of, you know, these kind of slanderous statements against the president, outrageous, they get on Fox News. Do you think that makes the Democratic Party as a whole look bad?
WILLIAMS: To who? I mean, obviously it's subjective, but I mean, I guess you're talking about to the public.
WATTERS: You know, just to average Americans, independents, people that are not totally tuned in.
WILLIAMS: I don't approve of the profane language, if that's what you mean. And obviously, you know, you sit next to me everyday. You know I don't like the bullying. I don't like the personal attacks that the president engages in.
I think imitating that behavior is not attractive to me. And I don't think it's attractive to most people. But I mean, obviously some people excuse it and say, big deal. Not to them. I will say this, I think the big issue here is not somehow that Hollywood elites, the people like or don't like.
It's that people are saying this president lies constantly. Tonight, the worry is he's going to lie again, tell them more lies and then people get frustrated and angry and use profanity. But I mean, I would just come back to the actual issue. Let's stick to the facts. Let's not make up stories in order to justify actions of a tyrant. Let's not do that.
WATTERS: Well, I think the president will be fact-checked by his own staff and by the mainstream media.
GUTFELD: Never happened to Obama.
WATTERS: I don't see the tyrant analogy, Juan, but let's move on to Emily. When you look at these celebrities, saying these things, did you think they have as much influence as they used to or people just tune them out?
COMPAGNO: No, definitely not. And I think that is statistically proven right now that in terms of like the younger generation, the much more profound influencers are YouTube and internet sensation. Susan Amos, we wouldn't recognize but --
GUTFELD: Greg Gutfeld. Why are you laughing?
COMPAGNO: But that's like having the influence. To me, you know, the common theme of Hollywood and the Hollywood versus Trump is just the hypocrisy. It's ridiculous to me for this kind of insular community that has the highest -- like for example, the highest level of homelessness in the entire United States, the highest median of housing , you know, it's almost a million dollars.
And these are the guys saying that the guy in the Oval Office is the one perpetuating a polarized society or that he's the one that doesn't care about low income or minority communities. And one of the quotes that we read by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that says the GOP lost entitlement to policing women's behavior a long time ago.
Oh, like in this regard, like Hollywood still has that honor? Like, oh, that's right, because women have been respected economically, sexually in the market all around by Hollywood this entire time. So every time a celebrity opens their mouth with just such a vitriol that isn't policy- based, I just think they are hypocrite (ph).
PERINO: It's a good question if they are more influential now. I think that if they were influential, Hillary Clinton would be president.
WATTERS: That's true.
PERINO: And obviously not (ph).
WATTERS: That Jay Z and Beyonce rally would've put her over the top.
PERINO: Not that. Remember Katy Perry?
GUTFELD: And remember, every mouth that was espousing that stuff about Trump kissed Harvey Weinstein's ass.
WATTERS: Ooh.
COMPAGNO: Totally. And Kevin Spacey's.
WILLIAMS: I just think -- I --
WATTERS: Let's -- let's leave you with that though, America.
Just two weeks after the murder of a California police officer by an undocumented immigrant the new governor now promising sanctuary for all illegals. Ahead.

WILLIAMS: Now, that's a classic, Jesse.
The president is set to address the nation tonight on what he's calling a crisis at the southern border. Hmm. And we also have just learned that he has invited congressional leaders back to the White House for a meeting tomorrow afternoon.
But while the president is hoping to secure a wall deal, liberals like new California Governor Gavin Newsom promising policies in stark contrast to the Trump administration. He is vowing to give "sanctuary" to all who seek it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM, D-CALIF.: Together let us build a house stronger than the coming storms yet open to the world. A house that provides shelter to all who need it and sanctuary to all who seek it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: He's also proposing a budget to extend health care coverage to undocumented immigrants up to the age of 26. Of course, Emily, that's extending health care coverage to everyone in the state. And he says basically, and we saw that today and, by the way, in New York. The governor reelected in New York saying the same thing.
These are folks who are pushing this. But you're a Californian, and I just wanted to ask you, what do you think about Gavin Newsom and what do you think about his approach? Because I was stunned when I read this. Because I get to sit next to these guys every day. California had a huge budget surplus. They've got money sitting around.
COMPAGNO: Well, to your first question: what do I think about him? What do I think about his policies?
And as a Californian, you know, my memory is fresh of him being a mayor in San Francisco. That's when he was called a philosopher king, where he was basically full of these ideas. And he always said that the best politics is a better idea.
But frankly, it really didn't do a lot. And there were a lot of things that he says as the hallmark or the pinnacle of his term as mayor that really didn't have an effectuated result. For example, homelessness in San Francisco or some of the environmental projects that he didn't start and didn't finish but has taken some credit for.
In terms of the Medi-Cal and him expanding coverage from 19 to 26, you know, just last year an audit uncovered that $4 billion of Medi-Cal has gone to ineligible recipients. So to me, it would behoove him as the next governor if he would clean up programs before trying to expand them. And I just think what we're getting from him is a lot of messaging and grandstanding without the actual implementation that we can count on.
(PHONE VIBRATES)
WILLIAMS: Was that an alarm? Was that a national emergency?
WATTERS: That was a national emergency at the border.
GUTFELD: Either that or it was gas.
WILLIAMS: That was -- oh. All right. So what do you think? I mean, I'm just struck by the idea that you get big liberal state governors like Newsom come forward, not only -- really going after Trump. And Trump has gone after California repeated times. Now Gavin Newsom comes back and says, "It's not going to be one house for the rich, one for the poor, one for native-born, one for immigrants. California is going to be one house for all."
WATTERS: It's a nice sales pitch. Attacking the president is always good if you're a Democrat.
I think he is trying to cater to the Hispanic population in the state, assuming that the Hispanic population in the state likes sanctuary laws. Polling says they don't like sanctuary laws.
California, the population of Hispanics is, I think, 40 percent of the state is Hispanic. Three million illegal aliens working right now in the state of California. And you know they have a great agriculture industry, service industry, construction industry. You know, he's catering to those people.
But California is such a beautiful state. Silicon Valley and the coastlines and Hollywood. That they can afford to mismanage the entire state and still kind of technically get away with it. Because if you look at the homeless crisis there, drug abuse, crime in the major cities, the massive income inequality that I guess they don't mind there, there's a lot of imbalance in that state.
But because it's such a -- it's probably the most perfect state in the country with such an enormous economy, when you compared to other countries in the world, they can buy with giving everybody free stuff.
WILLIAMS: All right. So Dana, when you listen to Gavin Newsom, do you think he has a political future?
PERINO: Yes, I was just thinking, it's actually pretty exciting to watch this next generation of liberal leaders run for office, get elected. And he's done -- he's kind of put in his time. Right? So he went from mayor. Then he was lieutenant governor, and now he's governor.
I think he's pretty effective and pretty persuasive. I don't know if he's effective in terms of the actual programs and the follow-through.
I am curious about how all these things are going to get paid for. Maybe because Jerry Brown left a big surplus, he's got room to play. I am pretty excited to just hear them and see how they're going to actually try to convince America that that's the direction to go.
WATTERS: But is he likable, Dana?
PERINO: I think he's likable. I'm going to go with likable.
WILLIAMS: Yes, and good looking.
PERINO: OK.
WILLIAMS: Yes. Good looking and strong voice. Right? So --
PERINO: Strong voice, that's always a good one.
WILLIAMS: Stentorian, I think, Greg. But by the way, Greg, you were born in California.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: You're a native Californian.
GUTFELD: That is true.
WILLIAMS: Two Californians at the table.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: But when I read this, I thought 116 billion reserve, 14.8 billion in unrestricted surplus. I thought you told me California was --
GUTFELD: They're taxing --
WILLIAMS: -- cratering.
GUTFELD: They're taxing people to death. That's why people are leaving.
It's a horror show. If you go to San Francisco, you better be an Olympian in hopscotch, because you're going to be jumping over feces-encrusted transient campgrounds.
WATTERS: OK.
GUTFELD: So the point is this governor has misplaced priorities. He's choosing to virtue signal with sanctuary cities, because that has no ultimate consequence to himself.
Meanwhile, you have a rise in disease, epidemic proportions in Southern California because of these campgrounds, of hepatitis and whatever, TB, whatever you're seeing there. I'm not exactly sure which diseases, but talk to Dr. Drew. He'll tell you.;
So because he has presidential aspirations, he's figuring out the right things to say that will raise his stature so he becomes, like, the anti- Trump. I think that's why he's doing this.
As for the -- paying for the health care, it really should upset you that you are paying for the health care of noncitizens.
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: That is something that should piss the hell out of you.
WILLIAMS: Even if they live next door?
GUTFELD: Oh, yes. In fact -- in fact, I am -- I mean, De Blasio is doing -- we pay more than our fair share in New York City. I know. And the fact that we are now extending this.
So we're talking about you're not for a strong border if you are creating enticements to cross it, whether it is -- whether it is through sanctuary cities or paying for health care. That is basically saying, "Border, screw you. Come across, risk your lives. Risk your children's lives to come here and get the free stuff." It's disgusting. This is why -- it is just -- I'm not.
PERINO: Is it similar to Britain?
GUTFELD: Yes. I'm not excited by this. I just think it's sad.
PERINO: You're making -- you're making very good points, but do you think this is similar to what happened in the U.K. --
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: -- where they said, "Here's all these --"
GUTFELD: Freebies.
PERINO: -- "the benefits." And then you -- you didn't have people that were fleeing oppression --
GUTFELD: Yes.
PERINO: -- stopping in any country. They would wait until they got to Britain, and that's where they wanted to stop.
WILLIAMS: OK, so let me -- let me just change subjects briefly at the end of this segment. The president now inviting Democrats back to the White House tomorrow after the speech tonight.
Jesse, what do you make of this?
WATTERS: I think he knows it's crunch time, because right now, no one one has gone without a paycheck. If you think about it, we're hearing a lot of hysteria of the people not getting paid. That doesn't even happen until the 14th. He knows the 14th is the first time that federal workers then don't get paychecks.
So I think within the next week, he wants to get a deal done.
WILLIAMS: And Emily, he's already said he wants to get IRS workers back so they can issue refunds for taxes. But you know, we've been through two years where there apparently wasn't a crisis, with Republicans in power. Now he says there's a crisis. Now he wants the Democrats to come in.
Is there an out that you can foresee where that Democrats could help them get out of this box?
COMPAGNO: By collaboration and coming to an agreement.
WILLIAMS: How?
COMPAGNO: By -- well, in some --
WILLIAMS: What could they offer?
PERINO: Tonight apparently, he is going to appeal to bipartisan agreement about border security, which everyone should be able to agree on, and national security.
I think that this means, by him announcing today that he's calling them back tomorrow that he will not announce a national emergency tonight. That he'll maybe say that "I'm prepared to. I'm not -- let's have one more shot at this. Let's try to work together."
Because if you go back to FOX News voter analysis from the midterms, one of the No. 1 things people who voted said they wanted was for more bipartisan cooperation to get things done. So I think maybe he'll try that tactic one more time with them before he does anything on a national emergency.
WATTERS: The FNVA? Fox News Voter Analysis.
WILLIAMS: Yes, very good.
But Emily, I just wanted to finish up with you. If he needs Democrats to get out of this box, is what I think you guys are saying.
COMPAGNO: Yes, and I think that's what you're highlighting, is what every citizen needs, which is our elected officials to come together in a collaborative way and to not just simply stay in their corner and fold their arms.
Absolutely, we need our government elected officials to do their job together tomorrow. So I love that he's calling them back after tonight. Maybe his speech will hold their feet to the fire, given the public coverage of it, and then tomorrow we can see them get to work and accomplish something.
WILLIAMS: Greg.
GUTFELD: Get the engineers in there. That's all I say.
WILLIAMS: All right.
It's the viral video everyone is talking about. Why one woman completely loses it at the airport. Yes, really. You've got to see this. That's next on "The Five."
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
COMPAGNO: We've all felt frustration while waiting at the airport, but one woman became completely unhinged, and her epic meltdown is now a viral sensation.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) Get me out of here! You rapists!
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get me out of here! Get me out of here! I have a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) gun on me, because I'm hopeless. Get me out!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
COMPAGNO: The woman was eventually subdued and detained. And a JetBlue spokesperson told FOX News she was denied boarding due to being intoxicated and disruptive.
All right. So Greg, you have an interesting take on this.
GUTFELD: Well, I'm -- I really don't like showing these videos on TV. I don't think we're helping anybody when we show these things. We're a country now where we're bored, and so we're being fed unfortunate experiences on smartphones of people who may have medical, psychiatric issues. Maybe she mixed prescription meds with alcohol. Maybe she has a deep-seated psychiatric problem.
And yet, people's bad days become really entertaining for us, and we can pretend and say, "Oh, we feel really bad about this person or that person." But if we felt really bad, we wouldn't show it. That's my feeling.
COMPAGNO: Dana, was that a bad day or was that a gnarly meltdown?
PERINO: Well, I don't know. I mean, it is possible that she had something else going on.
I just -- I know that -- I've never actually -- I've never witnessed anything like this at an airport, but I always do feel sympathy for the airline workers. I feel like they take a lot of crap from a lot of people. Sometimes, you can get frustrated for legitimate reasons. But like, if your flight is delayed because of weather, then obviously, that's not a reason to scream at the staff.
So I don't know what happened here. I hope she's better.
COMPAGNO: How about you?
WATTERS: This would never happen with delta. Delta is the best carrier out there.
GUTFELD: That's where you got your free --
WATTERS: The medallion in 2019 right there, I'm coming for you.
I'm also impressed about how she hoisted herself up on the table area. That was impressive physically.
I agree with Greg to the extent that we like watching meltdowns, because it makes us feel less crazy.
GUTFELD: Right.
WATTERS: You like saying "Oh, look at you," and then pointing the finger. The only thing better than a regular meltdown is a celebrity meltdown. Then you get the best of both worlds.
GUTFELD: That's true.
WATTERS: I also just think we take it for granted that we're getting on these planes. We're not afraid to die. We're flying all over the country. We land; everything is great.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WATTERS: It's only a couple hundred dollars. We should be grateful because of this country, you can just fly across the country and everything is fine.
GUTFELD: Yes.
COMPAGNO: Have you ever seen anything crazy in an airport? You travel so much.
WILLIAMS: Yes. I've seen people get mad, but she called them a rapist. I was like, where did that come from? What is going on here?
Now, I will say apparently -- this is Fort Lauderdale Airport -- there was a 20-hour delay involved.
WATTERS: Ooh.
GUTFELD: Which that wasn't her plane. It was like she just -- yes, yes, yes.
WILLIAMS: Right. But then the airline said she was drunk and maybe on prescriptions.
We had a situation at Dulles where Kevin Rooney, the soccer star, was taken in and arrested. But apparently, he was also taking some prescription drug. Maybe like taking something to sleep while he's on the plane --
GUTFELD: Take an Ambien.
WILLIAMS: -- to combine it with alcohol, you're in bad shape.
PERINO: That's not a good idea.
GUTFELD: Oh, tell me about it.
WILLIAMS: I find, you know, there are moments when I think Greg can be compassionate.
GUTFELD: [laughs]
WILLIAMS: You know what I mean? That you showed some human -- for this lady in a way I didn't anticipate.
GUTFELD: Well, I just don't -- I don't think it's -- I feel like we're finding people at their very worst, and we don't have the compassion to just say, "You know what? We don't have to look at it." We will click on it.
WATTERS: You're saying this, because this could be you. This is your spirit animal.
GUTFELD: This could be anybody. You never know.
WATTERS: This is why you show up to the airport 20 days before your flight.
GUTFELD: That is true. You never know.
WILLIAMS: This is an ego act for him. He's just protecting himself.
GUTFELD: So true.
WILLIAMS: I was so foolish. I fell for it.
WATTERS: He's not compassionate; he's selfish!
GUTFELD: I --
COMPAGNO: I think there's something about airports, though, that for some reason, there's like this heightened sense of --
GUTFELD: Of course.
COMPAGNO: And maybe it is the, like, fear of death at any minute and the high federal security, and this microcosm of the world, because we're all in these small places. But there is something about an airport that lends itself to freak-outs and people being totally frightened by these freak- outs.
GUTFELD: A lot of people don't fly that often.
COMPAGNO: This came and he guy missed his flight, because apparently another flight attendant -- whatever, it was a miscommunication, he claimed. So he got to the gate, and he had missed -- they had closed the thing. And he took his bag, and he chucked it at the -- yes, over the counter and was screaming. And literally, it was like, I feel like in any other instance, maybe people would have intervened, but in this -- in that kind of situation, literally the entire gate --
PERINO: It's nerve-racking.
GUTFELD: It's Lou Dobbs.
PERINO: Because you think your flight is going to get canceled.
WILLIAMS: Is that who it is?
GUTFELD: It was Lou Dobbs. That's why nobody did anything.
COMPAGNO: OK.
WATTERS: Let's go to the video.
GUTFELD: I have it on tape.
COMPAGNO: "One More Thing" is up next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: "One More Thing" -- Jesse.
WATTERS: Happy birthday to the king. It's not my birthday. Elvis Presley -- sorry, Greg.
PERINO: Big fan?
WATTERS: Was born on 19 -- 1935. He would have been 84 today. Nominated for 14 Grammys, won three. I think he had 18 No. 1 hits in the U.S. in about a 13-year period. Amazing concert performer. Gave over 1,100 different concerts.
GUTFELD: You sound like a real fan, Jesse.
COMPAGNO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Boy, the passion.
WATTERS: I'm such a fan. Look at this picture right here, Greg. Right there.
GRAPHIC: PHOTOSHOPPED PHOTO SHOWING ELVIS IN HIS WHITE JUMPSUIT WITH JESSE'S FACE
GUTFELD: I knew it was going somewhere.
COMPAGNO: I'm really struck by the -- hair similarity.
WILLIAMS: I know what I'm getting him for Christmas next year. Forget the Michael Jackson jacket.
WATTERS: OK, the king lives on.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: All right.
GUTFELD: Juan.
WILLIAMS: Well, Thursday marks the 20th anniversary of a show I know you watch. Take a look at this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(CLIPS OF "THE SOPRANOS")
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILLIAMS: Yes, "The Sopranos" hit the airways in January of '99 and, in six seasons, changed American television. Appointment TV can be credited with the rise of today's binge watching.
"The Sopranos" inspired an era of shows with more ambitious plot lines and, of course, deeply-flawed characters like Tony Soprano, and it paved the way for provocative shows like "The Wire," "Breaking Bad," "Mad Men." So a tip of the hat to David Chase, who created the show and to the lead actor, James Gandolfini, who made a violent mobster into an American icon.
GUTFELD: All right. Dana.
PERINO: OK, well, you know Jasper is America's dog. He's very smart but not always smart. And last night, Peter showed me this video from the park, where he was kind of, like, doing what the Democrats and Republicans are doing with the shutdown. He's giving it his best shot with that stick. But he just --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(JASPER CARRYING GIANT STICK IN HIS MOUTH, GETTING STUCK BETWEEN TWO PARK BENCHES)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PERINO: -- he cannot get it to work. He just can't, like, run it right. Bang.
GUTFELD: He will not make America's -- he's not "Animals are Great." This is not "Animals are Great" material.
PERINO: It's like, come on, Jasper, one more time, try it. Oh, denied. Denied.
I'll be on Tucker tonight, and we'll be previewing the president's speech at 9 p.m.
WATTERS: That's funny.
GUTFELD: Fun, fun, fun.
All right. It is time for, Dana --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD (singing): Animals are great! Animals are great! Animals are great!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Jasper has his long stick, but these little critters, they've got the bush. Check it out. There they are, little baby. These little kittens hiding in bushes.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(KITTENS HIDING IN BUSHES, POUNCING OUT AT A POINTING HAND)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: Isn't that great? They're like little -- they're like little, what do you call them? Those things that come up? Whack-a-moles.
PERINO: Whack-a-moles?
GUTFELD: Except they're like cats.
PERINO: Whack-a-cat?
GUTFELD: Yes, but I wouldn't -- I don't -- do not condone whacking cats. I think that you should never whack a cat, because you never know who that cat belongs to and they could come and whack you. But I love kittens, because they're so surprising, which is why --
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD (singing): Animals are great! Animals are great! Animals are great!
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUTFELD: They are. Emily.
COMPAGNO: All right, one thing is for sure. You do not mess with UFC fighters. And I just love this story.
So UFC fighter Polyana Viana was waiting for a taxi outside her Rio De Janeiro apartment when she was approached by a man who was trying to rob her and threatened that he would pull out a gun. She beat him up.
WATTERS: Whoa.
COMPAGNO: She's won 10 out of her 12 professional fights. She quickly took action, and she just absolutely, as you see there, just decimated this guy.
And of course, she did not suffer any injuries. And the supposed gun, it turns out, was actually a cardboard cutout, so it was all for nothing.
But it reminded me of that story, because remember where that gun shop was like -- there was an attempted hold-up, and the perpetrator was immediately subdued by, like, 30 people with guns. So I loved it.
GUTFELD: That's what I love about -- I love about women and self-defense. Because that adds a whole new, like, sense of, like --
WATTERS: You like that, Greg?
GUTFELD: No, because guys got -- now they've got to think twice when they're mugging.
COMPAGNO: Yes.
WILLIAMS: Yes, even though they had a gun.
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: The story the other day of a guy -- a woman ran into a karate studio --
GUTFELD: Yes.
WILLIAMS: -- and the karate guy beat up the criminal.
GUTFELD: Exactly. All right. We've got to move on. "Special Report" is up next.
