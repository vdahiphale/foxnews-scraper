Democrats in Texas have given up on a congressional race following a primary victory by an unorthodox candidate.
Time magazine reports Keesha Rogers won with 53 percent of the vote. She is part of the LaRouche political movement, wants to impeach President Obama, opposes the United Nations, and supports the colonization of Mars. During the campaign she was photographed carrying an oversized portrait of President Obama with a Hitler-style mustache.  The Texas Democratic Party has already adopted a resolution denying support for Rogers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And while previously-unknown South Carolina Senate candidate Alvin Greene won his Democratic primary without campaigning, Rogers says, "I was knocking on doors everywhere -- everyone knew my positions." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
School Daze 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
There could be another example of resume boosting from Illinois Republican Senate candidate Mark Kirk.
The New York Times reports a leader at the church, where Kirk claims he was a nursery school teacher, says "he was never ever considered a teacher. He was just an additional pair of hands to help a primary teaching person." Kirk's campaign maintains he was a nursery school teacher with "the responsibilities one would expect." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Kirk has come under fire for several exaggerations and errors in his statements about his military record.

The Los Angeles Police Department wants its red light camera contractors exempted from the city's boycott over Arizona's new immigration enforcement law.

          });

The L.A. Times reports the city council will consider the request Tuesday along with a bid by another Arizona-based firm for the same contract. But police officers are still questioning whether political correctness is trumping public safety. The LAPD withdrew a request for officers to attend a training conference in Arizona after objections from some council members.
