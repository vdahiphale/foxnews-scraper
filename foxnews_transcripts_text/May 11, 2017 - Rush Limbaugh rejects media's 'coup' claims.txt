PERINO: Tonight, President Trump defending his controversial decision to fire FBI Director James Comey in his verse first sit-down interview, since the dismissal on Tuesday. Over 48 hours after the firing, Comey's outcome remains highly controversial with many Democrats alleging obstruction of justice. After some evolving White House accounts, the President gave his explanation for the termination.

TRUMP: Look, he is a showboat, he is a grand standard. The FBI has been in turmoil. You know that. I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil. Less than a year ago. It hasn't recovered from that. Regardless of recommendation, I was going to fire Comey. Knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It is an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won. 
PERINO: President Trump also clarified that even with Comey gone, he expects the FBI to continue the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election.

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! This is a family channel. 
PERINO: When a story changes like it did today, then you get more of the story. That's just inevitable. Where do you think the White House stands tonight?

        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Well, you know, because there's been several different, you know, explanations for one, justifiable termination. The President has the absolute authority. It's constitutional to do exactly what he did. President Obama had the same authority to do so. And Hillary Clinton if she were elected president, likely would have exercised the same authority and discretion and dismissed Director Comey.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Right now, President Trump is trying to get out there to give the narrative and explain it but I think what would have helped from the beginning in terms of the communications was just sort of a clear delineated timeline. Because now people are trying to go back in and fill in the gaps, for what? No one is saying that this isn't something that the President has the authority to do. 
PERINO: Right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUILFOYLE: And I don't hear a lot of people protesting to say that this is someone who overstepped his bounds and -- of the office by in fact stepping into the shoes of Loretta Lynch and the Attorney General by saying that this case should not be prosecuted. That was something that was improper for him to do. There's a number of things that happened since the timeline, going back to July 5th. 
President Trump had the authority to do this. He acted based on his evaluation of this person's ability and suitability to serve and made the decision to terminate. Informed his AG and his Deputy AG who then prepared the memorandums that backed up and justify the termination. That is where we stand. But still 48 hours later, you have the detractors. People trying to make something out of this. There's no evidence so far to suggest any kind of collusion with the Russians. There is no funds that have been, you know, averted or, you know, short staffed to be able to continue any investigation. So, what exactly is the problem?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PERINO: Well, Jesse, one of the things also today was a suggestion that there was some hypocrisy from the White House that one of the things the Republicans had rightly said was that it was inappropriate for Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General to meet with Bill Clinton on that plane, on the tarmac. Then she basically -- Comey says, okay, well, that is why I had to step in and basically crossed that redline into the prosecutorial role.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Which basically leads to the frustration that Rod Rosenstein, the Attorney General says. But tonight, and there is more reporting on this in the New York Times tomorrow morning that President Trump met with Comey several times and was pressing him to ask him about an investigation. Do you see hypocrisy there? 
JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST: I don't know if I see the hypocrisy. If people are saying, you are not allowed to really ask the FBI director if you are under investigation. And I guess the FBI director said he wasn't. And we also know that Grassley Republican and Dianne Feinstein Democrat both said, Comey said, Trump was not subject of an investigation. We're also hearing that none of Trump's top aides are the focus of the FBI investigation. Some of the reporting shows what's going on are two things. 
The counter intelligence investigation being done by the FBI is whether or not a handful of American citizens wittingly or unwittingly were compromised by Russian spies. The criminal probe by the FBI is looking into not collusion with the Russians but whether or not there were laws broken in terms of money laundering, tax schemes, and things like that. Lobbying. So, we also heard today from the guy at the justice that they don't need a special prosecutor. And there's tons of resources for this probe going forward.

WATTERS: So, I think we shouldn't point a special prosecutor to maybe investigate a lot of Democrats can't accept the fact that Hillary lost. 
PERINO: Bob, why, I don't understand also, why did the Democrats want a special prosecutor so much as soon as that happens, it all goes underground, there's no more comment and it really should, leaks should really stop at that point. And they wouldn't have any more stories to talk about.

I don't understand what the President is talking about. And of course he doesn't understand.

BECKEL: No, that is not true. That is not true. And listen, even the deputy, now the temporary head of that went up and said, that's not true. The people that work for the FBI strongly favored Comey and are terribly upset by this. Now, then you've got a few people, few FBI agents who didn't think it was a good thing not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. A few. But a very small number and that's Republicans.

GUTFELD: I have three points to make. Everybody's got to chill. Number one.
PERINO: Okay. 
GUTFELD: Why is there controversy? Because we keep saying it's controversy. The guy who got fired isn't even taking it that badly! He's not upset. He is already sitting at home in his boxers eating ice cream. They saw them out in the garden, he was having fun. He is the least excited about this. He doesn't even care. So why do we care? Yes. Have you seen him? Anyway, by the way, Donald Trump asked if Comey, if he was under investigation and everybody said oh, my God, is that illegal? No, it is human. It is human. Let me finish.

GUTFELD: It's like asking a teacher in a class like it, are you going to flunk me? It's human. Getting pulled over by a cop and you just wonder, like am I going to get a ticket? This is a human thing. 
PERINO: No.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
GUTFELD: Well, you've never get a ticket. I always get. Well, my point is this. You could sit here and go, oh, that's terrible. Oh, it is actually a human -- are you guys investigating me? 
BECKEL: Greg --
GUTFELD: That is what Trump does. No, I am not done yet. Because you had your like long monologue which made almost no sense, when you take out all the insults. When he was in that interview with Holt, you said that he lied. No, he actually believes in what he is saying. And who believes what they are saying, a person who believes that they are innocent. So, we can all sit there and laugh at what he is doing but maybe he actually does believe what he is saying. 
And maybe he thought -- because we have evidence of this, we have evidence of this, that he thought that the Democrats were going to be pleased by this decision. He was like a cat who carried in a dead pigeon to the owner. He thought he was going to get the applause, the kind of applause that Stephen Colbert got when he announced the firing. He was actually, he believed that this was a good thing. And that is why he is shocked now. And everybody here is like, oh my God! Oh my God! Lighten up. Relax.
BECKEL: Why should anybody relax? You said Comey is the only person not upset about this. Comey is going to get even for this. And he's got to find out one thing, we all going to find out one thing, that there is no way he ever told Trump -- no FBI director would ever say -- 
GUTFELD: He didn't respond to that. 
PERINO: Let me ask Kimberly --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');

        }
      
GUTFELD: No, he will respond to that.
PERINO: Let me ask Kimberly, he's a former prosecutor -- 
GUTFELD: I've never heard that. 
PERINO: -- about this one thing, that Greg mentioned which is that it's no big deal, it's just human. But there is a process that the White House is not supposed to call the FBI director or supposed to go through the Department of Justice. That was like the whole problem of Lynch and Clinton. That's the whole thing. Like from a prosecutorial standpoint, I'm not saying there's any law broken here necessarily but in terms of -- regard for the law, you have to follow the process to actually have the law regarded. 
GUILFOYLE: Well, that was interesting. Look, definitely there was a process to this that could have been more closely adhered to, in terms of any criminal violation or anything like that, I don't see that. But yes, you should follow the order and chain of command and go abide it. The rules are there for a reason. Nevertheless, we have a situation here where all the discussion about this isn't about the propriety as to whether or not the President have the authority to dismiss, a directive that he felt was not serving the best interest of the country and of the FBI but about the process, and about the communications and sort of the roll out like we discussed last night. 
Like the objections to the travel ban. So, that is something that is like, you know, a repetitive theme here. But in terms of the President, even Comey says the President had the right to dismiss him and the acting director said, he had the absolute right to do what he did. And in fact, Comey said the President had the right to dismiss the director of the FBI for any reason he wants. 
PERINO: Which is the reason that they should have given so that they could avoid all of this.

WATTERS: No. He is not investigating him. He's not investigating. I want to take --
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Dianne Feinstein, one of your Democratic senators said also the President is not the target of the investigation. He also said something else, he said, the President of the United States is a buffoon. That buffoon beat your party in November. So, what is worse? Being a buffoon or getting beaten by a buffoon. Also, there's a difference between -- 
BECKEL: Now, that was a little shocked. 
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: -- scandal and a conspiracy. You guys said that Benghazi was a conspiracy. Remember what happened at Benghazi? People died and the Democrats lied about it. So far President Trump has not lied once about --

(LAUGHTER)
WATTERS: And no one has died. So, I do not know where you are getting this scandal from. You're also saying that they colluded, you're also saying that the Russians and Trump colluded on the elections. How did Podesta get hacked? He handed over his password to a hacker. 
BECKEL: I didn't say they colluded. I said, they were looking into it. You guys are jumping way ahead of the game here. The game that whether or not there was collusion. And you say, there wasn't. I didn't say there was. But a lot of the investigation go forward and when it's done -- 
PERINO: The investigation is going forward. 
BECKEL: Yes. Right.
PERINO: Hey, there was one other thing that happened today in the Lester Holt interview. Because President Trump was asked about the firing of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn back in February. Here is what he said.

TRUMP: We fired him because he said something to the Vice President that was not so. 
LESTER HOLT, NBC NIGHTLY NEWS: Did you know that he has had received payments from the Russian government --
TRUMP: No.
HOLT: -- that he had received payments from the Turkish government?
TRUMP: No, but Obama perhaps knew that because he had clearance found the Obama administration and this is something they never want to report. He had clearance from the Obama administration. The highest clearance you can have. And I think it's a very unfair thing that the media doesn't talked about that. 
PERINO: This is also something, Greg, that the President I think is very frustrated with is that the FBI hasn't moved quickly enough on the leak investigation, that is a part of the Russia investigation. Right?
GUTFELD: True. That is true. I'm interested from the psychological viewpoint, looking at Donald Trump. He is like a shark who doesn't realize, you know, a shark doesn't realize there is a commotion on the beach. He's just a shark. And that is what Donald Trump is. He's a shark with a comb-over. He is just going around, and he doesn't realize what's happening above the water. And going back to the point I made to you, Bob. I believe that he believes, I think he believes in what he is saying. Which is why when you say he is lying, it's not lying if you believe it is the truth. I mean, it's not -- again, you can't be in this prism of two ideas. An absolute nefarious creature or he's a hero. It's probably somewhere in the middle.

GUILFOYLE: He's a shark in the swamp. 
BECKEL: He's a shark in the swamp. You believe that he believes Obama did in fact tapped his phones? 
GUTFELD: Absolutely. I think that he believes -- and then he will change his mind. And he will believe that. But I think what he's doing something, he believes it. I don't think he cares enough to lie about stuff. He just, when he feels something, he says it. He's impulsive and compulsive. 
BECKEL: And does that compulsivity carry out when you have the acting Attorney General who stands up and says something and he fires her? And then you have got the FBI director who says something in-front of a Senate Committee, and he didn't like that and he fired him? Do you think that was just a shark trying to eat the truth? 
GUTFELD: I think Comey knew it was coming. 
GUILFOYLE: If President Obama dismissed Comey or if Hillary Clinton -- people don't like it because President Trump did it. He has no obligation to keep him. I think it was an excellent decision. Comey really acted inappropriately, overstepped his bounds. Totally out of line. Everybody knows it. Nobody is disputing it. And by the way -- 
GUTFELD: But the thing is --  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
GUILFOYLE: Well, what's different does it make actually, does he have the right and the authority to do it, would you have preferred it if he did it right, when he came in? 
BECKEL: Sure. Flynn having the highest clearance is under Obama. Flynn has the highest clearances from the time he became a general. So, it was right before Obama, number one. Number two, why Trump gets away with something like this? Lester Holt, I go back to this again. Let this guy get away with more stuff in that interview and why the press in this country does not, when they get a chance to face the sky, face to face and he boldfaced lies, why don't you say it? 
WATTERS: All right. Maybe -- 
GUTFELD: You never cared about the last eight years of President Obama when everybody was comatose, or Obama-tose as I often say. 
WATTERS: Can they play patty cake with your guy for eight years and --

(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: But here is Rush Limbaugh with a different perspective. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: It's not the Saturday night massacre, it's not Nixonian. It's none of that. It isn't even close to that. Nixon wasn't doing a coup. Nixon was president. Trump is not doing a coup, he is president. Leaders don't mount coups. Leaders have coups mounted against them which is what is happening here. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: All right. So, Greg, do you think now this Russia conspiracy thing has become the Left's birth certificate rabbit hole that they're going to dive down no matter what happens? 
GUTFELD: To be fair, every side has that kind of story. We have had them. And the left has them. And, you know, we will go after, you know, we will say Hillary has got to go to jail. That's our Russian story. So, everybody has one. When I see people on "The View" get upset, it's like when inmates complained about the food. I tend to like the warden. You know? So, it's like the entertainers right now are in Trump's jail. You know, in which they deserved because they have had free reign for eight years. This story is like a giant fiber brand muffin "The View" is taking with strong coffee and they are just crap out the hysteria. 
(LAUGHTER) 
WATTERS: Do you think -- 
GUILFOYLE: Oh, God! I mean, so nuts!
WATTERS: Okay. Do you think this whole clash for this Russia thing, is this about ratings, because right now, the more left in the media beats this drum, the more ratings they get, or do you think it's all about partisan politics? 
PERINO: Well, I think probably is that the investigation is taking so long. And it's likely to take a lot longer. 
WATTERS: Yes.
PERINO: And so what President Trump said today and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the Deputy Press Secretary said that he wanted it to end. And I think that's being taken out of context by some people in the media, by saying that he wanted it to end and that firing Comey will get it to end. I don't think that's what President Trump meant and that's what she meant. So, the overwrought analysis by some, by jumping to a conclusion, and like, that it is a coup, doesn't help the situation and does make it look hysterical but there is an investigation that's ongoing. President Trump himself said he wants to see it completed. And the FBI Director -- the acting FBI director today said that there has been no interference that the investigation has not been impeded and it will go on. 
GUTFELD: Look at Venezuela -- 
GUILFOYLE: Right. So, where is the problem?
GUTFELD: You have to look at the United States. 
WATTERS: Yes.
GUTFELD: This is what drives me crazy. 
WATTERS: None of these celebrities ever look at what's going on around the world instead they say, there's a coup in America. 
GUILFOYLE: We have a system and the system works. 
WATTERS: Wouldn't a coup be if Comey illegally took Trump out? I think that is the definition of a coup.
GUILFOYLE: Yes. Well, people are historically confused definitionally about what a coup is. And by the way, another one of the reasons in the report that states that why Comey overstepped -- how about the fact that he slowly walked the records request about Americans that are being surveilled and unmasked? That is a serious investigation. That is what the lead should be and all the news agencies should be talking about Americans being surveilled. About privacy rights. And about unmasking, who ordered it, who was unmasked and for what reason. That's a grotesque abuse of privacy rights in this country. 
BECKEL: Well, if that was so grotesque, it should have ended when Trump got into office. But, you know, the fact that we have built a whole segment around Whoopi Goldberg -- 
GUTFELD: I love Whoopi! 
BECKEL: Rush Limbaugh who is -- 
PERINO: All right.
BECKEL: Stretch the truth on occasion and the fact that we built a whole segment around these two people -- 
GUTFELD: Okay. There is a lot of this. 
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Can I ask you a specific question though? I missed you. I missed you so much. 
BECKEL: (INAUDIBLE) The Watergate situation. Go ahead.
WATTERS: I am younger than you. 
BECKEL: I got you. 
WATTERS: I know. And you can tell by looking in the street. Let me ask you a specific question. 
BECKEL: Yes, sure.
WATTERS: So, the Left is assuming that there is this big collusion going on between Trump and Russia. But let's start from the beginning. 
BECKEL: Uh-hm.
WATTERS: What facts are there -- evidence to show collusion right now at this time? 
BECKEL: Well, I think there's two important points that they're looking into. One is the Wikileaks, going to Russia and coming back into the United States. 
WATTERS: Okay. Podesta gave the hackers his email address. That is Trump's fault? 
BECKEL: Wait. Wait. There are 4,000 people -- wait a minute, what?
WATTERS: He gave his password to the hacker. How did Trump make Podesta do that?
BECKEL: It wasn't just Podesta they were hacking. 
WATTERS: Podesta's emails were hacked. All of them. That was the main components of WikiLeaks. 
BECKEL: Leave it that aside, they were hacked. Right? And the other thing is that there is now some fairly conclusive -- 4,000 people were hacking into and sending it to Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania fake news -- stuff out of WikiLeaks that they sent out there. Now, if you think for a minute that you don't have some evidence here that there were some people in the Trump operation that were involved with Russia, and if the Trump operation, getting money for their various projects -- 
GUILFOYLE: Okay. But now -- 
WATTERS: Okay. I haven't heard Kimberly. 
GUILFOYLE: No, no, no, no, no. I don't know I'm sorry, yes. 
WATTERS: Being pump into the states -- 
GUILFOYLE: Right.
WATTERS: That were beaten through the blue wall by Donald Trump? 
GUILFOYLE: I keep hearing these wild bedtime stories by Bob over here. And it's very fanciful. And I mean, there's no evidence. No one has come forward to say that there was any kind of collusion whatsoever. I haven't heard one factual statement to suggest or support that. There's an ongoing investigation. 
BECKEL: There is an investigation going on.
GUILFOYLE: Right. And what has it produced? What have we heard -- so far, nothing. Okay. But so far, what has the report said? 
WATTERS: So, if the report finds there's no evidence of collusion, are you going to apologize to the American people? 
BECKEL: No, I am not going to apologize. I will say, fine, that's the results. 
WATTERS: Okay. So, you will accept the results? 
BECKEL: Of course.
WATTERS: Okay. We heard it here. 
Up next, we will tell you why Hillary might need some good lawyers. When we come right back. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUILFOYLE: Welcome back. With the James Comey out of the FBI, does that mean Hillary Clinton should be worried about her email case being reopened? Today, the acting director of the FBI revealed for the first time that some agents were upset the criminal case against Ms. Clinton wasn't pursued. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ANDREW MCCABE, ACTING FBI DIRECTOR: I think morale has always been good. However, we had, there were folks within our agency who were frustrated with the outcome of the Hillary Clinton case. And some of those folks were very vocal about those concerns. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GUILFOYLE: Also today, FOX News Catherine Herridge talk to a former FBI agent who suggested the bureau may read look at the Clinton email investigation as well as the immunity agreements given to five individuals associated with the case. Dana, what do you make of these developments? 
PERINO: Well, I am skeptical of former FBI agents or former CI agents making suggestions for what possibly could happen. This happened a lot in law enforcement because they have to remain anonymous so that they can communicate and that both agencies used a lot of former FBI agents or CIA agents in order to make their case. And so, I don't know exactly what will come of this. 
In the realm of possibility, in the world we're living in today, I could see it happening. But I will tell you this -- I think that the Trump administration has got to figure out who they're going to nominate for FBI director, and try to make sure this is a stellar nominee that they can get confirmed. Because this question will absolutely come up at a hearing that that FBI nominee will actually have to then say what is or her intentions would be even if they couldn't actually say, that will be a big sticking point for the Democrats. And I think that the country, the administration needs to get this settled down, get a nominee, get through confirmation as soon as possible. 
GUIFOYLE: Yeah, I think great idea. Get somebody out there and to take up the new cycle.
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Right.
GUIFOYLE: . with somebody -- quiet professional.
UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Like me.
GUIFOYLE: Yes. I mean, very similar.
GUTFELD: Yes, I am. Did Hillary get away with something? Yes, but let her have it. I mean, she's already in jail. It's called life. I think -- you know what I think? I think Donald Trump should do something really, really brilliant right now. So Comey's out, Hillary's out, make Hillary be FBI director. 
GUIFOYLE: Have her investigate herself.
GUTFELD: Have her investigate herself.
(CROSSTALK)
PERINO: If the FBI investigation and the way President Trump thinks it will, which is that there's no evidence of collusion. Then, at that point, maybe he should just tell the FBI that he's request is that they let this one go. But after the investigation is over. 
GUIFOYLE: All right, Jesse, what do you make? 
WATTERS: I'd like to see they reopened the investigation. I like to see them pursue an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Remember, the Clinton Foundation, I think right before Hillary's state department approve the access for these uranium deposits here in North America, money flowed into the foundation for Russian interests. And then on the email case, I think that her I.T. guy got immunity, took the fifth, and for other associates of Hillary took immunity. You know, I don't see how firing an FBI director is a cover-up, but keeping a secret server, deleting 30,000 emails under subpoena, and then smashing your iPhone with a blackberry is not a cover-up. It strikes me as a cover-up. And then the left keeps talking about collusion between Trump and Russia, I think collusion is when someone at CNN like Donna Brazile gives the big questions to Hillary ahead of time, that strikes more is collusion. 
BECKEL: Is this Groundhog Day? 
(CROSSTALK)
BECKEL: No, because you've get the same talking points when you're on a rally, same thing with Hillary Clinton. Nobody cares about that. We're building this whole segment again, with all due respect, we're building this on the basis of a former FBI guy, who says that they do that. There not going to do that. It's another way to try to cover up for Trump's actions in Russia, and you try to bring us again. Guys like you, want to bring it out again.
(CROSSTALK)
GUIFOYLE: What actions in Russia? Bob, you just literally making stuff up. What actions in Russia? There's no evidence or proof of that. Yet, you keep putting forward this false narrative and it's puzzling and disturbing at the same time. 
BECKEL: It's puzzling and disturbing? 
GUIFOYLE: Yeah.
BECKEL: Then why are they having this investigation? 
GUTFELD: I have a solution for this.
GUIFOYLE: So far.
GUTFELD: Hear me out, guys. Hear me out, I have a solution. 
(CROSSTALK)
BECKEL: Why would they do that?
GUIFOYLE: No additional funds have been requested. 
WATTERS: You've just said there's no evidence. And then you've just said Trump doing serious things in Russia. 
BECKEL: I didn't say there was no evidence. I said that it's not out yet. 
WATTERS: OK.
BECKEL: But your story is like -- role of you from three years ago. 
GUTFELD: Do you not see the parallel in these stories that they're exactly the same. That on one side you have people screaming about Russia and Putin and collusion, and on the other side you have people screaming about Hillary and emails. They're almost identical if you took out the subjects and reversed them, you wouldn't know the difference. So my point is why don't they just cancel it out? You can have your story, we'll have ours.
BECKEL: Screaming about the Clinton email.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Comey, after an overwhelming amount of evidence dropped the case against Hillary, and of a very little evidence so far pursuing this Russia thing. That's a very big difference to me. 
BECKEL: That's because you don't know what evidence they're pursuing. They may have 28.
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: It's pretty clear when Hillary had the secret server.
(CROSSTALK)
BECKEL: They made a decision. He made a decision, didn't he? That's over. 
WATTERS: Not yet. It might be reopened. 
(CROSSTALK)
GUIFOYLE: You should be worried it if there's no evidence.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Bob, this is a family hour. 
BECKEL: You're right. I'm sorry, it is.
GUTFELD: Is it really nice, you meant? Santa Claus is really nice.
BECKEL: Nice.
GUTFELD: There you go.
BECKEL: There really is a Santa Claus.
GUTFELD: Yes.
BECKEL: I got yelled at that before. 
GUIFOYLE: Can I go?
GUTFELD: No. 
PERINO: Yes.
GUTFELD: Let's go now to a commercial break. 
GUIFOYLE: More cowardly action by college students. We'll show you a stunning active disrespect, right after this break. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
GUTFELD: So you want to talk about bravery, the difference between standing alone and predictable groupthink? Role this please. Compare Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, giving a commencement speech and then the students at Bethune-Cookman University where she was on Wednesday:
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
EDUCATION SECRETARY BETSY DEVOS: I am honored to become a wildcat. 
(PEOPLE BOOING) 
DEVOR: And it's a real honor and privilege to be with you as we celebrate the Bethune-Cookman University class of 2017.
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
GUTFELD: As DeVos took the podium at this historic black college, many grads turn their back on her, others booed and heckled. Still, she persisted. Not that the left who throw that phrase around would care. They enjoy seeing an outsider get clobbered. See how the media reacted. Mediaite, an industry web site that vomits predictable assumptions said that, quote, maybe DeVos should have taken the hint because of an earlier petition that was circulated against her appearance at the school. Meaning: Don't show up. So there's a solution. If people wish to silence you, stay home. Censorship, approved by the media. Other reporters on Twitter seem to enjoy the mass bullying too.
So imagine if Betsy wasn't Betsy, but Michelle Obama, a Hillary, a Liz Warren, what would be media industry's take then? We know the answer. Because we know the media isn't much different that today's students. After all, campuses are where the intolerant left-wing sausages made and we've just got another glimpse of the assembly line where the cases get filled.
So this is -- I want to do - - I've got to give credit for the college because the college could have canceled and they didn't. They went through it. A lot of people canceled these events, or I mean cancelled these speakers, but they went through it. This was Edison Jackson, who is the president.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNINDENTIFIED MALE: If this behavior continues, your degrees will be mailed to you. Choose which way you want to go.
(END VIDEO CLIP) GUTFELD: I thought that was great, Kimberly. 
GUIFOYLE: I love it. I mean, this unbelievable the kind of behavior you're seeing in colleges. Imagine if your child went there and behaved that way. It's so disrespectful to somebody that had the courage to show up and be able to speak to them, somebody who strongly supports education and educational choice. It's really sad what's happening and it's happening very quickly in rapid succession across this country. And it's not -- institutions of education. It's institution of ignorance that don't even let anybody speak or try to listen or understand a different point of view. I think she handled herself with composure, and I commend the university for the way they handled it. 
GUTFELD: Yeah. You know, bob, I'm sure that their student who disagree with her policies, but isn't it better to just listen, maybe? You might -- who knows? 
BECKEL: Keep in mind, a couple of things. I've spoken at Bethune-Cookman and it is a historical black college. It needs federal funding to stay alive as to the other ones. And the Trump administration and Ms. DeVos who is probably never been in a crowd that large with people who are -- I would get in trouble for saying that -- but I don't think. 
GUTFELD: Because you don't know that it's true. 
BECKEL: It would be a good guess.
(CROSSTALK)
BECKEL: The Trump administration has said that they would like to do away with federal funding for most universities. And if that were to happen, this school would go under. This woman has attacked over and over the public education system, and particularly in Detroit and in minority areas. These kids came out of those schools and made their way through and are graduating, and this woman has done everything she can with all the millions of dollars she has, to undermine public education. 
GUTFELD: Or make it better. 
BECKEL: You may think to make it better, but this woman has been attacking.
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Everybody is pro-choice.
GUIFOYLE: The left wants to limit the choices.
BECKEL: No, no, no, we don't.
GUIFOYLE: That's what you're saying. BECKEL: I don't want to limit choices, but we can't -- you're not going to be able to get every child into another school. 
GUIFOYLE: So that makes it OK?
BECKEL: Yes.
GUIFOYLE: Like two bags end the break?
BECKEL: No, no, no, because one of the things that Republicans do -- you all jump on public education. You know most people in this country like their public education. 
(CROSSTALK)
WATTERS: Those people like their health care, too, right?
BECKEL: Listen, it's like saying you've made a bad choice like going to a public school system. These kids, if I were them, I would not have showed up, number one. The real person who I think the villain here, whoever invited this right wing anti-minority school person. 
GUTFELD: Anti-minority is code for racist. 
BECKEL: I didn't say that. 
GUTFELD: Well, you said anti-minority means racist.
BECKEL: I'm not educated like you.
GUTFELD: Jesse, it took guts for her to do that. She probably knew she was walking into a lion's den and went through it. 
WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, she handled it with a lot of class. And I respect the university administrator who told those kids to pipe down. You know the left -- they're so tolerant and they're for respecting women and open dialogue, and then they behave like this. It's pretty embarrassing. You know, I disagree with Bob on almost everything you've just said. I don't think that Trump wants to take away funding for all of higher education. I haven't really heard that ever. 
GUIFOYLE: I haven't heard that one, have you? 
WATTERS: Let me know when you find out what the sources on that, I'd be happy to look.
BECKEL: I'll be happy to bring it tomorrow. Are you going to show up?
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: Dana?
PERINO: Oh, my God.
(CROSSTALK)
GUIFOYLE: Unbelievable.
(CROSSTALK) GUTFELD: You remind me of -- never mind. Dana? 
PERINO: This is what I would say quickly, the fact that people decided to go into public service, they're already making some sort of a sacrifice. I'm not talking monetarily, but I mean putting yourself out there and advocating for positions that they might disagree with. But I actually think that for going there, that the school -- giving her an honorary degree, giving her this moment.
GUTFELD: Right.
PERINO: . sort of Ben said, do you mind if we have a cup of coffee afterwards we really want to talk to you about our position, and they probably would have gotten a lot farther. 
GUTFELD: They gave her an honorary degree. That's for a reason. 
PERINO: I think that the university was trying to do the right thing and it just backfired. 
GUTFELD: Yeah. Well, I think it front fired. 
(CROSSTALK)
GUTFELD: I think I invented a word. 
GUIFOYLE: I'm glad that they stood up.
GUTFELD: But they gave her an honorary degree. They must know something, and you don't, Bob. 
BECKEL: There's nobody who gives a commencement speech still get an honorary degree.
GUIFOYLE: Well, they're very open-minded there. I mean, Bob? 
GUTFELD: Bob, did they give you an honorary degree? 
BECKEL: No. 
(LAUGHTER)
BECKEL: I've given commencement speeches twelve times, and I'm the only one who has never gotten an honorary degree. 
GUTFELD: I wonder why.
BECKEL: I'll tell you son, it's like this. 
GUTFELD: Today, the Trump administration announced the result of a massive six-week anti-gang operation, details next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BECKEL: OK, folks, it's my block that stand for two minutes, we're going to do this very quickly. It's about the immigration -- and asked the results of the largest gang sweep ever. The six-weeks nationwide operation resulted in more than 1300 arrests, including over 100 from the notorious gang, MS-13. OK, let's talk about this. Jesse, is that good, great, wonderful? 
WATTERS: Yes, it's a good thing. He's keeping his campaign promise, keep the bad hombres out. And I think the street is safer. The kids are safer. And I don't see how anyone could have a problem with that. 
BECKEL: All right, Dana?
PERINO: Well, this shows the government can still work while there might be chaos in terms of the White House press office today trying to manage the story. The other parts of government work apace. And this is a campaign promise that was made. There's also that other story about the little boy that was hurt by the illegal immigrant. And I think the feds do need to explain why they haven't done the reentry statute.
(CROSSTALK) GUIFOYLE: He came in 15 times. 
GUTFELD: I would like to take a page from Jimmy Kimmel, and apologize to all of those people who don't want violent gang members who murder and deal drugs arrested. We are heartless people to want to have safe streets and protect our families and children.
BECKEL: Kimberly? 
GUIFOYLE: I think that President Trump should be commended on this, very serious crackdown on gang. And I worked as a gang prosecutor in Los Angeles. 
GUTFELD: When? 
GUIFOYLE: . MS-13. Read the Wikipedia.
(LAUGHTER)
GUIFOYLE: MS-13 is one of the most notorious gangs and they really prey on young males to come in, especially that don't have fathers. Who come in here through refugee or asylum programs to take them in, and then indoctrinate them into the gang. They're also prevalent in the prison system as well. So, I think this is a big step forward and no one should object to these guys being swept up. 
BECKEL: I don't think anybody object either. I think it's terrific. But one thing I should point out here, of the 1300 people, almost 1,000 of them were American citizens, number one. 
PERINO: But they got swept up and get prosecuted. 
BECKEL: No. Secondly, this extensive six-week planning and implementation of this was done in November, as I'm told that it started in the Obama administration decided to move forward on this. So, we'll give Trump some credit here because he usually gets credit around this table, except for me. One more thing, Mr. President is up next. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PERINO: It's time now for one more thing. Greg? 
GUTFELD: All right, time for this. I hate these people. You know, when I'm on a subway and I see you coming onto the subway and I offer you my seat because I think that would be the nice thing to do, don't say no. Just don't. Because you know what, it's embarrassing and it's disrespectful. And then I stand up and stand there and the seat is empty, and you stand there because you refused to take the chair because you don't want it. So you have two people staring at an empty seat while others are staring at us going, those people are weird. You know what? Take the seat if it's offered. 
PERINO: This is great New York City advice in case you're coming to visit. 
GUTFELD: There're subways all over the world, dana. They're all underground.
PERINO: All right, Bob. 
BECKEL: Mr. President, I'm told -- so let me apologize to a concept that you are not aware of. Now, I'm listening to you and the American people that say you're going to release your taxes when your audit is done. Well, nobody cares you said, except the reporters. That's not right. Poll shows over 75 percent of the American people like to see your tax, but you said, let's wait -- is done. Now you're saying I will release it after I get out of office. Good job, Mr. President, another untruth. 
PERINO: I'm not sure it's untruth. All right, Kimberly, you're next. 
GUIFOYLE: So check this up it's a World War II veteran ran in his 96th birthday and a pretty spectacular way by jumping out of an airplane. This is Delton Walling a Pearl Harbor survivor, and he's no stranger to skydiving. He said that the birthday jump which took place in Lodi, California, will be his last, however. He said he would focus on his busy schedule and big plans for travelling and giving motivational speeches. So this is very cool. So every time he said you do something like this, it makes you feel pretty good. And we want to thank you, sir, for your service.
PERINO: That's cool. I've never done that. All right, Jesse. 
WATTERS: So a good Samaritan saved someone's life in China the other day. There he goes. Runs his motorcycle into this truck, catches on fire, and guys come over and rescue him and help put him out. And now he is in the hospital. And he is going to survive this fiery crash. So he should be thanking these people, very, very lucky man. 
PERINO: Absolutely. All right. So imagine this, another one from overseas. You're biking down a trail, and out of nowhere a bear joins you for the ride. This has happened in Slovakia. He kept pace with him for a while before he paled off. I would be very nervous if that happened.
GUIFOYLE: At least they have the GoPro. 
GUTFELD: These are great segments to tease earlier in the show. But we don't. 
GUIFOYLE: The bear, charges.
GUTFELD: Yes, and that accident. That's amazing footage. We should have a whole segment called amazing footage. 
PERINO: It's fun to have a staff meeting on air. 
GUTFELD: It is. I should just have written that in an email later. 
PERINO: All right. Well, it has been real fun, never miss an episode of "The Five." Don't forget to set your DVRs recorded nightly. "Hannity" is up next.
