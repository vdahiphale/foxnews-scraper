     Video  Gutfeld: Media change their tune on town hall protests 
Unlike their coverage of Tea Party protests, the press is giving very sympathetic coverage to angry crowds at some GOP town hall meetings 
Oh, how the networks embraced the recent town hall protests:

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {

DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS: We begin tonight with Americans across this country determined to have their voices heard, and their target, members of Congress home for break. What they are getting instead is an earful.

ANDREA MITCHELL, NBC NEWS: The politics that we've been seeing, Tea Party politics and like really reach a new level of white supremacism of anti-African-American rhetoric.

Remember that? Oh, the good old days. So, the new protests get this, those are concerned citizens but remember the other ones? They are racists. Just so you get that clear. And what an odd coincidence that just before these new folks are crashing the current town halls, there were mobilization efforts by left-wing groups to crash the very same town halls. How did the networks miss that coincidence?
The New York post reports on an Obama-linked group called Organizing for Action offering training manuals and tips on Facebook that show you how to disrupt events. Tips which oddly then appear at the protests. How did that happen? The advice: Go into halls quietly so as to not raise alarm and grab a seat to the front. But do not all sit together by spreading out in pairs, the whole room looks pissed off reinforcing the lie that everyone agrees. Also, ask hostile questions and loudly boo whenever possible. Meaning act like Keith Olbermann. And finally, give the video footage away to the hungry media who bleakly spread the free publicity. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, the goal is to cause chaos and fear and create the impression that even the safest leaders are far removed from their constituents. Meaning, foment a lie that these are sincere voters who disagree, when in fact they're cultivated in tactics of famed community organizers like Mr. Alinsky.
Perhaps it's too much to expect the networks to address this coordination, maybe because they are happy to be part of it.
