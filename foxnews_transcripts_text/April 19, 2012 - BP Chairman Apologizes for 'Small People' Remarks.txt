BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg has apologized for a remark that offended some of the very people he was trying to reassure. Svanberg said Wednesday his company cares about the "small people" hurt by the Gulf oil spill.
One New Orleans resident said, "We're not small people. We're human beings.  They're no greater than us. We don't bow down to them. We don't pray to them." 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
BP quickly attributed the mix-up to a slip in translation for the Swedish-born  Svanberg. But later the chairman admitted he spoke clumsily and that he was very sorry. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Staying Busy

The Democratic National Committee is accusing Republicans of politicizing the Gulf tragedy. A new RNC video hits President Obama for engaging in a variety of activities over the past 58 days, all before meeting with BP executives.
Smoke Signals

We told you Wednesday about a woman in Britain who received a double lung transplant -- from a 30-year smoker.
Today the Press Association reports a cancer patient says he was told by the British government-run health care appointment line he could not book a doctor's appointment because their records showed he was dead. He tried explaining he was alive, but they referred him back to his doctor to sort it out.
