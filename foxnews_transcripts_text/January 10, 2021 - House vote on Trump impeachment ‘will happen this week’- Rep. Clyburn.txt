CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I'm Chris Wallace.Calls grow to remove President Trump from office with just ten days left inhis administration.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (voice-over):  The president facing accusations his words helpedset that deadly assault on the Capitol in motion.With his inner circle shrinking, a push is underway to remove him frompower.REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL):  It's time to invoke the 25th Amendment and toend this nightmare.WALLACE:  And Democrats discuss an alternative.REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  If the vice president andcabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward withimpeachment.WALLACE:  But the president tries to head off calls for removal by finallyadmitting he lost.DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  A new administration will beinaugurated on January 20th. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth,orderly, and seamless transition of power.WALLACE:  We'll discuss the final turbulent days of the Trump presidencywith former White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who resigned from anadministration post this week. And the possibility of a second impeachmentwith House Majority Whip James Clyburn.Plus, Twitter bans President Trump from its platform, saying his recenttweets glorified violence. We'll ask our Sunday panel about the power ofbig tech to restrict free speech.All, right now, on "FOX News Sunday".(END VIDEOTAPE)WALLACE (on camera):  And hello again from FOX News in Washington.This is a week that has shaken the nation's capital to its core, a weekthat brought a direct assault on our democracy. We saw the president of theUnited States urged tens of thousands of people not to accept the resultsof the election, to march on Congress and demand they stop the steal.We saw senators, self-proclaimed adherence to the text of the Constitution,ignore the 155 million Americans who voted and say Congress should decidewho the next president is.We saw a mob of insurrectionist storm the capital, lay waste to the officesof elected leaders, invade the Senate chamber, and even sit in the chairthe vice president occupied moments before. And now this -- we saw a non-scalable 7-foot fence go up around the capitol grounds. For all the talkabout the barrier on our southern border, this is the wall many willremember is the true mark of Donald Trump's presidency.This hour, we'll discuss it all -- the resignations, the calls to removethe president, and the search to find some way to put the pieces of ourgovernment back together.In a moment, we'll speak with former White House Chief of Staff MickMulvaney and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.But first, let's turn to David Spunt at the White House with the latest ondemands for the president to step down or be forced out -- David.DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Chris, there was a very realpossibility Donald Trump could become the first president in Americanhistory to be impeached twice. It just takes the majority of the House todo so and Democrats are chomping at the bit.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TRUMP:  I want to thank you all.SPUNT (voice-over):  Minutes after President Trump spoke to the crowd,melee inside and outside of the United States Capitol. Five people,including a Capitol police officer, died.Trump administration officials continue to submit resignations, includingcabinet secretaries Elaine Chao and Betsy DeVos.A second impeachment could happen in just days.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  We don't need a lengthydebate. The president's abuse of power, his incitement of a mob against aduly elected representative body of the United States is a manifestlyimpeachable offense.SPUNT:  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she will move forward withimpeachment if Vice President Mike Pence decides against invoking the 25thAmendment and the president refuses to resign. If the House impeaches,Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the Senate won't get involveduntil January 19th at the soonest, the day before Trump leaves office.Some Republicans don't want to wait."I want him to resign, I want him out. He has caused enough damage", AlaskaRepublican Senator Lisa Murkowski told her hometown newspaper.Late Friday, Twitter bans the president's accounts permanently. A Twitterspokesperson says his tweets incited violence.(END VIDEOTAPE)SPUNT (on camera):  I'm told Vice President Pence will attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20th. President Trump said hewill not -- making him the first president to skip an inauguration sinceAndrew Johnson did so to General Ulysses Grant in 1869 -- Chris.WALLACE:  David Spunt reporting from the White House -- David, thank you.And joining us now, Mick Mulvaney, President Trump's former chief of staffwho resigned this week as the administration's special envoy to NorthernIreland.Mick, after all of the controversial things that Donald Trump did over thelast four years, why was this week the final straw? Why now, say, that youcould no longer be part of his administration?MICK MULVANEY, FORMER TRUMP CHIEF OF STAFF:  Chris, good morning. Thanksfor having me. I think everybody recognizes that what happened on Wednesdayis different. You can go down the long litany of things that peoplecomplained about with Donald Trump. And I could probably defend almost allof them. Many of them were policy differences, many of them were stylisticdifferences. But Wednesday was different. Wednesday was existential.Wednesday is one of those things that struck to the very heart of what itmeans to be an American.And it was wrong. And I think it was important for those of us who used tobe on the inner circle. I mean, look, you and I have been doing this foryears. I came in in 2010, you know, the Tea Party. I started the FreedomCaucus with Mark Meadows. I was in the cabinet. I was the chief of staff. Ithought it was important for somebody who is not establishment, who is nota Trump -- a never-Trumper to come out and say that, that was wrong. Itneeds to be said again and again and again by as many people as possible.WALLACE:  Should President Trump be removed from office in these final 10days? If you were a member of the cabinet, would you vote to invoke the25th Amendment? If you were still a member of Congress, would you vote toimpeach?MULVANEY:  Yes, I think the 25th Amendment is a very clumsy tool. We'venever used it under these circumstances. We typically used it when apresident goes for a medical procedure. We don't really know how to do it.And it's slow. It's not unusual we're talking about it. Again, this wassuch an extreme event on Wednesday it's not surprising we're looking atextreme possible reactions to what happened on Wednesday.Regarding impeachment, I think it depends. I know the Democrats are goingto introduce articles of impeachment on Monday. If it's just related toWednesday, that's one thing. If it's the type of impeachment that justbecomes a list of complaints of why they don't like Donald Trump, that'ssomething else. But I think it's different now than the impeachment waslast year.Last year the impeachment was a witch hunt. It was a political thing. Theywere looking for an excuse to impeach the president forever. Now it'sdifferent and I think it will be looked at very differently by members ofboth the House and the Senate.WALLACE:  So directly, if you were still a member of Congress and it wasimpeachment for incitement to violence, which is what this article ofimpeachment is, specifically over the events this last week, would you voteto impeach this president?MULVANEY:  Yes, (INAUDIBLE) sort of sit here and say yes or no, but I wouldtake it really, really seriously, Chris. I'm not trying to dodge yourquestion. But that's probably the most serious question you can ask anymember of Congress. And to sort of give a flip answer based on sitting heretalking about it.You want to sit down, you want to hear the arguments, want to parse out thespeeches that the president made, that his son made, that Rudy Giulianimade. Look at what actually happened that day, look at what happened duringthe day. What did the president say while it was going on, what did thepresident say afterwards. All of that would be evidence that needs to betaken into consideration.But I can assure you, there will be members of both parties who look at itvery differently than they did last year in the previous impeachment.WALLACE:  Mick, when you announced your resignation this week, you saidthat you felt, quote, "embarrassment and shame."  Do you feel anyresponsibility -- you were chief of staff for more than a year -- do youfeel any responsibility for Donald Trump?MULVANEY:  I feel a emotions this week. I was shocked, I was angered, I wassad, I was embarrassed, I was frustrated. And I still am trying to figureout what I could have done differently, if anything. I've been out of theWhite House now for eight months.What I do know, Chris, is there are things that are different. When we sawthe president -- I wrote a piece in the "Wall Street Journal" six weeks agosaying that I thought the president would leave in a presidential manner. Ireally did believe that at the time.The stories I told to back that up were true.I've seen the president be presidential before and I know that he has theability to do it, he did it every single day. I don't know what'sdifferent; if it's different now, if it's different about his advisors.He used to love vigorous debate from all sides of a particular issue. Idon't know if he still has that in the White House. I don't know if nowhe's surrounded himself with people like Rudy Giuliani and Peter Navarrothat simply tell him what he wants to hear and reaffirm exactly what theythink he wants them to say.That's a very dangerous position for any president to be in. I think thepresident, either he's different, the people around him are different orboth, but something is very different now that we saw when I worked theremore than eight months ago.WALLACE:  Mick, respectfully, there are people who say he isn't different,this is the Donald Trump you worked for. (Inaudible) John Kelly who wasyour predecessor as White House chief of staff says he gave this advice tothe president when he left in December of 2018. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)JOHN KELLY, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF (Voice Over): I said please don't hire aboot licker or a yes man because you will be impeached. And towards the endof my time there, all I ever heard from some of the real devotees in theWhite House was you got to let Trump be Trump, let Trump be Trump.(END VIDEOCLIP)WALLACE:  Kelly says specifically that you and others didn't have the spineto tell the president, "no."MULVANEY:  That's not true and I'm sorry to hear John say that -- not goingto pick a fight with John Kelly. The advice is good advice, not to surroundyourself with yes men.Look, we saw the president be presidential. I remember circumstances --WALLACE:  But he says you were one of the yes men, Mick.MULVANEY:  No, that -- well, he's just -- listen, John should know morethan anyone else that what happens when the doors close in the Oval Officeis not the stuff you see on TV. It's easy now, Chris, for people who don'tlike the president, who never liked the president, who always thought thepresident was a monster, wanted him to be that. People who saw them throughthe filter of the media to say, oh, look, we told you so, we knew it wasalways going to be like this.But those of us who worked with him every single day knew that the exactopposite was true. Knew that he was into the policy, he was excited aboutwhat we had done for the country. Unemployment was down, we didn't have anynew foreign wars; we had a lot of successes to point to despite all ofthose sort of stylistic things that people like John Kelly just reallydidn't like.But we had those successes and we were very proud of the work that we weredoing, very proud of letting the president be the president because he waselected as the president. But again, all of that changed --WALLACE:  But -- but --MULVANEY:  -- on Wednesday. And I don't know why.WALLACE:  But again, Mick, a lot of people say it didn't change onWednesday. Kelly was right. The president was impeached when you were Chiefof Staff for cutting of aid to Ukraine, allegedly, unless they dug up dirton Joe Biden. And here you were at that time defending the president. Takea look.(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)UNKNOWN: This is (inaudible) is a quid pro quo. It is funding will not flowunless the investigation is in (ph) -- if a Democratic server (ph) happenedas well.MULVANEY: We do that all the time with foreign policy.(END VIDEOCLIP)WALLACE: Whether the president should have been impeached or not, I don'twant to get into that argument, why didn't you resign over that?MULVANEY: Because I simply misspoke. And I've had that conversation withJohn Koe (ph) who was the gentlemen asking that question. A friend of minemany, many times. But it's actually really a --WALLACE: I'm not talking about --MULVANEY: -- good example --WALLACE: I'm not talking about your statement, Mick. I'm talking about whynot resign over what I'm -- I know you don't think was a proper thing forthe president to do, cut off aid to Ukraine --MULVANEY: No, no. No, no. Chris --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: -- digging up dirt on Joe Biden.MULVANEY: No, no, no. But, Chris -- no, no. (Inaudible). That originalimpeachment -- and I don't (ph) realize we were going to get into thistoday, had absolutely nothing to do with anything that was actually wrong.It was the Democrats looking for an excuse and they found one line in atranscript with Zelensky saying, do us a favor, that allowed them -- gavethem the political excuse they needed to do an impeachment.We all know, or at least many of us know and expect that that was -- thatwas an impeachment looking for an excuse. It was a political event. It wasa show trial. And, again, I don't want to get into this too heavily today.But that has nothing to do with what we're --WALLACE: OK.MULVANEY: -- doing today. The reason I didn't -- the reason I didn't resignright then (ph) is the president did nothing wrong. The president didnothing wrong back then.WALLACE: Well, OK. Let me --MULVANEY: Nothing (ph) --WALLACE: Let me ask you about some other things. You were a top member ofthe administration when the president defended the White supremacists atCharlottesville. You were a top (ph) member of the administration, notChief of Staff, when the Trump administration separated parents comingacross the border from their children.Why not resign over those?MULVANEY: Because it -- the -- I remember the kids in cages thing, whichwas -- which a lot of folks gave a lot of attention to and we seem to haveforgotten, including you Chris, that those pictures -- many of the picturesof the kids in cages were taken during the Obama administration. They wereObama caged --WALLACE: Nothing --(CROSSTALK)WALLACE: -- nothing like with (ph) the policy under Donald Trump.MULVANEY: Chris, these are policy differences, OK? These are things thatyou think the country should look one way, we think it should look another.These are differences of style, the way the president speaks. Did hemisspeak at Charlottesville? Yes. Should he have corrected it? Yes. Did hehandle it poorly? Yes. But it was not something that people resign over.If you talk as a living, as you and I do, you're going to misspeak fromtime to time. It's inevitable. Those are not the type of things to giverise to resignations. In fact, I don't think anybody including John Kellyresigned during any of those. As I recall, John Kelly got fired and didn'tresign.Wednesday was different. And I hope that we focus on why Wednesday wasdifferent than something about a policy over immigration or a policy on howto handle this or that. This is different and I think it's important thatpeople recognize the differentiations between differences of policy andwhat happened on Wednesday.WALLACE: Finally, on November 7th, you pointed this out and I want to -- Iwant to ask you specifically about it. On November 7th, four days after theelection, as you point out, you wrote an article for The Wall StreetJournal. I want to put some of it up.You said, the U.S. needs to know that the winner is actually the winner.And once Americans know that, I have every expectation that Mr. Trump willbe, act, and speak like a great president should, win or lose.Mick, how could someone who worked with the president so closely for threeyears be so wrong about who Donald Trump was?MULVANEY: Then clearly, something is different now than it was when you sawit.I wrote that article for a reason, because I've seen the examples. I thinkif you read the piece, I give a couple of examples. In there, I told (ph),this one is another example that I've never talked about publicly, which isthat during the impeachment, the president tweeted something during thetestimony and there was concern that it might rise to level of tamperingwith witnesses.I know a little bit about the law. I practiced law a long time ago. Itwasn't that, but I was worried about the political impact of that.So, I went to the president, privately, said, Mr. President, there's goingto be a political problem. We need to fix this.He looked at me, and said, OK, brought the lawyers down, talked to them,picked up the phone, called Kevin McCarthy. Brought Ivanka in, talked tothem, talked to some of his friends in New York. Got a bunch of differentopinions, and then fixed it, reversed course and did the right thing.That was the president that we saw time and again. You saw him through themedia, you saw him the light that you wanted to see him.We saw the real President Trump who had that ability to pivot when he knewsomething had gone off the rails.That didn't happen on Wednesday. It hasn't much since the election, andthat's what I think the difference is and that's why I got that piece sowrong six weeks ago.WALLACE:  Mick, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk withyou, sir.MULVANEY:  Thanks, Chris.WALLACE:  Up next, House Speaker Pelosi moves to impeach President Trumpfor the second time. We'll ask Majority Whip Jim Clyburn about that, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE:  House Democrats have drafted a new article of impeachment againstPresident Trump, if members of the Trump cabinet do not take action toremove him. The resolution could be introduced as soon as tomorrow.Joining us now, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.And, Congressman, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday".REP. JIM CLYBURN (D-SC), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP:  Thank you very much forhaving me.WALLACE:  Have Speaker Pelosi and you and the Democratic leadership -- haveyou made a firm, final decision whether or not to vote on impeachment ofPresident Trump this week?CLYBURN:  I think so. I think that will come probably Tuesday and maybeWednesday, but it will happen this week. The articles have been drawn up.Jamie Raskin and the leadership have been working very hard to make surethat it is exactly what is required to demonstrate to the Senate, well,maybe the House first, that this president has rendered himself dulyunqualified to be president.WALLACE:  Congressman, if the House does vote to impeach, will you hold offdelay sending it over to the Senate until those two Democrats who won inGeorgia are certified and Chuck Schumer becomes the majority leader? Whichalso raises the question, does it make sense for the Senate to have a trialeven after President Trump leaves office?CLYBURN:  Well, I don't know that that's the House's business. Our businessis to -- to impeach which is basically an indictment. And then time andcircumstances will determine when it will go over to the Senate.You may recall, that the first time that the president was impeached thatNancy Pelosi worked with the managers to make a determination as to when todeliver those articles to the Senate. They were not delivered the next day.They were delivered at a time that was most appropriate.And so, we'll do the same thing that -- in this instance.But remember, Chris, we tell voters all the time that your vote is yourvoice and I believe we have to practice the same thing. Our vote is ourvoice and we want to voice disapproval of the actions taken by thispresident last Wednesday and the week before down in -- the vote inGeorgia.WALLACE:  Congressman, there are -- I -- I understand the reasons to voteto impeach. There are some practical arguments against impeachment. Itfurther divides the country. It mobilizes the Trump base.Perhaps most importantly, it could interfere with Joe Biden beginning hisadministration, confirming his nominees, getting to work.Do you find any of those arguments persuasive?CLYBURN:  Yes. I find all of them to be persuasive. But that doesn't meanthat the House should not do its work.Remember the Senate determines guilt or innocence and that has to do withthe Senate's schedule.Now, the House has to do its business. We call ourselves the people house.The vast majority of the American people -- I saw the full results thismorning say this man should be removed from office. So if we are thepeople's house, let's do the people's work and let's vote to impeach thispresident and then we'll decide later or the Senate will decide later whatto do with that -- an impeachment.WALLACE:  Let's go back to the events of Wednesday afternoon, as a veteranof the civil rights movement you have seen plenty of violence before, buthonestly, how worried were you about the safety of your colleagues in theHouse and yourself?CLYBURN:  Well, Chris, I've been telling my friends and relatives that I'ma little bit concerned with the fact that on Wednesday I never got afraid.I was not afraid at all.The police that were assigned to me, the Capitol police did a remarkablejob. They got me off the floor. In fact, I turn around and a so-calledundisclosed secure location, Nancy Pelosi and I arrived there at the exactsame time.So I want to thank the Capitol police that were in charge of my safety.They did a great job. I just wish they had the leadership at the top thatthey're deserving of.WALLACE:  Well, let me ask you, though, because you have an unmarked officeinside the Capitol. And you say that although it doesn't say "Jim Clyburn"on it, doesn't say "House Majority Whip" on it, that the mob found it onWednesday.Do you think that there is the possibility that they had some inside helpfrom people inside the Capitol or even perhaps at some level of the Capitolpolice?CLYBURN:  Well, I don't know that, and I was not making the accusation. Iwas just telling you what the facts are.There is a marked office, got my name on the door. But they didn't botherthat office. They went to the office where I usually work and where Iusually am. And for some reason they found that office. I have no ideawhether or not they were up there before, whether they got some otherschemes. Somebody may have just talked about it.So I'm not going to make that accusation. I do know this, my staff was inmy office. They were -- had all the furniture and stuff at the door. Andthere were people trying to get in.WALLACE:  President-elect Biden this week had this to say about the eventson Wednesday, the riot and the assault on the Capitol on Wednesday. Take alook, sir.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  No one can tell me had it been a group ofBlack Lives Matter protesting yesterday there wouldn't have been -- theywouldn't have been treated very, very differently.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE:  Congressman, do you think that there was a race component to thepolice response on Wednesday as compared to some demonstrations -- well,over the years but specifically the Black Lives Matter protests thissummer?CLYBURN:  Absolutely. And I think that everybody in the country,irrespective of what side of that question you'd be maybe on, you knowthere was a difference in the way they treated these, you may call themprotesters, I call them insurrectionists, and the way they treated thepeaceful protesters of Black Lives Matter.And we saw what the president -- that's where they get their signals from,the president went out and ordered the removal of demonstrators near theWhite House so he could stand up with an upside-down Bible in front of St.John's Church. These people got their signals from him. That's the kind ofleadership that this president has been portraying. And there are a lot ofpeople who saw in that leadership how they should conduct themselves.That's why I said, and I'll say it again, that it's a shame that the hardworking rank-and-file Capitol police did not have better leadership.WALLACE:  Finally Congressman, Democrats are going to have a majority this-- in this session of Congress but not much of one. A one vote majority inthe Senate, a razor thin majority in the House.As a matter of practical politics, won't President Biden have to scale backhis agenda just to get anything passed through this Congress when it's sotightly divided?CLYBURN:  I do not think so. I don't think that's President Biden's agendashould be scaled back at all. He needs to be robust with it, simply becausethe people voted for it and everybody in the House and the Senate knowthat.I think he has to be careful how he makes these presentations. I think hehas to inform people as to what it is he's trying to do and hopefully getbipartisan support for it. I've said this before as well. If he doesn't getthe bipartisan support, do as Truman did. When he could not get theCongress to move to integrate the Armed Services, he issued an ExecutiveOrder.The Emancipation Proclamation was an Executive Order. I can go down throughhistory and show you how many times significant decisions have been made byExecutive Order.And so I think that Biden should make every effort to reach out to bothsides of the aisle to get common sense legislation passed. But if they'renot going to be cooperative, then he should use his executive authority andget it done.CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Congressman Clyburn, thank you. Thanks forjoining us this Sunday and please come back, sir.CLYBURN: Thank you very much for having me.WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss Twitter'sdecision to ban President Trump from its platform. A reasonable effort toprevent violence, or a restriction of free speech?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WALLACE: Coming up, Democrats clinch control of the Senate after twohistoric wins in Georgia.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): For the first time in six years, Democrats willoperate a majority in the United States Senate.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel what the new majority means for theBiden agenda.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MADISON CAWTHORN (R-NC): When you rip the tongue out of somebody whowould speak against you, you don't prove them to be a liar, rather you justprove that you're paralyzed with fear on the altar of oppression.REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): The reality is that Donald Trump committedsedition. He incited a violent group of domestic terrorists, andinsurrectionists, to go to the Capitol.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Two members of Congress, Republican Madison Cawthorn and DemocratPramila Jayapal, reacting to Twitter's decision to ban President Trump.And it's time now for our Sunday group.Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff and president of CavalryConsultants, Josh Holmes. Marie Harf, executive director of the ServeAmerica PAC. And Jonathan Swan from "Axios."Jonathan, Donald Trump says that he doubts he ever would have been electedpresident without Twitter. How is he taking the Twitter ban at this point?And, more generally, what do you since is -- or what are you hearing is hismood in his final days in the White House?JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, "AXIOS": Well, I've had anumber of conversations with President Trump over the last few years aboutTwitter and FaceBook and he said to me on several occasions that it's hismost powerful weapon, it's his most powerful tool, and he believes that.He may not be wrong, by the way. I mean he -- it's the way that hecommunicates directly with the American people. He goes around themainstream media. He can speak to -- I think he's combined audiences atleast 150 million, may be more than that. His Twitter audience wassomething like 88 million and it's an incredibly intense following. There'speople who just are addicted his Twitter feed. So he will see this is ahuge blow to him.I spoke to two people who have talked to the president in the last 24hours. They told me he wasn't yelling or raging. He's, obviously, veryangry about it. I know inside the White House right now they're trying toturn their attention for the next few days on how they can fight backagainst these social media companies. So I wouldn't be surprised -- I knowthat -- I mean one person last night said to me, everything's on the table.I don't what that means policy wise. I said are we talking executiveorders? They said, everything's on the table.I don't know what's achievable and what's realistic and what they canactually do in terms of executive action. But I can tell you, they arelooking very, very hard at that and Dan Scavino, the president's socialmedia guy, is heavily involved in that.WALLACE: Josh, Twitter is not a public utility, it's a private company. Ifit says, as it does, that there is continuing talk about insurrection onits platform, doesn't it have, one could argue, an obligation to policethat even if that rises up to the tweets of the president of the UnitedStates?JOSH HOLMES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO MITCH MCCONNELL, PRESIDENT ANDFOUNDING PARTNER, CAVALRY: Well, they certainly have the ability as aprivate company to do anything that they'd like to do, and that includesplatforming every conservative if they'd like to. I think the largerproblem here is any effort, historically-speaking, to stifle free speechultimately has resulted in making the problem that you're trying to curemuch, much worse because ultimately all of this speech gets funneled downinto smaller silos, to more extreme sects, to further radicalize and pushaway sort of mainstream thought. And I think you can see that alreadyhappening here.I'm less concerned about this in terms of what it means for Donald Trump'sTwitter account. I'm more concerned about the precedent that it sets forconservative speech going forward. And I think that is what mostRepublicans and conservatives are looking at as a real problem for whatTwitter has done here.WALLACE: Some of the blowback to the Twitter ban is based on how Twitterexplained, justified cutting off the president. I want to put up a coupleof explanations.Twitter said the president talking about American patriots is beinginterpreted on Twitter as support for the mob that attacked the Capitol.Twitter says the president announcing he won't attend the inauguration mayencourage people to attack on January 20th because he won't be there.Marie, is there some tortured reasoning there to ban President Trump fromTwitter and what about the decision of Amazon and other big tech companiesnow to basically shut down Parler, which is a social media platform thatconservatives have chosen instead of Twitter and FaceBook?MARIE HARF, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SERVE AMERICA PAC AND FOX NEWSCONTRIBUTOR:Well, Chris, Donald Trump has arguably violated Twitter's rules that theyhave for their platform for years now. So while these last tweets that heposted may not have been his worst, certainly he has done worse things onTwitter. They were, I think, probably the last straw.And the most interesting part of Twitter's statement, actually, I think,was the last statement, how they have information both from their platformand from other sources that Donald Trump was encouraging violence aroundthe inauguration to come. So not just punishing him for violence thatalready happened that left five people that on Wednesday, but that theywere looking forward and concerned about preventing further violence.And when it comes to Parler, I mean Parler is an even worse version ofTwitter where we've see multiple people calling for Vice President Pence tobe killed, including people that have been on President Trump's legal team.So I think these social media companies have always been drinking from afire hose when it comes to hate on their platforms. But when they saw andinsurrection jump from the pages of, you know, of Twitter from the posts ofTwitter to real life on Wednesday, it was different for them.WALLACE: Right.HARF: It became reality and not just words on a platform. And I thinkthat's why they took such drastic action.WALLACE: Meanwhile, there are growing calls to remove President Trumpeither through the 25th Amendment or through impeachment and trial in theSenate.Here is Republican Senator Pat Toomey. Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA): I do think the president's behavior this week doesdisqualify him from serving. I do think the president committed impeachableoffenses.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: I don't think you can overstate how bitter feelings are in theRepublican Party towards President Trump. Just this morning, Pat Toomey,that senator you just saw, has escalated and now says he believes thatDonald Trump should resign immediately.And, over the weekend, a source close to Vice President Pence tells me thatwhen Pence, the mob had broken through and Pence had been taken down to abunker in the basement of the U.S. Capitol, that President Trump -- this iscoming from a source close to Pence -- President Trump never reached out toinquire about Pence's safety and to this day has never condemned the peoplethat were in the Capitol on Wednesday calling to hang Vice President Pence.All of this leads to the question, Josh, as the former chief of staff toMitch McConnell, what do you think are the prospects that the Senate, ifthere's an impeachment, will vote to remove Donald Trump as president,either -- either to convict him and remove him while he's still presidentor even after he leaves, to convict him and say he can never run for officeagain?HOLMES: Well, I mean the behavior that you described just now, Chris, isobviously abhorrent and I think that there is a much stronger case forimpeachment now than there certainly was a year ago when I stronglydisagreed with the case that was made.I thought the interesting part of your interview with RepresentativeClyburn was his suggestion that they would move to impeach in the House andthen hold the paperwork, essentially not giving it over to the Senate,because it's important to note that once the Senate receives articles ofimpeachment, they have to proceed expeditiously. It's not an option. Theyactually have to do it.You saw a memo over the weekend saying that they wouldn't move until the19th, that they couldn't move until the 19th. If the papers were deliveredat that point, it would be literally right on top of the Bideninauguration. Clearly Democrats don't want to do that. And so thesuggestion that Clyburn made there was that they would hold it for a periodof time.Now, once it gets to the Senate, that's Chuck Schumer's Senate. Obviouslyhe's the new majority leader at that point and they're going to have toproceed with a case and a trial. The Senate doesn't convict without hearingevidence from both sides. I don't know ultimately where the votes lead. Ido know that their case is much stronger than it was a year ago.WALLACE: All right, panel, we have to take a break. We'll leave it there.When we come back, Joe Biden's agenda. With Democrats now in control ofCongress, what can he get through and what can Republicans still block?(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: I am focused now on ustaking control as president and vice president on the 20th and to get ouragenda moving as quickly as we can.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: President-elect Biden ducking questions about impeachment as heprepares to take office in just ten days.And we're back now with the panel.Josh, Joe Biden will have majorities in the House and Senate, but prettysmall ones, razor-thin, really, in both houses. Given the fact that he'llhave just 51 votes in the Senate, but that is enough for budgetreconciliation, it is enough to confirm your nominees if the Democrats allline up behind him, what do you think that he can get through in the Senateand what do you think Republicans will still be able to block?HOLMES: Well, I think the first biggest decision he needs to make withDemocratic leaders is whether they want the first hundred days to be miredin an impeachment trial about his predecessor, which, you know, it clearlywould have an impact on everything that -- from his legislative agenda tohis nominees.The only thing that really changed on Tuesday with the two wins in Georgiawhere the nominations and confirmations. He can clearly go through aDemocratic majority and work through those pretty quickly. But he's goingto need a substantial bipartisan effort to get any sort of legislationacross the finish line because of that 60 vote threshold. They do not havethe votes to try to limit the filibuster. So there's going to need to besome bipartisanship.The one caveat to that is the budget. If they can pass a budget, they canthen operate in this sort of arcane reconciliation rules that ultimatelyallow them to change tax policy with a simple majority. That's a big thingto watch in the first quarter and I think something that thisadministration will focus on.WALLACE: Marie, what's your sense of Biden's legislative calendar schedule?What do you get the sense he's going to push first? What do you think he'llput off until later in the year? And given the fact that, you know, it'snow just a few votes in the House and one vote in the Senate, do you thinkthere's some parts of the agenda that he campaigned on that are just goingto go on the back burner?HARF: Well, Chris, I think, number one has to be getting his team in place.And that involves dealing with everything from COVID to the economy andjobs to national security. And so I do think that there's a strong sensethat confirmations have to happen immediately. And then paired with that isthe question of additional COVID relief for Americans. He has talked aboutthe $2,000 checks, getting more relief to small businesses, gettingunemployment relief to people. I think that will be a first priority aswell.Obviously, the vaccination program isn't really legislative. I thinkthey'll probably be more focused on that through executive action and theexecutive branch.But I actually think that this is an opportunity for senators like JoeManchin, Chris Coons, Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, the folks clusteredaround the middle of both parties, to come together to help Biden getthings passed like infrastructure for example, things passed like tweaks toour health care system. You know, Joe Biden did not campaign on huge,radical change, he campaigned on working across the aisle to address thingslike prescription drugs. And so I think that once we get through thisinitial period of time where he gets his team in place and works to reallyattack the coronavirus issue, those are the kinds of things he's going tolook at.WALLACE: Wednesday afternoon, when the insurrectionist were still insidethe Capitol, President Trump put out this video.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This was a fraudulentelection, but we can't play into the hands of these people. We have to havepeace.(END VIDEO CLIP)WALLACE: Jonathan, from what your sources are telling you, does DonaldTrump think that after January 20th he still has a role to play in nationalpolitics and that he still has a base that will follow and support him?SWAN: Well, he does have a base that will follow and support him. It willbe the height of naivety to think that he doesn't. And, in fact, I thinkpeople drastically overstating the extent to which Donald Trump is adiminished figure after this. Yes, he's a -- of course he's a -- he --there's no doubt he's lost some -- and Josh probably has a better read onthis than I do, some number of Republicans. He's certainly lost quite a fewelected Republicans.But I don't -- I haven't seen any evidence yet that he's lost a hugeproportion of the Republican base who, you have to remember, was -- and weknow this both from data, like hard, quantitative data, but also from focusgroups and from anecdote and from activists in the field, that he had anincredible bond with the Republican base. A very intense bond that I'veseen firsthand at many Trump rallies and there are some things -- I'm notconvinced that goes away at all.So I think people should be very wary of dismissing Trump as somebody whohas serious power, his own type of power outside of Washington going farbeyond January 20th.WALLACE: Josh, let's change and pivot more to the official party, theelected officials, the party infrastructure. How much support has DonaldTrump lost over this last week inside that part of the GOP? Does he stillhave support? Does he still have clout? Or to what degree has thatdiminished?HOLMES: Well, I mean, Chris, there's been a seismic change this week and Ithink it's a combination of factors, obviously ending with what happened onWednesday. But there was a fatigue everything post-election of thepresident focusing entirely on this, you know, fraudulent election messagethat, you know, wasn't true. And most everybody knew it. But instead ofsort of getting behind what was ultimately going to be the future of theparty in two Georgia Senate races, the president continued to focus on howwe would be president ultimately. That began to chip away. And as therhetoric began to be more and more pointed, more and more away from thefuture of the party, I think there has been a significant slide.Where that ends with Wednesday, as you saw a number Republican senatorsspeaking very directly to this for the first time on the Senate floor. Youhad senators like Tom Cotton, Mike Lee, Tim Scott representing sort of thenext stage of conservatism in Washington, D.C., begin to open a new lanethere.Jonathan Swan is quite right that there is still a huge bases of supportwithin the Republican Party throughout this country, but we're beginning tosee the slow turn here.WALLACE: All right, panel, thank you.
