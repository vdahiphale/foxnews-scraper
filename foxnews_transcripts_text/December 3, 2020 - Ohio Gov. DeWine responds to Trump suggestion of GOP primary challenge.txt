NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, thank you very much, Bill.We are following very closely the governor of California, Gavin Newsom.He's outlining really the strictest provisions since the height of thepandemic back in March and April because of the serious spike in cases.Governor Newsom, among other things, is looking at stay-at-home orders andtrying to make this as voluntary as possible, but hinting that, if peopledo not cooperate, there could be problems. He's dividing the state into atleast five regions. And lockdowns would last for a minimum of three weeks,which will take us right to the cusp of the holiday season.So, what happens right now? We're over the fallout. Also going to begetting reaction very shortly from the governor of Ohio, who has put hisown state on a -- well, a no-travel list, if you will.In the meantime, William La Jeunesse in Los Angeles with the latest for theGolden State and how far this crackdown goes.Hey, William.WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Neil, as you said, andthis is being driven by hospital and ICU bed capacity.And, basically, what the governor said, as you said, the state is beingbroken into five regions. And as each region hits 85 percent capacity andthey're reaching their limitation, if you will, 85 percent of the bedsbeing full in the ICU, that will trigger, if you will, these newrestrictions.And, basically, what it means is, obviously, restaurants, indoor, outdoor,closed, hair salons, massage parlors closed. Schools can be reopened on apartial basis. There will be a little wiggle room there for them.Also, you can walk, and you can bike with your partner, but no largegatherings at all. And, basically, the governor is saying, hey, this is anintent, obviously, to get a control on this now.Santa Clara County and parts of Northern California are supposed to hitthat threshold probably today or tomorrow. The other regions are saying byprobably mid-December.Also, I meant to say that retail would be limited to 20 percent ofcapacity. So, if you have a small boutique, that can be two people. If it'sa big box store, this can be something else. But we remember what that waslike back in March and April, if you will.And the governor says that's going to be at least until New Year's Day. Andhe believes that those mitigations, if you will, will help reduce thecaseload and the stress on the hospital system.They are opening two facilities, ARCO Arena near Sacramento, and alsoImperial Valley College out near El Centro, which has had a surge ofpatients there. And they are over capacity there in the ICU beds already inthat area.And there are nine other facilities that will open with 100 to 200 beds, asrequired -- NeilCAVUTO: William, thank you very much, my friend, William La Jeunesse inCalifornia, where they're really cracking down.Reaction now from Dr. Amesh Adalja, what he makes of all of this, the JohnsHopkins Center for Health Security, much, much more.Doctor, these seem like fairly sweeping measures. And I imagine California,though it has the most -- certainly the most startling spikes of thecountry, they will not be the last to make moves like this. What do youthink?DR. AMESH ADALJA, INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA: Yes, I do youthink that what you're seeing is hospitals really going back into crisis,something that we hadn't really thought about or talked about since --since the spring.We saw a little bit of that during the summer. And I think this is a metricthat everybody is most concerned about, that when hospitals can't providecare, when they can't provide care for COVID patients or people for heart -- with heart attacks and strokes and car accidents, that becomes a concern.And there has to be (AUDIO GAP) get control of these cases and keep themfrom landing on vulnerable populations that end up in the hospital. Andmany places don't have the ability to test, trace and isolate, especiallywith how much the burden of cases are.So, governors increasingly are back in the same position they were in earlyon, without a really coherent testing strategy, and not enough contacttracers. They look at these blunt tools, and they try to deploy them.And I think that it's sad that we're back to the same position again.CAVUTO: I'm wondering, too, this is a different metric, right, Doctor, thatthey're using to sort of clamp down on things. It used to be how many casesyou have, and what's the percentage of positive cases.This is most acute where it is in a region or a hot zone where hospitalcapacity has declined markedly. What do you think of that?ADALJA: I think that's a better way to think about it, because, remember,all of the flattening the curve was really about was trying to stay belowhospital capacity.And when we saw people that were getting infected at high numbers, but notimpinging on the hospitals, that's a different type of a situation thanwe're in today. And, really, when you look at hospital capacity, that'swhat you -- where you run into all those problems, where you see excessmortality increase, where you see hospitals unable to render care.So, I do think that this is a better way to look at this, because we knowthat we can't get cases down to zero. We know we're going to get spread,because this is a virus that spreads so efficiently, that's establisheditself in the human population.What we have to do is reduce the harm the virus causes. And hospitalcapacity is the way we actually can focus our efforts on reducing thedamage this virus is causing.CAVUTO: You know, it occurs at the very same time we have vaccines readilyavailable, one, of course, that was just approved in the United Kingdom,Pfizer's drug that it made in conjunction with BioNTech.It's a matter of time before, I guess, Doctor, the FDA does the same, butothers are waiting for approval themselves, Moderna not too far behindthem, AstraZeneca.Are you optimistic that, by the end of this year, early next year,significant doses will be out to mitigate all of this?ADALJA: Not by the end of this year. I think, by the end of this year, wewill start to see health care workers, we will start to see some nursinghome patients start to get vaccinated.But, really, to get through this winter, it's going to be without thevaccine for the bulk of the population. So, I do think there are going tobe some very dark weeks and months ahead, because this vaccine, really tosee this impact, we have got to get closer to herd immunity.I think that once enough of the nursing home populations are vaccinated,maybe as we get into the new year, we will start to see some pressurealleviate on hospitals. But it's going to take some time to see the impactof this vaccine.CAVUTO: All right, Doctor, we will watch it closely. Thank you, as always,for taking the time.I wish you good health. And you have been a great help to everybody justgetting a lay of the land and where we stand on all of this.As the doctor was wrapping up there, we are hearing that Pfizer is citingsome vaccine supply chain issues, not severe, but enough to take at leastsome of the cream off the Dow earlier on, when we were up in excess of 200points, still a gain for the markets here, but concern, again, aboutgetting this out and some of the supply chain issues that come up, not onlyhere, but abroad, across the world.That's going to probably be a given, but not to be startled by that. Justletting you know that that is one of the issues they're working with.But the virus itself and surviving it is not as insurmountable as it usedto be, particularly for a vulnerable set of the population, like theelderly or those with extenuating conditions.So, you can imagine how worried folks were once Chuck Grassley got wordthat he had tested positive for the virus. He was asymptomatic. But the 87-years-young Iowa senator was not an easy target for the -- for the virus.I caught up with him earlier today, in his first interview since comingback to work since dealing with all of this. He says he feels just fine,and targeting the virus is finer still.Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA): I feel very well.I was fortunate that it was asymptomatic. And I was quarantined for 14days. I got a lot of well-wishes. And I appreciate your well-wish rightnow.CAVUTO: Well, we were reaching you. And I had urged your staff to say youcould tune into my show if you needed your sleep. So, maybe that helped.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: But, Senator, it is always good having you.Let's get right to the mechanics here.GRASSLEY: Sure.CAVUTO: This $908 billion stimulus measure that is out there, are you forit? Are you open to it?GRASSLEY: I'm open to it within these parameters.The dollar amount, as long as it doesn't get higher, would be maybeacceptable, but what's in it? I'm not a big fan for a lot of money forstate and local. But there are so many things that have bipartisan supportalready.And the most important thing is, I think there is a general understandingamong all Republicans that we need to do something. And as long as thatfigure is lower than higher, and it can't be as ridiculous as $2.2 trillionthat Pelosi wanted, and it better not get more than $900 billion.And we just need to do something. And I think there is a good chance we cando something.You quoted Schumer, Pelosi, McCarthy. I think you would get good vibes fromMcConnell today on this. So, I think there is a good chance we canaccomplish something and we should accomplish something.CAVUTO: Let me ask you a little bit about Senate Republicans and theirconcern that the president has already promised to veto the defense bill asit stands right now, unless protections given social media companies arewiped out, in other words, that they cannot fall back on 230 to shield themfrom lawsuits.Some of your colleagues, including Senator Inhofe, have said this hasnothing to do with the defense appropriation, even though he confers withthe president on some of these social media concerns that go too far.What do you think of this?GRASSLEY: Well, first of all, defense is the number one responsibility ofthe federal government.And for six years in a row, we have always passed the defensereauthorization bill. So, it's very important that we support our troopsand get this job done.Now, it happens that I agree with the president on 230. We need to dosomething about that. But I don't -- I don't know whether I agree with himthat it needs to be done on this defense authorization bill, because it isimportant that we get it done. I hope that it could be done this way, butit shouldn't hold up the entire bill.CAVUTO: All right. He insists right now that that should be the case, andthat is exactly what he is going to do.If he keeps insisting on it, what are you going to do?GRASSLEY: Well, I will -- one way or the other, we're going to pass a billand get it there, with 230 or without 230.And then, if he vetoes it, I guess there would be great discussion with thepresident on the importance of not vetoing it. But, if he did veto it, itwould be subject to an override.And I don't want you to ask me right now if I would vote to override ornot, because I don't have that mind made up. But I want to vote for adefense authorization bill one way or the other, 230 or not 230.CAVUTO: Senator, there are reports, The Washington Post and others, sayingthat the president is considering firing Bill Barr as attorney generalbecause he has said that the president's claims that fraud is on a rampantscale has simply not evidenced themselves, the attorney general sayingwhatever happened didn't affect it on a grand scale that would have changedthe outcome.First, do you agree with the general on that, and, secondly, thepresident's reported wish to fire him?GRASSLEY: Well, we know that there is fraud in the elections. Maybe that istrue of a lot of elections. Is there enough to overturn the votes? So far,I haven't seen it. But that doesn't mean it is not there. And there's a lotof court cases going on.And I think the extent to which both Bill Barr and the president would holdin reserve until these issues are brought out before a judge and getdiscovery and get everything out there, so we know how bad it is before wedraw any conclusions.I don't think the president should fire Barr, but I think Barr should havebeen a little more reserved in what he said about -- about fraud.CAVUTO: Do you think Joe Biden was the duly elected president of the UnitedStates, he is the president-elect, will be sworn in, should be sworn in onJanuary 20?GRASSLEY: Well, we will know that two weeks from yesterday, December the14th, when the Electoral College meets.CAVUTO: I understand that, sir, but do you -- do you agree with that?GRASSLEY: Well...CAVUTO: Do you think, as the attorney general said, while fraud,malfeasance might have been going on, it was not in -- to the degree thatit would have changed the outcome that we see now?GRASSLEY: Well, right now, with the certification that the states havegiven -- and you can kind of add up the electoral vote -- it kind ofimplies that, on December the 14th, Biden is going to be president-elect.But I don't think you should use that title until it is certified by theElectoral College.CAVUTO: Do you think that, once that is official, once it comes in -- asyou say, in less than two weeks, when the Electoral College meets, that,whatever grievances the president has, he should stop the fight,acknowledge that Joe Biden should take office on January 20, go to theinauguration, do all the things that presidents have done in the past?GRASSLEY: I would not pretend to give a president very much advice, excepton policy. And this is more of a political question, so I won't give advicethere.I would only say that, if the president wants to run for reelection in 2024-- and there is some talk of that, and I'm not going to comment whether heshould or not -- but if he wants to, the more gracious he is as he leaveson January the 20th, I think the better people would feel about his being acandidate for reelection, particularly the 70 million people that think hewas cheated out of this election.And there is reason to believe that -- that there is plenty to be concernedabout with the -- with how a lot of mail-in ballots were handled in variousstates. That doesn't necessarily imply fraud, but it could mean that statelaws weren't followed as appropriately as they should be.Like, for instance, you would just expect, when you're counting ballots,you ought to have one Republican and one Democrat at the table to determinewhether or not a mail-in ballot is a legitimate ballot. And that hasn'tbeen done. And it -- maybe it is not done often enough.But that is the way it ought to be in the future. And that is a lesson wehave learned from this election. We let the Democrats change state lawsthrough the courts for three or four months before the election. And Idon't think that we took it as seriously as we should.And it tells us now that individual state legislatures need to go back andoverturn those court cases by changing the law, so that we in the futureknow that we're never going to be -- nobody is going to be cheated in anyway whether their vote really counts or not.And we are going to make sure that anybody that casts an absentee ballot isreally the person casting it. You can't do like what you're doing inGeorgia right now, having one person cast -- request ballots for dozens anddozens of people. It is just open for fraud.And Jimmy Carter said that mail-in voting is just a unique possibility forfraud. So, there is a Democrat that is well-respected that ought to befollowed.CAVUTO: You know, Senator, you mentioned Georgia.And there has been quite a back-and-forth between the president and thegovernor of Georgia, the secretary of state, the lieutenant governor, allof whom have been sort of, you know, wincing at the president's criticismthat they botched this or that they're not being vigilant enough in thevarious counts that are still ongoing.What do you think of that and how the -- what the secretary of state inGeorgia has called the president's tone, that it could lead to some badthings, maybe even violence?GRASSLEY: The president should do everything he can on Saturday, when hehas his rally, to get every Republican that voted for him out to vote andsome people that maybe didn't vote for him out to vote, those people thatare scared of a Biden presidency with a Democrat senator.He should stick to script. Forget ad-libbing. Don't talk anything about howhe was cheated out of being president of the United States. Do everythingto unite the Republicans in Georgia, so that we have a firewall against theprogressiveness of this Biden administration.And -- and that is what he should do. He should go down there and basicallykeep to script.CAVUTO: Do you think, though, that his comments are going to hurt theRepublican senatorial candidates there, or at least open up a divide inGeorgia, and flip the Senate potentially Democrat?GRASSLEY: What he's said up to now, no, but what he says on Saturday isgoing to make a big difference.(END VIDEOTAPE)CAVUTO: All right, Chuck Grassley talking about the back-and-forth inGeorgia, doesn't think that anything the president's done or said right nowwill interfere in that race.So, he will simply have to examine it. The president will, of course, be inGeorgia this weekend. We will be covering that live as well.In the meantime, the fallout in these other battleground states, to whichthe Trump campaign is giving a good deal of attention and will make itscase right now in Nevada as to how that state was taken out of a sure Trumpcolumn because of a lot of the chicanery.We're going to be going into that in about 10, 15 minutes, when thishearing, where the Trump folks will sort of lay out their legal argumenthere.But ahead of that to Jeff Paul on what we could be looking.Jeff is in Carson City, Nevada, with the latest.Hey, Jeff.JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Neil, a pretty big crowd gatheringhere outside the courthouse in Carson City.As you take a look behind me, you can see a lot of them either carryingTrump flags or American flags and signs out here. You can see one thatsays, "Stop the Steal."They're out here trying to drum up support for the Trump team's effort tochallenge the election, hoping a judge either declares Trump the winner inNevada or tosses out the election entirely.Now, the Trump campaign says it does have evidence that the elections inNevada were illegitimate. They claim there were substantial irregularities,improprieties and fraud.One of the major issues, according to Republicans, deals with how ClarkCounty processed its mail-in ballots. They say the machines for -- thatwere used to verify signatures were problematic, and that the whole processjust wasn't fair.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JESSE BINNALL, TRUMP CAMPAIGN ATTORNEY: Donald Trump won the state ofNevada, after you account for the fraud and irregularities that occurred inthe election.We are asking the court to recognize the fact that President Trump wasvictorious in this election.(END VIDEO CLIP)PAUL: And, on the other hand, Democrats say this is a desperate attempt bythe Trump team to overrule the will of the people, and they don't believethere's really any hard evidence that would change a judge's mind.But that hearing will get under way here in about 15 minutes, and we willsee what happens -- Neil.CAVUTO: All right, Jeff, thank you very, very much.Well, we have been waiting for quite some time. And the reason why we arelooking at this hearing so closely is because the Trump campaign says itwill have irrefutable proof to back up its views that the vote there wasfraudulent, that it was rigged and that many votes that meant to go toDonald Trump instead never got there.And, as a result, he lost the state. It is an argument that his campaignhas raised in some of these other battleground states. This is that rareopportunity where we can hear from the campaign their proof of that andwhether it made a difference, not only in that state, but even nationally,because they have been arguing that, when you look at all of this, withoutit, Donald Trump would have been easily reelected, in fact, the presidenthas said by a landslide.There's no way to prove that. But we will be going to Nevada to get an ideaof that.To the Ohio governor, who had said not too long ago that, even if therewere some malfeasance or crazy things going on, in the aggregate, it wouldnot change the overall vote. He had said it is clear that, certainly, basedon what we now know, that Joe Biden is the president-elect.It was within minutes of hearing that that the president tweeted out asuggestion that maybe Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio should be primaried.Will he be? The governor has far bigger issues to deal with right now,including a spike in cases.How he's handling that and what he makes of all of this -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, we're continuing monitoring this press conference, avirtual one, Governor Gavin Newsom of California, where they are reimposingrestrictions for at least the next three weeks in so-called hot zones,where hospital capacity has gotten very, very low.It's a new metric used to justify curbing those crowding in public areasand the rest. They are pretty sweeping measures. So, if a lot of Californiais already upset with the strong arm of a very intrusive government --that's how many critics see this -- others see the governor simply tried toprotect his folks -- of course, that will likely be adding to this here.But the crackdown there, while not a lockdown, will have rolling sort ofrestrictions here that will no doubt roil the state, and at least for thenext three weeks to come.A fellow who knows this process quite well, the governor of Ohio, MikeDeWine, who, among other things, added his state itself to a travel warninglist.Governor DeWine, very good to have you.GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R-OH): Neil, thank you.CAVUTO: What is this travel restriction advice you're giving right now?DEWINE: Well, what we have always done is put a map up every Wednesday forthe people of Ohio and put the positivity rates of states across thecountry.And 15 percent positivity is very high. And that's a warning. And so whatwe had to do today, to be consistent and honest, is to say Ohio is at 15percent now. And so we want people -- you know, it's just one more caution.It's always been just a light that goes on and says, hey, if you're goingto this state, be careful, because they have got a very high spread of theinfection.Well, now we have a very high spread of the infection, and we have to tellour own citizens that.CAVUTO: It doesn't go down well. It doesn't even go down well with membersof your own party, Governor, several of whom have gathered to try toimpeach you, saying you're going too far with these orders.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: What's going on?DEWINE: Well, there's four members of the General Assembly.There's 132 members of the General Assembly, and four of them think that Ishould be impeached. So, they have every right to think that. But I'm goingon about my business and focused on what we have to get done, both withCOVID-related, but also, frankly, in the other things.We have a budget coming up and a lot of discussions. The state legislatureis in a lame-duck session now. And I'm working with Senator Obhof andSpeaker Cupp and -- the two leaders, and we're working things through.CAVUTO: All of this occurs at a fractious political environment, as I'msure you're aware, Governor.While you had said not too long ago that the president was certainly wellwithin his right to get the count right and make sure it was right, that,as you saw things back last time we chatted, it looked like Joe Biden wasgoing to emerge as the president of the United States on January 20 of nextyear.Do you still subscribe to that?DEWINE: Yes, both.Look, I just listened to your account. I think it's great any time -- andno one should be fearful of the president of the United States or anyonegoing into court and putting forth evidence. He has every right to do that.Our courts are great finders of fact. And they're -- the courts are open,and people have absolutely every right to use them, including the presidentof the United States.I also said that it certainly -- and this was a while ago -- it certainlyappeared that Joe Biden was going to be the next president.But, look, I have had a very great relationship with President Trump. I --actually, I was talking to him last night about an Ohio-related matter thatdidn't have anything to do with the -- with COVID.And whenever I have asked him, I have called him, he has been there, doneeverything that he could to help us through this virus. I think that thegood news, when I talk to the people of Ohio -- we did a press conferencetoday, and we talked about, what's the good news?Well, the good news is, this vaccine is coming. And, you know, December 15,we're going to start doing it.CAVUTO: Well, did the conversation ever veer into, Governor -- all right,but when you were talking to him last night...DEWINE: OK.CAVUTO: He had suggested maybe primarying you because of your comments thatit looked like...DEWINE: No, we didn't. Look...CAVUTO: ... Joe Biden was going to be the next president. Did that evercome up?DEWINE: We didn't -- we don't -- we didn't get into that.We talked about a challenge that we had in Ohio, something that I wantedtheir help on. And the president said he would see what he could do. And healways does that.CAVUTO: OK.DEWINE: So, it's -- look, it's important to have that relationship.And I was proud to be his chairman in Ohio. And we won by about eightpoints.CAVUTO: All right, yes, not too shabby there.So, let me ask you a little, then, on this same issue, if you don't mind,sir.Bill Barr had much similar things to say about this whole issue offraudulent and rigged elections, and has no doubt that maybe some of thatwas going on, but, again, to your point, not to the degree that it wouldhave changed the outcome.Apparently, the president, from all reports, bristled at that. There waseven some talk that he might fire, might still consider getting rid of theattorney general.What do you think of that? Do you think that that -- that that would beadvisable, for the president to fire his attorney general?DEWINE: Well, I remember something President Bush once said when I was infront of him, and he had a member of his staff that was doing something andtalking about something.And someone else, a member of Congress, I don't know, he just -- thepresident said, you need to stay in your lane.So, my lane is to focus on Ohio and to focus on this virus. And I don'tknow the facts that you're recounting. And I have -- frankly, I have beenfocused the last few days on the -- getting the vaccine.And we're -- what I was about to say a minute ago was that this is a majoraccomplishment of the Trump administration. And it's coming. And it'scoming, we think, around December 15.CAVUTO: Really?DEWINE: And we're going to be putting shots in people's arms in Ohio, wehope, the next day.CAVUTO: All right.DEWINE: Yes. So, we're excited about it.CAVUTO: Good for you.DEWINE: And it's -- I think it's a major -- a major accomplishment of theadministration.CAVUTO: Governor, before I leave you, we're going to be going live to thisNevada hearing, where this is really an opportunity for the Trump campaignto outline exactly the abuses that it sees that cost it not only in thatstate, that cost the president a win in that state, but in some of theseother battleground states.Now, some have said that this battle will be only resolved when theElectoral College meets in less than two weeks. The president has indicatedthat, if that's the point at which Joe Biden wins, whatever his grievances,he will accept that. But others aren't so sure.Do you think that, when the Electoral College gathers and confirms andcertifies that Joe Biden has won, that it's over, that the president shouldbe gracious, that he should attend the inauguration? What?DEWINE: Sure.But, I mean, look, that's what the president said. I mean, you just quotedthe president as saying that that's what he would do. I take him at hisword that he will do that.CAVUTO: Well, he didn't say he would go to the inauguration or that hewould go happily...(CROSSTALK)DEWINE: Well...(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: ... would just say that that's -- that's the point.(LAUGHTER)DEWINE: Well, look, we...CAVUTO: You will leave it at that.DEWINE: We have a great tradition. We have a great tradition in thiscountry for 200 years.And people accept the result. We -- the president has every right to gointo court. But, ultimately, when the result is there, the loser alwaysaccepts it, and we move on. Doesn't mean we like it.CAVUTO: OK.DEWINE: But it's accepted, because that's part of who we are. That's whatmakes us different than a lot of places on Earth.CAVUTO: All right, fair enough.Governor DeWine, always classy, always a gentleman.DEWINE: Thanks, Neil.CAVUTO: The governor of the beautiful state of Ohio, ahead of dealing witha lot of this and ahead of a lot of folks dealing with the aftermath ofthis.As I promised you, I wanted to take you to Nevada, because, for the longesttime, we have been trying to ascertain the proof that the Trump campaignhas of some of these abuses that were so widespread and so distinct thatthey cost it not only a victory in Nevada, but in many of these otherbattleground states.This is their opportunity on live Television to spell out that proof. We'regoing to Nevada for them to spell out that and to hear from all sides.To Nevada.(JOINED IN PROGRESS)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ... satisfying the requirements that might allow that tobe admitted.There's a matching between certain files produced by the Department ofMotor Vehicle and voter files, but even he admits that it's only matched onpart of the name.So, a single member of a household could be a non-U.S. citizen living withseveral other U.S. citizens, and Mr. (INAUDIBLE) had no way ofdistinguishing between any of them.So, for all three reasons, Your Honor, I think the declaration,supplemental declaration should be rejected by the court.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Binnall?BINNALL: Thank you, Your Honor.May it please the court, Jesse Binnall on behalf of the contestant.The motion to strike should be denied for the reasons that we laid out inour filings on this matter.As to the specific positions just laid out by the defendants, I will alsostart on the timeliness of the filing.The -- the information that this was based on that -- Mr. Camsell's (ph)supplemental affidavit is -- is based on, is data that was retrieved fromthe Department of Motor Vehicles at about 2:00 p.m. on Monday, pursuant toa subpoena.This is one of the few instances where it's data that was discovered not byextrajudicial discovery in our case, but actually using more of a formaldiscovery process, because that's the only way we could receive thisinformation.And as soon as we received this information, it was passed along to thedata scientists for comparison with the list of people who had voted. Whatwe, of course, learned then is that, approximately, it appears from theexpert report, about 4,000 non-citizens voting in this election, 4,000additional people that are not authorized to vote in the 2020 election.Mr...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What about the court's ruling and order that basicallyall witnesses had to be disclosed by the contestants by 5:00 on November25, 2020?BINNALL: Your Honor...UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (OFF-MIKE) But is it fair to the defense then tosuddenly bring this in at the last minute?BINNALL: You Honor, it was information that there's no other way that wecould have gotten in. And there's the -- the idea that you only seasonallysupplement. And that's exactly what we did in this case.This litigation is especially truncated, and it has to be that way. And weunderstand that. But data that there is no way for us to have had at thatdeadline that the court set, that's why the court has discretion in thesesituation -- these situations to say that, since there's no possible waythat we could have had this information by November the 25th, there's noway that we could have produced this specific information.We did tell them that Jesse Camsell was going to be a witness in this case.And, indeed, he did give deposition testimony in this case. He gavedeposition testimony in this case on other data, information that came outat -- within I think about -- well, at roughly the same exact time as thisinformation was produced to us by the Department of Motor Vehicles,UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What about the requirements of NRS-293.415 thatbasically this matter be heard upon deposition of (OFF-MIKE)? They have noability, basically, to have cross-examined him on this new additionalmaterial, no ability at all to question his methods or methodology inrespect to (OFF-MIKE) material?Is that fair?BINNALL: Your Honor, I understand the court's position on that.And I would say that the better remedy that would meet the interests ofjustice on this is to allow them to do just that after this -- afterargument to allow them -- we can do that tomorrow. We can do that thisevening. And then we can submit the deposition supplementally to the courtfor its decision.That would be something that could meet the interests of justice to stillallow them to cross-examine Mr. Camsell on these issues, without denying usany reasonable means of bringing this to the court's attention, sincethere's no other way that we could have gotten this and to submit it tothem any earlier.We literally submitted this at the earliest moment we could have, in orderof getting the data, comparing the data, producing a very short reportexplaining how the data was compared, and then providing it to thedefendants.They should have the ability, but they certainly have the resourcesavailable in a document subpoena situation to use their own experts, theirown resources to compare this data and say if they think we got anythingwrong, that it's fewer than 4,000 non-citizens who voted in this case.They haven't done that yet. They have had at this point a similar amount oftime that we have had to do this, and they haven't done that. But if theywant the opportunity to depose Mr. Camsell on that, we will make himavailable for a deposition, a very short deposition, after this.We can submit it to the court supplemental without further argument.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Hamilton, any final comment on this issue?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your Honor, the words out of my mouth, the statuteanticipates that evidence to be presented by deposition and argument ofcounsel.That hasn't happened here. This contest was filed on November 17. That'squite a while ago. And counsel had plenty of time to secure whatever datahe needed and to produce the declaration or expert testimony.Your Honor gave a clear deadline. If there was some issue, then counselcertainly could have filed an emergency motion for the court for leave oreven approached us for how to deal with that. He did neither.The court has indulged counsel at every turn by providing ample opportunityfor discovery. But this is both inconsistent with the statute andfundamentally unfair to the court and to the defendants.So, we would ask that it be stricken.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.Subject to the court, I'm going to go ahead and strike the (OFF-MIKE)declaration (OFF-MIKE) I believe for the reasons that I clearly indicated(OFF-MIKE) disclosure deadline of November 25, 2020, which, I might add,none of the other experts by the claimants were even disclosed on thatdate.They were all disclosed later (OFF-MIKE) the report (OFF-MIKE) November 30,I believe with respect to that. But I'm going to allow all that.I'm not striking anything other than this current declaration, for tworeasons primarily. (OFF-MIKE) primarily under NRS-293.415, it's clear tothis court that I am basically limited to depositions in argument inrespect to making a determination in this case in regards to that.And the reason for that, certainly in the court's mind, is an ability tocross-examine and verify the information and make sure that, basically,it's fair to both sides.So, with that in mind, I want to move forward with respect to that. It's myintent to give each side approximately an hour. We may take a breaksomewhere along the way in respect to the matter in regards to that.You can reserve part of your time for rebuttal, if you decide. But you havean hour. So, if you want to go 30 minutes and reserve your time, that'sfine with the court. However you want to do it with respect to that isfine.I do have one other question that the court thinks is important to startwith. And that is, what is the evidentiary standard that applies withrespect to this (OFF-MIKE). I think it's important that we go through theevidence and look at the evidence having an understanding what the standardis that we're going to apply.Is it a clear and convincing standard, or is it a reasonable doubtstandard? So (OFF-MIKE) do you want to comment on that? Again (OFF-MIKE) Ihave read all the briefs. And that's -- I'm not making a decision whichway. I just kind of wanted to get a flavor for everybody (OFF-MIKE) courtsare going to look at.BINNALL: And I understand that that would be an important point for thecourt to consider, is, because there -- the statute itself is silent on thestandard of proof that would be required in a case like this. The defendants have cited law in other jurisdictions. But, of course, sincethis is a creature, a statute in Nevada, it would be more appropriate tolook at what -- how Nevada handles situations like this.The default is always in a civil case preponderance of the evidence. Thatis -- that is the default burden in a civil case. And this is a civil case.It's an unusual case. And it's understandable why there wouldn't be a lotof case law defining some of this.But short of any -- any intent of the legislature -- and we're aware of noother intention of the legislature to increase the burden of proof to aclear and convincing standard, as the defendants urge the court to do.The right thing to do is going back to the civil standard that we're veryfamiliar with, which is preponderance of the evidence. From a policyperspective, that's the right answer too.We're trying, as the court said when the court took the bench, to determinewhether every vote was properly counted, every legal vote was counted in anelection like this. There is no reason to give more deference to one sideor the other in that determination.The proper thing to do is to weigh the evidence to see whether or not thedecision to certify the electors for Vice President Biden was appropriate.And so, consequently, since there's no reason to favor the defendants moreor the contestants more, the preponderance of evidence standard is theappropriate use here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What about NRS-293.410, which talks about reasonabledoubt? (OFF-MIKE) reasonable doubt (OFF-MIKE) talks about reasonable doubt.Is that similar to preponderance of evidence or that is a higher standard?BINNALL: And that's an interesting use of reasonable doubt in that statute,because it's not the reasonable doubt, very clearly, that we would be usedto in a criminal case.It could be read to say that, if there's -- that the -- it could be read tooffer a standard much more favorable to the contestants, quite honestly, ofsaying that, if there's a reasonable doubt in the outcome, that the contestshould be granted.It's difficult to see exactly how that would work in this setting, YourHonor. And that's why I think it's more appropriate for me and, quitehonestly, hopefully, it gives me a little bit more credibility to you tosay I don't have to just throw up as a -- as somebody sitting on this sideof the courtroom who has a burden, some burden, that I just have to havealmost like a probable cause-type standard.I think it does have to be more than that. It has to be that we do have aburden to meet here, a burden that we will meet, that we're very common wewill meet. And I think the way a reasonable reading of the reasonable doubtlanguage in 210 means that it's similar to the preponderance of theevidence standard that otherwise the court would use in this setting.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Hamilton?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your Honor, I agree with -- I agree with counsel.(INAUDIBLE) the Supreme Court has not yet defined clearly the burden ofproof required in an election contest.But an election contest, by its nature, is asking a court to do anextraordinary thing, which is overturn the results of a certified election.And so, for that reason, courts around the country typically embrace aclear and convincing evidence standard, California, Illinois, Kentucky,Maryland, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, a variety of states. We have cited themall in the brief.So, it has -- obviously, the statute set a standard that will be thestandard that will apply. It was a Nevada court that spoke it. And thatwould be, obviously, controlling. Here, we don't have that. So we have tolook -- I submit that two things guide the standard.First would be, how are election contests treated elsewhere on similarstatutory schemes? And that is the use of higher clear and convincingevidence standard.Second would be more of a functional approach. The cause of action sounds,at least in part, in fraud. And fraud, under Nevada and the law ofvirtually every state, requires a higher evidentiary standard.So, for both reasons, I think that the clear and convincing evidencestandard is the one that should be applied by the court here.Ultimately -- and (INAUDIBLE) ultimately, I'm not sure that it'sdispositive here, because I think the claim fails under even a more relaxedpreponderance of the evidence or reasonable doubt standard, Your Honor.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would reserve ruling on that issue. I think it's kindof a difficult issue in regards to this. And it may or may not make muchdifference when we get down to the ruling.The other question I have is, there was a certification of the electionresults by the Nevada Supreme Court. Does that have any impact on thishearing?And, again, if you look at the statutes and the timetables that things haveto be done under Nevada law, and you do have time periods in which to filea contest, and it was filed properly within the time period, so I'm not bysure it technically has any impact.So, just a final comment.BINNALL: Your Honor, that I think that's a very good question and somethingthat we looked at.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I always like to hear that I asked a very good question.(LAUGHTER)BINNALL: It's a good question from the very nature of the fact it came fromthe bench, I know.(LAUGHTER)BINNALL: Your Honor, the contest statute and -- is, I think, quite clearabout the timing and the fact that the ministerial action of certificationby the secretary of state and then the governor does not -- does not takeaway the court's ability to enter an order on a contest.Of course, just by the timing that the General Assembly has laid out onthat, I think is very clear.The -- and, up until -- matter of fact, the law actually is that you cansee from the legislative history on the contest statute that it isanticipated that the timing has to be so truncated because no one is ableto take the oath of their position until the contest is decided.And so that is the important time frame to look at for the contestposition, is to actually go down in the legislative history. If we haven'tcited that, I can -- we can get that and provide that to the court, thatthe important thing is whether they have taken their oath to actually thenbegin their terms.And they can't take those oath until the contest is actually decided. Andso that would be separate and apart from the certification process by thesecretary of state. Otherwise, the timing laid out the legislature justwould be impossible for there being an election contest at all.It would render the entire statute (INAUDIBLE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Hamilton?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Your Honor, I think Nevada law speaks to that in NRS(INAUDIBLE) sub 4.Whenever an election is annulled or set aside by a court, and the court hasnot declared some candidate elected (INAUDIBLE) election (INAUDIBLE)commission, if any has been issued, is void (INAUDIBLE)So, I think, without having spent a lot of time thinking about it, that theaction by the Nevada Supreme Court does not prevent the act -- this matterfrom going forward to a judgment.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. I agree -- I agree with both of you.Thank you for your (OFF-MIKE)So, at this time, basically, the court is prepared to go ahead.Mr. Binnall, if you want to start with the argument. Again, we're kind oflimiting everybody to time (OFF-MIKE)And I want you to know that I have read all the briefs (OFF-MIKE). And Iread as much of that as I possibly could from 5:00 until noon today inrespect to that. And there's a significant amount of papers there.But I concentrated primarily on (OFF-MIKE) I read primarily the depositionsof the experts in regards to this particular matter. So, that -- I didspend a good deal of time going through that (OFF-MIKE) most importantplaces to start (OFF-MIKE)BINNALL: And, Your Honor, we understand that there's a substantial amountof submissions in this case, and very truncated position to get it allforward for the court.I'm -- I was reminded of the old adage that, if I had more time, it wouldhave been shorter. In this case, we think almost everything that we havegiven to the court is something that is important for the resolution ofthis matter.It is all critical information that we have been able to gather in a month.And we appreciate the court's consideration of that and taking up all thetime that the court has in looking at everything.We are actually -- also just put together something this morning, but thatwe thought might be helpful. And that is an additional exhibit index thatgives the particular exhibit and which binder it's in for our binders.Can we hand that up to the court?UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.BINNALL: OK.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would like to have it. Thank you very much.BINNALL: Thank you.And we will make sure that we get one of those to opposing counsel promptlyas well, if it hasn't already.And, Your Honor, I'm going to go for about 35 minutes right now. And thenI'm going to withhold the rest of my time for rebuttal, if I can do math.Your Honor, this case is about the failure of the electoral system in anelection. And no one ever wants to say that, but it's true. The evidenceproves it.The questions are, how did this happen, who's responsible, and what do wedo about it?Our free, fair and open elections are a source of national pride. We spenduntold millions of dollars around the world preaching the benefits ofelection integrity.We make sure that elections are decided by the people who vote in them, andnot by outside actors trying to influence the results, voters who are theones that are legally able to cast those votes and the importance thatevery voter gets only one vote.The evidence that we have submitted is compelling. It shows that electionofficials planned and implemented an election system that would be highlysusceptible to fraud, that would ignore the best practices developed overthe years, and eschew meaningful observation.This was made worse, as Mr. Gessler's expert testimony makes clear, by thelegislature's decision to adopt (INAUDIBLE) and take us to a system ofuniversal mail voting at very much the last minute, without a sufficientamount of time to clean the voter rolls and implement a plan to ensurevoter integrity.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let me ask you about that.BINNALL: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the -- basically, the (OFF-MIKE) counting machinethat (OFF-MIKE) in respect to the ballots? Is that correct?BINNALL: Are you talking about the Agilis machine in Clark County?(CROSSTALK)BINNALL: Yes, Your Honor.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And wasn't that issue determined issued by Judge Wilson(ph) in the (OFF-MIKE) case and the other cases that have been filedthroughout the state of Nevada?And I'm raising that because (OFF-MIKE) raising an issue of collusion. Andwe're going to get to that at some point in time (OFF-MIKE). Is thatsomething I should even consider?BINNALL: Your Honor, I think the clearest answer, and the reason why theanswer is no, is that Judge Wilson decided that there wasn't standing tobring that challenge.And anything decided without standing is a nullity and can't have(INAUDIBLE) effect. There were other reasons for his decision. But because-- since we would be looking -- well, regardless if we'd be looking atissue preclusion or claim preclusion, the lack of standing would bedispositive on that particular issue.You also do have the facts that the parties are different between the twocontests. And so, for res judicata purposes, that would have an effect.And one of the -- the reason that standing was so important and why youwouldn't have a res judicata or collateral estoppel issue come up here isbecause, essentially, the argument was wasn't ripe yet. We didn't know atthat point if it was going to be a problem.And so you can't really say on one hand, well, we don't know if this is aproblem yet because it happened pre-election, and so the election actuallycomes, we see it is a problem, and then say, well, it's already decided,when we said it wasn't ripe.That kind of reasoning doesn't really work for a preclusion narrative.So, the primary issue that we're going to see with the use of the Agilismachinery here is one that's purely statutory, the -- as far as the legalproblem. And then what flows from that is going to be the evidentiaryproblems, which there's not going to be the conclusive issues on theevidentiary problems, because even if the Agilis machine had already beendetermined to be legal by Judge Wilson's previous ruling, the issues atplay is whether the authenticated signatures, whether they wereauthenticated by a human or by a machine, whether they were properlyauthenticated, whether they let through fraudulent votes.And we do have evidence that we have submitted to the court that says thatthe answer that we have been able to determine, without really any use ofcivil discovery, and certainly not what you would normally get in a fraudinvestigation of this sort, is that, yes, the signature verificationsystem, machine, human, whatever, let through bad votes.So, the statutory issue is going to break down -- and I don't want to --well, we're there, so I'm just going to address it, if it is easier for thecourt.The statutory issue is that, even in AB4, which was, of course, just passedthis past summer by the legislature, it decided -- it required thatsignatures be verified by the clerk or the clerk's employee.Clark County is a little bit different, because there's a county statutethat specifically says that the role of the clerk is assigned to theregistrar when it comes to election matters.And so that statute, for Clark County purposes, which is the only placesthat uses this Agilis machine.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
