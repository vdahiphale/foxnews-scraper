NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, we are keeping track, well, of alot of meetings and gatherings.The president of the United States meeting with top Michigan Republicanleadership on that vote count that's going on there. You think it'sprobably resolved and done. Not necessarily.Then, Joe Biden, the president-elect and his powwow with Chuck Schumer andNancy Pelosi about how to proceed immediately and maybe goose some lame-duck stimulus talks.All of that, and the vice president of the United States helping out thosetwo Georgia Republican candidates. They're simultaneously up for a run-offelection on January 5, and he is doing his best to make sure they both getin.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is "Your World."So many fast and furious developments right now, not the least of which isa curious meeting at the White House that includes the state majorityleader, Mike Shirkey, and the House of speaker, Lee Chatfield. They're veryinstrumental in the role of that ongoing count here and have expressedsupport for the president trying to make sure that every legal vote iscounted.But how far they will go and how much the president can weigh in on this isanyone's guess.Let's go to Kevin Corke right now with the very latest -- Kevin.KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Perfect lead-in rightthere, Neil. Good to be with you this afternoon.You're right. There is so much happening in this race in the Great LakesState of Michigan. A number of people want to know what will happen withthe ongoing vote. Will all the legal votes be counted? And what to do aboutthose canvassers who say they don't want to certify the vote in WayneCounty?So, we're talking about possible intimidation in some circles, andultimately an invitation right here to the White House, as you mentioned, apair of state lawmakers from Michigan right here to have a conversationwith the president of the United States.Now, a lot of people are wondering, what's that conversation going to beabout? Well, I can tell you, we asked the press secretary, KayleighMcEnany, about that. And she sort of seemed to characterize the meeting asmore or less routine. She said something along the lines of, listen, thepresident meets with state leaders all the time.What she didn't drill down on is what might be the tone and tenor of thisparticular conversation, in particular, when you consider what is at stakein the state of Michigan, just the very latest twist IN what has been avery hotly contested race, obviously, in Michigan, people still wanting toknow not just about that conversation, but is there are a pathwayultimately to change the outcome of the apparent vote in that state, whichis currently led by Joe Biden?Now, I can tell you, Neil, we have actually seen affidavits from a pair ofcanvassers here at the White House. We -- in our time here at the WhiteHouse. These are from canvassers over in Michigan. They say they want torescind their votes right now, because they don't want to certify the votein Wayne County, say too many irregularities there.We also heard the president talk just a bit about his thoughts on what'shappening in that place and other challenges around the country. Listenhere.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Big pharma ran millions ofdollars of negative advertisements against me during the campaign -- whichI won, by the way. But we'll find that out.We had big pharma against us. We had the media against us. We had big techagainst us. We had a lot of dishonesty against us.(END VIDEO CLIP)CORKE: So, there you go. You heard the president say: "I won, by the way.We will find that out."Just the backdrop as we continue to keep an eye here on the North Porticohere at the White House. Hopefully, we will get a chance to see some ofthose lawmakers either going in or coming out, Neil.We will keep an eye on it. We do anticipate, as always, some sort of areadout. I promise, as soon as I get anything, I will pass it along -- but,for now, back to you.CAVUTO: All right, thank you, my friend, very, very much, Kevin Corke atthe White House.Mike Shirkey, the Senate majority leader who is meeting with the presidentas we speak, along with the speaker of the Michigan House, he was accostedat the airport on his way to meet the president. Take a look at this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Will you honor the will of the Michigan voters?(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO: All right. Well, that went well.What comes in it and this powwow the president's having with these twogentlemen at the White House, we might know momentarily.But John Pavia with the -- Quinnipiac law adjunct professor with us.Now, John, I do want to get into the legalities of this and how far itgoes. But I'm also, maybe because I'm the numbers guy here at FOX, a bit ofa nerd. The numbers look daunting for the president right now, even inMichigan. He looks like he lost it by 150,000 votes. That's a lot of votesto make up, whether ballots were questionable or not.But maybe, maybe it's possible. In Georgia, the fight is still on, eventhough that state has all but been certified and approved right now with a13,000-vote edge for Joe Biden, in Pennsylvania, more than 81,000-vote edgefavoring Joe Biden. I guess it could turn around.But when the president hasn't even given up on Arizona, which was calledfor Joe Biden, and the gap there of 11,000 votes, I guess what I'm tryingto say is, mathematically, he'd have to run the table on all of this,wouldn't he?JOHN PAVIA, QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY: Yes, he would, Neil.And that's why I think, going back to day one, right after the ElectionDay, I said, this is really not like what our team dealt with back in 2000,right? The margin of victory is too much in too many states.And so where we're at today with these Michigan legislators, the Republicanstate legislators coming to the White House, I actually think this had tohave been the strategy from day one, knowing that it's going to be almostimpossible to find enough invalid ballots to overturn any of these states'final counts.Then you have to go to sort of plan B, which is, under our Constitution,any state has the ability to sort of pull the right to vote back into thestate legislature, the way it was when the country was first founded, andhave the legislature cast the votes of which candidate won those electoralvotes.It's still a very -- I mean, let's face it, it's still a Hail Mary ofsorts. But I think this day was coming from the time -- Wednesday after theelection, that this was the strategy. And now we're going to see. And it'sa domino strategy. Can you get one state legislature to say, hey, we'recasting our ballots for -- our electoral votes for Donald Trump, eventhough the citizens here voted for Joe Biden?And then, if you get one state, do you get another? I don't think it'sgoing to happen. But I can assure you, that's the conversation. He'sleaning on them pretty hard, I'm sure, there in the Oval Office.CAVUTO: I would imagine, John, that would be controversial, to put itmildly...(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: ... if the electors end up going for the person who didn't win thepopular vote in that state.Seen as unprecedented as that might be, we have had elections called andgone into the House over other issues nearly half-a-dozen times in ournation's past. But that would incite a crisis in itself, wouldn't it?PAVIA: Oh, huge.I mean, I can't think of how many Donald Trump euphemisms and adjectives todescribe how humongous it would be and tremendous.(LAUGHTER)PAVIA: But the bigger thing here is -- and I have said this a couple oftimes now -- number one, what kind of impact will it have in Georgia? Imean, could it turn people off to voting for a Republican, if this goes ontoo long? That's part A.Part B is, Donald Trump becomes a private citizen pretty soon, assuming hedoes not -- he's not successful in his attempts to stay in the Oval Office.And, as you know all too well, there's still a lot of attorney generals andI think maybe federal prosecutors who are thinking about, are there thingswithin -- in his income tax returns that they'd love to prosecute him on?I'm not saying it would happen, but I don't think he's going to make anyfriends by prolonging this. But, with that said, this is his right.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: And those investigations and pursuits would go much moreaggressively against a private citizen Donald Trump than they would have aPresident Trump, correct?PAVIA: Yes, and a private Donald Trump that really pushed this to the limitin terms of trying to overturn the results of election night.CAVUTO: Got it.PAVIA: So, he's -- I know he doesn't take advice well, but he's got tostart thinking about stuff like that, because, as I said last night here,he's not building up any kind of equity in the goodwill bank by pushingthis.With that said, this is his right. And I think from -- what the citizensare getting an education right now is how our Constitution works. And it'snot great for the country. It's great for -- if you're a con law professorat Quinnipiac teaching on election law. It's like -- it gives me greatmaterial.CAVUTO: So, John, real quickly on that, it is within his right to count theballots, but let me ask you this.Is it within his right, and do you see any truth to his charge that he woneasily and handily and this was fraudulent and rigged and he has the proof?Because, time and again, when we have sought that proof, or wanted to takea look at these hundreds of affidavits that have supposedly been signed toargue the case, we don't see them.Now, maybe they're saving them for some moment. But I'm just wondering...PAVIA: Yes, there's...CAVUTO: ... do you think this was a fraudulently won election on the partof Joe Biden, from what you have seen?PAVIA: I don't.And when it ended, he made the allegations. And my first thought was, OK,so now you have to come up with proof of real systemic fraud, right? Everypresidential election, there's these wacky ballots, and you get affidavitsof people who said these the -- a bag of ballots were dropped off or burntin some -- I mean, that happens in every election.But you had to come up with something that shocks the conscience of people.And they haven't. There's no evidence. And there's not enough evidence, notnearly enough.So, no. Joe Biden, I think, is going to be the next president. And I thinkDonald Trump has the right to do what he's doing. And I -- but I think,after tomorrow, if these state legislators come out of the Oval Office,say, Mr. President, we're just not going to go back to Michigan and tellpeople that we're not going to follow the will of the voters, I think hereally needs to start saying, let me -- let me, to the extent I can, nowtry to be a gracious loser and do the right thing.CAVUTO: All right, we will see.John Pavia, thank you.That's what we're waiting for here, as you're looking at the White Houseright now, the North Portico here. Very soon, we should see these gentlemenleave, these top legislators from Michigan, and whether they have indeedresponded to the pressure from the president to at least consider some ofthe things he's saying.They might address the press. They might not.In the meantime, the president-elect, Joe Biden, himself, who is convinced,on January 20, he will be sworn in, already dotting his I's, crossing hisT's on things he might be able to do with Democratic leadership NancyPelosi, Chuck Schumer, meeting with them today in Wilmington.Peter Doocy has the latest on how all that went.Hey, Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: And, Neil, good afternoon.The president-elect appears ready to take the name the people's house toheart, because he told Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer shortly after theyarrived that, when he is in the Oval Office, mi casa es su casa, my houseis your house.The transition team really did not give cameras very much time inside thetheater where a room has been converted into a temporary office space withsome placards that say, "The Office of the President-Elect."You can see it there. And it was hard to hear much of what Biden saidbecause of distance from the microphone and also because of masks. But thespeaker of the House told us before she got here that the point of thismeeting was going to be to talk about how to approach the lame-ducksession, how to avoid a government shutdown, and how to invest ininfrastructure and clean energy.This is the rare meeting during the transition for Biden with out-of-towners that is not conducted via Zoom. And it is the only thing on hisschedule today, his 78th birthday. So we do expect them to add some icecream in there somewhere as well -- Neil.CAVUTO: Seventy-eight years old.All right, thank you, Peter Doocy, for that.Let's go to Mark Warner right now, the Virginia Democrat, SenateIntelligence Committee ranking member.Senator, always good to see you. Thank you for taking the time.Do you believe that maybe part of this meeting the president-elect had withNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer was to sort of push along a stimulus deal,perhaps before the president-elect even takes over in January? Is thatdoable, in your eyes?SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): Neil, I want to get to that.But I just got to, like, say, guys -- and I appreciate your honesty andstraightforwardness.But I just hope you remind your viewers Joe Biden won this race by sixmillion votes. There's 306 electoral votes. In virtually every one of theseclose states, he won by bigger margins than President Trump won in 2016.This election, based upon Donald Trump's own appointees, was the cleanestand least interfered with, thank God, due to Chris Krebs and CISA and ourintel community and our law enforcement.Thirty days out, we were afraid of -- we were afraid of foreigninterference. We were afraid there might be violence in our elections.Thank God Americans turned out, record numbers for Donald Trump, biggernumbers for Joe Biden.The system worked. And the vast majority -- and the one thing I just wishmore of my Republican Senate friends would get on FOX and say -- some ofthem have said it, but there is not a single one that I have talked to thatisn't privately embarrassed by the antics of Donald Trump in the lastcouple weeks, in refusing to acknowledge the will of the American people.Now, in terms of a stimulus package...CAVUTO: Well, Ben Sasse has said -- Ben Sasse has said that. Mitt Romneyhas said that.But you wanted to bring this up. And I think it's a good time to bring itup, Senator.WARNER: A whole bunch...(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: This notion that the president might never -- I hear you, but thatthis president might never concede, or he might grudgingly concede and saythat the other guy won by trickery.Do you think that is a wise strategy that, if -- even if he is saying, allright, in the end, I tried everything again to turn around what he views tobe a rigged and fraudulent election, that that will be good enough, thatpeople will look at that not the way the president wants it to be lookedthat?WARNER: Well, Neil, thank goodness you and responsible broadcasters even onconservative networks are being willing to not play into that falsehood.When the president-elect is not getting the presidential daily brief on theintel basis, that is making our country less safe. When the president-electis not getting the coronavirus information that he needs, that is making usless safe.When I am fearful that we have seen the defense secretary fired, that ChrisKrebs fired, I worry about the CIA director and the FBI director. That isnot making us more safe.When we arbitrarily -- and I think there ought to be a plan to get out ofAfghanistan, but it ought to be a plan that is done in concert with the 30nations who have fought with us and our Afghan allies, who have died withus. And when those troop levels are brought down arbitrarily, with nowarning, that does not make us more safe.And I just implore your viewers who -- even no matter how big of DonaldTrump supporters they are, that they ought to recognize we ought to beabout rule of law. And if Donald Trump wants to play out all his actions,fine, but not going through the beginnings of a peaceful transfer of power-- my God, you don't need disinformation coming out of Russia.It's coming out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.Now, to the virus and the relief package, it is almost criminal that theSenate is breaking and not staying in and putting another COVID package.I love the fact that the market is so high, but when we are looking at acliff of ending the unemployment, ending the rent for -- the rentalforbearance, the mortgage forbearance, the student debt forbearance, wheremy small businesses and restaurants are closing left and right...CAVUTO: So, you want to move quickly. I understand.I don't mean to jump on you, Senator.WARNER: Yes, I want to move quickly.CAVUTO: I do want to go back to what you were saying about the president,though.Let me ask you this very, very quickly. He might not budge on this wholething. And I'm beginning to wonder. Some of your Democratic colleagues haveexpressed enough concern to Joe Biden that he should be countering a legalassault on the president's legal assault, because they're concerned, by notanswering it, they might be teeing up a long, protracted legal strugglehere, and that he should -- he should be doing that.What do you say?WARNER: My -- listen, I went to law school, but I would never pretend to bea lawyer.It seems to me, from what I have read from, from your commentary andothers, the president has virtually lost all of these lawsuits. And what Ithink Donald Trump would want is, he wants -- we know one thing DonaldTrump is great at. He's great at punch, punch, punch.And I think Joe Biden really wants to try to be president of folks votedfor him and folks who didn't vote for him. And I think, so far, him nottaking the bait makes sense.But I do implore business leaders. Every business organization that I'maware of in the country has said, let's go through this orderly transition.Those people who still have Mr. Trump's ear, I hope, at some point, theywill make the case that we need to...CAVUTO: Well, they haven't reached it.But let me ask you this, Senator. And I -- my producers want to kill me.WARNER: Sure.CAVUTO: But this is an interesting...(CROSSTALK)WARNER: Sure.CAVUTO: This -- if the president never concedes, doesn't go to theinauguration, doesn't have any of the stuff where he meets his successor atthe White House, you know, the normal things we do...WARNER: Sure.CAVUTO: ... that are part of this whole pageantry of a change in power, howwould you feel about that?WARNER: I would be, frankly, not surprised by Mr. Trump once again showing-- putting his own personal ego first, and I think it would be a greatdisrespect.I think it would be a great disrespect for the 73 million Americans whovoted for Donald Trump that he wouldn't honor the traditions of the officeof the presidency.CAVUTO: All right, Senator Warner, thank you very, very much.The senator speaking out on that.The president has said that, by almost anything he's examined and hiscampaign team that's challenging all of this has examined, there wasfraudulent and rampant, and rampant irregularities, so much so, thepresident insists again and again that he won substantially.There are no numbers to confirm that, no numbers that even get us close tothat. But the fight goes on.And the question right now is, at what point does the president say, that'sit?So far, not now.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, Pfizer is searching for emergency approval by the FDAfor its vaccine. It's done in coordination with BioNTech.Here's the thing, though. That vaccine has to be very, very cold, about 94degrees below zero cold. Easier said than done.Edward Lawrence has some ideas they're kicking around to make sure it canhappen -- Edward.EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Neil, the coldstorage business is really heating up here.They have never been busier at Thermo Fisher Scientific. These are productsthat are ready to go out the door. They're testing them. You can seethey're testing this unit at negative-92 degrees Celsius. Now, negative-70degrees Celsius is what Pfizer and BioNTech need. That's also negative-94Degrees Fahrenheit.The demand for these units globally has never been bigger than right now.In fact, the company realized that this was coming after they had theirfirst contact with vaccine makers. And so they started to gear up. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MITCH COYNE, VICE PRESIDENT, GENERAL MANAGER OF CONTROLLED TEMPERATURETECHNOLOGIES, THERMO FISHER: No, this is a new level, new capacity levelsfor our cold storage business. And it's been something we have beenplanning, again, back from the March/April time frame, when productionstarted.And when we thought about how this was going to be distributed to themarket, we took some significant actions in the middle of the summer toramp up our production and our raw material plan.(END VIDEO CLIP)LAWRENCE: Yes, they started buying those raw materials in July. They alsostarted hiring people in July; 700 people work at this plant. And you knowwhat? They're still hiring to try and meet that demand -- Neil.CAVUTO: All right, thank you very much, Edward Lawrence, on all of that.Let's go to Dr. Roshini Raj, NYU Langone associate professor of medicine,so much more.Doctor, the emergency use and everything else that they want for this,that, I guess, the FDA or other authorities decide on. But it takes acouple of doses, right? So, explain how this one works.DR. ROSHINI RAJ, NYU LANGONE HEALTH: Sure.So, this vaccine, as you said, does require two doses. You get one dose,which is an injection, and then, three weeks later, you get the seconddose. And you really do need both doses to get the efficacy that they'requoting as 95 percent.And let's just point out, Neil, if we're talking about potentially havingthis ready in December, COVID really hit the U.S., let's say, lateFebruary, March. So it's a remarkably rapid time frame, and to develop avaccine and actually get it into the people's hands, really remarkable, andthe 95 percent, a much higher number than we were certainly even hopingfor.So it's pretty incredible what we have seen so far.CAVUTO: Others are coming down the pike as well, Doctor. I know you and Ihave chatted about this.Whether you're looking at Johnson & Johnson or Moderna, they're all sort oflooking at offerings of their own. How do you, as a doctor, decide which isbest and for whom?RAJ: Well, I think we're going to definitely get some guidance from theFDA.And you're going to have to compare a lot of factors. One is efficacy. And,right now, it looks like so far very promising for all of the vaccines thatwe have data on so far above 90 percent. But the other thing is deployment,and how are you going to deploy these vaccines?And some of them require that very cold storage, and some do not. It may bemuch easier to use those vaccines that don't need the deep freeze. So, partof it's going to depend on what facilities you have in your area, in yourcounty or even in your hospital.And then we may get more data, hopefully, on certain vaccines, perhapsmaybe even better for certain populations, like for the elderly or thosewith medical issues. And it may be a case where you're choosing based onthe individual person which vaccine is more suited to them.But this is going to take a while. And I do want to kind of temper the goodnews with the not-so-great news, because this is not going to happenovernight. It's going to take several months to really deploy this to allof the Americans.And the other thing is really educating Americans about the importance ofgetting the vaccine.CAVUTO: Right.RAJ: Unfortunately, we're already hearing a lot of pushback, because peoplesay they're not going to take the vaccine, they don't believe in it. Theydon't think it's safe.So, there's going to be a lot of work to do on that front as well.CAVUTO: Yes, you're right about that. And you had telegraphed that lasttime you were here, that you got to get people over that resistance.Doctor, thank you very much. Hope you have a very safe, healthyThanksgiving yourself, Dr. Roshini Raj.RAJ: You too.CAVUTO: In the meantime, the vice president just wrapping up campaigning onbehalf of the two Republican Georgia senatorial candidates.Democrats need to win both those races to take control of the U.S. Senate.How's that looking?We will ask the lieutenant governor of Georgia -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: Fifty million Americans taking to the roads and airports to head toyour house for Thanksgiving. But have they heard that now you can't havethat many of them? How is it outside?We will be back after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, those Republican senatorial candidates in Georgia had abit of an assist today by the vice president of the United States.And it doesn't end there. For the next six weeks or so, this is going toget very, very interesting.Steve Harrigan in Atlanta on how all of this is going down.Hey, Steve.STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, the vice president in Georgiatoday really on a dual role, on the one hand, campaigning for the twoRepublican Senate run-off candidates for that run-off election on January5, but also making the case that the presidential election is not yet over.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As our election contestscontinue here in Georgia and in courts across the country, I will make youa promise. We're going to keep fighting until every legal vote is counted.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)PENCE: We're going to keep fighting until every illegal vote is thrown out.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)PENCE: And whatever the outcome, we will never stop fighting to makeAmerica great again.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)PENCE: That's why Georgia and America need David Perdue and Kelly Loefflerback in a Republican majority in the United States Senate.(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)HARRIGAN: There's already been one presidential recount by hand in Georgia.They count almost five million ballots, found that Joe Biden had a lead ofmore than 12,000 votes. The governor of Georgia expected to certify thatvote in just about a half-an-hour's time -- Neil, back to you.CAVUTO: All right, thank you very much for that, Steve.Again, waiting for the governor to do that.I wonder how the lieutenant governor feels about all of this.Geoff Duncan joins us right now.Sir, thank you for taking the time. I know you have been quite, quite busy.LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN (R-GA): Yes, glad to be here.CAVUTO: The president not keen on anyone writing off on election that hethinks he won in Georgia.Do you think, from what -- everything you have seen, sir, that Joe Bidenwon Georgia fair and square?DUNCAN: Well, we're well into the process of counting every legal vote herein Georgia.Just a few hours ago, Brad Raffensperger, our secretary of state, signedoff on certification on the election results. And I know the governorshortly will be taking that issue up in his office.I believe the process here has been one that we have paid a lot ofattention to. We have focused on just following the letter of the law,Neil, and certainly proud of the effort of all the election offices on therecount that we had, the risk-limiting audit that just finished a few daysago.CAVUTO: So, you accept what the secretary of state has said, what thegovernor will sign off on, that it was close, but, in the end, Donald Trumplost your state?DUNCAN: Yes, I definitely follow the secretary of state's guide here thatthey have absolutely counted the legal votes.We continue to have a legal process for the president to be able to pursue.I know that he has the opportunity in the next few days to ask for anadditional recount. I believe he has until Tuesday to make that request.But, certainly, I encourage any candidate or any citizen, if you see anysort of impropriety, now is the time to point it out to us, because thehour is late.CAVUTO: The president had been critical of the secretary of state. TwoRepublican senatorial candidates said he should step down, that he hasn'tserved the people of Georgia well.Do you agree with that?DUNCAN: Yes, Brad Raffensperger has been great to work with, from ouroffice's perspective.Brad and I actually served in the state House of Representatives together.He's a rock star conservative. He is absolutely focused in on trying tofollow the letter of the law. And, certainly, our team has worked well withhim. And they have communicated well to us as to the process they're in.And, look, Neil, this is not easy, right? It is absolutely in the spotlighton the national stage.CAVUTO: Right.DUNCAN: But we are in -- making sure we count every legal vote.Every citizen in the state of Georgia that cast a vote deserves that. Everycandidate's name on the ballot deserves that. And that's the process we'refocused in on.CAVUTO: The president has been not pleased with the states that don't gohis way or he feels that there's been some fraud or rigging that maybestate officials like yourself are unaware of.Mitt Romney, among others, Ben Sasse as well, saying that the president hasbeen very undemocratic, the way he has been pressing Republicans tooverturn election results.Do you believe the president has been undemocratic in his approach?DUNCAN: I have said this a couple of times on TV the past week or so.Look, just because the guy I voted for isn't going to win the state ofGeorgia doesn't mean my job description changes. I'm focused on the letterof the law. I'm focused on earning the trust of 11 million Georgians. And,quite honestly, at this point, the whole country is watching. We want tomake sure we put our best foot forward and earn the trust of everybody.Neil, one of the things that's hard for me to watch play out here inAmerica is this attraction to 10-second sound bites, or to figuring out away to gather 7 percent of the truth and package it as a tweet, or topackage it as a Facebook post.Just imagine if the founding fathers were more worried about 100 likes on asocial media post than they were doing the right thing.And so, look, this is a difficult process to go through. And we're going tokeep making sure we earn the trust. But, at the end of this process, onJanuary 20, this is still America. This is still a great place to raiseyour family. This is still a great place to run your business. This isstill the greatest military on the face of the Earth.I'm proud of that. And we're going to keep working hard here in Georgia toearn that trust.CAVUTO: And you have been consistent on that.Geoff Duncan, thank you very, very much, the lieutenant governor of thebeautiful state of Georgia, as this Senate race continues. That will bedecided on January 5.By the way, the Georgia secretary of state will be my special guesttomorrow on "Cavuto Live," 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. So, we will get intothis a little bit more with the guy who has become an increasing target ofthe president on this race and actually some others.Stay with us.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, we're just getting news that Kyle Rittenhouse, theteenager charge in those twin fatal shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin, hasjust been released on $2 million bond.We don't know the details, who provided the money, what have you, but KyleRittenhouse released now on a $2 million bond. We will keep you posted ifwe find out any anything more.And, meanwhile, keeping you posted, back on politics, on the president-elect and who he is going to select eventually for his Cabinet.Among the first posts he is considering is Treasury secretary. And a numberof interesting names have popped up. None of them are the traditional whitemale model.Charlie Gasparino on the impact of a decision like this, I think, Charlie,due before Thanksgiving next week, right?CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, we're -- thevice president-elect has indicated it's imminent.The names have been floating around for a while. I'll tell you who I havebeen hearing from Democratic sources, Lael Brainard, Fed governor, woman,at the top of the list. Number two, an African-American, very accomplishedeconomist Roger Ferguson. He just left TIAA-CREF, so he's signaling thatsomething's happening with him in this new administration.I have also heard other names out there, Janet Yellen. Elizabeth Warren hasbeen -- the former Fed chairwoman. Elizabeth Warren's name is out there.But I think because we have divided government, most likely now, theelection -- the results of this election, particularly the down-ballotraces, which went a lot of Republicans, they picked up seats in the House,and that -- and there's a good chance going to keep the Senate.You don't want to put -- you just don't want to contentious hearing withsomeone as progressive as her, so she's unlikely to get the nod.If I had -- if I was laying odds on this thing, Neil, I would say theTreasury secretary is likely to go too Lael Brainard, and Roger Ferguson islikely to take the NEC job, the job currently held by Larry Kudlow.Both are very good at their jobs. They are considered moderate Democrats.These are not the people that are out of the mainstream. They areaccomplished economists.Jamie Dimon would probably be the best pick for the job. He's the head ofJ.P. Morgan Chase, as you know, the best banker in modern -- in recenthistory. But the progressives hate him. They -- he's too much of a banker.One of the about Ferguson just for this job is that, while he istechnically running the -- typically, until recently, ran an investmentcompany, TIAA-CREF invests for teachers. That's a big Democraticconstituency.CAVUTO: Oh, interesting.GASPARINO: So you don't run -- you don't really have a problem politicallywith that.Lael Brainard has been most of her -- spend most of her career ingovernment think tanks and academia. So, again, she is -- she passes thesmell test. And Janet Yellen is a known quantity.I still think it's -- I think, if I was to bet again, Lael Brainard getsTreasury, Roger Ferguson gets NEC.CAVUTO: All right. Right.GASPARINO: Are those are good choices. Those are not out-of-the-mainstreamchoices. And they're accomplished.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: All the remarkable, when you think of someone like a Steve Mnuchin,who has been with the president from the very beginning, his one and onlyTreasury secretary. That's rather unusual.(CROSSTALK)GASPARINO: That's a great point, Neil.CAVUTO: An administration that went through people like tissue paper, youknow?GASPARINO: Right.And that is a great point, because if you would think of any positionthat's a burnout position, it's usually the Treasury secretary inadministrations that don't have much turnover. I mean, Obama went throughTim Geithner, and then he had Jack Lew.It's a burnout job.CAVUTO: It is a tough job, yes.GASPARINO: So, it's remarkable that Mnuchin lasted as long as he did.CAVUTO: Got it.All right, my friend, have a wonderful, safe weekend trip.GASPARINO: You too. Thanks.CAVUTO: Charlie Gasparino, the best in the business by far.Also want to let right now about the travel plans on many Americans. Eventhough they're being urged, stay home, stay home, 50 million are ignoringthat. And a good many are coming to your house. Now, maybe you haven'tbroken the news to them that local governors and mayors are telling youthat you can't have any more than 10 people at your house.What are you going to do about the 20 that are on their way?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: Well, anyone who's in authority says it's not a good idea to travelthis Thanksgiving, but, apparently, 50 million are ignoring that advice anddoing so anyway.Jeff Paul at Los Angeles International Airport with more on what will be avery busy week for such traveling -- Jeff.JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Very busy regardless.But the CDC is emphasizing that this is a recommendation, not some sort ofrequirement or travel ban. But they do hope people listen to their warningabout not traveling this Thanksgiving.And they really want people to think twice about whether that trip is worthit, to risk someone's life just to go have dinner at somebody else's houseor see a family member, when you could do it later down the road, when itis safer.And it's not just about the death toll. They're also worried about thespread of the coronavirus. Within just the last week, the U.S. saw aboutone million new cases. But despite those increasing numbers and the newwarning, there's a mixed reaction among travelers.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no qualms whatsoever traveling. I think it'sactually cleaner on the planes than it is going to a gas station andgetting gas.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's the safest place right now. I mean, they're verystrict on their COVID procedures. And it was time to get away.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm with the belief that you can give thanks every daywith family, but you don't want a situation where you meet, and then youare going to go to someone's funeral two or three months later.(END VIDEO CLIP)PAUL: Now, last year, more than 4.5 million people traveled by air for theThanksgiving holiday. AAA is estimating that number to be cut in half ormaybe even more with this CDC warning about not traveling for the holiday,long extended weekend.And LAX says they're going to be ready for whoever comes to the airport.They will have hand sanitizer out, Plexiglas up. You have got to wear yourmask.And, Neil, one other quick note. You really got to hand it to the peoplewho work here, whether it's people keeping the restrooms clean, the flightattendants. Really a big kudos to them, because they're not only worriedabout their job, but also their health.CAVUTO: I'm glad you mentioned that, Jeff, and very true, at that.Jeff Paul on all of that.We're going to take you to the state of Connecticut after this. They havegot a red alert going on.The state's governor on what's behind that red alert and the spikes incases that almost, well, has the entire state looking red.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, as expected -- and we had the lieutenant governor ofGeorgia on a short time ago -- I just want to let you know that Georgia hascertified Joe Biden the winner in that state.I'm going to be talking to the state's secretary of state tomorrow. It wasthe center of a lot of attacks from the president and even the twoRepublican senatorial candidates that he wasn't doing enough to police whatthey said was a flawed voting process.But, apparently, it's all over here, certified, signed, sealed and justabout done. So, we will keep you posted on any new developments there.Also keeping you posted on a spike in coronavirus cases pretty much allover the country. They have various ways of treating this in some states.What I like about what they do in Connecticut is, it's color-coded. So, forme, I can look at the picture of the Nutmeg State and see virtually allred. I don't know what that means, but it's a red alert phase.The state's governor back with us, Ned Lamont.Governor, always good to have you with.This looks worrisome. What's going on?GOV. NED LAMONT (D-CT): Look, we're high infection. The whole country ishigh infection.Last time, COVID hit us in a region. It hit the country in differentregions. This time, it's nondiscriminating. It's everywhere, which makes ita little tougher, because I can't borrow from one hospital to supportanother one. But we're as ready as you can be.CAVUTO: So, what do you do in this environment?Your -- some of your colleagues in New York and in New Jersey are limitingThanksgiving Day gatherings. What's going on in Connecticut?LAMONT: Look, we want you to stay with your family. I heard your piece ontravel. Stay close to home. Don't travel this time.And the main, most important thing we have done recently is saidrestaurants, after 10:00 at night, you got to close down. It's easy toenforce. We were finding restaurants were becoming bars as the evening wenton. That's no more.CAVUTO: Yes.I'm wondering, too, people hearing about these vaccines, and, sometimes,Governor, I always get the idea that people get a little devil may care. Ican be a little more risky now because I'm hearing about these vaccinescoming down the pike.What do you tell your residents?LAMONT: I tell them it's good news. Vaccines are coming. We're ready to getthem distributed. But it's the eighth inning of the ball game. And a lot ofgames are won and lost in the final two innings.So this is the time for you to really hunker down, be disciplined, getready. It's a bridge to the vaccine. By later this spring, we should be ingood shape.CAVUTO: Now, the CDC, of course, is very cautious about the travelrecommendations, to your point. A lot of people are traveling just thesame.I'm wondering about the economic impact, because, when you have to revisitrestrictions and that sort of stuff, it slows things down. Are you worriedthat, just as you were making these gains, the Connecticut economy couldsuffer all over again?LAMONT: Well, we have kept manufacturing and construction. We have gotabout 88 percent of our economy open.I worry about the service sector, though, like restaurants, where, if theyhad to close, that represents hundreds of thousands of unemployed.I think the good news we have learned, compared to last time, is that wecan open retail safely, and if you keep your distance and wear the mask.And that's -- that's a lot of economic activity that we can keep going.CAVUTO: All right, stay safe, stay healthy, Governor Ned Lamont, beautifulstate of Connecticut, like so many states, all this spiking up again.But he's trying to put the hammer down and get it under control, as are alot of his Republican and Democratic colleagues. Party knows no fault linehere. This is something we're all in together.Again, you just heard that news in Georgia that this vote was certified forJoe Biden. Georgia's secretary of state with me tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.Eastern Time to weigh the impact.Here's "The Five."Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
