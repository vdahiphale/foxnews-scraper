JEANINE PIRRO, "JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE" HOST: Welcome to the special edition of "Hannity" the intolerant left. I'm Jeanine Pirro in tonight for Sean. Tonight for the hour, we'll review the extreme measures Democrats, Liberals, and the mainstream media will take in order to malign President Trump and everyone who supports him. 
But first, I want to address my recent appearance on "The View" to discuss my new book, "liars, Leakers and Liberals" and the events that followed. Much has been said about what took place between me and Whoopi Goldberg both on and off the set. Tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m., I will address everything that went down and set the record straight on my show "Justice." We hope you will join us.

But first, it was a busy week for President Trump and a frenzied week for everyone who hates him. Ever since President Trump took office, the left has been totally obsessed with all things Russia but this week following the president's meeting with Vladimir Putin, their Russia hysteria reached all new levels of crazy. Watch this.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think it's extreme to use the treason word. 
 Adhering to the enemies, giving them aid and comfort. I have no trepidation about assigning the "treason" word. It's no different then had someone attacked the United States with missiles.

PIRRO: Joining us now to weigh in on all of this absurd rhetoric is the counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. Hello Kellyanne.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, POLITICAL CONSULTANT AND COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Hi.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        }
      
PIRRO: As I listen to that rundown of comments, I couldn't help but think treason is an offense for which you can receive the death penalty. Are they looking for the president to get the death penalty?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

CONWAY: Oh but for a media that is so precise about the language they always want to hear from everyone who works here, boy do they just toss words in the salad bowl and mix as they want to come out with the toxic stew. It makes no sense to me Jeanine that they are hunched over in anger at all times. They are physiologically incapable of finishing a sentence or addressing any issue without mentioning Donald Trump's name five or ten times. 
He and I were looking at the Washington Post the other day, and he pointed out that there were six of the seven articles on the front page were all about him and only because the all-star game was in town, or it would have been seven out of seven. And so it tells you something. The obsessive outrage has been mainstreamed and regularized and I think this is a very serious point because it's not just that the outrage and the "who can out-crazy the next on cable TV" has been accepted as now expected. 
You have a lot of print journalists who have contracts with these cable news stations. So even though it has their print affiliation below their names, they are performing for the cameras and the viewers on those particular networks. I take complete offense with a smile on my face but on behalf of those who suffered loss, grievous loss on 9/11, over 3,000 Americans gone; Kristallnacht where 2,400 plus Americans killed at Pearl Harbor. My goodness, they're comparing it to this? What do the families feel when they hear that?  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And so it's completely over the top and I just want to tell you something else, you and I can complain about it but I have a slightly different view. 
 I'm not sure it really matters. I'm not sure it matters. The president's approval ratings are far higher than the Democrats in Congress, than the mainstream media's. I don't think it matters because people curate from each and every event what they think is most important to them.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What is most important to them is that this president and the tradition of the presidents from the last 75 years beginning with Eisenhower met with the leader of the Kremlin. He is duty-bound to keep us out of war and he is trying to forge a conversation on issues that affect both countries and the rest of the world: North Korea, the Middle East, Israel, Iran, nuclear proliferation, Syria, obviously the Ukraine; so many different issues to discuss with the different heads of countries. 
PIRRO: OK, so - so we've got a president who is doing his duty, which as you say is to keep us out of war and doing what every president has done over the last 75 years, which is meet with the leader of the Kremlin and they are yelling the sky is falling. When Blumenthal says and it is a 9/11 moment, just like before 9/11. What could they be talking about? Everyone is like saying what is it that the people are talking about?

CONWAY: First of all, it gets someone like Senator Blumenthal on the next TV to talk more crazy. I have to say he represents the people of Connecticut. Connecticut suffered losses on 9/11 in the towers.
PIRRO: Interesting.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CONWAY: . if not on the airplanes. So how could he possibly do that and equate that to the grievous loss of life, the worst terrorist attack on American soil in our nation's history. Let's recap last week because the media doesn't want to talk about it. The president started the week out at NATO where he extracted $44 billion in contributions toward shared defense from these countries on the way to securing commitments for hundreds of billions of dollars more into the future.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Secretary Soltenberg of NATO thanked President Trump on Twitter and in person publicly, saying thank you for doing this. It's because of his leadership and stewardship that this is happening that other countries are keeping their commitments the way that our country has.
Then he went to the U.K. to reaffirm our great and historic relationship by meeting with the Queen who I think reviewed the guards for the first time we're told in about 70 years also with Theresa May. And then over to his meeting with Putin which is not unlike what other presidents have done with the leader of the Kremlin at the time. 
I want to say one more thing - it is just stark raving mad that when the media think about Russia, all they think about is election meddling. And when they think about the Supreme Court all they think about is abortion. There are so many different issues to talk about. The president has said yes he believes the intelligence. Russia interfered but Jeanine it was unsuccessful interference.

CONWAY: He said there's no evidence that it affected a vote or swung the electoral outcome. Why doesn't the media say that and why did Obama and Brennan and Clapper, the last two who are cable news pundits now, why did they bury the intelligence they had? They had it in the fall of 2016. I was a campaign manager at that time. They never came to me and said we want you to see this. They buried it because they thought she would win and Trump would lose and all of a sudden it became a big deal in December and January to them.

PIRRO: You know what? They buried it because they were part of -- when they talk about meddling in the election, I think the intelligence community and the D.O.J. and the F.B.I. was meddling in the election. Anyway, Kellyanne Conway, always good to get your take on all of this. Thank you so much. 
CONWAY: Thank you, Judge Jeanine.

PIRRO: All right and joining us now with more is the author of the book "Why We Fight.," Fox News national security strategist Sebastian Gorka and former Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee. All right, guys I'm not going to go over all the crazy again because for anyone to compare the president doing what he did by meeting with the leader of the Kremlin to the Holocaust or Kristallnacht or treason or a 9/11 moment, they have to be out of their minds. But Austan, can you please tell me what they are thinking? We are all level-headed smart people here. When Obama said, "Tell Vlad I'll get back to him, I'll have more flexibility," why didn't they flip out then? 
AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER OBAMA ECONOMIC ADVISOR: Well, look, the Obama question, a lot of people said a lot of very offensive things about President Obama, as you know and we'll leave it at that.

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GOOLSBEE: Look, in this case, I think normally, I agree with you. People on the left and on the right can go too far. On the question of the the summit however, here it's not just the left. I notice you did not play the Republican statement about what President Trump's summit achieved, which were extremely critical. They called him disgraceful. The Republicans, one leading Republican official in Ohio resigned from the Republican Party. 
PIRRO: I don't think he resigned from the party. You are wrong about that; he resigned from his position. He says he is still a Republican. 
GOOLSBEE: OK. The thing I would say Judge is this. It is okay to sometimes if the president does something that doesn't turn out the way he wanted it to, and I think you have to say this summit did not go as well as he wanted it to. Republicans and Democrats and Independents have really kind of condemned what happened.

SEBASTIAN GORKA, MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Judge, it's outrageous and Kellyanne is absolutely right. The idea that Senator like Senator Blumenthal can besmirch the memory of the people who suffered in World War II, the people who suffered in the Holocaust. This is outrageous. Almost half a million Americans died in World War II; 3,000 on September 11 and this is what you are accusing the president of doing? This is like this is 9/11, Kristallnacht. It's sheer lunacy.

GORKA: Everybody thought Hillary would win. Right, congratulations, I'll be there. The fact is for 70 years the Soviets and then the Russians have been doing this. The left couldn't care less. The media couldn't care less. They only care now because Donald Trump won the election and they still psychologically unable to absorb the fact he is president.

And one more thing, Judge, F.D.R. and Truman met with Stalin dozens of times behind closed doors. We also had Kennedy meet with Khrushchev.

I will leave the Clinton Foundation out, the payback thing. But does it bother you that Russia with the approval of our government, has 20 percent of the America's uranium we use for nuclear medicine? 
GOOLSBEE: It might. I would have to see more details. My understanding is they are not allowed to remove it from the United States.

PIRRO: It went to Canada. It already went to Canada and they removed it. 
GOOLSBEE: It doesn't make the summit a success. This was a terrible summit that went very badly and I wish they could just put it behind us. 
PIRRO: So you are comparing a success to our losing 20 percent of our uranium that could be used for a bomb or that they use for our nuclear medicine. The last word.
GOOLSBEE: It cannot - it cannot be used for a bomb. You are talking about the different grade of uranium that cannot be used for a bomb.

GORKA: All you have to do is enrich it I mean that's classic what aboutism. Twenty percent of our uranium gets taken out of the country through Canada by the Russians, oh, but Trump didn't have the best press conference. That is most obscene and actually hilarious example of what- aboutism I have seen in my life. 
GOOLSBEE: It was your what-aboutism. I didn't raise it; you did.

JONATHAN HUNT, FOX CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Jonathan Hunt. Tragedy in Branson, Missouri, as 17 die in a duck boat accident; nine of those killed are from the same family. Two members of that family survived. One of them says that the captain told passengers not to bother grabbing their life jackets. The boat capsized during severe thunderstorms on Thursday night on Table Rock Lake. Authorities say 7 of the 14 survivors were hurt when the vessel went down. The captain is among the survivors.

Michael Cohen secretly taped a conversation with his then client and presidential candidate Donald Trump. They discussed making a payment to Playboy model Karen McDougal who claims she had an affair with the president. The phone call was made two months before the 2016 election. The president's attorney Rudy Giuliani says the payment was never made. I'm Jonathan Hunt. Now back to "Hannity." 
PIRRO: Welcome back to this special edition of "Hannity" the intolerant left. While the left and mainstream media are quick to attack President Trump over meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, they failed to see the real story of Trump's tough policies toward Russia. During an interview on CNBC, President Trump issued a stern warning to Putin if the relationship between the U.S. and Russia collapses. Watch this.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look at the sanctions I have put on. Look at the diplomats I threw out. Look at all of the things that I've done. Nobody else did what I've done. Obama didn't do it. Obama was a patsy for Russia. He was a total patsy. Look at the statement he made when he thought the mics were turned off, the stupid statement he made. 
 Nobody does a big deal about that. Getting along with President Putin, getting along with Russia is a positive, not a negative. Now, with that being said, if that doesn't work out, I'll be the worst enemy he has ever had. 
(END VIDE0)
PIRRO: But President Trump has not only issued warnings, he has a long track record of countering the malicious actions of Vladimir Putin. The president armed Ukraine, increased sanctions on Russia, increased funding to NATO, slapped severe financial restrictions on some of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, and authorized a counterattack on the Putin-backed soldiers inside of Syria killing hundreds. Remember, Russia's takeover of Crimea in the Ukraine, Putin's power grab in Syria, and the election meddling all happened on Obama's watch. Joining me now with reaction from the Fox Business Network, Lou Dobbs. Good evening, Mr. Dobbs. How are you this evening?
LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Good to see you Judge.
PIRRO: All right. Why can't they at least recognize what is fact? If they want to make up stuff and editorialize, that's okay, but they can't recognize the facts. 
DOBBS: They don't want to recognize the facts. The reality here is there is nothing accidental about what the left wing media is doing nor the desperate Dems, the Lilliputian Liberals who think they can compete with the president. They have to attack like a huge pack of hyenas to have any chance against getting the attention of this president and even then, it's not a fair fight. This president is achieving more than any president in modern, political history. You mentioned some of the achievements. And Putin learned something very important for world peace. He learned that there is not even an ounce of backup in president Trump. He thought he was dealing there with a while with an Obama-like figure. As soon as he did press in Syria, hundreds of his so-called "patriotic Russians" who were doing his bidding in Syria were dead on the battlefield. 
PIRRO: That's right. You know what I find interesting? There is so much criticism of the president as it relates to his going toe to toe with the NATO allies because they don't want to pay their full fare, but what is amazing is Germany is now buying its energy from Russia and while they buy it from Russia, they are saying hey, U.S. NATO, all of you protect us in case Russia comes after us. First of all, why is Germany buying the energy from Russia and then asking us for our money in case we need to defend them? What's that about? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DOBBS: Because just as the president has said, there have been in succession three American presidents who have been dumb enough to permit this direction on the part of Germany. They are in effect paying blackmail to Russia. Vladimir Putin won't hit them with a tactical nuclear weapons or whatever because he is getting a payment, whether it's for a pipeline or whether it's putting a chair on the board of a German chancellor on the chair of the pipeline. This is ridiculous and it's preposterous and not one person in the American media has been talking about this but me. 
PIRRO: You know what? I actually thought, I actually thought that there was a - that there was a reason that maybe and -- we are exporting energy now. The United States is starting this huge export of energy. Maybe the price -- no. it's blackmail. 
DOBBS: It's outright blackmail and Merkel has paid it. By the way, each German leader has been paying it. All of Europe is dependent upon Russia in one form or another, some small, some large percentages of their energy and each one of the European nations is dependent on Russia for energy. That is exactly what Putin wants; it's what's working. And what was it that President Trump in that summit in Helskinki attacked and suggested that Merkel do? And that is back the heck out of that pipeline and start buying your energy from your friends. 
PIRRO: Okay. So, the United States is getting stronger as it relates to the exporting of energy. Correct? 
DOBBS: Absolutely. We are a net exporter for the first time petroleumproducts. This is remarkable the success and to be very clear, it didn't start under Obama. It started under Trump. The full push for petroleum exports is remarkable. We are right now the largest oil producer in the world. 
PIRRO: In the world. 
DOBBS: And that may change because the president is also convinced Saudi Arabia to help with lowering prices by raising production so they may be competitive with us again.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
PIRRO: Well you know what? But the good news is if we at some point can rely on our own energy, that is a good thing. 
DOBBS: It's a wonderful thing and it's part of the deal. We have -- North America is replete with the petroleum reserves. This is the richest area in world when it comes to the natural resources. 
PIRRO: And we don't have to rely on the other guys anymore. 
 DOBBS: We really do not. 
PIRRO: Lou Dobbs, always good to have you on "Hannity." 
And earlier today, President Trump tweeted -- "I got severely criticized from the fake news media for being too nice to President Putin. In the old days they would call it diplomacy. If I was loud and vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!" 
Joining me now is the former Clinton pollster and Fox News Contributor Doug Schoen and GOPAC Chairman David Avella. All right Doug, let's start with you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sure.
PIRRO: All right, so the president gets out there and he does what every leader has done, and that is every president has done, meet with the leader of the Kremlin and now it's treason, which requires a death penalty sentence. It's a Holocaust, Kristallnacht, 9/11, the sky is falling. What do you think? 
SCHOEN: Well, I don't think it's Kristallnacht, 9/11, it certainly isn't treason but I would say as a principled hawk on foreign policy, the president was too accommodating. I would like to know. 
PIRRO: Why? 
SHOEN: I'd like to know Judge -- why? Because he did not affirm for the world media that the Russians had meddled. There was no discussion of our values, that we stand for freedom and liberty and they are an oppressive, authoritarian regime, that there was no discussion of the counterterrorism agreements that may or may not have been reached, or most importantly, you haven't talked about tonight, cyber security. Our intelligence views them as the most aggressive and the malevolent force in the world. We need to know before the next summit, where we stand, what we will do and we stand with the NATO allies four square, completely in defense of our values. 
PIRRO: David Avella, all right, so what Doug is saying is that he didn't reiterate and I'm going to say that word, that he believes it was meddling. It was meddling. could you understand why the president would be somewhat soft in terms of -- I don't want to use the word "soft," why the president was hesitant to totally support the intelligence community given the fake investigation that was based on the dossier purchased by Hillary Clinton? 
 ALLEN AVELLA, GOPAC CHAIRMAN: Doug's answer there sounds like he is auditioning to be Bernie Sanders; press secretary for his president bid in 2020. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SCHOEN: No, sir. I'm a Scoop Jackson Democrat. I'm a hawk. I'm not with Bernie sanders. I believe we assert the values and stand up to oppression everywhere. That is the opposite of Bernie Sanders, David, and you know that. 
AVELLA: Here is - here is the best way for the president to position us be in a position of strength against Russia and that is to keep the American economy going strong. The way we have all the funds to do all the things Doug talked about is a government with resources. The best way for government to get resources is American workers being at full capacity, making sure government has the resources it needs, and making sure nations around the world want to be working in our market, buying our products. 
And when we have a strong economy, it's the best way to deal with Russia. So what the president has done and to get us our economy where it is today he needs to keep doing. That is how we deal with Russia. 
PIRRO: But you know, Doug, you talk about being a hawk and what David is talking about is so incredibly important and that is economic strength. People who are in business together rarely go to war with each other but you say that you are a hawk. You know, when Putin annexed Crimea and with the overthrow attempted in Ukraine, Obama didn't do anything; President Trump is. We are sending billions to Ukraine in terms of arms and munitions. 
AVELLA: Well let me be very clear. I have worked in Ukraine and was acutely aware of what Putin did and I think it was outrageous and I think what Obama did was outrageous. I approach this as a patriot and an American, not a partisan. We need to do more to stand up to the Russians, whether it be in Ukraine, in Georgia, in Syria. We need to stand with our NATO allies--
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: But we're killing them. Hold on. We are killing them in Syria. We are arming them in Ukraine. We sanction them because of Crimea. I mean, come on. Let's not make -- let's not make like this is, he is not doing anything.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SCHOEN: I didn't say that. I said there is more to be done. Twenty percent of the overall land mass of Ukraine is held by the Russians. Whether it be Crimea or Eastern Ukraine. Putin is talking about a phony referendum in Ukraine. We got to say no to that and strengthen the Ukrainian government and indeed, our allies around the world. 
PIRRO: All right. David Avella and Doug Schoen, thanks so much. And coming up, Alan Dershowitz, Sara Carter, and Tom Fitton weigh in on the let's obsession with treason. Don't go away. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. 
It's the end of the world as we know it. At least that's what the left and the mainstream media want you to think. Some compare Trump's meeting with Putin to the Holocaust, Pearl Harbor and 9/11. 
But the favorite new talking point from some liberals, never-Trumpers and their friends in the media is that President Trump has treason. Take a look.

ERIN BURNETT, CNN HOST: The words like treason and undermining, you know, our Republican little case, our rule of government are being used now.

PIRRO: Joining us now with legal analysis of this absurd claim is the author of the book, "The Case against Impeaching Trump," Harvard Law professor, Alan Dershowitz. Fox News contributor, Sara Carter, Judicial Watch president, Tom Fitton. 
All right. Professor Dershowitz, I'll go to you first. What is treason? 
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL: Treason is the only crime defined specifically in the Constitution. It shall consist only in levying war against the United States or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort. 
Obviously, it's wartime. It's what Aaron Burr was accused of doing. It's what people who became Nazis and supported the Nazis and joined the Nazi regime were accused of doing. It's not what President Trump did. Nor is it what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt did when he went to Yalta and he sat down with Stalin and allowed him to control all of Eastern Europe. 
Many Americans on the right were calling that treasonous or treason. But you can't just throw that term around. It's the only crime specifically defined in the Constitution. 
I want to make one more point. To compare what President Trump did to the Holocaust or to Kristallnacht is a form of Holocaust denial. Because what it suggests is that nothing more happened to the Jews than is happening today in America. 
It suggests there were no gas chambers, there were no killing fields, there was no plan to kill six million Jews. It's a disgraceful comparison.

PIRRO: Well, then you know--
DERSHOWITZ: And it just demeans the suffering that so many people went through during the Second World War. 
PIRRO: Professor, without a doubt, the pain of the Holocaust is still rippling through our society. And the world. As well it should. 
DERSHOWITZ: Of course. 
PIRRO: But Sara Carter, I'll go to you. They also likened it to 9/11. Three thousand Americans were attacked on 9/11 and killed. What -- do these Democrats and the mainstream media, do they really, do they like laugh in a corner? Or do they believe this? 
SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You know, what is so frightening, Judge Jeanine, is that I actually think they believe this. At first it would seem laughable. I was thinking the first time I heard that, I thought is this a joke? Is this the crazy uncle in the corner? 
And then I kept hearing it over and over and over again. I mean, CNN dedicated nearly eight hours to calling the president treasonous. It is punishable by death. Think about that. 
This is disinformation. This is a campaign against an administration that is so volatile and so dangerous. Look, if they are worried about Russia, they should be worried about themselves more. Because the disinformation campaign that is coming across on the media and from the rhinos and from the Democrats is far more dangerous than what happened with Russia. 
PIRRO: Clearly. I mean, it is a hate campaign. Tom Fitton, and you know, a year ago, you would ask for freedom of information on certain documents, Department of Justice comes back and says no, no, no, no. So in February of this year, you actually file a lawsuit. I mean, you know, you follow through with this. 
TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Right. 
PIRRO: And now you are getting information I believe on the minimally corroborated dossier that we know was a fake. And I believe that we are now finding out that that dossier was an essential part of the FBI's application for the warrant. 
FITTON: Well, this is a big deal in the sense the FBI supposedly is going to give us, I would presume gave redacted materials about the FISA application, which the DNC, Clinton dossier was used to support. So we are going to get these FISA application warrants or at least versions of them that have been denied to the American people thus far. 
And it's been a year. The cover-up is beginning to end. And we'll see just how far the deep state is willing to go in terms of showing exactly the abuses it engaged in to target Trump. 
Remember, the allegation by Devin Nunes' intelligence committee was, that but for, there would be no FISA warrant, there would no spying on the Trump team but for Hillary Clinton's dossier that was laundered in the FBI and DOJ through Bruce Ohr, through the State Department, through Blumenthal, you name it. So this is a -- this could be a big deal. 
(CROSSTALK)
PIRRO: Well, it--
FITTON: We don't know. We were supposed to get the documents today. We haven't even gotten them yet. 
PIRRO: Right. I saw that you were supposed to get it today. But everything that you have been doing, Tom Fittom has been a big deal by getting information that Congress can't get. 
Well, I'm going to go to you, Professor Dershowitz. Now let's assume that Tom Fitton ends up getting information that proves that the dossier was totally an essential part of the warrants. And that we know that Hillary Clinton paid for it. Where do we go from there legally? What happens? 
DERSHOWITZ: Well, there is a case called Franks versus Maryland which says if a warrant -- it didn't deal with a national security warrant. It's even worse if it's a national security warrant because that's done ex-party and the court is supposed to be able to trust the people who are bringing it to them. 
FITTON: Right.
DERSHOWITZ: But if it's based on misinformation or failure to provide essential information the entire warrant can be thrown out. And then you get to the issue of fruit of the poisonous tree. And it's just not clear what it would do to the ongoing investigation. 
PIRRO: Or investigate.
DERSHOWITZ: No in my book "The Case Against Impeaching Trump" I follow through this whole analysis of what would happen if in the event we had a situation like that. And we have to get back to the point of treason as well. 
You know, treason is an impeachable offense. Yes, it's punishable by death. But the only people who commit treason and the only people subject to impeachment are the people who actually join forces militarily--
PIRRO: Yes.
DERSHOWITZ: -- with our enemies and help them during time of war. People like Ezra Pound.
PIRRO: Right.
DERSHOWITZ: People like the woman who broadcast to Americans, people who, Benedict Arnold. 
PIRRO: Right.
DERSHOWITZ: But treason is not something that can be used against the president.
(CROSSTALK)
PIRRO: Right. And Sara Carter--
DERSHOWITZ: They used to do that in England but they don't do it in America. 
PIRRO: -- I just have one time left. Sara Carter, what are your -- what are your sources telling you about the information that may be released to Tom Fitton? 
CARTER: Well, once this information comes out, I have been told by numerous sources that the answers will be revealed and it's going to be explosive. And this is the reason why, Judge Jeanine, the House intelligence committee and the other committees want the release of those documents. They don't want to allow the DOJ to continue hiding this from the American public. 
PIRRO: And Tom Fitton, just a few seconds. You know, Congress wants it. They don't want DOJ to hide it as Sara Carter just said, but you are the only guy getting it so my hat is off to you. But I'm not wearing a hat. 
FITTON: Well, you know, you got to go to court. Congress doesn't go to court. Come on, Congress. Join us. 
PIRRO: All right. Professor Alan Dershowitz, Sara Carter, and Tom Fitton, thanks so much for being with us. And still to come, Florida A.G. Pam Bondi and Tammy Bruce, they're going to weigh in on how the left is targeting pro-Trump supporters all over the country. That and more, as this special edition of Hannity continues. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Jonathan Hunt. 
New details tonight about preliminary plans for President Trump's military parade. At least 5,000 service members may march in the parade. It's also expected to feature old and new aircraft, grand vehicles and horses but no tanks will be featured. 
About 50 Pentagon staffers are reportedly planning the event. It's expected to cost at least $12 million. The parade is scheduled to take place November 10. 
The FDA issued a warning today about a synthetic marijuana laced with rat poison. It's also known as Spice or K2 and it sickened hundreds in 10 states and killed several others. Washington, D.C. is the latest city to issue a warning. More than 200 cases of people becoming have been link to the drug since Saturday.
I'm Jonathan Hunt. Now back to Hannity. 
PIRRO: Welcome back to the special edition of Hannity. 
The intolerant left. Yesterday, anti-Trump protesters gathered outside of the Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters' Los Angeles office where they burned and stomped on an American flag while chanting America was never great. 
They had gathered because a far right group had also planned protest at the same location. Also in Los Angeles, protesters tried to shut down the ground opening of a coffee shop because the owner is supposedly pro-Trump. 
The owner's daughter said it was very scary. There were a lot of people protesting outside wearing masks and they threw a significant amount of feces at our windows. 
It's becoming more common for Republicans, including members of the Trump administration to be harassed in public. Here are just some of the examples. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I was asked to leave a restaurant this weekend where I attempted to have dinner with my family. My husband and I politely left and went home. I was asked to leave because I work for President Trump. 
PAM BONDI, FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Three huge guys came up and started probably an inch from my face screaming at me every word in the book cursing as loud as they could. 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is on Mexican restaurant of all places. (muted) go. Shame on you!
(CROWD CHANTING)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are you separating families?
(CROSSTALK)
ELAINE CHAO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION: Why don't you leave my husband alone? 
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Back up. Back up. 
(END VIDEO CLIP)
PIRRO: Joining me now is Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Fox News contributor, Tammy Bruce. All right. Good evening to both of you. 
TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, there. 
PIRRO: You know, Pam, I have to tell you, when I hear about people burning the American flag, and chanting f America and all of the other stuff that we can't possibly say, it is, it's stunning to me. But the First Amendment protects all this. 
BONDI: That's right. It does protect that. And you know, we fought for this country to have the First Amendment right to do that. Let me say, shame on Maxine Waters. These were her supporters. And she is out there representing allegedly the United States of America. She should have come out and condemned them burning our flag right away. 
Her supporters said they weren't there to incite hate or violence yet they have pipes and bats. Really? I mean, she should be ashamed of herself because she has not come out and condemned this. And Jeanine, you and I have been saying this for a long time. She can stop this. But she won't. She keeps doubling down and making it worse. 
PIRRO: OK. And so, I mean, Tammy, what Pam says is true. She could have said something about it. 
BRUCE: Sure. 
PIRRO: But this is the same person saying when you see the people in publish, push back. Get a crowd. What's going to happen when, you know, something crazy happens? I understand that people were there were bats and pipes. 
BRUCE: Obviously we want this to stop before someone is killed or seriously injured. We've seen where there's protests where someone ends up getting killed. We've all rejected that. 
The problem is, indeed, that this has the permission slip that Maxine Waters gave the people who are on the edge. The good news is it's not everyone, right? These events make the news. It's a select, smaller group of people. We should not presume that this is all, you know, of America. 
I've begun to question whether or not we are as divided even as we are told we are. So in the midst of something like this, things can be done. Yes, Maxine Waters should have said, my gosh, I was wrong. Cleary this is now ballooning--
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: She was forced to say that. 
BRUCE: But you know who else has not said anything after something like this is Paul Ryan, is Mitch McConnell. Other Republican leadership that could say, you know, clearly representative Waters is not saying anything. But they've got the power to take action against her internally, in Congress. But also--
(CROSSTALK) 
PIRRO: What kind of power would they take or action, I should say? 
BRUCE: Well, I think that you can limit someone's position on committees. You can limit the engagement that they can have in Congress. You can embarrass them with the rebuke and a censure. None of those things have occurred. 
(CROSSTALK)
PIRRO: But you know, I've got to tell you, Pam, it seems like in Congress, you know, what Tammy is saying is a great idea. But one hand washes the other. Like all of a sudden we find out that there is a slush fund for sexual harassment. They all knew about it. And they are like shocked, there is gambling in Casablanca. I mean, it is the left and the right. One hand washing the other. What can we do about this? 
BONDI: This is not the America that we grew up in. Nor is it America we want to live in. And she needs to on her own condemn this. She needs to stop what she's been saying.
(CROSSTALK)
PIRRO: She is not going to, Pam. 
BONDI: I know. Someone is -- Tammy is right. You and I have been saying this, Jeanine. Someone is going to get hurt. And really I'm so glad the other side of protesters didn't show up that day. 
PIRRO: Yes.
BONDI: Yet her supporters still did armed with pipes and bats. Yet they weren't there for fear or hate. Really? 
PIRRO: You know, one of the things, Tammy, that concerns me is that when we have issues like we had in let's say with anti-fa when they jump into their ninja outfits.
BRUCE: Sure.
PIRRO: And then there is a stand-down by police, as we saw in Berkeley, with the arson and the fires and the damaging property. The stand-down by police, what can we do about that? 
BRUCE Well, I think the public conversation is important. We have to shame that kind of behavior, we got to point it out. We got to make sure that people know what cities are doing what. And there is. There needs to be a public shaming. 
But also, may I suggest -- I'm not a big fan of hate crimes. You know, a crime is a crime. But you've got action here where yes, you have the First Amendment when it comes to expressing your opinion. That does not include protection for violence or vandalism or terroristic threats or anything like that. 
What if, in fact, there were serious repercussions to that kind of action. We know that the charges were dropped in all of the rioters at the Trump inauguration, the anti-fa and others.
PIRRO: Right.
BRUCE: We -- perhaps it's about adding that kind of action as an additional hate crime. If you attack people because of their political beliefs -- but yell and speak all you want. Physical violence, and terrorism, that kind of dynamic we've got to address. 
PIRRO: Pam, you are the attorney general. 
BONDI: Yes.
PIRRO: Now when the police stand down, what power do we have? We have 30 seconds. What power do we have to force them to act? 
BONDI: Well, it's very difficult because again it's free speech. And that's what these people want. They want the police to attack them. They want to be arrested. That's what they want. They want to be dragged out in handcuffs. 
The only crime I saw based on in front of Maxine Waters' office was the theft of that flag. And that is a petty theft, Tammy, but it is a crime. And it is showing that people will be held accountable. 
BRUCE: Yes.
BONDI: But it's a bigger picture than this. These people have just got to stop. 
(CROSSTALK)
PIRRO: Thank you, both. Coming up, more of the special edition of Hannity right after the break. Stay with us. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
PIRRO: Welcome back to the special edition of Hannity. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left this evening. Be sure to pick up a copy of my new book, "Liars, Leakers, and Liberals."
