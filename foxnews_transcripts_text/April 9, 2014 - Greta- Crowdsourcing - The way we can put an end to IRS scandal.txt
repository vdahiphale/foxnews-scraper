Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. I know how to get to the bottom of the IRS scandal. Crowdsourcing.
The IRS should just turn over all the records and emails to us. We will dump them on the Internet and let the crowdsourcing begin. We can scour them and get real answers, real fast. Forget Congress. There is no sense of urgency there. Congress is getting answers - it's like taking forever. Drip, drip, drip, like they're on Quaaludes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Of course, they're not getting audited or tax exempt status, so what's the rush, right? And President Obama, he says he loves transparency. But he's no help. He decides what happened before the facts are known and expects us to accept his pronouncement. Remember his no "smidgen" of corruption crack? Well, just today, after the smidgen remark, we learned of an email where Lois Lerner, of course, is angling for a job with President Obama's political group Organization for Action. Now, that's cozy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I know the IRS, too, they are not going to like my idea. In fact, they are going to hate it and say, "Can't do." They are protecting the privacy interest of taxpayers. I got a way around that one, too. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Tea Party groups and others suspecting they were targeted may just want to waive their privacy rights. They are fed up with the IRS and they don't, for one second, think the IRS is their pal now suddenly protecting them when for the last six years they have been their target.
So, it's our turn to help. The American people crowdsourcing. I bet the target victims trust the American people more than they trust Congress, the president, and the IRS all rolled into one. Let's get privacy waivers. Let's put it all on the Internet. Transparency. And let's see where the chips may fall. And that's my "Off the Record" tonight.
