BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hi, Greg. That's one lucky turtle.Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.Breaking tonight, we begin another week in the throes of the coronaviruspandemic with another day of record hospitalizations across the U.S.Another warning that Christmas could be even more dangerous thanThanksgiving, and a lockdown affecting 34 million people in the nation'smost populous state. About 84 percent of Californians are under a stay athome order tonight, an order that is crippling many businesses and sparkingopen defiance by some in law enforcement.This happens one day after a record of almost 102,000 totalhospitalizations was recorded because of the virus. And the prediction fromDr. Anthony Fauci that the spiking cases around the Thanksgiving holidaymay be just beginning with the longer Christmas and Hanukkah periods ahead.So, what does it mean about how the U.S. will operate heading into theholidays?

WhileMayor de Blasio is threatening action against a pub owner who defied hisshut down order.BILL DE BLASIO (D), MAYOR OF NEW YORK: When the state of New York says yourbar needs to be closed, your bar needs to be closed.

Time is running out for President Trump.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you looking to change the outcome of the election ortried to make a case the American people that it wasn't fair?TRUMP: Well, I think the case has already been made. If you look at thepolls, it was a rigged election. You look at the different states, theelection was totally rigged.ROBERTS: While the president's legal team and recounts have identifiedirregularities in the voting, it's not approvable scale to erase JoeBiden's lead. So, as Democrats did to him in 2016 and beyond, PresidentTrump is trying to cast doubt on the legitimacy of a Biden presidency.TRUMP: It's a disgrace to our country. It's like a third world country,these ballots pouring in from everywhere using machinery that nobody knows.And now we find out what we can do about it. But you'll see a lot of bigthings happening over the next couple of days.ROBERTS: The Trump campaign is hoping the U.S. Supreme Court will take upthe Pennsylvania mail-in vote case. Senator Ted Cruz telling Fox News thecampaign has approached him about arguing it on their behalf.In a statement saying, the bitter division and acrimony we see across thenation needs resolution.

White House official told me that simply Pfizer"negotiating in public", Bret.BAIER: John Roberts live in the North Lawn. John, thank you.As John just noted, the Trump campaign is hoping the U.S. Supreme Courtwill take up that Pennsylvania case. U.S. Supreme Court Associate JusticeSamuel Alito ordering Pennsylvania officials to respond to an electionchallenge a day earlier than previously scheduled.Alito had previously ordered the state's lawyers to respond to the lawsuitby Wednesday. That is one day after the Safe Harbor date, which would meanCongress cannot challenge any electors already named in accordance withstate law.Alito now wants a response by 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. This is a challenge tiedto the change in the mail-in ballot process in the Commonwealth ofPennsylvania by the legislature back in 2019. Upheld then by the stateSupreme Court there, but without a change to the state constitution, whichsupporters insist is required under Pennsylvania law.President-elect Joe Biden is putting a key Obamacare defender in charge ofhis health department, but at least he's nominating him for that.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra would be the first Latino tohead the Department of Health and Human Services and its trillion-dollarbudget.But despite that, correspondent Peter Doocy tells us many of Biden's fellowDemocrats are not that happy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (Voice over): Biden alliesaren't fully satisfied with his cabinets, diversity.REP.

A Christmas miracle.Biden wants Dr. Vivek Murthy to be Surgeon General, again, an infectiousdiseases specialist from Mass General Dr. Rochelle Walensky to run the CDCand California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to run Health and HumanServices.Three years ago, Becerra was an advocate of Medicare for All.XAVIER BECERRA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA: Absolutely. When you givepeople access to Medicare and talk to seniors who have their Medicare whosay keep your hands off my Medicare, I think it would have the same effectfor most Americans if they knew they could depend on something likeMedicare for themselves as well.DOOCY: Republicans plan to oppose Becerra. Senator Tom Cotton tweets,Xavier Becerra spent his career attacking pro-life Americans and tried toforce crisis pregnancy centers to advertise abortions.The cycle, Biden's team changed the way presidential campaigns operate,relying heavily on drive-in rallies. And that's the idea for theinauguration, even though you can't park a car on the National Mall.BIDEN: I think you're going to see something that's closer to what theconvention was like than the typical inauguration.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): Biden just told us he is going to reveal his pick fordefense secretary on Friday but today, the buzz in town is all about beer.A local brewery is honoring the train loving president-elect with this RailCar One: Wilmington to Washington.

That is a reversal from Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio who orderedthe schools closed last month. Correspondent David Lee Miller has thelatest tonight from New York.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  It was back-to-school again thismorning for some New York City public school students.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm thinking it's exciting.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Because I get to see all my friends again.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It has been tough away from school.MILLER:  A little more than two weeks ago New York Mayor Bill de Blasioshut down all classroom instruction when the citywide COVID infection ratehit a three percent trigger. Critics say the decision was arbitrary.Following withering criticism, the mayor came up with that new back-to-school plan for kids up to fifth grade who are previously signed up forclassroom instruction.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Things are changing week to week.MILLER:  The new rules require weekly random COVID testing for 20 percentof all students and staff. Before students can attend class, they must havea signed parental consent form on file permitting school to test for thevirus. A recent study by Brown University professor Emily Oster showsschools are not a major source of COVID spread.EMILY OSTER, BROWN UNIVERSITY:  Rates for elementary and middle schoolstudents are much lower, typically about half of the community rate. Andthat is really likely to reflect, or seems to just reflect the fact thatkids are younger, kids are much less likely to get COVID than older people.MILLER:  Students must take safety precautions while in school buildings.The president the American Federation of Teachers says with the rightprotocols in place she is optimistic about classroom instruction.RANDI WEINGARTEN, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS:  We need the resourcesand we need the safeguards, but if one can do that, then we should be doingin-person learning.(END VIDEO TAPE)MILLER (on camera):  There is still no plan for New York City middle andhigh school students to get back to the classroom. At the earliest, thatwon't happen until after the first of next year. Bret?BAIER:  David Lee Miller in New York. David Lee, thanks.Public school teachers in San Diego are being offered training to overcomewhat is being called white privilege. Training documents reveal thatteachers must accept that their supposed unconscious bias is perpetuatingracial superstructures. And they must acknowledge they are living on landstolen from Native Americans. The teachers are told in these documents theyare racist and, quote, upholding racist ideas, structures, and policies.They're also told to commit to becoming, quote, "antiracist" in theclassroom.Up next, the panel on the coronavirus cases, lockdowns, and resistance. Andas we go to break, we mark the 79th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack.Japanese bombers struck the Hawaiian base 1941, plunging the U.S. intoWorld War II.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yet in spite of this blow of surprise devastation,American fighting planes took off, and they together with the fire ofantiaircraft guns shot down more than 40 Japanese planes. A brave recordconsidering these scenes.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES:  We are going to be in some significant, I would say, pain andsuffering in the next couple of months, because even though the light atthe end of the tunnel, namely a vaccine, is literally at the threshold,what we have now is a challenge ahead of us of the bleak months of Decemberand January.DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR:  Thevaccine is critical, but it's not going to save us from this current surge.Only we can save us from this current surge. And we know precisely what todo.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Medical officials looking at that surge, saying that we are in fora tough couple of months according to the trends. If you look athospitalizations just in recent days, yesterday, December 6th, 101,000,almost 102,000 across the country. Again, the death rate, the case fatalityratio, otherwise known as the crude mortality rate, 1.9 percent overall,but COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people, 86.29. Those are from Johns HopkinsUniversity.With all of that and all that we're facing as a country on this, let'sbring in our expanded panel, FOX News senior political analyst Brit Hume,Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at "The Wall StreetJournal," Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for NationalPublic Radio, and "Washington Post" columnist Marc Thiessen. Brit, yourthoughts on where we are and where we may be going here? BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Obviously these increases indeaths are profoundly disturbing. The question then becomes is, with thecases increasing, hospitalizations increasing, and deaths increasing,whether we do, as Dr. Birx said, know exactly what to do. I'm not at allsure we do. The problem with these numbers is that we don't know who'ssick. We don't know how old they were. We do know and have known from thebeginning that this is an ailment that affects the elderly wildlydisproportionately to the rest of the population.So it appears -- I'm sure that probably is true of these latest round offatalities -- it appears we're still not doing as good a job as we need todo to protect the elderly. What we're doing instead is a lot of lockdownsand closures and stay-at-home orders for the whole population, which has adramatic effect on children in schools, on businesses, on health careitself for ailments that are not being treated because hospitals arecrowded and people are postponing it or are afraid to go to the hospital.So I think we are -- this virus -- excuse me, this vaccine can't come soonenough, because to a great extent I still think we don't really know whatwe're doing.BAIER:  Yes, speaking of the business shutdowns, obviously Californiareally feeling it, Mara. Take a listen, this business owner and also theadmiral talking about outside dining. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANGELA MARSDEN, PINEAPPLE HILL SALOON AND GRILL OWNER:  They basically shutoutdoor dining down. And I came in to give last paychecks and bags ofgroceries to my employees, and saw a 200 person tent with tables set up ina catering truck for a movie company in the same parking lot within fivefeet away -- 20 steps away for me. I just was so angry.ADM. BRETT GIROIR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ASSISTANT SECRETARY:  Theevidence clearly does not support limitations on things like outdoordining, particularly that are spaced, outdoor bars. The evidence just isn'tthere.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Admiral Giroir there. Mara, your thoughts on the balancing actthese states are playing, some one way, some the other? MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO:  Andin some states they are going in two different directions at once. We alsohad that business owner on National Public Radio yesterday, and the problemis that the messages have been very inconsistent. Some restaurants have toshut down. Movie sets can still serve their workers outside. There are somany exceptions to the business closures, it's very confusing.The problem is that if we had been able to test in a very comprehensive wayearly on, we would have been able to know who should stay home and whoshouldn't. But now we're kind of using a blunt instrument to try to shutthe economy down, and we're not sure what works. So I think it's a realproblem. People are getting frustrated. Also, they can't figure out what isthe clear message, who should shut down and who shouldn't.BAIER:  Not only that, Congress, Kimberley, cannot figure out how to getthis package across the finish line. And it was really telling, and I wasoff Friday, but I noticed how Speaker Pelosi, and I listened intently fromafar, to this particular soundbite that didn't seem to get a lot ofcoverage. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA) HOUSE SPEAKER:  That is a total game changer. Anew president and a vaccine. So there's nothing to -- these are different -- what was then before was not more of this. This has simplicity. It's whatwe've had in our bills. It's for a shorter period of time, but that's OKnow because we have a new president.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  It seemed like she was saying the thing out loud that she wasn'tgoing to say, which is she's agreeing to a smaller package, much smallerthan Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was negotiating with her.KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes. I think this was why thereis some momentum and the possibility that this will happen, because let'sbe clear, for months, the fact that we didn't have a COVID relief bill isbecause Nancy Pelosi would not agree to say yes to anything. She was stilldemanding $3 trillion, $2 trillion, when it was incredibly clearRepublicans weren't going to go there.Now I think the big flash point, and watch for this in the next couple ofdays, if you have this bipartisan group that's working on a $900 billionbill. There seems to be some progress, some indications the White Housemight support that. The question is whether or not you can get Republicansin the Senate to agree to what has become a flash point, which is moremoney for state and local governments, which they view as basically a blankcheck for some bad policies out there. That's going to continue to be asticking point. We'll see, though. The fact that the Democrats climbed downon this some means that there's a better prospect for a bill then we haveseen for months.BAIER:  Marc, you have some strange bedfellows about pushing back aboutthis negotiated deal. Bernie Sanders and Josh Hawley on the same side,saying there need to be direct stimulus checks, and if not, they're notgoing to support it.MARC THIESSEN, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Here's the interestingthing, as was just mentioned, Nancy Pelosi was resisting us for a very longtime. In July, Senate Republicans offered $1.1 trillion in COVID reliefincluding $300 billion for stimulus checks for the American people. Moneyfor small business, $105 billion for state and local governments whichDemocrats said was a priority. Pelosi and Schumer said no. The White Houseraised that offer to $1.6 trillion. They said no. In October the WhiteHouse increased at $1.8 trillion. They said no.And the reason was they wanted to punish Donald Trump. They didn't want todo anything to stimulate the economy and give him a victory that he couldclaim going into the election. And Pelosi even said it. She said all DonaldTrump wants is his name on the check. People right now are going into theselockdowns again, and people don't care whose name is on the check. Theyjust need the money.And so now -- that was before it was to hurt Donald Trump. Now the bigsticking point is -- because the Republicans are negotiating on state andlocal aid. The Democrats don't want to give them liability reform,protection for all these businesses who spent the last year trying to dotheir best to follow the advice and regulations and keep their businessesgoing. The Democrats are saying we'll give you a six-month moratorium onlawsuits. That doesn't do anything. So before it was to hurt Donald Trump.Now it's to do the bidding of the trial lawyers.BAIER:  Brit, do you think that the losses in the House that the Democratssaw that were not predicted came from this lack of getting something acrossthe finish line? HUME:  I think it was part of it, Bret, but I also think the reason whythey weren't expected was the polling was so bad on that that people wereunder a wrong impression about is how likely Democrats were to pick upseats. I think there was a lot in that, Bret. Also, we had all of that waveof rioting and crime in the streets that Democrats were hesitant tocondemn. Donald Trump turned out a huge vote on his side. Some Republicansran ahead of him obviously, but I think there was a lot in it. But Icertainly think that was part of it.BAIER:  All right, panel, stand by. Up next, the Georgia Senate runoffswith the Senate control hanging in the balance.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Do you support expanding the Supreme Court? REV. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, (D) GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE:  I'm really not focusedon it. And I think that too often the politics in Washington has been aboutthe politicians. I'm a pastor.SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA) ATLANTA DREAM CO-OWNER:  Justice Ginsbergherself said nine justices is the right number. He would pack the courtwith radical justices that would legislate from the bench to fundamentallyoverride the Constitution and our laws in this country, and Georgians needto know that is wrong for Georgia and our country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Senator Kelly Loeffler and Reverend Raphael Warnock in the debatelast night. This is a set up to the January 5th runoffs in Georgia, andthat balance of power in the U.S. Senate will be determined by what happensin these two races January 5th.We're back with the panel. Mara, clearly we've seen down in Florida anddifferent states, that this pitch about socialism really did move votes,and whether Loeffler managed to hit that mark in the debate is really whatthe issue is.LIASSON:  Yes, and she did repeat it many times, I think something like 14,my radical liberal opponent Raphael Warnock. But it is a message thatworked, and this is a message that the Republicans in Georgia think isgoing to work again. Look, the polls in Georgia right now are within themargin of error for both the Senate runoffs. Every Democrat I've talked tothink the Democratic candidates are the underdogs. Usually Republicans winrunoff races. It's the Democrats that have a turnout falloff for runoffs.But there's been a lot of complicating factors, including President Trumptalking about how the election was rigged and stolen from him, and someprominent Republicans even on his legal team who have said Republicansshouldn't turn out because the governor there isn't doing enough to dealwith this, quote, rigged election.BAIER:  Yes, and Marc, the president going down to Georgia, rallying hissupporters there, spent half of the time talking about that Senate runoffcontest, but also half of the time challenging the election on hispresidential side. Here's the secretary of state of Georgia talking to NeilCavuto.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, (R) GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE:  I'm going to be votingfor my two Republican senators, and I hope every Republican gets out tovote for our Republican senators. And secretary of state, we're going torun --NEIL CAVUTO:  Even though those two Republican senators wanted you to stepdown, you're still going to vote for them? RAFFENSPERGER:  I'm a conservative Republican, and I believe in theRepublican ideals and what we stand for. Yes, I will be voting for my twosenators.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Marc, did the president do what he had to down in Georgia? THIESSEN:  Well, he certainly finally focused on the Georgia electionagain. I'm glad he went down there and I'm glad he said what he said forthe second half of the rally.The problem with the focus on the last election as opposed to the nextelection is that not only is it damping down the enthusiasm of his basegoing after Republicans in the state for not supporting him and feeling theelection was stolen, but it's also turning off a lot of independents andconservative Democrats in Georgia who are not very enthusiastic about theleftward turn of their party, don't necessarily want Democrats inWashington to have total control and a one-party state, but they are putoff by Trump's unfounded claim that the election was stolen.And so one of the things we learned from the election was that people likedivided government. They don't want to give Democrats complete control. Butthis whole message about the last election is drowning that message out.BAIER:  From the Trump perspective, they are still fighting, Kimberley,even though the recertification again in Georgia. One of the things thatpeople are watching is this supreme work case potentially, that Alito hasasked for responses to. And this is the Pennsylvania vote by the stateSupreme Court there about the process of mail-in ballots. And that haslegal -- at least some questions about it.STRASSEL:  Yes, and that's going to be a signal. Let's see where thePennsylvania court comes out on that because, look, this has been one ofthe central aspects of the Trump campaign's arguments in all of thesecourts, is that there was funny business with regard to mail-in ballots. Wehaven't really seen many courts respond to that positively so far. Butwe've always been waiting for it to get up to the Supreme Court or for itto go to higher levels. This is now the moment where we are there.BAIER:  Brit, last word.HUME:  Just this Georgia race confronts Republicans with the dilemma thatthe party is going to be facing for some time to come, and that is this --how to continue to attract the support that Donald Trump brought to theRepublican Party among minority voters, among blue-collar voters, while atthe same time finding a way to sand off the edges of their image and theirmessage so that the people who are turned off by Trump who might otherwisevote for Republicans will come back to the fold. That is the problem. It isnot an easy one. I would say it's a very knotty one. The Georgia race willtell us something about how the will they will able to do that goingforward.BAIER:  And we'll follow it every night. Panel, thank you very much.When we come back, momentous occasions.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, some major milestones.
