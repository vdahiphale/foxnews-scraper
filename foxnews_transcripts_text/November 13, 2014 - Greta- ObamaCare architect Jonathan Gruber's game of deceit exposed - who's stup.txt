Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Professor Jonathan Gruber, what a jerk! With his arrogant attitude, he calls you, the American voters, "stupid." It's so boorish.
But you know what's worse in and far more serious than his boorish insults? His abuse of power, by thwarting Democratic principles that are protected by transparency. Transparency is a big part of Democracy, and any intentional deception to get any law passed is abuse of power. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He was deeply involved in designing ObamaCare and no matter how much the Obama administration, Leader Nancy Pelosi now try to run away from Gruber, they are up to their eyeballs with them. Just listen to him openly brag about deceiving the American people: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
JONATHAN GRUBER, OBAMACARE ARCHITECT: Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage and basically you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, basically that was something really, really critical in getting the thing to pass.

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Gruber could have been transparent. He chose not to be, and now his ugly game has been exposed. So who is stupid now? And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
