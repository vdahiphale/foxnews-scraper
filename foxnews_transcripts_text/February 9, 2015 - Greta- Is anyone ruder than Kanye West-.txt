Let's all go "Off the Record." What is up with Kanye West? Could anyone be ruder? Remember when he did this to Taylor Swift at the MTV video music awards?

KANYE WEST: I'm really happy for you. I will let you finish. But Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time.

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

It was a big time in her career but he decided to be obnoxious and ruined it for her. He apologized and said he was sorry. But was he? No. How do we know? Because he just did it again at the Grammys this time to another artist getting an award back.
That was obnoxious and rude. Now, Kanye later tried to defend his indefensible behavior during an interview and that just made him look worse. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

WEST: I just know that the Grammy's, they want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us. And Beck needs to respect artistry and he should have given his award to Beyonce. And at this point, we are tired of it because what happens is when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in the face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you are disrespectful to inspiration. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });

What kind of jerk steals exciting moment from someone else? A big jerk. Kanye is obviously starving for attention. Yes, he is pathetic. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
