Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. Check this out: A sculpture by artist, Sean Skelly - do you like it? You just bought something like it. By you, I mean the State Department, with your tax dollars. The cost, about a million dollars.
So, why did you spend a million dollars on it? Well, to decorate the U.S. Embassy in London. The State Department wants to fancy up their London digs with your money. That's right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But there is more. Here is another State Department art buy. This $120,000 sculpture is headed to Pakistan to decorate our U.S. embassy there. Do you like it? You may not like this art, and you may think it's a waste of money. Do you know what is really rotten about this? It's when the State Department bought it, right at the end of September, knowing that our government was just days away from running out of cash to run itself. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Remember the government shutdown we had because we had that big money fight? And what did President Obama say during the shutdown? He said it was irresponsible, and he blamed it completely on the Republicans. He said they didn't care. Meanwhile - la-di-da - his administration's State Department is buying that fancy art with your money. That proves during these tough economic times what they care about is themselves. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I know what you are thinking; I'm thinking it, too. If the State Department has some extra cash lying around, how about spending on some necessities, like security at the embassies. Does the word Benghazi ring a bell? How about just not spending the money?
Our government needs money. We're in debt. And, of course, a million dollars would not run the government long, maybe 15 seconds or less, or yet it won't pay down our debt. But it's the big picture. It's their attitude. Is anybody even thinking? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
