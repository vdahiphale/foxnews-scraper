Author Mike Huckabee writes, A person who has no standard to live by other than the culture of the moment is a person whose principles might as well come from the latest public opinion polls. In a time where it seems anything goes, and truth is more fluid than ever, Rare, Medium or Done Well is for anyone wondering how to make a difference in today's culture.
