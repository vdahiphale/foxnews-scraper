BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (on camera): Hi, Jesse. (INAUDIBLE) Geraldosnowman.All right, as we wait new official guidance from the CDC, one major schooldistrict inches closer to a deal on reopening amid the coronaviruspandemic. We'll bring you there.Plus, he has long supported reopening schools. I'll speak live with Dr.Anthony Fauci about how he believes it can be done safely.And rules for thee but not for me, some lawmakers crying foul now at HouseSpeaker Nancy Pelosi amid tightened security on Capitol Hill.This is SPECIAL REPORT.Good evening. Welcome to Washington, I'm Bret Baier.Chicago schools could gradually start to reopen for in-person learning thisweek under what the Chicago mayor is calling a tentative agreement with theteachers' union there on COVID-19 safety protocols and more vaccinationsfor teachers.The deal if approved by members of the union, would avert a possible strikein the nation's third largest school district. Chicago is only one of manycommunities across the country fighting to get students back insideschools.I will speak in just a few minutes with the Director of National Instituteof Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, but we begin withSenior Correspondent Mike Tobin in Chicago. Good evening, Mike.MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Good evening, Bretfrom a snowy Chicago. After almost a year with students board with class ona computer, some of them not logging on. Grade slipping, depression on therise, there may be a pathway back to the classroom. But as we see acrossthe nation when dealing with labor and a pandemic, nothing is easy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN (voice over): At long last, Chicago's mayor announces a breakthroughthat could mean public school students start phasing back to in-personstudy this week.LORI LIGHTFOOT (D), MAYOR CHICAGO: I am confident that the measures that wehave and will put in place will make our schools even safer than theyalready are.TOBIN: But the Chicago teachers union was quick to tamp the optimism,tweeting there is no agreement yet between the union and the Board ofEducation. What we have is a framework.A vote by the rank and file to ratify that framework could come as early asTuesday. But the deal says no member of the CTU will be required to returnto the classroom without an opportunity to be vaccinated. It also createsthresholds to shut down in-person learning if the virus surges.In Philadelphia, 2,000 educators didn't show up for in-person instructionMonday at the urging of the president of the Teachers Federation.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because they refuse to risk their lives in order to sitin school buildings that are unsafe.TOBIN: San Francisco also announced a tentative deal that hit a snag whenthe city attorney said the agreement was progress but not enough. And hewill file a motion to an existing lawsuit compelling the school district tomeet state requirements for reopening.The director of the CDC who said a safe return to class does not require avaccine, says transmission happens outside of an environment where safetyprotocols are followed like schools.DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, DIRECTOR, CDC: The data from school suggests thatthere's very little transmission that is happening within the schools,especially when there's masking and distancing occurring.TOBIN: Across the nation, three of the largest 10 school districts arestill close. The three that are open are in Florida. The other largedistricts from New York to Houston are partially open.In New York, the mayor announced that middle schools will be reopening latethis month for about 62,000 students, their teachers prioritized forvaccinations.BILL DE BLASIO (D), MAYOR OF NEW YORK: We talked about the city coming backstrong, so much of it depends on our public schools and our public schoolshave done amazing work throughout this crisis.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN (on camera): The phased in return of Chicago students could startwith Pre-K and special education kids this week.Then in March, you'll see kindergarten all the way through eighth grade. Notimeline for a return of high school students, Bret.BAIER: Mike Tobin live in a snowy Chicago. Mike, thanks.To talk more about schools and vaccines, let's bring in the government'stop public health expert, the Director of the National Institute of Allergyand Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci. Dr. Fauci, thanks for beinghere.DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES (on camera): Good to be with you, Bret.BAIER: You just heard Mike's report, there's obviously a lot of concernfrom parents, from teachers, from communities about getting kids back toschool. Can these communities do it safely now, even though the teachersare not vaccinated?FAUCI: You know, I think as what you heard, Dr. Walensky say that this canbe done, provided that the capability of keeping the children and theteachers safe. Namely: wearing of masks, having the resources to be able toarrange the classes, so that you have appropriate spacing. Those kinds ofthings that are common public health issues can be done.But obviously, you have a lot of serious discussions going on between theteachers' union and the officials of the city in the states that you justmentioned. So, it's not an easy problem to solve.Obviously, we want to get teachers vaccinated, they are essential personnelas far as we're concerned, it would be important to get them vaccinated.But there are situations where you likely can still get children back toschool provided you do it in a safe environment, these are the masking andother public health measures.BAIER: And just to be clear, you're not speaking in a personal capacity,you're speaking as the job that you do, right?I mean, we had the White House come out and say that the CDC directorsaying almost exactly what you said, was speaking in a personal capacity,not an official guidance. But this is going to be the official guidance, isit not?FAUCI: Well, I -- you know, the official guidance, Bret, is coming outliterally imminently, very likely this before the end of this week. So, Ithink it would be important, rather than trying to get different opinionsof it, let's see what the guidance shows and then we could all discussabout the various aspects of the guidance. But it will be coming out, I'malmost certain before the end of the week.BAIER: Where are we on this virus right now? And we know what we know aboutgetting the effort to the vaccines, getting them out and about, butfighting the virus. What are the numbers you're seeing? What are youlooking at right now?FAUCI: Well, Bret, we've been through a very terrible period over the lastmonth as you know. We had situations where we were up to 300,000 400,000new cases per day, up to 4,000 deaths per day, hospitals almost beingoverrun.The good news now is that what we're seeing numerically is that there'sbeen a plateauing, and a coming down of numbers of cases, a rathersignificant diminution. We hope we continue to go in that direction, that'sthe good news.The somewhat challenging news is that we have variants, namely mutationsthat have occurred that were dominant in places like the U.K. that are nowhere in the United States. And from the data that we get from our Britishcolleagues, is that this virus tends to transmit more readily from personto person, which means that we're going to have to double down on a publichealth measures.The good news is that the vaccine that we have that we're distributing now,even though the supply has not yet completely met the demand, the vaccineis effective against that variant that is predominant in the U.K.So, we have a task ahead of us. We've got to do two things simultaneously.We've got to adhere to the public health measures, masking, physicaldistancing, avoiding congregate settings.At the same time, to the extent possible, we get as many people vaccinatedas quickly as we possibly can, that will help contain the outbreak and alsohelp to contain the spread of these variants which are of concerned here inthe United States and in other countries.BAIER: Dr. Fauci, I want to bring you back to February of last year, thisis the Whitehouse Task Force, you're talking there about the status of thisvirus at that point, take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)FAUCI: We can't rely on a vaccine over the next several months to a year.However, if this virus, which we have every reason to believe it is quiteconceivable that it will happen, we'll go beyond just a season and comeback and recycle next year. If that's the case, we hope to have a vaccine.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER: Well, I just want to get your thoughts about looking back at thatpiece of tape and what you were thinking then and what you're thinking now?FAUCI: Well, I mean, I think what happened was even the beyond expectationsin a positive way. When I was asked back then, because we had startedworking on the vaccine literally in January, I guess a month before thattape, Bret. And I was asked, when do I think we'd have a vaccine that mightbe available. And I said anywhere from 12 to 18 months.Fortunately for us, because of a variety of circumstances, we were able toshow that we have a vaccine that's both highly efficacious 94 to 95 percentwith a very good safety profile.So, I had said back in the tape that you just showed that we would reallyneed a vaccine if we were going to get a handle on this.And fortunately for us now, we do have a vaccine. The question is, we'vegot to get enough doses out to get as many people vaccinated as possible.BAIER: I just want to do a quick lightning round here. Do we know now ifyou have COVID -- have had COVID, how long your protection lasts? We knowthat you can get it again, but do we know -- do we have any studies aboutthe numbers now?FAUCI: No, we don't, Bret. It really varies from person to person. Itlikely will be at least six months or more, but we don't know the completedurability of that. We will know the durability of protection against withregard to the vaccine if we follow individuals long enough.But everyone is obviously asking that question, if I got infected inFebruary, how long am I going to be protected against reinfection againstthe same virus?In the end, the fact is, Bret, we don't have a definitive answer to thatquestion. Although, we can surmise that it is likely several months, atleast.BAIER: Last thing, I watched the Super Bowl last night. Kudos to the NFL,they got the season through and it was exciting to watch. But is theregoing to be a time when we're going to be no masks? When is that time, ifyou had to guess? Go in to a sports game, going to a theater, going to aconcert without a mask?FAUCI: You know, Bret, that will really be dependent upon how we get thelevel of virus in the community down.If we can get -- and I have used this as an estimate, it's not definitive,that if we can get 70-85 percent of the population vaccinated and get towhat we would hope would be to a degree of herd immunity, which really isan umbrella or a -- or a veil of protection against the community with alevel of virus is so low, it's not a threat at all.Then at that point, you could start thinking in terms of not having to havea uniform wearing a mask, but we're certainly not near there yet.When do I think that would occur? You know, it's very difficult to predict,Bret. But if everything falls into the right place, and we get this undercontrol, it is conceivable that you might be able to pull back a bit onsome of the public health measures as we get into the late fall of thisyear.But there's no guarantee of that, because if we don't get the overwhelmingmajority of the population vaccinated, there's still going to be aconsiderable amount of virus in the community. And as long as that's thecase, Bret, people are going to have to wear masks.BAIER: Yes. And you know, because of what we're doing with coronavirus, wehaven't heard a lot about the seasonal flu. We lose 30,000-60,000 peoplefrom the flu, is that going down dramatically?FAUCI: Extraordinarily dramatically, Bret. And in fact, that is a very goodtestimony to the efficacy of wearing masks, avoiding congregate settingsand keeping distance, because we did that during this late fall earlywinter and the level of Influenza in the community is remarkably low,regarding comparisons to other years.Our Australian colleagues had the same experience during their winter,which is essentially our summer. When I was talking to my colleagues inAustralia, they were saying Tony, we don't have hardly any flu this yearand we think it's due to the fact that people are wearing masks, keepingtheir distance and avoiding congregate settings, those to show you thatthose types of public health measures actually work.BAIER: Dr. Fauci, we appreciate your time. You're welcome back anytime.FAUCI: Thank you, Bret. Good to be with you.BAIER: President Biden continuing to push his nearly $2 trillion COVIDrelief plan without bipartisan support, but is not the only thing on hisagenda that's raising some eyebrows among Republicans especially.White House Correspondent Peter Doocy looks at the administration's otherplans while the president still has to answer questions about hispredecessor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): President Bidensays he's not following the ins and outs of the Trump impeachment trial.JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll let the Senate work thatout.DOOCY: Instead, his focus is COVID-19, touring in Arizona vaccination sitetoday virtually.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm on in.DOOCY: And supporting a Democratic relief proposal for federal payments upto $3,600 per child for qualifying families.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This proposal is emergency fundingas I understand it.DOOCY: What about raising the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour by 2025? TheCongressional Budget Office now projects that could cost 1.4 million jobsin 2025 alone, but the White House still wants it in the stimulus.PSAKI: There is a parliamentarian who will make decisions about what canend up in a final package.DOOCY: Even though Biden himself was skeptical about raising the wage likethat Friday.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But that may not be in your American Rescue Plan --BIDEN: No, I put it in, but I don't think it's going to survive.DOOCY: Immigration policy may soon change too, as DHS reportedly preparesto tell ICE agents not to prioritize deporting illegal immigrants convictedof simple assault or DUI.PSAKI: Nobody is saying that DUIs or assault are acceptable behavior. We'retalking about the prioritization of who is going to be deported from thecountry.DOOCY: It's been 19 days since 11,000 people planning on working on theKeystone XL pipeline found out the project was cancelled by Biden executiveorder.ADAM STOUT, LAID-OFF KEYSTONE PIPELINE WORKER: My wife and I, we have adaughter in college and how do we pay for that? How do we add toretirement, provide health care?DOOCY: Climate czar John Kerry promised union workers like Stout (PH) canhave green jobs instead.JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: They can be the peoplewho go to work to make the solar panels.DOOCY: But union boss, Richard Trumka, who still supports Biden's generalideas thinks he should have had those green jobs lined up already.RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OFINDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS: I wish he had pair that more carefully with thething that he did second by saying, here's where we're creating jobs.DOOCY: When do they get their green job?JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president and many Democratsand Republicans in Congress believe that investment and infrastructure --building infrastructure, that's in our national interest that boost U.S.economy, creates good-paying union jobs here in America and advances ourclimate and clean energy goals are something that we can certainly work ondoing together.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY (on camera): President Biden is addressing climate change with an allof government approach. Every Cabinet agency is supposed to be using theirauthority to improve the environment. But despite all the eyeballs on this,people losing jobs, the feds determine are not environmentally friendly.Still, have not been told when their promise, green jobs will be ready.Bret.BAIER: Good questioning at the briefing today.

With just more than a month until the deadline, thecampaign to recall California Governor Gavin Newsom has nearly reached thenumber of signatures required to qualify for a statewide ballot. Thecampaign says they have 1.4 million names with 1.5 million needed.That's is tonight's live look "OUTSIDE OF THE BELTWAY" from SPECIAL REPORT.We'll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER: Texas Republican Congressman Ron Wright has died at the age of 67.Wright had been battling cancer was admitted to the hospital two weeks agoafter contracting coronavirus.Wright was first elected in 2018 to represent the 6th congressionaldistrict in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.Alabama Senator Richard Shelby will not run for re-election in 2022. TheRepublican is the fourth most senior member in the Senate who was firstelected as a Democrat to the Senate in 1986.Shelby became a Republican following the 1994 election. Shelby'sannouncement follows decisions by three other Republican senators not torun again. As of now, Republicans will have to defend 20 Senate seats in2022 compared to the Democrat's 14.Just within the last hour, lawyers for former President Donald Trump weresaying the former president is pleased that there was bipartisan support onhow to structure the upcoming impeachment trial.His counsel believes the process will, "provide us with an opportunity toexplain to senators why it is absurd and unconstitutional to hold animpeachment trial against a private citizen."The House impeachment managers say the former president merits convictionand should be disqualified from holding any office in the future.Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel has an impeachment preview.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): All parties have agreed to a structure that willensure a fair and honest Senate impeachment trial of the former president.Each side will have ample time to make their arguments.MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The second impeachment trial is expected to begin with debate overwhether it's even constitutional, and then a simple majority vote.Then, 16 hours for House managers to make their case, 16 hours for thepresident's defense.SEN.

MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Tell them they are not welcome. I didn't say goand fight, I didn't say anybody was going to have any violence.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL (on camera): The wild card is witnesses. If the impeachmentmanagers want to call witnesses or subpoena documents and the Senatesupports it, that could stretch this trial out for a long time. Bret?BAIER: OK, Mike, thank you. Let's get some insight now into the impeachmenttrial this week. Senior political analyst Brit Hume joins us. Good evening,Brit.(CROSSTALK)BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST (on camera): Hi, Bret.BAIER: There's a sense on Capitol Hill that not only Republicans butDemocrats may want to move this thing quickly.HUME: Well, I don't think. It may be the case that Democrats are waking upto the possibility that this impeachment trial will not brew down to theirpolitical credit because much of the country will not really see the pointin trying to convict a man and remove him when he's already gone.Apart from that, the case that Trump incited the mob by what he said on theday of the riot seems a little weak in light of the fact that the presidentexplicitly encouraged these protesters to go to Capitol Hill and protest,as he put it peacefully and patriotically.I think the case would be better made if, as Trey Gowdy has suggested, ournew contributor, that if they made the case that his failure to act whenthe riot started might be grounds, or in my view, all the stuff he pumpedinto the -- into the brains of his supporters about the election beingstolen, which clearly animated a lot of them to come to Washington might bea better ground.But nonetheless, clearly, they want to get it over with and we probablywill only see a trial of a matter of a few days judging by the schedulethat Mike just articulated.BAIER: Right. This is just one count and it's the incite count. You know,Georgia officials have opened up an investigation into what he did on thephone call with the Georgia secretary of state down there, other avenues.But this is just that one count.HUME: Right.BAIER: As far as the political impact, if as expected, just looking at thenumbers he is acquitted, what do you think it means for the future of theTrump political force?HUME: Well, if history has any guide and we have recent history on this,Bret, I mean he was impeached once before, there was a trial. He wasacquitted. Nancy Pelosi, I can remember, obviously, thinking this was goingto be a stain that was going to last and affect the outcome of the upcomingelection.The thing dropped out of sight. It was never mentioned in the fall campaignby politicians in either party that I'm aware of. It was certainly not any-- mentioned by either presidential candidate, it just dropped like astone.So, I don't think there is any good reason to believe that this will leavea lasting mark, unless that, you know, he were -- if he were convicted, andthe -- and the vote succeeded to bar him thereafter from higher -- from,you know, federal office. That obviously would affect his political career.But if he's not convicted, I don't -- I think this thing just disappears ina matter of -- probably a matter of months.BAIER: I wanted to ask you this while I had you. Over the weekend, formerSecretary of State George Shultz died at the age of 100. I had theopportunity to interview him for my book about Reagan, Three Days inMoscow, and was fascinated to hear his stories.And I just wanted to get your thoughts on really someone who wasinstrumental in the Reagan years and really in foreign policy overall.HUME: Right. Bret, he was one of the most consequential Cabinet officersand public officials of our time. Up -- leading up and through the Reaganadministration and beyond. He was very smart, very self-confident, verypublic-spirited, a very decent honorable man, set a great example. And youknow, I think, you know, for years to come, historians will look at himwith and give him great credit for the service he performed. He was a fineman.BAIER: Brit, as always, thank you.HUME: Thank you, Bret.BAIER: Coming up, rule breaker. Why several Republicans are saying HouseSpeaker Pelosi is not following her own rules. Rules that have cost atleast two lawmakers 5,000 bucks apiece.Also ahead, why thousands of National Guard troops in our nation's capitaldid not get involved after protesters scuffle with police in Washington,D.C. here over the weekend.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Washington, D.C., police got in skirmishes with members of Antifaover the weekend as demonstrators threatened to burn down the city whilethe city has thousands of National Guard troops still in town following theinauguration. Correspondent David Spunt tells us why they did not getinvolved.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Scuffles on the streets ofWashington, D.C., Saturday night hours after a peaceful way to Our BlackHistory Month, took a turn. Those on the ground spotted what appears to bean Antifa antifascist flag, carried by a group dressed in black. The groupstopped in front of restaurants for a brief moment, yelling "No KKK, nofascist USA." Authorities say the group marched north from a populartourist area.The city has been on the edge for months after a summer of clashes betweenprotesters and the police. Following the January 6th riot on Capitol Hill,D.C. Muriel Bowser announced more than 20,000 National Guard troops wouldwatch over the nation's capital during the inauguration.MURIEL BOWSER, (D) MAYOR OF WASHINGTON, D.C.:  I'm sad about it. I'mcommitted to making sure that we get our city back.SPUNT:  There are still approximately 6,200 troops on the ground. But asource with the National Guard tells FOX News they were not involved inSaturday night's incident because it did not happen near the Capitol or onother federal property. Mayor Bowser silent on the unrest. FOX News reachedout for comment but has yet to receive one. D.C. Congressional DelegateEleanor Holmes Norton declined to comment.(END VIDEO TAPE)SPUNT (on camera):  A spokesperson for D.C. police tells FOX News therewere no injuries or arrests. Bret?BAIER:  David, thank you.Multiple Republicans are calling on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to be finedfor reportedly bypassing magnetometers installed at the Capitol followingthe January 6th riot. Just last week Republicans Louie Gohmert and AndrewClyde was fined $5,000 for doing the same thing. Speaker Pelosi is notcommenting on the incident. The acting House sergeant of arms says it hasnot received any official report from Capitol police about that incident.The Biden administration is reversing yet another move made during theTrump administration, this time removing terror designation for Iran backedHouthi rebels in Yemen. State Department correspondent Rich Edson has ourreport.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Iran-backed Houthi rebels launchedarmed drones into Saudi Arabia this weekend. The Saudi government says itsmilitary intercepted them in a failed attack targeting civilians only twodays after the State Department moved to strike the Houthis from aninternational terrorism list.NED PRICE, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  We can and will continue to keepup the pressure on the Houthi leadership, just as we take these steps thathave received bipartisan, strong bipartisan support to ensure that we arenot worsening the humanitarian suffering of the people of Yemen.EDSON:  Last month the outgoing administration labeled the Houthi a foreignterrorist organization, triggering automatic sanctions. Eight groups saythat designation hampered their work addressing what the U.N. calls theworst humanitarian crisis on the planet. Saudi Arabia has been fighting forseveral years in the Yemeni civil war to try to prevent an Iranian proxyfrom controlling an entire country on its southern border. Some Republicansoppose the State Department ending Houthi's three week say on the U.S. theterrorism list. Senator Tom Cotton calls it a foolish gesture of goodwill,adding, quote, "The Biden administration is repeating the deadly errors ofthe Obama administration by appeasing Iran and refusing to call terroristsby their name."The administration has frozen arms sales to Saudi Arabia and is reviewingweapons contracts for the United Arab Emirates.(END VIDEO TAPE)EDSON (on camera):  The administration has also announced it is suspendingU.S. support for Saudi Arabia's offensive operations in Yemen, thoughofficials say the U.S. will continue to assist in defending Saudi Arabiaand countering terrorist groups in Yemen. Bret?BAIER:  Rich Edson at the State Department. Rich, thank you.Up next, a look at the big field of mayoral candidates in the big apple.First, Beyond Our Borders tonight.

We'll be rightback.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Breaking tonight, the U.S. Supreme Court has granted temporaryrelief to another group of California houses of worship, churches,synagogues, mosques, allowing them to conduct indoor services with somelimits. Two pastors had sued over the state's restrictions on in-personchurch services. The high court's latest emergency order follows a similarone Friday when by six to three vote the justices said the state could notimpose sweeping bans on indoor worship but could cap it at 25 percent ofthe building's capacity. The court said the state of California couldcontinue its ban on singing and chanting indoors.Trying to run the city that never sleeps is not an easy job, but it is apost more than 40 people want. Correspondent Aishah Hasnie looks at thecrowded race to be the next mayor of New York City and what one of themcould inherit.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We will rise up again.AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  From a former police officer to aformer presidential candidate, even a reality TV star, 41 people andcounting are running for mayor of New York City, all with an eye on urbanflight and what's ailing the big apple.KATHRYN WYLDE, PARTNERSHIP FOR NEW YORK CITY:  The biggest issue the nextmayor is going to face is a lot of confidence in the trajectory of thecity.HASNIE:  Since COVID first hit New York City, 70,000 people have left,resulting in a $34 billion loss of income according to data analyticscompany Unacast. Experts like Kathryn Wylde with the Partnership for NewYork point to quality-of-life issues like coronavirus, high unemployment,rising gun violence, racial injustice, school closures, and a $4 billionbudget deficit. So why would so many people want this job?DOUG MUZZIO, BARUCH COLLEGE PROFESSOR:  I think it's the attraction of theoffice, just the power of the bloody pulpit.HASNIE:  To stand out from such a path, public affairs professor DougMuzzio says a candidate needs three things.MUZZIO:  Money, organization, and message.HASNIE:  Name recognition doesn't hurt either. Former 2020 Democratpresidential candidate Andrew Yang has that in spades.MUZZIO:  The only disadvantages is he has never run anything.HASNIE:  But most importantly, Muzzio says the candidate must have avisionary plan to fix the city's problems because if things don't getbetter, some experts worry residents who left may never come back.WYLDE:  The welcome mat is out in Florida, Texas, Tennessee, across thecountry. We can't, as our mayor has been want to do, say we don't need you.MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, (D) NEW YORK CITY:  I am not going to beg anybody tolive in the greatest city in the world.WYLDE:  That's going to hurt New York if we don't change our tune.(END VIDEO CLIP)HASNIE:  The good news is both experts believe the big apple will bounceback. How long that will take may depend on part on who's in charge. Theprimary, June 22nd. Bret?BAIER:  Aishah, thank you.Up next, the panel joins me to talk COVID relief, impeachment trial, andthe curious case of Keystone XL pipeline.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RICHARD TRUMKA, AFL-CIO PRESIDENT:  I wish he hadn't done that on the firstday, because the Laborers International was right. It did and will costjobs in the process. He has also promised to create jobs, good union jobs,and be the best present union that we've ever had, and I believe he will dothat as well.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president and many Democratsand Republicans in Congress believe that investment in infrastructure,building infrastructure, that's in our national interest. And the boost tothe U.S. economy creates good paying union jobs here in America andadvances our climate and clean energy is something we can certainly work ondoing together.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO, asked about the Keystone XL pipeline,wishing President Biden hadn't done that day one. More than 11,000 peoplehave lost their jobs, and maybe more, and their promised energy jobs, newclean energy jobs that aren't available yet.Let's bring in our panel, Harold Ford Jr., former Tennessee Congressman,CEO of Empowerment and Inclusion Capital, Mollie Hemingway, senior editorat "The Federalist," and former South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy,after a stint last week at prime time live. Trey, let me start with you.What about this energy back and forth, and the jobs that they say arecoming but people deal with the job loss right now?GOWDY:  Well, here is a crazy idea, Bret. Why don't you kill Keystonepipeline after you create the infrastructure jobs? That way 11,000 peoplearen't out of work. The moral for me is political bases are very needy. Hethought the highest priority, the reason he was elected president, was tokill a pipeline, not COVID, not political rhetoric, but to kill a pipeline.Political bases are very needy groups.BAIER:  Harold?HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE:  Well, I find myself -- thanks for having me on. I find myself agreeing with Trey there that Iwould have probably waited on the Keystone pipeline. It had already beenapproved. I will remind everyone, as I've said on this show before, therichest man in the world, he isn't digging or drilling for oil and gas.He's building electric cars. I think the new president is onto something intrying to figure out how we transform to a different and clean energyeconomy. In fact, President Trump's outgoing head of the World Bank, DavidMalpass, who came into the job believing that climate friendly policieswere the wrong path, is leaving that job having put the World Bank andurging America to get even more so on that path.I think what the president is trying to do, I probably he would havewaited. Again, as I said, I share Trey's thinking about this. I might havewaited on that. I would have moved a little different direction, but I likethe thrust of what he is doing, and I sincerely hope this $1.9 trillionrelief package is something that he doesn't relent on and he continues topush.BAIER:  Mollie, it was newsy that Trumka came out and said what he said,obviously an ally of President Biden.HEMINGWAY:  Yes. Let me first of all say that the pipeline should not havebeen killed. It was a wonderful thing that was helping provide energyindependence for the country, which isn't just good for domestic jobs. It'salso good for national security. And President Biden was pretty honestabout a lot of what he wanted to do with the economy. He was not honestabout what he was going to do in terms of getting rid of that pipeline anddestroying so many jobs without a plan in place in any way for what thosejobs could be.But it seems like if President Biden were trying to kill the economy hewould be doing exactly what he is doing, whether it's this pipeline thing,whether it's raising taxes, getting rid of the Trump tax cuts, whether it'sthe $15 minimum wage that he wants to put forth, which is totally somethingthat large corporations can handle but absolutely destroys smallbusinesses. And then more than anything, his refusal to take on theteachers union as they keep on holding children hostage and making surethat schools cannot be reopened. Not having the courage to take that onshows that the economic doldrums that could be in play might be here forsome time.BAIER:  Dr. Fauci is saying those guidelines, CDC guidelines, are coming upthis week imminently. We'll see where that goes beyond the personalcapacity of the CDC director on that issue of schools.The other thing that is raising eyebrows in D.C., Trey, is immigrationpolicy. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TOM COTTON, (R-AR):  Now the Biden administration is saying they arenot going to deport criminal illegal aliens for serious and violentfelonies like assault. Joe Biden and the Democrats are putting Americanworkers last and illegal aliens first.JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Nobody is saying that DUIs orassault are unacceptable behavior, and those arrested for such activityshould be tried and sentenced as appropriate by local law enforcement. Butwe are talking about the prioritization of who is going to be deported fromthe country.(END VIDEO CLIP)BAIER:  Yes, for border states, that is a big issue, Trey.GOWDY:  I think they are on the wrong side of it, Bret. Good luck sittingdown with the parents of a kid killed by a drunk driver and explaining howremoving drunk drivers was not a priority. And domestic violence, youreally want to explain to someone that if you commit an act of domesticviolence, you should remain on a path to citizenship? You should be a pathback to wherever you came from, but you should not remain in this country.I think he is making a big mistake letting people who break our laws againonce they've come here unlawfully continue to remain here.BAIER:  Quickly, Harold, is this giving an issue to Republicans gettingready for 2022?FORD:  It's early. It could. Again, I tend to agree. This may be a littlestrange, Trey and I agree twice here. I think this might not be -- as muchas I understand what the president maybe trying to do, with someconstituencies it's probably not the right thing. I think the larger efforthere has to be comprehensive immigration reform, and hopefully that iswhere he is headed.BAIER:  All right, panel, stand by. When we come back, tomorrow's headlinestonight, plus a quick tape rewind.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BAIER:  Finally tonight, a look at tomorrow's headlines tonight with thepanel. Mollie, you're up.HEMINGWAY:  My headline for tomorrow is that impeachment is dead onarrival. Whether you're looking at the constitutional questions or thequestions on the merits, it looks like impeachment trial is not going toend in a conviction for President Trump. And a reminder that the Senatemajority leader himself less than a year ago was on the steps of theSupreme Court violently threatening Justices Gorsuch up Kavanaugh to rule acertain way on a case they were hearing at the moment he gave the speech,and he was not even censored by his own body.BAIER:  Trey, you got a headline?GOWDY:  In a trial about hot rhetoric, false allegations, and overall badjudgment, House Democrats decide Eric Swalwell is the best person to makethe case on their behalf.(LAUGHTER)BAIER:  All right, Harold, your headline?FORD:  Mine's a little lighter. Brady worth $100 million for 2021-22 CBOestimates say.BAIER:  I was going to play the tape, but I'm not going to play the tape.Two of the three of the panelists shows Kansas City big win, but then oneanchor on the show said Tom Brady will win. I said by six. I was off by afew. He is the GOAT of the NFL, really any team sport. Thank you, panel.Thank you for inviting us into your home tonight.
