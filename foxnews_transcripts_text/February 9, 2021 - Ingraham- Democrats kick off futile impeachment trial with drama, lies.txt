LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm glad you press the Trump lawyer on thefirst lawyer who presented the case.HANNITY: Yes, little meandering, little free associative, let's just say -go ahead.INGRAHAM: It was terrible. I'm sorry but it was terrible.HANNITY: Extemporaneous.INGRAHAM: You're way too charitable. If you hire that guy in the case thatyou were paying the bills on you - it would have been like, I'm sure you'rea nice person but enough praise toward the Democrats.HANNITY: I was a little nervous in the beginning.INGRAHAM: Oh my God.HANNITY: I was like oh boy.INGRAHAM: How much time could he spend praising the Democrats. The wholething was like a walk down memory lane about how much he loves the Senateand I mean this is like story time at this - at the at the trial, it wasridiculous.All right sorry, I'm going to get into this but I'm pretty worked up aboutit given what's at stake for the - for the constitution, the country butI'm glad you pressed - the second lawyer Sean was much better so.HANNITY: All right Laura, have a great show.INGRAHAM: All right Sean, good to see you. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THEINGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. The left's vow to reprogram Trumpsupporters is getting serious. Now they want to purge law enforcement aswell and last week they tried pretending remember they cared about thepolice but we're going to tell you the truth later on the hour.Also tonight, an adviser to the WHO says the organization's dismissal ofthe COVID lab leak theory, they said this today. He's saying it's a lie andhe's brave enough to come on to tell us why but first the impeachmentcircus kicked off today with House Dems making this argument to justifyimpeaching a president no longer in office.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Their argument is that if you commit animpeachable offense in your last few weeks in office, you do it withconstitutional impunity. You get away with it. This would create a brandnew January exception.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: It looked like a DNA chart. Of course the media approached it allwith the usual uncritical lie.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOHN KING, CNN HOST: What a powerful presentation, quoting the framers andquoting the history of past impeachments saying, we have every right to behere.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This really was a master class.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Disqualification is powerful here to protect thecountry.WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: House impeachment managers made a very, verypowerful case.ARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: One of the most powerful and disturbing pieces ofan opening argument I've seen covering any trial.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Do they do they send around talking points to each other becausethey know nothing about the law themselves, OK. But for all thebootlicking, it made no difference at all and we have the evidence to proveit because they couldn't convince retiring GOP senators like Rob Portman orRichard Byrd a flip, they have nothing to lose and despite language to thecontrary over the past few weeks, no GOP leader from McConnell to JohnThune broke ranks either.Now to put it simply, 44 Republicans voted against allowing the impeachmenttrial to continue meaning Democrats still have 0 chance of convictingformer President Trump. They need 67 votes to do so. Now meanwhile Trump'slawyers argue that the impeachment trial shouldn't be happening.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID SCHOEN, TRUMP DEFENSE ATTORNEY: In this unprecedented snapimpeachment process, the House of Representatives denied every attribute afundamental constitutional due process that Americans correctly have cometo believe is part of what makes this country so great.How and why did that happen, it is a function of the insatiable lust forimpeachment in the House for the past four years.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Well in there a session with Trump obviously hasn't ended withTrump leaving office. They crave Trump at this point. They want to make anexample of him and what they really want to do and I've said this before,they want to demoralize you and scare you.But leave processing constitutionality aside for a moment, what is insidethe article that the Democrats have brought, well, remember what's inside,let's read it. "Incited by President Trump members of the crowd he hadaddressed, in an attempt to interfere with the constitutional duty tocertify the results of the 2020 presidential election unlawfully breachedand vandalized the Capitol."So again, they're saying President Trump incited those people who breachedthe doors. Now here's the key part of his January 6 speech that theimpeachment managers would rather you not see.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD J. TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I know thateveryone here will soon be marching over to the capitol building topeacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Marching over peacefully and patriotically. Patriot's don't breakdoors or put people's lives in danger. That's not what patriots do. Are theTrump words, the words of someone trying to foment an insurrection?Joining me now is Congressman Devin Nunes, ranking member of the HouseIntel committee. Congressman Jim Jordan, ranking member of House Judiciaryand former Clinton impeachment manager Bob Barr.Congressman Jordan, now the process arguments of course matter but I thinkthe weakness of the Democrats article of impeachment, their single articleof impeachment, I wish the President Trump's team had spent more time juston that. Your take?REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Well yes, but they got across the main messageLaura, which is this is about canceling the guy who got 74 millionAmericans to vote for him. They don't want him on the ballot in 2024 andthey're so focused, obsessed I think the word you used and that's the rightword. They're so obsessed with that, they're willing to ignore theconstitution, they're willing to ignore due process and they're willing toignore the facts which as you point out, the president said peacefully andpatriotically go down to the capitol and make your voices heard. I mean Ithink about this past year, Laura.The Democrats told us you couldn't go to church, you couldn't go to work,you couldn't go to a loved one's funeral, your kids couldn't go to schooland now they're trying to tell those same Americans you can't vote for theguy you want to vote for in 2024.That's how obsessed they are. I think the American people see through itall. I think they understand that this is ridiculous and as you said thepresident's going to prevail here which he should based on theconstitution, the lack of due process and based on the facts.INGRAHAM: Congressman Barr, I thought it was significant that CongressmanCicilline refused to concede that the Chief Justice not showing up topreside was in fact significant. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI), HOUSE IMPEACHMENT MANAGER: Let me state thisvery plainly. It does not matter. It is not significant. When the currentpresident is on trial, if he - the chief justice doesn't preside, the vicepresident can preside and it would be a conflict for someone to presideover trial that would become president if there was a conviction.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: OK. Ken Starr vehemently disagreed with that last night on theshow and said it is entirely significant that the Chief Justice declined tobe part of this. Your take.BOB BARR, FMR CLINTON IMPEACHMENT MANAGER: Well first of all, ChiefJustices don't like to sit in impeachment trials. That was obvious ageneration ago when Justice Rehnquist had to be sort of dragged kicking andscreaming to preside over the Clinton impeachment and with the lastimpeachment of President Trump also, it puts the Chief Justice in anuncomfortable position but the fact that this Chief Justice properly readsthe constitution that they cannot impeach by prior, they cannot convict aformer president is very significant.Otherwise since President Trump as president was impeached, now they'regoing to triumph if in fact there was a constitutional basis for thattrial, the Chief Justice would be sitting in that chair. The fact that heis not is very significant.INGRAHAM: Now Congressman Nunes, House impeachment managers played video ofthe violence on January 6. They produced quite a - quite a presentation andit included a very disturbing moment. I have to warn our viewers. It'sgraphic. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Congressmen, that's the moment Ashley Babbitt was shot dead. Westill don't have a report on what exactly happened, who shot her, what wasthe actual finding in the report. Was it capitol police? Was it secretservice? You can't really tell what is going on here. Why don't we knowthis?REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Well, I would start with what you're talking aboutLaura is actual evidence so if you go back four years are actually fiveyears now, open an investigation into Trump. No evidence but theyinvestigated the Trump campaign for supposedly colluding with the Russians.I feel like we're kind of groundhog day from a year ago, I think Jim and Iwere probably on your show during the last impeachment that they had a yearago and but when the evidence was actually presented, the evidence was thatthe Democrats were actually coordinating with someone who really wasn't awhistleblower and the I.G. testimony still is sitting behind locked doors.Nobody's ever seen that likely because the Inspector General who wasinvolved in this was actually also meeting with the Democrats and theirstaff so fast forward and look at what's happened here. OK, there was aviolent Bob a riot. We want everybody prosecuted and when during everyprosecution, you will have to present evidence.But what they're trying to conflate is that Donald Trump participated in arally and told everybody to come to Washington and have a rally. That isperfectly legal. It's one of our basic rights as Americans and when youlook, the rioting, the mobs and the fires and the looting that were goingon all over this country, that's what I hope that we will raise that, thatthe Trump lawyers will raise this and Republicans will raise this.Democrats were saying this, there were Democrats who have in previous pastnot voted to certify electors.INGRAHAM: Yes a lot of unanswered questions. Yes, 100 percent. Theunanswered questions that Byron York wrote about days ago still haven'tgotten answers so if a president's going to be impeached for something, webetter have a full report. That's my point in raising Ashley Babbitt issue.It's just one question. Both of by the way, the BLM riots over the summerCongressman Barr and the January 6 riot at the capitol were obviously,they're all terrible but let's talk about the damages that were causedbecause we need to put all of this in perspective, given the Democratrhetoric that was inciting people all last summer.Now the BLM riots did upwards of $2 billion in damage, injured over to 2000police officers, resulted in at least 30 deaths. The capitol riot injuredabout 50 officers and 5 deaths. Congressman Barr, deaths are deaths butwhen you when you repeatedly say that America is a systemically racistcountry and tell - get people out of restaurants and threaten people justbecause they supported Trump, threaten them when they're out with theirfamilies.I mean there's never a charge of incitement going the other way, ever.BARR: No, it's a one way street like so many things are to the Democrats intoday's world Laura. It's a one way street. The fact that there were riotsthis past summer, spring and summer and really into the fall, is irrelevantfor their purposes because of course it doesn't fit their narrative.The riots swept across this country caused hundreds of millions of dollarsin damage, damage that cannot be replaced, small businesses shut down,lives lost, families torn apart and yet the Left still to this day willhave America believe that those rights were or those demonstrations weremostly peaceful. It's laughable.INGRAHAM: Well Cicilline, Congressman Cicilline, Congressman Jordan,basically just blew off any concern about violence over the summer. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CICILLINE: To counter the undisputed evidence of what actually happened inthis case, you'll see video clips. They'll show video clips of otherpoliticians including Democratic politicians using what they considerincendiary language.Apparently, they think this will establish some sort of equivalence. That'sa gimmick. It's a parlor game meant to inflame partisan hostility and playon our divisions.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Oh yes, so the Republicans are the ones trying to fomentdivision, Congressman Jordan so certain violence is apparently dismissed,other violence has to be taken seriously enough to impeach a man no longerin office.JORDAN: Yes, you're right. Both on the 6th and what happened last summer,both tragic and both wrong. What happened last summer though while it wasgoing on, we had Democrat members of Congress say while the violence istaking place in the streets, we had Democrat members of Congress say weneed more unrest in the streets at the very time there is unrest in thestreets.Now compare that to what happened in this situation where the presidentsays peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard, where the - wherethe attack was planned before the president even gave his speech. The FBIknew about it. There was a pipe bomb filed the day before.The Sergeant of Arms told a Capitol Hill police when they asked foradditional help, asked for the National Guard, he told him no. So those arethe fundamental fact that show how this is so much different than whathappened last summer where you had people encouraging the very thing thatwas going on at the time, it was going on.That's the problem and Americans I think again see through all this.INGRAHAM: And Congressman Nunes, it really is the case, is it not? ThatDemocrats for all their boasting and all their you know, they think theyhave the wind at their back now because they have control of both Houses ofCongress and the presidency, they don't seem very secure about just makingtheir policies, put them front and center and bringing them to the Americanpeople.They are absolutely obsessed with stopping another Trump run for thepresidency.NUNES: Yes, it's very odd because that's exactly what it looks like. Theyjust don't want President Trump to run again but what you're also nothearing and Jim mentioned a little bit about this, the intelligence wasgood in the days leading up to that.So FBI and other law enforcement knew there was going to be a problem. Ihad been briefed on it that morning by Capitol Hill police officers whowere wondered what intelligence that I had and if I had seen anything sothey knew of the groups. They knew the groups are going to be there.What they're trying to do, the reason they're so worried about this isbecause for some reason there was the smallest fencing I've ever seenaround the capitol as getting as we get closer to inauguration of the newpresident.You had the request for additional security that was denied. Ultimately theSpeaker of the House is responsible for that. Nobody's asking thosequestions is what did the speaker know and when did she know?INGRAHAM: Well, we got to keep pursuing that. That is extremely interestingand a phenomenal conversation tonight. Gentlemen, thank you so much forbeing here tonight. And we're going to move on because there's somethingvery perverse going on in our country.We have woke agitators looking to shame and cancel, de-platform you, makesure that you never work again. My ANGLE on the rise of the sanctimonioussnitches is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM: And now Biden's snitch patrol. That's the focus of tonight'sANGLE. Now you probably encountered the busybody phenomenon, right, duringthis never ending COVID-era. You know the neighbor who barks at you forgoing maskless while you're out walking your dog in a freezing day, anempty road.You know, the social media friends who comment on your Instagram post. Hey,nice dinner party but looks like more than 10 people at your house. Well,the Super Bowl parties in Tampa Bay. They had COVID-scolds in a froth.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Large crowds of mostly maskless fans celebrating theSuperbowl win.DON LEMON, CNN HOST: Man, if you could just animate the COVID being spread.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought you know Florida's going to kill all of us.I really felt that way.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I spoke to the Tampa Bay police and I asked them whatare you doing about this?(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: I think they just hate Florida now. Of course liberal politiciansin the medical cartel have been encouraging us to tell on one another sincethe shutdowns began.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know the old expression about snitches. Well, inthis case snitches get rewards. We want to thank you for turning folks inand making sure we are all safe.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you see a crowd, when you see a line that's notdistance, when you see a supermarket that's too crowded, anything, you canreport it right away so we can get help there to fix the problem.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: What a horrible mayor. Well, it was last April when theAssociated Press seemed thrilled to report that snitches are emerging asenthusiastic allies as cities, states and country work to enforcedirectives meant to limit person to person contact. They're phoning policeand municipal hotlines complaining to elected officials and shamingperceive scofflaws on social media.Wow, the CCP must be very, very proud and our very own social creditsystem. We've done it to ourselves, courtesy of unhinged progressives whoare happiest when they're ordering someone else around. Now this is funnyin one way but it's pernicious stuff and it's infected every level of oursociety.Last fall students were encouraged to rat out their friends who had thenerve to attend parties on campus, that a way to build class spirit. Now myguess is that about, I don't know 90 percent of the sanctimonious snitchesare just frustrated bitter lefties with too much time on their hands.Case in point. Taylor Lorenz, a reporter who covers the challenging Tik Tokbeat for The New York Times. We learned that she recently strayed fromcovering stupid pet and dance videos to snitching on a Silicon Valley groupchat.She tried to embarrass Marc Andreessen, the wildly successful investor byfalsely accusing him of using the word retarded during a private discussionon the platform Clubhouse. Well, when retraction - retraction was demandedbecause it was false, she diluted it by saying well, people just needed tobe more careful about context and when they use certain words.According to The Federalist for months Lorenz had obsessed over Andreessenin conversations on Clubhouse. Last fall Lorenz alleged that several men onthe platform were perpetrating malicious sexual behavior on the app,tweeting that it was rife with sexism and misogyny.But people like Ms. Lorenz, they're kind of everywhere and with Biden inoffice, the snitches are even more emboldened. You don't even want - theydon't even want you to freely communicate in private now. Earlier thismonth, a New York Times tech writer said "I'm worried about Telegram. Otherthan private messaging people love to use Telegram for group chats. Up to200,000 people can meet inside a Telegram chat room. That seemsproblematic."You know what else seems problematic that these seething snitches have morein common with the old fashioned Soviet faux police than they have with thefree speech liberals of the 1970s. That's what's problematic. And one ofthe most disturbing aspects of the rise of the Snitch and Ditch culture ishow the Left is using it all to divide families.Now we've seen how children who rat out their conservative parents areinstantly just crazed by corporate media and their praise by corporatemedia and even some of them become social media darlings. This woke 18-yearold spotted her own mother in a viral video taken outside the January 6riot.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: The mom was the one punched in the face. Her daughter then calledher out in a tweet. And then the daughter did an interview with TMZ.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HELENA DUKE: I would have had no idea she was there at that video forgetting punched in the face. It wasn't viral on Twitter.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Down the road, I could see government officials moving toliberate children from their conservative parents on the pre-tax ofpreventing kids from getting radicalized.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DUKE: I present her with like educated points and facts that I have likestudied or researched because I want to be as like unbiased as possible andshe would just be like nope, that's not right.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: She was like nope, that's not right. Like totally. Apparentlyfamily snitchdom pays. She's raised $74,000 for college on a GoFundMe pagesince tweeting about mommy. I guess it beats baby sitting or waiting tablesto pay for tuition.Liberal busy bodies claim that they're just trying to save lives with theirsnitching but we know that's not true. They're silent when blue statemayors and governors are caught violating their own COVID dictates and theymade excuses when entire city blocks were in flames last summer because ofthe BLM riots.The complete frauds. This is not about standing on principle. Snitches wantriches and of course, they want power. Their political overlords in theBiden administration themselves are masters of snitching.That's entire job description - that's an entire job description forAnthony Fauci shaming America for wanting to go back to normal. But it'stime to shame them right back, for turning Americans against Americans andthat's THE ANGLE.All right, joining me now is Dave Rubin, host of 'The Rubin Report' andauthor of 'Don't burn this book.' Dave, this isn't just one issue of COVID,you know the people who are, you're outside on a trail and they literallyjumped to the other side of the trail if you don't have a mask on in themiddle of summer.It's pervasive on a whole host of issues and it's having a very corrosiveeffect on personal relationships and even family.DAVE RUBIN, HOST, THE RUBIN REPORT: Yes, Laura, you gave me so much to workwith there in that - in that beautiful intro. I mean I'm hearing crazy LAwhere I kid you not, if I'm walking my dog, people walking their dogs theother way on the other side of the street will pull them in differentdirections.The dogs are going to start having nervous breakdowns and I'm onlypartially kidding about that. I mean we're going to actually start givingdogs the same anxiety that so many people are walking around with. But realquick on the New York Times and this Taylor Lorenz story and Clubhouse andeverything else, this is exactly what wokism will bring to every industry.Wokism and social justice and the ideas of equity as opposed to equalitywill destroy every single institution, whether it's an educationalinstitution, a journalist institution, a governmental institution whereverit goes he will destroy things but there's something a little morenefarious going on here with the New York Times, which is the reason thatthey write all of these anti-tech stories is because they don't likecompetition.People are starting to realize that you don't need the paper formerly knownas The New York Times to get information anymore. It's pure left wingpropaganda. We all know it. The New York Times wrote a piece actually, thejournalist too you mentioned who wrote that piece about Telegram, thatTelegram is scary now.That's where the bad guys are coordinating. He once wrote a piece thatincluded me about a bunch of YouTubers that were leading people to the allright. It was a Sunday front page piece. It also included libertarianeconomist who I think won a Nobel Prize Friedman.So that is what we're up against. They don't want competition on top of thegenerally bad ideas that they have.INGRAHAM: I think they don't want freedom. They - I mean these are the samepeople who are praising China's response to the virus. Where you have a fewpeople making all the decisions for everybody else because everybody elseis dumb and uneducated.Even that 18-year-old girl who ratted out her mother, I tried to give mymom facts, like, like, like -- I tried to give her facts. But they are theones who are terribly uneducated, Dave, about history and what this type ofthought police, these thought police patrols, what it will ultimately dowhen it backfires on them.DAVE RUBIN, HOST, "THE RUBIN REPORT":  Of course, when you see EricGarcetti say snitches get rewards, it's not much of a jump for then kids toturn in their parents, right? So this will affect, as you said, it willaffect families, it will affect local communities, it will affect basicallyeverything.And it does have something to do with belief, I think, that the generalbelief systems that these people have if they can control the world. Theycan create a system that all the generations before them could nevercreate. All the people before them that were backwards, racist, bigot,homophones, they did all of this terrible, terrible stuff, and only theseeducated, follow the science, elite "New York Times" people and their wokepartners, who are antiracist -- although they are actually, that's theirony -- only they if we gave them enough power could they perfect asociety.But of course, you know this, Laura, any time you try to get to utopia, youend up in dystopia. And in many ways that's what we're in right now. We'rein a modern dystopia. We just don't quite see it.INGRAHAM:  And just going back to the obsession with President Trump, Dave,President Trump really has revealed these folks for who they really are.They don't want -- they don't really want the people to have any say or tobe able to meet in private or to go to church when they want. Familiesgetting together, there is too much tradition in families.They don't like any of that. The find it all a threat. And it took Trump,four years of Donald Trump, to really explode this out into the public,because a lot of us knew this was happening, but now we really see them forwho they are and what they really represent.RUBIN:  Absolutely. I had well-respected, liberal public friends that wereapplauding Jack Dorsey on Twitter when he banned Trump. Since when are goodliberals for censorship? But he broke a lot of these people, he really did.But even when you see what is going on with impeachment right now, nobodycares except the media elite and the woke-sters.Nobody cares. I'm fairly certain we have got some bigger problems in thecountry, like all the unemployed people and the lockdowns, and the litanyof other issues that maybe government should have something to do with. Butinstead, what are they doing? We are impeaching a guy who is out who can'teven get on Spotify because they booted him from that.INGRAHAM:  Dave, great to see you tonight, thanks so much.And the WHO has just dismissed the COVID lab leak theory. So it's all over,no questions asked. Not so fast. A current advisor to the WHO, he is braveto come on. He's going to tell us why, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:  We've told you about the seedy ties between Biden's cabinet andChina. But it's Joe's pick to head the CIA who has perhaps the mostextensive CCP links to date. Since 2015, William Burns has served aspresident of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and accordingto the Daily Caller News Foundation, the endowment took millions from pro-China interests under his leadership. That includes $1.5 million from aChinese businessman who is a member of the two organizations directly tiedto the Communist Party, and as much as $250,000 from the China-U.S.Exchange Foundation. Now, that's a think tank to help advance the CCP'sgeopolitical ambitions.Burns also invited a number of congressional staffers on a junket to Chinain 2019 where they met with a slew of Chinese bigwigs. One congressionalstaffer who attended said they were surprised Burns was able to have thatmuch access to Chinese officials.Now, should Americans feel confident that this man is poised to leadAmerica's premier spy agency? Sadly, that is not all, though. Beforeleaving office, former President Trump proposed a requirement that U.S.schools disclose their relationships with the Confucius Institutes.Basically, those are fronts for CCP propaganda. Well, late tonight welearned the Biden administration quietly axed the Trump plan, allowing theinfluence operation to continue working in the shadows.While Biden lets China's propaganda infect our schools, the World HealthOrganization is becoming a global super-spreader of Chinese disinformation.The head of the team that the WHO sent to investigate the origin of COVIDmore than a year later made this absurd statement today.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We also looked, for example, at the Wuhan Institute ofVirology. It was very unlikely that anything could escape from such aplace. And we also know that when lab accidents happen, they are, ofcourse, extremely rare.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM:  Now, let's get this straight, the WHO wants you to believe thatCOVID-19 just happened to start spreading at a wet market that is veryclose to not one but two high-security China virology labs, one of whichwas doing highly controversial gain of function research on coronaviruses.Joining me now is Jamie Metzl, WHO adviser and Atlantic Council seniorfellow. Jamie, what did the WHO fail to do in it's Wuhan investigation?JAMIE METZL, W.H.O. ADVISER:  Well, the investigation itself was veryshort. It was two weeks of quarantine and two weeks of meetings, but theactual investigation was done by Chinese authorities. And so the WHOinvestigators were basically receiving a report from the Chinese officials.And as I see it, the big failure is that they outlined four possible waysthat COVID could have begun. One was direct bat to human, second, batthrough an animal intermediate host, third through shipping or some kind offrozen food from somewhere else, and four, the accidental lab leak.As you know, Laura, for more than a year I've been one of the leadingadvocates saying we have to look very, very seriously at option four. Butrather than saying, let's look more deeply at all of those possibilities,the WHO investigators say we should look at the first three, but not at theaccidental lab leak. And I'm just miffed that this happened. I think it isreally terrible. We don't know, most of us don't know exactly how COVIDbegan, but certainly an accidental lab leak is a very, very crediblepossibility.INGRAHAM:  What really needs to be done, then, in order determine how thevirus started, how it originated?METZL:  In the best of all possible worlds, we would have an internationalteam that would be able to go to China and have the ability to do anunrestricted forensic investigation of the Wuhan Institute of Virology andother sites. This is in many ways a potential crime scene. But we're notgoing to get that kind of information from the Chinese. So what we reallyneed to do is to build an international consortium of private scientistsand professors and willing government and others to say we need to get tothe bottom of how COVID began. We need to be fearless. We need to ask toughquestions.Yes, most of the evidence is in China, but there's lots of evidence that iselsewhere. I'm actually part of a community of scholars who are connectingdigitally around the world, trying to ask the tough questions, trying toget to the bottom of this. But it is going to be really difficult. And Ithink today was an unfortunate step backward.INGRAHAM:  The problem is also, is it not, China's outsized influence andmoney that it donates quite generously to all sorts of academic andresearch institutions that, frankly, depend on that money. China has anenormous reach across the globe, and there are a lot of people, I'm sorry,they don't want to get crossways with China now, not if China is runningthe field.METZL:  Yes, unfortunately it's true. So let's take it in two parts. Firstis with the WHO. As you and I discussed the last time I was on the show,Laura, the challenge for the WHO is it's an organization created, funded,and controlled by states. And so by definition, the WHO needs to balancebig power politics. And so the WHO is in a really tough position.But then there are these broader Chinese influence operations all aroundthe world. You look at a place like Australia where they are reallysuffering from all kinds of intervention, including the most aggressiveintervention in Australia's political system. It's not just there. It's allaround the world.And that is one of the big challenges that we face, because for those of usin the democratic world, we have certain norms, ways that we think aboutinteracting with civil society groups, with business investment. And Chinais in many ways playing by a different set of norms. And if we don'trecognize that and respond aggressively and creatively and wisely, we aregoing to lose so much of what we've spent many decades building.INGRAHAM:  We learned today that Beijing is saying any country that decidesto boycott the Beijing Olympics is going to be subject to all sorts ofsanctions and a really aggressive -- so China responds very aggressivelywhen anyone questions them. But Jamie, your insight and your willingness todiscuss this, especially given what is at stake, is really admirable. Thankyou so much for coming on.METZL:  My pleasure, Laura.INGRAHAM:  The left's plan to deprogram those they consider extremists, nowit includes sheriffs who keep us safe. One of them reacts, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:  The left began its mission to purge conservatives fromgovernment by targeting the military, remember, looking for all thoseextremists. But they are not done yet. "Axios" reporting that "A key partof breaking extremists' rising mainstream influence will be making itunacceptable for white nationalists, antigovernment extremists, andconspiracy theorists to serve in the military, in police forces, or aslawmakers. Former FBI counterterrorism analyst Clint Watts says "It's a lotof sheriffs' departments that make me nervous because they're elected.Politics means you go with party."Here to respond is Sheriff Richard Giardino of Fulton County, New York.Sheriff Giardino, this isn't just insulting to law enforcement, in my mind,it's incredibly dangerous.SHERIFF RICHARD GIARDINO, FULTON COUNTY, NEW YORK:  It's very dangerous.But see, they are very clever. What they are doing, Laura, is what startedin the summer when the narrative outpaces the facts. And what they aredoing is saying what makes him nervous is elected sheriffs. Electedsheriffs serve the Constitution, and they serve the public and theircommunities. And what they are seeking to do is eliminate elected sheriff'sso they can take control over law enforcement.We saw it this summer when we had over 35 chiefs, superintendents, andcommissioners, mostly men and women of color, removed as chiefs, sheriffs,and superintendents because they did not adopt the narrative that they weresupposed to. And so you see this now, they are trying to undercut theConstitution. They are trying to take away power from the sheriffs. If youremember, the sheriffs were some of the few people that stood up to some ofthese unconstitutional orders at Thanksgiving, that we're going to counthow many are at home. It's insulting. I don't want members who are QAnonsupporters. I don't want white supremacists.INGRAHAM:  Obviously.GIARDINO:  They are trying to paint all of us with the same brush. Goahead.INGRAHAM:  I just have to ask you. I am worried about this being set as thenarrative as you get closer to the warmer weather, because people thoughtBiden is in office, there's going to be no more BLM riots. There is goingto be something that happens, and then you add this to the mix, fomentingthis understanding that law enforcement is rife with white supremacists? Ifind that puts a target on your back. Forget getting rid of the electedsheriff. It's put a target on the backs of law enforcement.GIARDINO:  It continues the narrative from the summer that all policeofficers are racist. All police officers get up in the morning with theintent to go shoot men of color. And what is really disturbing about thatis the narrative outpaces the facts. For instance, nobody knows that 60children 12 and under of color were killed last year in drive-by shootingsbecause they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hardly anyone knowsthe names of those kids. There's no condemnation. There's no protests.Then other thing is law enforcement during the summer and into the fall, wewere ambushed in cars in Los Angeles. We were thrown -- bottle rockets werehost at us, rocks, bottles. They condemn us. They say we are there tomurder people. They set this narrative, and then they call -- we're theonly profession when all that is done on a Friday night, you call 911 onSaturday and beg for help. And we don't care what color you are. We don'tcare what your religion is or your politics. We go.It is very scary, because it continues to undermine law enforcement andauthority. And the statistics and the facts really outweigh that lawenforcement is the enemy of young black and brown people. And that isshowing in New York City last year where last year 1,500 shootings andalmost 500 homicides, 90 percent of victims were black and brown, and over90 percent of the suspects were black and brown. It's not the police.INGRAHAM:  It's heartbreaking. Sheriff, we really appreciate your joiningus. We are out of time, but we are following this story, don't you worry.We are staying on it.And a virtual court hearing takes a pretty funny turn, I think so. Icouldn't stop laughing. The Last Bite explains.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)INGRAHAM:  A west Texas judge got a big surprise today when one of thelawyers in a virtual hearing appeared on the screen like this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I believe you have a filter turned on in the videosettings. You might want to -- I think it's a filter.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is. I don't know how to remove it. I've got myassistant here. She is trying to. But I'm prepared to go forward with it.I'm here live. It's not -- I'm not a cat.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I can -- I can see that.(END VIDEO CLIP)INGRAHAM: Thanks for clarifying. What an interview late tonight, thatlawyer Rod Ponton. If I can make the country chuckle for a moment in thesedifficult times, I'm happy to let them do that at my expense. I -- how old?What a good sport and I can't take those filters off either when my kidsput them on.That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and the "FOX NEWS @NIGHT" take it from here. Shannon, I think I've watched it 10 times.ENDContent and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALLRIGHTS RESERVED.
