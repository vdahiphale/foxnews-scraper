Pop star Ariana Grande and actor Tom Selleck make headlines for all the wrong reasons 
Some fresh pickings from the Political Grapevine: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb2', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban1', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban1', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Loose Lips
We start with celebrities behaving badly. Pop Star Ariana Grande could be in for more than just a tongue-lashing from police after video surfaced that appears to show her licking doughnuts at a shop in California. Local police said they are investigating along with county public health officials. The 22-year-old singer and a friend appear to "maliciously lick" the doughnuts that a clerk says they did not pay for. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
On Wednesday, Grande apologized for saying "I hate Americans. I hate America" in the same video. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The Waterboy 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Actor Tom Selleck is making headlines for all the wrong reasons. The man who played America's favorite private investigator in the '80s is accused of stealing truck-loads of water from a public hydrant and delivering the precious resource to his 60-acre ranch where he is said to grow avocados. California has imposed historic water restrictions in an effort to deal with the state's severe drought.
The Calleguas Municipal Water District says it spent nearly $22,000 to hire a private investigator to document the alleged thefts that date back two years. A lawsuit naming Selleck and his wife was submitted to superior court on Tuesday. Selleck's reps have not commented. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
From Russia With Love
Finally, selfies can kill. That's the message from Russia's Interior Ministry. The French Press Agency reports the government is launching a public safety campaign urging Russians to take safer selfies after nearly 100 people have been injured and dozens killed in accidents involving high-risk poses. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The signs warn against selfies on train tracks,  with wild animals and atop electrical towers to name a few.
