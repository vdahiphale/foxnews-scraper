SEAN HANNITY, HOST: All right. Tucker, great show as always. Good to see you.
Welcome to “Hannity.” 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');

Tonight, we have a ton of breaking news. In the course of the next hour, you will hear from Congressman Devin Nunes, he's breaking news. Congressman Mark Meadows, he will break news. Senator Lindsey Graham will break news. Lara Trump will join us, Sara Carter, much more. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Before all of that, we begin with breaking news from "The Hill's" John Solomon, investigative reporter. And hours ago, he made a very important legal filing in his very own name demanding the release of records surrounding the Carter Page FISA application and the three subsequent renewals. Solomon is now on a mission to determine how an American citizen was spied on by our federal government with a warrant that was based on phony campaign, Russian lies, op research, oh, and paid for by the leader of the opposition party right before an election. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In the motion, Solomon writes the following: The FBI, the DOJ, and any other governmental agency should welcome public disclosure of findings of attorney misconduct so they can be addressed. And so that proper procedures can be put in place to ensure such misconduct never happens again.
We've said it before, I will say it again tonight, we are now witnessing and we are now fully exposing the single biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal. It is unraveling before our eyes each and every night. We are getting closer every day. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Joining us now, we begin with this. We'll get back to my monologue. Investigative reporter, he is -- I think you're executive vice president of "The Hill"? Some big title.
JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT: I am, indeed, yes. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: John Solomon is with us. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
OK. Let's go deep into this. This is important.
SOLOMON: Sure. So, with my good friend, Kevin Todd at the Southeastern Legal Foundation, which is a public interest law firm, we filed this motion today with the FISA court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court, and what we're saying to the judge is, listen, we know you have an important job. Most of this needs to remain secret, we are not looking to intrude on that, but there is enough in the public domain now to raise questions about the conduct of the FBI and the Justice Department before your court, and we are asking that if you have had findings, or if you know the evidence of wrongdoing, or that you have taken some form of action against DOJ or FBI officials, could you let us and the public know?
And so, really, I'm just a figure of the public asking the courts to do that. There is precedent for this. If you remember, one of the early times I came on your show to talk about the FISA court, it was in the spring of 2017. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
At that moment, the FISA court had made a rare public ruling, and it disclosed that the Obama Justice Department, the same Justice Department that prepared this first FISA, that had engaged in misconduct, illegal searches of Americans to phones records, the NSA database, and that court said that day, the Justice Department, the same Justice Department that James Comey, Loretta Lynch, all of the players on this FISA wanted, suffered from an institutional lack of candor, basically accused them of lying.
There is precedent to do this. We hope the court will find this filing of the Southeastern Legal Foundation helped me with worthy of releasing some information.
HANNITY: You know, I want to stay on your lawsuit. This is very important. We will have the I.G. report on FISA abuse. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I think the evidence is so overwhelming, so incontrovertible, so many contradictions. Notice, McCabe says, oh, no dossier, no FISA application. No FISA warrant. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SOLOMON: That's right.
HANNITY: James Comey, he signs the first one, verified. Three months later, president-elect is in Trump Tower, saying it is not verified, and it is salacious. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But more importantly, Carter Page was -- well, spied on in a couple of ways. Stefan Halper, who went after Carter Page, Papadopoulos, Sam Clovis, and now we have a blonde bombshell flirting with Papadopoulos. But backwards, they not only spied on Carter Page, it gave them the door into all things Trump world.
SOLOMON: That's right. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Trump campaign, Trump transition, Trump presidency, correct? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SOLOMON: That's correct. And listen, anyone who says, we just targeted (INAUDIBLE) Carter Page, doesn't understand how a FISA warrant works and why we need a court to monitor it. And that is once you get access to this, you get access to their historical phone records, you're able to insert people-like informants posing as other people, agents who might pretend that they are a Turkish college assistant, as in the case of George Papadopoulos, to extract or trick you into giving up information. It's a very powerful tool.
And, listen, fighting spies, capturing terrorists, is hard work. We don't want to take that from the FBI. But in this case, we now know the evidence that was used was highly flawed. It's not a normal counterintelligence investigation. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: James Comey said recently he signed that first FISA application. He says, oh, no, the FBI doesn't spy. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
SOLOMON: Yes.
HANNITY: Well, was signing the FISA application, was that spying? Did the FBI approve the blonde bombshell and Stefan Halper? Is that spying?
SOLOMON: We believe so. And, yes, listen, every spy, a real spy that I have talked to says what the FBI did in this case is spying, and let's get over using the term -- let's be honest, the first step to getting right is that using the honest terms, then disclosing the facts, and then fixing the problem. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I hope this court action tonight is the first step in trying to create a remedy for the country. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: All right. John Solomon, great reporting and a lot more coming.
SOLOMON: Thank you. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });

        }
      
HANNITY: Thank you.
Now, the deep state, they are clearly in panic mode. But also tonight, so too are there best friends in the Democratic Party. Now, for nearly three years, Pelosi, Schumer, their radical base, they have relied on nothing other than lies, conspiracy theories, the politics of destruction. They have been on a mission, and that is to take down a duly elected president, President Trump, at all cause. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, they have no plan to improve the economy, none -- none to improve the lives of the forgotten men and women, the people of this country that make the country great. No solution for immigration. No vision for more peace around the world. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Instead, three long years, one big lie, conspiracy theory, you know, a Roswell, New Mexico, level conspiracy theory. But now the gig is up. We now have four separate investigations that have all cleared President Trump of the spurious charges leveled against him and his campaign. No collusion, fact. No obstruction, fact.
And now, with their collusion hoax dead and buried, and absolutely zero record of accomplishment from anybody in the Democratic Party, well, Democrats -- they are now grasping at straws, and now, oh, let's go to a fifth investigation, maybe we'll make it an impeachment threat. Over what? Unspecified, phantom crimes that they can't even seem to describe.
They are literally demanding what would be a fifth separate investigation into Trump and Russia -- rage, hatred, psychosis, now govern this new radical, extreme, Democratic socialist party. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');

        }
      
So, today, right before an important infrastructure meeting planned at the White House, Nancy Pelosi, she had plenty of time to continue the lying and recklessly accuse the president of a cover-up. By the way, while you watch this, think, a cover-up of what? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: Would you believe that it's important for -- to follow the facts? We believe that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States. And we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.

HANNITY: OK, accusing the president of covering up a crime that never happened.
Covering up exactly what, Speaker Pelosi? What is the president of the United States covering up?

        }
      
Investigations from the FBI, Bob Mueller, House Intel Committee, bipartisan Senate panel, on the same Russia collusion lie all cleared the president.
Yet, Speaker Pelosi -- by the way, she is only speaker in name only. She has to now capitulate to a radical base led by the real speaker of the house, and that, of course, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her friends in the radical left. Pelosi, of course, now acting on the insane dictates, yes, given by freshman congresswomen, to bash our commander in chief, just minutes before what was supposed to be a bipartisan, important meeting on infrastructure at the White House. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The president, he's done. Two and a half years, cooperation, no executive privilege, encouraged everybody to testify, 1.5 million documents, even answered Mueller's questions. He's done. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now, he is not going to be a punching bag day in and day out. And today, the president rightly fought back in a huge way. He should do it, he did do it, and according to reports, the president walked right into his meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, called them out for their unethical conduct, and ended the meeting, and walked into the Rose Garden, where he delivered these pretty powerful remarks. Take a look.

Then I have Nancy Pelosi go out and say that the president of the United States engaged in a cover-up. Now, we've had a House investigation. We have Senate investigations. We have investigations like nobody has ever had before and there is nothing, we did nothing wrong.
I walked into the room, and I told Senator Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, I want to do infrastructure. I want to do it more than you want to do it. I would be really good at that. That's what I do.
But you know what? You can't do it under these circumstances. So get these phony investigations over with.

HANNITY: Yes, it is beyond sad. It is frankly pathetic, these phony investigations, sick conspiracy theories, that is all this Democratic radical socialist party has.
Pelosi, she has been speaker now for nearly six months. They've accomplished nothing. She turned on a compromise on DACA, compromise for Dreamers. She refused to address the crisis at the border, said building walls are immoral. She wasn't saying that in Obama's second term. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        }
      
She blocked any attempt to address the failures that everybody pays more, lost their doctor, oh, and by the way, we don't have any choices anymore. Obamacare, she and her fellow Democrats, they played a zero role in what is now the best economy we have seen in decades.
It is roaring. America's energy independence, Democrats, no role, the millions of new jobs created, no role whatsoever -- 1.7 million jobs available, more than people on unemployment, securing the border, no role whatsoever appeared, trade deals, nothing. They have done nothing.

          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');

And she can't even show up to a bipartisan infrastructure meeting without launching a vile attack against the president first?

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
This is not Pelosi's first rodeo, though. She knows her impeachment fantasies, it's bad politics, it won't work, and she is completely and utterly controlled by the radical socialist base in her party. As I said, it's Speaker Pelosi in name only. If Pelosi doesn't appease Ocasio-Cortez, Congresswoman Omar, and others, she knows she is out of leadership. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {

        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's why after today's White House meeting, Pelosi doubled down on dumb and these unfounded attacks against the president, and said she'd pray for him.

REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: Wasn't really respectful of the Congress and the White House working together. He just took a pass. In any event, I pray for the president of the United States. And I pray for the United States of America.
The fact is, in plain sight, in the public domain, this president is obstructing justice, and he is engaged in a cover-up. And that could be an impeachable offense.

It's kind of cracked me up.
Democrats, their friends in the media mob, they spent three long years trying to con you, the American people. Make no doubt, they lied to you. They lied the entire time. This is no longer the party of Joe Lieberman, even a Tip O'Neill, strong liberal, Massachusetts, Scoop Jackson.
Instead, it is now the party of radical socialists, liars, con artist, and conspiracy theorists. That's who they are. That is all they own. Where are the solutions for the American people?

And appropriately enough, you're one one-time savior, Michael Avenatti, is once again in serious legal trouble today. Yes, well, he was charged with stealing money from Stormy, Stormy, Stormy, Stormy's book deal. He's also facing separate extortion charges on 36 other federal indictments for perjury, theft, fraud.
Now, for months, by the way, Avenatti was begging to come on this program, over and over again. And we never gave him a serious platform. He never deserved it. We've looked at him as -- well, frankly, we kind of saw through him from the get-go.
This channel literally called out his fraud over and over again. By the way, we still give him the presumption of innocence, something he never gave Justice Kavanaugh. But this wasn't the case on other networks. For over a year, the media mob worshiped at the altar of Avenatti, giving him hours and hours of airtime, to spew his fraudulent, unchecked accusations. And they were giddy about every interview.
Remember this?

HANNITY: Ha, ha, ha, go.
Now, the people you just saw promoting Avenatti and his claims, they are the same people who promoted the Russian lies and conspiracy theories against the president every second, minute, hour of every day, the same people now calling for this impeachment over phantom crimes, the same I- believers in the Kavanaugh case, and the ones that believe in protecting Hillary from real obstruction, with real intent, real underlying crime.

And the media mob's reckless bias has never been more palpable than today. It is clear now more than ever, as we have said in '07 and beyond, journalism in America, it is dead, it is buried. We're going to have a lot more coming up throughout the hour. As I said, we have a lot of guests coming up tonight.
Breaking news, we have a big story to cover. The House Ranking Intelligence Committee member Devin Nunes, in a letter to President Trump, the congressmen, he is now urging President Trump to discuss Hillary's dirty, Russian, bought and paid for dossier with his British counterpart, writing, quote, I respectfully request that you ask Prime Minister May about the British government's knowledge of the Steele dossier and whether the British government took any unilateral actions based on information provided by Steele at the request of any U.S. departments.
In other words, it appears the ranking members of the House Intel Committee has reason to believe the British government may have also used the dirty, Russian, phony, lying dossier, Hillary paid for, as a basis to spy on a political campaign. So, tonight, the question remains: did they coordinate with our own American intel agencies to spy on an American citizen, working for the Trump campaign, maybe trying to get them to circumvent American laws and do things that they would never be allowed to do? Just a question.
Joining us now with more, about his letter to President Trump, ranking member of the House Intel Committee, Congressman Devin Nunes.
Congressman, let's talk about the letter, and is there any possibility, in your mind, and if so, how strong, that there might have been people in our intelligence community, not rank and file, that perhaps outsourced what would be illegal intelligence gathering to our allies? Random countries like Great Britain, Australia, maybe Italy?
REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF.: Well, I think we can be short about one thing, and that is that on foreign soil, someone was running operations against Trump campaign people. Now, we don't know if that was our government, if it was the British government, or if it was some type of firm of some kind that was doing it. But I think it is definitely a fact, Sean, that at least on British soil, possibly on Italian soil, there were activities going on that we need to get to the bottom of. And look, it has been very frustrating because we have been asking these questions, and we are not getting them from places like the FBI.
So, as you probably know, the president is getting ready to head to London here in a couple of weeks to spend time with the queen. I spent a lot of time with intelligence officials from the U.K. And so, look, I think we need to get some answers here. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Congressman, we now know, and it is getting deeper every day. We know that in closed-door testimony, Bruce Ohr warned everybody, in August of 2016, about the dossier being unverified, about Hillary paying for it, about Steele hating Donald Trump.
We also know ten days before the first FISA application was filed, signed by Jim Comey, that in fact, upper echelon -- again, not rank-and-file FBI people. They were all warned, Department of Justice people, warned, that, in fact, Steele had a political agenda, he had an election day deadline.
Now, we also know that, in fact, spies were sent in vis-a-vis Stefan Halper, for Carter Page, Papadopoulos, Sam Clovis, on top of the spying, basically through the FISA warrant into all things Trump. What else are we going to find out?
NUNES: Well, I know this much about Christopher Steele, and his dossier. You know, I've read plenty of intelligence reports. I've met with plenty of British officials that are in intelligence, not only in the U.K., but here and abroad.
They have been very valuable allies to us. They are not idiots, Sean. There is no possible way that British intelligence folks read the Christopher Steele dossier and didn't just laugh, OK?
So I actually believe that Mueller knows that the Mueller dossier team knew that the Brits actually I think did give us some morning. But we can't get that information. I think there are things that Mueller knew about, I think the Brits probably did raise concerns about Steele's credibility to the new administration.
But, of course, we can't get those documents. It's what we continue to try to get. I think, hopefully, it is what the U.S. attorney out of Connecticut is going to get to the bottom of. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
HANNITY: Were you -- is this a true statement that with all of the warnings ahead of time, that the FISA applications with -- your memo, Grassley-Graham memo, bulk of information unverified, Clinton bought and paid for, they lied by omission, and they lied straight up, saying it was verified, but we know it's an unverifiable document. Now we know Steele doesn't stand behind it, that this was a premeditated conspiracy to commit fraud on a FISA court.
Do you believe that as I do?
NUNES: Well, we made a criminal referral that there was a conspiracy to fraud the FISA court. We also made one that there was also conspiracy to manipulate intelligence. You had on John Solomon earlier. He has filed a request with the court.
The easiest way to clean this up, and the quickest way, would be for the FISA court itself, for the FISC, the secret court, to come out and take action against all of these top level people at the Department of Justice and the FBI who fraudulently produced information to the court. You know, because if not, if the courts doesn't do this, it is -- we are going to run all through all of this between I.G. and the U.S. attorney, the work that we continue to have to do.
And look, at the end of the day, it's not going to be believable that we should have a secret court in this country if they can't take action to enforce people that deliberately lie to them.
HANNITY: Do you believe Robert Mueller has something to answer for when it comes to when did he know that there was no collusion? A. B, if you have time for old tax returns, loan applications, and taxi medallions, morning raids with guns drawn at 4:00 a.m. with unarmed people, 30 people doing it, and he didn't get to the dossier? Literally, "The New York Times" suggests --

HANNITY: Yes?
NUNES: -- he knew the day he walked in the door that there was no evidence of collusion. But the Mueller dossier as we talked about the last few weeks, people actually read it closely, they are going to find, this is an absolute joke. He made out most of the information in his report based off of news stories.
So, you had circular reporting where you would have leaks from the Clinton campaign --
HANNITY: Yes.
NUNES: -- leaks from FBI, runs in a new story, and lo and behold, after $40 million, what you have? We have a news story regurgitated to the American public.
HANNITY: Your five buckets are revealed, what will the average American think?

When we come back, we have a lot more breaking news. Senator Lindsey Graham, he'll weigh in on the Democrats impeachment hysteria. Also tonight, Congressman Mark Meadows, he is leading this effort.
Also, Lara Trump, and much more.

HANNITY: Here now with reaction is the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Lindsey Graham of the great state of South Carolina.
Sir, how are you? Good to see you.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Good, thank you.
HANNITY: All right. It's clear Nancy Pelosi is speaker in name only. It is clear this is what the media mob and the radical Democrats are doing. No solutions for the American people.
GRAHAM: Right.

        }
      
HANNITY: I don't think -- Matt Towery, a great pollster said to me today, that combination of the Green New Deal and impeachment after four separate exonerations, that's not going to work out well, politically.
GRAHAM: Well, I don't think so. I think Medicare for all means Medicare for nobody. So, between their radical agenda and their desire to destroy Trump -- you got to remember this: two years, Mueller looked at Trump, $25 million, 40 FBI agents, 19 lawyers, 2,800 subpoenas, and they find no collusion with the Russians.
The Democrats will not take Mueller's -- as the final word. Here's what's going to happen. I don't think you can get the Democratic nomination for president without advocating for the impeachment of Donald Trump. I don't think you're going to be able to survive in the Democratic Party without a primary if you don't call for Trump's impeachment.
And here's what I think is going to happen. The public is going to kick the Democrats out of power and they're going to reelect the president, if he stays focused on doing the job for the American people.
HANNITY: There's a lot of talk, Mueller doesn't want to come in. You have commented on.
GRAHAM: Yes.
HANNITY: If he wants to come in, you said, fine.
Well, I know Democrats, that's still their dream, but their questions, I think you and Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows might have, that are a little different. When did he know there was no collusion with Russia? Important question.
He had time for taxi medallions and loan applications, and everything else, why didn't he investigate the dossier? Why did he only hire Democratic donors? Why did he hire one of his people who happen to be a lawyer for Hillary Clinton's foundation?
Why did he hire Andrew Weissmann, "Licensed to Lie", in Sidney Powell's book, he once withheld exculpatory evidence, most atrocious record, Enron accounting, and Merrill executives, 9-0, he lost in the Supreme Court?
Would you like the answer to those questions? Because I would.
GRAHAM: Yes, but I'll ask him, did you find any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia? Did President Trump do anything to stop you from doing your job is what I would ask him. The answer is no, Trump did not collude with the Russians. We know for sure he didn't. We now know that Trump didn't - gave 1.4 million documents to the Special Counsel. Everybody around the President testified for hours.
The bottom line is the Democrats want an outcome. The Mueller report didn't give them the outcome they wanted. And they're going to keep going until they get the outcome they want. And here's what's going to happen. If the President will focus on infrastructure, prescription drugs and keeping the country safe, he is going to win. And Nancy Pelosi and that crowd is going to get kicked out of office.
HANNITY: Is there a justifiable reason with that broad mandate that Mueller had? And it was broad. It took him way off course.
GRAHAM: Yes.
HANNITY: How does he then justify the main part of the mandate, which is Russian interference, and ignored the Hillary dirty dossier for Russia?
GRAHAM: To be honest with you, Sean, that wasn't his job. His job was to find out did candidate Trump colluded with the Russian? Did our President, when he was running for office, win the election because the Russians helped him and he wanted that help?
HANNITY: Well, wait a minute, though.
GRAHAM: The answer is no.
HANNITY: But he had the authority to expand out, Senator.
GRAHAM: Yes, but he didn't. That's what Barr is going to do, that's what Horowitz is going to do. You can say this anyway you would like, but here is the bottom line. After two years of a political rectal exam, nobody has been looked at more than Trump. They found nothing. But the answer for the Democrats is Trump has got to go. They will not beat him at the ballot box. If they try to impeach him, they're going to ensure his reelection.
I want the American people to know that Bob Mueller did his job. He looked at Trump every way you could look at Trump, and he found nothing. And this is just political revenge. It's going to blow up in their face. And I can't wait until 20.
HANNITY: Well said. Senator Graham, we will see you again soon. Thank you so much for being with us.
When we come back, Congressman Jim Jordan, he says Democrats are launching what is a coordinated effort to take down a duly-elected President. We'll ask Mark Meadows from North Carolina. Later, more bad news for Michael Avenatti indicted on new charges today related to Stormy, Stormy, Stormy. Wow! I wonder how fake news CNN and conspiracy TV MSNBC feel. He is their favorite guest. What if he gets convicted? What are they going to do? Straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Also developing tonight, Congressman Jim Jordan, Ohio, warning of a coordinated effort to undermine the President, citing secret memos among Democratic lawmakers. Let's look at this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OH: Senator, I think they've already started. They just won't formally declare it. There are secret memorandums of understanding, secret MoUs between the various chairmen on how they will coordinate their attack on the President. I mean, they're basically contracts. You're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to share certain information. A coordinated effort to take down the President.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Joining us tonight with all big breaking news, we have Freedom Caucus Chairman, Congressman Mark Meadows, North Carolina; Fox News Contributor, investigative reporter, Sara Carter.
Congressman, between your comments that you made about what is coming and Jim's comments about the state - the raging Democratic colleagues of yours, it's interesting. Where do you think this plays out? How do you think it plays out?
REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-N.C.: Well, I think Jim is exactly right. What they do on - by the Democrats on Capitol Hill is they've actually got this deal where they'll break one bit of news, go after the President in a different committee. I tell you, there's not a single committee that you can be in that is serious about legislative work. They're serious about going after this President. And it doesn't matter what the facts are.
I went by a couple of them earlier today, and all they wanted to do is talk about the President obstructing. I can tell you, I spoke to the President. He is willing to do a transportation deal, he is willing to lower prescription drug prices, and yet we have the Democrats that are only serious about one thing, coordinating an attack on this President.
HANNITY: Congressman, this would now - FBI investigation, House Intel Committee investigation, bipartisan Senate committee investigation, the Mueller Report. This would now be number five. And by the way, as all of these closed-door transcripts come out, really big kudos to you and Jim Jordan. You guys asked all the rights questions, and you were tough as nails behind the scenes. The only thing I resent is you did not give me this information. And I've known you and I'm friends with you.
(LAUGHTER)
MEADOWS: Well, you've got to get to the right time to release some of the stuff. But I - for us, it's about a search for the truth, Sean. And I can tell you, there's information coming that will curl your hair. I can tell you that the reason why it's so visceral - the response from the Democrats is so visceral right now is because they know - they've seen documents. Adam Schiff has seen documents that he knows will actually put the finger pointing back at him and his Democrat colleagues, not the President of the United States. And so that's why you're seeing it.
HANNITY: Congressman, we do have proof of Russia collusion. That's Adam- cowardly-Shift (ph) on tape with a Russian hoaxter and the guy is going with the Russian, "Well, do you have compromising material?" "Yes, about (ph) compromising material, naked (ph) Trump, naked (ph) Trump. Did Vladimir see them--?
MEADOWS: The Democrats coordinated with just about everybody but one critical group, the American people. They forgot the American people who actually went and voted for Donald Trump.
HANNITY: We talked, Sara, about five buckets. You now see that we are at the precipice. We expect within a week or so that we are going to have the first one of five buckets, that being, of course, transcripts at least, if not a tape, exculpatory evidence, and all the warnings right in front of them about the dirty dossier, and they used it anyway.
SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM VISITING FELLOW: That's right. So, once they release that information, which is so vitally important, the American people will understand what was going on here. Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, apparently both of them told Stefan Halper, who was spying on them for the FBI, that they were in no way, Sean, involved with the Russians or that - and they had no idea what Stefan Halper was trying to tell them about.
So, once that information comes out, once we get the Gang of Eight binder, once the full FISA disclosures are out there, it will start to put the pieces together for the American people. And most importantly, I think what Devin Nunes did today in his letter to the President is going to reveal extraordinary information.
I know I spoke tonight to several sources in the U.S. intelligence community that said there would be no way that MI5, British MI5, British MI6 senior executives, the directors of those agencies would know about this dossier and then not share that information with John Brennan. So there is going to be a lot more information coming out about what did Brennan know, what did Comey know, what did Clapper know, and how did foreign intelligence play a role in what happened with our U.S.--
HANNITY: Well, we know Comey lied.
CARTER: --the FBI probe into the Trump campaign. That's right. We do know that.
HANNITY: We know he lied. October, he said, oh, it's verified. He signed the first FISA warrant. December, at Trump Tower, he said, no, it's unverified. Which is it, Jim? And also, the Attorney General says you lied under oath under Obama. That'd be Loretta Lynch.
All right. Congressman, I've got to go back to this. You said the information will curl your hair. I have pretty straight hair. How - how does my - why does my hair become curly?
MEADOWS: Well, I think what happens is every time - and Sara was just talking about what may be coming in some of this. But when we talk about spying on a Trump associate, what I'm talking about is spying in the sense that the American people believe what spying is. That means secretly recording, taking down notes, making sure that they do covert operations, and yet here--
HANNITY: Did Jim Comey spy?
MEADOWS: Well, he actually--
HANNITY: Did he sign (ph) the FISA warrant?
MEADOWS: --was aware of it. He was aware of improper things that were being done, certainly.
HANNITY: All right. And how soon can we expect? Last question, exit question, both. Sara, we'll start with you.
CARTER: I think within weeks we're going to get information. And then, as it comes on, it will be an avalanche of information for the American people. And I think they'll be very disturbed at what they learn.
HANNITY: Mark?
MEADOWS: Hey, we're talking about days, not weeks. So, very soon. Very soon.
HANNITY: I resent the hell out of it. You didn't tell me.
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: It makes - I wanted - I asked you a lot.
(CROSSTALK)
MEADOWS: Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: --says, well, you're kind of over the target. I'm like, I need more, I need specifics to report to my audience. Good to see you both.
MEADOWS: All right.
HANNITY: All right. When we come back, liberal lunacy now reaching new lows. Democratic Senator Hirono is now bragging. She spoke to eighth graders about abortion. Eighth graders? Lara Trump will join us. Also, Michael Avenatti indicted on brand-new charges related to Stormy, Stormy, Stormy. Looks like he is in serious legal trouble. Straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Now the Democrats, they are ramping up their far-left late-term abortion agenda, even bragging about how they are getting teenagers on board. Really? Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MAZIE HIRONO, D-HI: I just left 60 eighth graders from a public school in Hawaii, and I told them I was coming to a rally in front of the Supreme Court. And I asked the girls of that group of eighth graders, how many of you girls think that government should be telling us, women, when and if we want to have babies? Not a single one of them raised their hands. How many of you boys think this government should be telling girls and women when and if we're going to have babies? And not a single one of them raised their hands.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Eighth graders?
Joining us now with reaction, Senior Advisor for the Trump 2020 reelect, Lara Trump, is with us. Lara, good to see you.
LARA TRUMP, SENIOR ADVISOR FOR TRUMP 2020: Hello, Sean, thanks for having me on.
HANNITY: Glad you're here. By the way - and you broke the news. It's public. You're about to have baby number two, and congrats to you and Eric.
TRUMP: Thank you.
HANNITY: I live in New York. It's a liberal state. New York City is like 9:1 registered Democrats. I'm a registered conservative, not a Republican actually. And every one of the people that I know, that I know are pro- choice, they hear about, "well, first we'll deliver the baby, we'll make the baby comfortable, and then we'll let the mother decide," or the comment by the House of Commons member, "Oh, yes, we would support - our legislation would support abortion even during the birthing process."
TRUMP: It is. It's so appalling, and to just - to hear what we just heard there from Mazie Hirono in Hawaii. Whatever happened to teaching kids responsibility? And instead of let's jump to an abortion, let's teach them about the sanctity of life. I wonder if she mentioned to them that not too many years earlier under the Democrats' new policies, a lot of them probably wouldn't be here because they're advocating, to your point, for 40-week abortions and infanticide.
It is absolutely crazy what we see happening in this country when it comes to this stuff. They've gone so far overboard. The average person in this country, I do not think, supports this kind of thinking, and what they are proposing with these crazy, crazy, late-term abortion laws. It's really sad to see. And by the way, as you pointed out, I am pregnant, and in a couple of months, I am going to have a baby. And this kind of thing to me is sickening, and I really can't wrap my mind around it at all.
HANNITY: It really is hard. And all of the people that say, that I know that are pro-choice, they are shocked and they find this so repugnant. And they make a very distinct difference, even though we might have a difference of when life begins. But if you look at everything that's happening, you stand back, big picture, between the New Green Deal and the out-of-control rage and the desire for a fifth investigation now after four conclusions, no collusion, you've got to sit back as - you're in the reelect campaign, and people want to keep digging that hall. I'm like, can I get you another shovel, would you like me to get you some other people to help?
(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP: I always say - I say - yes. I don't know who gave the Democrats the shovel, but let them keep digging. The really sad thing here, Sean, is that if for one second people wanted to stop playing political games and actually do something for the people of this country and work with our President, who has said he wants to fix infrastructure, health care, immigration, all broken systems that do not work for the people of this country, we would have them done by now or we would have them done in about 10 seconds.
This President, of all presidents, when it comes to infrastructure, he is a master builder. That's what he has done his whole life. But instead, Nancy and Chuck and their whole team of people on the Democrats side are more interested in playing political games than doing what is right for the people of this country. And it's really sad to see because I always think about how much could be accomplished if they work together.
To this President's credit, by the way, look at where we are and look at what we have accomplished despite the Mueller investigation, despite the obstruction, despite the constant attacks that he receives every single day. But you do tend to think about what could be possible if we could all just get along.
HANNITY: When you look at the economy, you can think of it, I can't, a single thing the Democrats have done to help the President achieve one economic record after another. And by the way, the people that have benefited the most, the people that were disproportionately negatively impacted by Biden-Obama policies - because I can't really think of and I'll never - the Reagan re-elect was simple. Are you - is the country better off--
TRUMP: Yes.
HANNITY: --than you were four years ago? And by every measure, I can't think of any example except big states, we can't deduct our - we don't get the special deduction of high income tax states that took away money from all the states that don't have high taxes. But--
TRUMP: Yes. This President has delivered on everything he said he would, Sean, and with zero help from the Democrats. Remember, they voted against the tax cuts, which saved, on average, around $1,500 per family in this country this tax season. So they have fought against him at every turn, every single thing he wants to do, deregulation. When it comes to anything possible, they go against him. If he says up, they say down. The good news is, he still gets things done, and they work so well for the people of this country and they feel it every day.
HANNITY: OK.
TRUMP: They feel it every single day. And I agree with you, they're going to come out and they're going to vote for him because their lives, come November of 2020, are going to be better than they were before Donald Trump took office.
HANNITY: Last quick question, 20 seconds. Who do you think gets the Democratic nomination, or do you care?
TRUMP: We don't care because we know this President is going to win. He's actually done things and produced results for the people of this country, instead of just a lot of talk on the other side. I wish I knew. If I had a magic ball and I can look into it, I wish I knew. But I'd like to see those debates. I think they'll be very interesting and very telling.
HANNITY: Oh, I think they'll be interesting. All right. Lara Trump, again, congratulations to you and Eric. Thanks for being with us.
When we come back, things keep going from bad to worse for, yes, the media's favorite guest, Michael Avenatti hit with more charges today. Trace Gallagher, full report, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: All right. Villain of the Day - yes, he is back. Michael Avenatti, scandal-ridden lawyer. He's in a lot more legal trouble tonight. Trace Gallagher live from our West Coast newsroom. Got a lot of issues. Trace?
TRACE GALLAGHER, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Sean. Stormy Daniels is now the sixth client of Michael Avenatti that federal prosecutors say he defrauded. This time he's accused of stealing part of Daniels' advance on her book, Full Disclosure.
A grand jury says Avenatti emailed a letter complete with a forged signature to her book agency, instructing them to wire $300,000 into an account controlled by Avenatti. "Far from zealously representing his client, Avenatti, as alleged, instead engaged in outright deception and theft."
Avenatti knew the charges were coming because before the indictment, he tweeted, "No monies relating to Ms. Daniels were ever misappropriated or mishandled. She received millions of dollars worth of legal services, and we've spent huge sums in expenses. She directly paid only $100 for all that she received. I look forward to a jury hearing the evidence."
Avenatti is also accused of extorting Nike and stealing millions in settlement money from other clients to fund his lavish lifestyle. The Daniels case alone could send him to prison for 69 years. For all of the cases, Sean, he's looking at 404 years behind bars. Sean.
HANNITY: All right. Trace Gallagher, thank you.
You know what? We're going to do something he would not do for Justice Kavanaugh with those phony charges by his "client." We'll give him due process, presumption of innocence. We'll never be the media mob. Thank you for being with us. Let not your heart be troubled.
Laura Ingraham, hi.
