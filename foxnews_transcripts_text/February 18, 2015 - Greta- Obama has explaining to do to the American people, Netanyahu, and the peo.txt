Let's go "Off the Record" for a minute. President Obama has some explaining to do to the American people and to the people of Israel and to Prime Minister Netanyahu.
First, President Obama embarrassed us when he got caught in a hot mic in 2011, trash-talking Prime Minister Netanyahu with then-French President Sarkozy. Sarkozy said he couldn't stand Netanyahu, called him a liar. President Obama jumped in, claiming he had it worse because he has to deal more often with Netanyahu. And then recently, President Obama insulted many Jews and embarrassed many Americans by blowing off the march in Paris after an anti-semantic terrorist attack on a kosher deli. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And more recently, President Obama said he doesn't have time to meet with Netanyahu when he is in town for a speech to Congress. President Obama can meet with a YouTube personality who eats cereal out of bathtub, but not the prime minister of our ally, Israel? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So now Wednesday's insult to Israel - and it is a big one - that Muslim leader who called Israel a suspect in the 9/11 attacks, was invited to the White House's antiterrorist summit. So let me get this straight: The White House invites a Muslim leader, who accused Israel of involvement in 9/11, but President Obama can't find five minutes to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is terrified Iran is getting nuclear weapons? That is so messed up. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And that's my "Off the Record" comment.
