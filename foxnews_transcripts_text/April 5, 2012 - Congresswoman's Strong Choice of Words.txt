Choice of Words
New York Democratic Congresswoman Louise Slaughter used some strong language while speaking to pro-choice supporters at a rally Thursday. She was talking about the budget battle with Republicans and the debate over GOP proposals on abortion when she made this statement: 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          });
        } else {

REP. LOUISE SLAUGHTER, D-N.Y.: This is probably one of the worst times that we've seen because the numbers of people who are elected to congress. I went through this as co-chair of the Arts Caucus. In '94, people were elected simply to come here to kill the National Endowment for the Arts. Now they're here to kill women. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Well, shortly after the shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in January, Slaughter decried that sort of heated political rhetoric. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And, as The Hill newspaper put it, Slaughter -- quote -- "suggested the Federal Communications Commission was 'not working anymore,' adding, she would look at ways to better police language on the airwaves."

The French press agency reports a 75-year-old woman accidentally cut off access to the Internet -- all of it -- in Georgia and neighboring Armenia when she hacked into a fiber cable while digging for scrap metal. She was arrested and charged with damaging property.

And finally, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi isn't letting his legal woes affect his mood.
While handing out prizes to a dozen promising young college graduates, he joked two female recipients were so wonderful he was thinking of inviting them to his famed "bunga bunga" parties. He also told one of their male friends he was cute enough to come along as well.
Berlusconi's trial on sex and corruption charges began earlier this week.
