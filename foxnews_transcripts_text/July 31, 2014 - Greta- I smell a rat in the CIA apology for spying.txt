Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I agree with Senator Mark Udall, CIA Director John Brennan should resign. But that's not all. There is a lot more. I smell a rat and a squishy apology from the CIA director should not push this matter under the rug.
Earlier today, CIA Director John Brennan apologized to the Senate Intelligence Committee leaders for spying on them. That's not a mistake. That is a crime and a big one. On the CIA's own website, it says domestic spying by the CIA is a crime. And the only way it's not a crime - and this is where I get a bit suspicious - is if the attorney general of the United States authorizes domestic spying. That, of course, would be Eric Holder. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, did the attorney general authorize domestic spying? If he did, he needs to tell us why. He owes the American people those answers. And if Eric Holder didn't authorize the spying, he needs to do his job and prosecute, convene a grand jury immediately. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
I don't buy for one second the Department of Justice's previous statement that there is not enough evidence for a criminal investigation. That statement is a lie. It smells like a cover-up to me. There could not be more evidence; the CIA director just admitted it happened. That's called a confession. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
How much more evidence does the attorney general need? Smell a rat? That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
