MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Happy Thanksgiving, John. Great to seeyou tonight. And good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this isThe Story for a Friday.Republican Michigan State Senator Mike Shirkey is one of several top GOPleaders in Michigan. Today, he was at the center of one of the hottestpolitical battles in the country. This morning, he woke up, he put on hismask. He went to the airport to go visit President Trump in the midst ofthis fierce battle over the presidential election in his state. And here'swhat happened here.(VIDEO PLAYING)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shame on you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shame on you.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What did Trump promise you?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Where is the evidence of fraud.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Shame on you.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Certify the results.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Certify the results.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, when pressed by a reporter over whether he would seek tooverturn the electors if the canvass board deadlocks, Shirkey deflected andthen sang a hymn about time surrendering and clinging to the old, ruggedcross. Watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. MIKE SHIRKEY (R-MI): Time has surrender and there's no more, I willcling to the old (inaudible).(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, like so many states, Michigan is up against the deadline nowto certify the election. And the president claims that voter fraud shouldforce a different outcome there. You remember this when two Republicancanvassers, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, denied the certification inWayne County based on out of balance vote tallies. They were then verballyabused, and they were called racists in a public forum on Zoom.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I hope that both of you go home tonight and read up onsystemic racism.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shame on you. Shame on you for leading to this level ofcorruption.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You all should be ashamed of yourselves and know thatwhat you are doing here today is on the wrong side of history.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Your cult followers doing whatever your cult leadertells you to do. Why don't you have any shame? Because you're not smartenough to realize you're in a cult.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Trump stink. The stain of racism that you WilliamHartmann and Monica Palmer have just covered yourself in is going to followyou throughout history. Monica Palmer and William Hartmann will forever beknown in southeastern Michigan as two racist and Lord knows, when you go tomeet your maker, your soul is going to be very, very warm.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Brutal treatment that they received. So, what exactly wasdiscussed behind closed doors at the White House today? This meeting got alot of attention. The Michigan lawmaker stated just a short time ago thatthey spoke to the president about a number of things, including COVIDrelief for the state of Michigan. They said they haven't seen anything thatwould lead to a change in the outcome of the election and that they willfollow the law. Now, word that the president has wanting to meet withPennsylvania GOP leaders, as well as he insists that he won the election.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The campaign which Iwon, by the way, but we'll find that out, almost 74 million votes.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So that is President-elect Biden slammed the president forinviting those Michigan lawmakers to the White House.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's going to be anotherincident where he will go down in history as being one of the mostirresponsible presidents in American history.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: We begin tonight with Monica Palmer, Republican member of theWayne County Board of Canvassers in Michigan. She's the person that all ofthose individuals were yelling at on the Zoom meeting. Monica, thank youvery much for being here tonight. So why did you and Mr. Hartmann decide tovote no? What bothered you about the vote tallies?MONICA PALMER, WAYNE COUNTY BOARD OF CANVASSERS: Well, in the primary, wehad a problem with 72 percent on the absentee counting board being out ofbalance, unexplained, and we had broad bipartisan support to get aresolution up to the state to have an investigation done and have theSecretary of State come into Detroit and help fix processes. At that point,it was outrageous.We had leaders at the local level and leaders at the state level just veryfrustrated with the results of not having things explained. And thoseprecincts and absentee county boards being unaccountable. We had a repeatin the general election when the executive summary of the plus minus reportindicating which precincts were in balance and out of balance, over 70percent of the absentee counting boards in Detroit were out of balance,unexplained, which means they're not re-countable.In addition, there were several other communities that were out of balance,unexplained, including Lavonia. And in a canvass, you're supposed to makesure that you have every valid vote counted for and not counting anyinvalid votes and that the total of the ballots issued matched the total ofballots totaled on election night.And if there's a discrepancy, there needs to be an explanation. So thatlack of explanations means that it's not complete and accuratedocumentation. And that is why we voted no, because it's the job of thecanvass to make sure that that documentation is complete and accurate. Andwithout that, we couldn't certify.MACCALLUM: In more than 70 percent of the counties with the absenteeballots, the number that were requested and the number that you receivedwere different. Tell me if I'm getting this wrong here. But there were moreballots that you got in than were requested, is that correct?PALMER: Close. There were more ballots counted in the tabulator than therewere shown as received ballots in the poll book.MACCALLUM: Got it. I mean, that that's obviously a situation that wouldmake anybody uncomfortable in your position where it's your responsibilityto sign off on it all being well accounted for and understandable andmaking sense. So, then you have the situation where you vote no and thenunder this enormous pressure, you change your vote to yes, you and Mr.Hartmann. So, now there's an attorney as of this evening in Michigan whosays that you cannot, a board attorney, you are not allowed to change yourmind again. What's your response to that?PALMER: My response to that is, is that we - on the second motion, a dealwas made between Vice Chair Jonathan Kinloch and myself. He promised methat there would be an audit and that he had guarantees from higher levelthat audit would take place. And that is the only reason that I voted yesfor that certification, because a comprehensive independent audit should beable to answer those unanswered questions, which would fulfill therequirements of the canvas. Moments after the vote was done, SecretaryBenson came on TV and said that the resolution was non-binding and that shedidn't have to perform the audit.MACCALLUM: And he said - here's Mr. Kinloch, the person that assured you,look, just vote yes and I promise you, we're going to do an audit. We'regoing to fix all these problems. Here's what he says now about that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JONATHAN KINLOCH, WAYNE COUNTY BOARD OF CANVASSERS: I said I called thegovernor, the secretary of state and the director of the Department ofElections, and I was not able to reach them. She knew that we could notdemand the secretary of state to conduct an audit.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So that doesn't match up with what he told you?PALMER: Not at all.MACCALLUM: So, is he lying?PALMER: Either he lied to me or he's lying now, I'm not sure which it is.MACCALLUM: Here's what Governor Whitmer, she wants you guys to get thisprocess done and over with, and here's what she's saying.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-MI): The will of the people will be done and theseefforts to disenfranchise Wayne County and majority where the majority ofour African American voters live, is just a blatant attempt to steal theelection result and disenfranchise Michigan voters.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Are you trying to steal the election, the voting process fromAfrican Americans in Wayne County, Monica?PALMER: Absolutely not. By voting no on the certification doesn't take avote away from anyone. What it does is allows the state to have 10additional days with a state board of canvassers to continue askingquestions to get answers to those unexplained imbalances.MACCALLUM: So, now you've got - what's your reaction to this Washingtonvisit today by the two top legislators in the GOP side on the stategovernment in Michigan, you saw how outraged some of those people were.PALMER: The outrage is something that I'm recently very familiar with so Ican empathize with them on that. As far as the timing of things, I'm notprivy to what was going on in those conversations, so I can't comment.MACCALLUM: And the president called you, so there's some out there who lookat that, right? They look at this meeting at the White House and they lookat the president calling you and they say, he's trying to work thesepeople. He's trying to change the outcome in Michigan, which is 154,000votes apart. What would you say to that?PALMER: I would say that that's not the case. The president called to thankme for my service as a public servant on the canvassing board. And moreimportantly, to check to make sure that I was safe because he had heardabout the threats that were being made in a public meeting. And I reallyappreciate him taking time out of his very, very busy schedule to do that.It meant a lot.MACCALLUM: Monica Palmer, thank you very much. We're all watching thisacross the country very closely as it unfolds. And you stood your ground,and we'll see where this goes. Monica, thank you for being here tonight.PALMER: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, moments ago, the police chief in Wisconsin provided anupdate after multiple people were shot inside a mall. Our reporter has justarrived on the scene and we will take you there live in moments.Also coming up, Victor Davis Hanson and Marc Thiessen on President Trump'shuddle with those Michigan lawmakers and their take on where the presidentshould go next with all of this, especially if he has an eye to 2024.That's next.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The campaign which I won, by the way, but we'll find that out,almost 74 million votes.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM: President under pressure from some Republican lawmakers to moveon while his supporters are angered that the GOP is not backing his fight.Joining me now, Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the HooverInstitution, and Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute Scholar andFox News Contributor. Gentlemen, good to have both of you with us thisevening.Marc, you, and I spoke earlier today, and you have laid out some veryspecific points that you think the president should do now. Have you sharedthose with the White House? And what would you tell them tonight if youwere listening to?MARC THIESSEN, FORMER CHIEF SPEECHWRITER, PRES GWB: Well, I published themin The Washington Post, and I sent them to the president, and he's receivedthem. So, he knows what my recommendations are. I mean, my advice to him isthere is a path to a second term. It's called the 2024 elections that hehas in as we talked about this morning, he's the first president in 132years since Grover Cleveland, who has a realistic chance of reclaiming thepresidency after having lost it four years earlier.But in order to do that, he needs to pivot and start focusing on the nextelection instead of this one. And he also needs to understand the reason helost. It's not because of voter fraud. He lost because millions ofAmericans who support his policies remember before the election, 56 percentof Americans said I'm better off now than they were four years ago, but alot of the millions of those people didn't vote for him. Why is that?Because they were exhausted by the chaos. And the chaos isn't all DonaldTrump's fault, but he contributes to it.And then when you have him inviting Michigan legislators to talk about thepossibility of having them - have different electors and changing theelection result, he lost Michigan by 156,000 votes, not 156 votes, not 1560votes, a 156,000. So, if the Democrats were - if the roles were reversedand the Democrats were doing it, we'd be outraged.So, what he's doing by the - and then having Rudy Giuliani going out andalleging a plot involving Cuba, China, Venezuela, George Soros and, youknow, Dr. Evil from Austin Powers, practically, that makes these votersthink I made the right decision and he's going to lose them permanently andit's going to be impossible for him to win back the presidency. So, heneeds to pivot away from this and focus on the next election.MACCALLUM: This is what Eric Holder said today about all of this, theformer attorney general, and then I want to get, Victor, your thoughts onthis. He said this is a period of maximum danger for our democracy.Tampering with county officials and inviting state legislators to the WhiteHouse to discuss a plot to reverse the results of a free and fair electionis the behavior of a foreign autocrat, not an American president.And yet, Victor, as I mentioned, there are all of these Trump supportersout there who are really angry that they're not seeing Republicanleadership support for the president on these voting issues. Where do youstand?VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, they're notparanoid or stupid, I think everybody Martha, they can agree that becauseof the lockdown and COVID and the pandemic, that there was a rush to have apreponderance of mail in balloting and early voting and computer systemsthat weren't fairly or fully authenticated in some cases. And the result isthat there was a lot of upset voters and there were state legislatures whohave - they have the constitutional prerogative alone to set the rules. Andsome of the rules were put aside. Everybody agreed on that.So, it was perfectly legitimate for two weeks to adjudicate these to thecourts and to sound it out in the media and back and forth. But thequestion was always was this of a magnitude, not whether the irregularitiesexisted, but were they have a magnitude to alter 20,000 votes very close inWisconsin or Georgia, 12 or so or 14 in Arizona.And I think that was working through, it had been two and a half weeks. Wehad three and a half weeks until the electors met. But then things changedwhen a lot of people freelance, when they came in and changed the dialogueand they said, no, no, it wasn't just fraud here. And it wasn't just aclose count here. And it's not just one state here. It's a multi-millionvote, coordinated conspiracy. And it's - if that were to be true, would bethe biggest scandal in American history, more than the 1824, the 1876election. So immediately everybody said, oh, my gosh, we can't evencomprehend the magnitude of what you're accusing on TV.So, we thought there would be analytics and data and forensics and maybethey will come. But so far, they haven't come. And so that is I think Marcis correct on that. That's changing what had been a measured and reasonableresponse and now it's chaos.And now we go into the political rather than the legal very quickly.There's an election coming up in Georgia, and that's a purple state now.And Donald Trump's legacy is on the line because if they win the Senate,they, being the Democrats, it's not just going to be one part of Congress.It's going to be the House. It's going to be the Senate. It's going to bethe presidency. No filibuster and maybe even a packed liberal court.So, there's a lot of stakes there. And Donald Trump alone can get that basefired up and go to Georgia and unite the party. But he can't do it if allthese people are making charges that they can't substantiate within 24 or48 hours.So, I think Mark is on - I think he's right in general on what he's saying.But I would have a little bit more sympathy because there wereirregularities either way, the overrides of state legislatures and theywere trying to find out whether that was going to alter the election. Now,it's changed, I think we should--MACCALLUM: Just a quick moment to close up here, Marc, your response?THIESSEN: Just simply, I agree with Victor and I'm very sympathetic to thepresident. I want him to have a second term. But he's got to focus on 2024.MACCALLUM: All right, thank you, gentlemen. Great to see you both tonight.Thanks for being here.THIESSEN: Thank you.HANSON: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, as we mentioned at the top of the show, there are reportstonight of multiple people injured following an active shooter incident atMayfair Mall in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, which is just outside of Milwaukee.The police chief confirmed moments ago that the suspect is still at large.Senior Correspondent Mike Tobin has just arrived on the scene. Mike, canyou hear me there? OK, what's going on there, Mike?MIKE TOBIN, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: I can hear you, Martha. And the one thingthat the chief pointed to and saying that the shooter is still at large,they can't necessarily say that he's not still in the mall. He could quitepossibly be hiding in the mall. When the authorities arrived at the scene.It wasn't necessarily an active scene. I mean, there was an exchange ofgunfire. The shooter was just apparently gone.But there was a shooting at - the shots rang out at 250 just before 3o'clock local time with Central Time here with the authorities responding.The one thing that Chief Barry Weber pointed to, though. The good news isthat there were no fatalities.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARRY WEBER, POLICE CHIEF, WAUWATOSA: Seven injured adults and one injuredteenager were transported to the hospital by Wauwatosa Fire Department. Theextent of their injuries is unknown at this time. Everybody was alive atthat time, though, so there's not been any fatalities that I'm aware of.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN: Witness working at the food court describes the chaos when the shotsfirst started ringing out.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I heard the gunshots one after another, and then I heardmy manager run back and, you know, him and the other lady said, there's ashooting, we need to go out here right now. Yes, luckily, we all got offsafely. Nobody's hurt. But, yes, it's just chaos. Terrifying, very scary.And I've never experienced anything like this before.(END VIDEO CLIP)TOBIN: Now, the chief described the shooter as a white male in his 20s and30s and seemed to emphasize any early information that is identifying theshooter is wrong. They don't know who he is. Martha.MACCALLUM: Mike Tobin, we'll stay on it with your help out there. Thank youvery much. So, coming up here tonight, Dr. Marty Makary with new data thatsuggests that schools are very safe to stay open. And a public-schoolteacher who says that California leaders are acting - are making peopleinto government hostages and that children are the victims. They're upnext.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Open high schools.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We've got the PPE and we've got the ventilation andwe've got the testing. For one since March, our kids were able to go toschool every day, get a little bit of life back, get their friends back andget their learning back.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: Outraged parents sending a message to New York City Mayor Billde Blasio to argue that schools are safe, that they're essential and thatthey need to remain open. And now this new study has been published by mynext guest at Johns Hopkin's School of Medicine. Among patients with nocomorbidities, the youngest age group, zero to 18 had a zero percentmortality rate. Take a good look at this chart. So basically, everyoneunder 70 has a less than one percent death rate. But as you know, in termsof the schools, some of the union leaders are unconvinced by the data thatyou see before you. Here is AFT President last night, Randi Weingarten.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)RANDI WEINGARTEN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: Schools arenot impervious to all that is going on in the outside.MACCALLUM: The transmission rate is very, very low. These experts andscientists say the children are safer in school. It's worked across Europe.It's worked across the U.K.WEINGARTEN: Well, the --MACCALLUM: They never closed their schools during second spike and now theyare in recovery, they are down 10 percent.WEINGARTEN: They've been trying to get kids back into school throughout thecountry and we worked with New York City to do it. But we have to getcommunity spread down now.(END VIDEOTAPE)MACCALLUM (on camera): Dr. Marty Makary joins me now, professor of healthpolicy and management at Johns Hopkins and Fox News medical contributor.Dr. Makary, good to have you with us.This is an interesting study. What really stood out to you from this data?MARTY MAKARY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, good evening, Martha. You know,one question that we have never been able to answer with good data up untilthis point is what about people who are completely healthy who have no pre-existing conditions, no co-morbidities? What is their risk?Because most of the data has been lumped together, including those at highrisk and those at low risk. And it turns out from the analysis we did inhalf of the nation's health insurance data set, no child under age 18 hasbeen found to die of COVID to date that has had no pre-existing condition.That is, we presume now that if not all, nearly all of the 169 deaths inchildren under age 20 to date during the pandemic in the United States wereamong kids with a pre-existing condition. So, this data has implicationsfor what we do, for how we interact. For how we do our schools and toprotect those who are vulnerable. We know now that it's those with pre-existing conditions. Those are the kids where we may need to take extramedication.MACCALLUM: Yes, absolutely. So, you know in that category you need to stayat home, absolutely, to prevent any risk and the same goes with theteachers. If they fall into that category, they should be given a way tostill continue to teach from home.You know, this obviously that there is good news in these numbers when youlook at them, doctor. But the other numbers that are surrounding us rightnow are pretty scary. We are now at 1,300 deaths a day. It's the highestrate that we have seen since May. And I think that a lot of people thoughtthat at the end of the summer this was tapering off. It's clearly not.MAKARY: Well, we are bringing a lot of infection into this resurgence intothe fall and winter and even though we are doing a lot better as doctors inpreserving life. We are taking a lot of infection in. So that's why we havehad a death rate of 1,300 deaths per day on average over the last week.But you know, the question about transmission is the primary question inschools. And in a study of 35,000 kids in North Carolina, there is not asingle case of transmission from child to adult out of 100 infections.Insight for education studied 191 countries looking at the countries thatreopened and found that it did not drive the pandemic or outbreaks anyfurther.And Utah, which has the best data on schools found that any increases oroutbreaks were attributed to teens and that infection was on off campuscongregant settings namely the parties not the classrooms. So, it's prettyclear the classroom is extremely safe and the transmission from kids toadults is minimal.MACCALLUM: So why do you think that's not a message that's getting throughthe leadership at these unions, the teacher's unions or in some of our bigcities like New York.MAKARY: Well, I think the thought is we cannot tolerate a singletransmission or infection, then I think it's there is no way to really havea rational conversation. But if we look at the policies that we do forviral meningitis, bacterial pneumonia, seasonal flu, it turns out thatdeath from COVID is below those things.And if we look at those who are healthy, more kids die from jelly fish thanfrom COVID who are completely healthy. More kids die from eating atoothpick. More kids die from middle school football than from COVID. So, Ithink we need to just have a reasonable conversation when we talk about thealternatives --MACCALLUM: Yes.MAKARY: -- and that is when schools are closed.MACCALLUM: Great point.MAKARY: There is a lot of public health problems.MACCALLUM: Dr. Marty Makary, thank you. Good to see you tonight.Lisa Dubrow is a kindergarten teacher in California with more than threedecades of experience in the classroom. Her school has yet to open itsdoors for in- person learning and there is no timeline for them to do thatany time soon.Lisa, thank you so much for joining us tonight. You sent us some verythoughtful words about how important you think this crisis is for ourchildren in the country. You say that you believe that the government inCalifornia is holding the people hostage in this situation. What do youmean by that?LISA DUBROW, KINDERGARTEN TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA: Thank you for thisopportunity. I have witnessed the government using children to preventadults from returning to their jobs and for our economy to kick back to thelife that we had had before COVID hit.We see all the anxiety built around COVID. We see people fearful for theirfuture financial wellbeing. And on top of that at the height of anxiety weask parents to take on the role of basically teachers in the home viacomputerized learning. That is just a cocktail that's way too far foranyone to imagine, especially for young children. I'm a kindergartenteacher. We are all about the concrete. And the computer isn't veryconcrete.MACCALLUM: So, Lisa, you know, you saw the comments that Randi Weingartenmade. And she represents teachers all across the country. She is concernedabout their health, about the children's health, but you disagree with whatshe is all about in this debate. Why?DUBROW: Correct. Randi Weingarten is a political activist. She has apolitical goal. She and others who are united in their vision for whatAmerica should look like the word transformation. They are using thissituation and others to transform America.MACCALLUM: So, you think that we are becoming too complacent in the rulesand regulations that surround this and that we have become too frightenedabout it? Is that accurate?DUBROW: Actually, my county of 1.6 million people in April under 200 peoplehad died due to COVID. One point six compared to 200 deaths. And thosedeaths were people in their late 60s and 70s. It made no sense that allaround me people were able to go to school or work or the gym but we wereable to go to Costco and we were able to go to the grocery store. It nevermade sense.MACCALLUM: And you say you've seen top level students who are now failingin their schools. That's tragedy.DUBROW: Well, it's tragedy for everyone because top level students, whohave been straight A's students are now giving up. I know parents dealingwith these very depressed children. Young people who haven't been able tobe with their friends, continue their sports are looking at college andjust going how is this going to work?MACCALLUM: Right.DUBROW: Students who are not high achievers are overwhelmed with thedistance, the lack of connection, the social, emotional benefits of beingwith other kids and being with people that care for you and enjoy you,we've lost the positive connection, the relationship to learning.MACCALLUM: Well, like a kindergarten teacher you get right to the heart ofthe matter and it's obvious that you care about these children a lot. LisaDubrow, thank you very much for being here tonight. I do appreciate it.DUBROW: Thank you.MACCALLUM: So, coming up next, Republican Governor Pete Ricketts ofNebraska on his reluctance to mandate mask-wearing in his state. He has adifferent approach and he joins us with that next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: What I failedto mention earlier is the enormous respect I have for Republican,conservative Republican governors who stepped up and issued mandates forwearing masks.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: President-elect Biden has stopped short of calling for anationwide mask mandate. He gets asked about it a lot. But he mayreportedly work to implement one in a roundabout way by persuading the 13Republican governors who have yet to make it mandatory in their state intodoing so.Among them my next guest Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts. Governor, good tohave you with us tonight. Thank you for being here.GOV. PETE RICKETTS (R-NE): My pleasure, Martha. Thanks for having me on.MACCALLUM: So, he is talking clearly about governors like Kim Reynolds inneighboring Iowa who has implemented a mask mandate in the state of Iowa.And you would be on the list of those who haven't done what he would liketo see happen in all of the states. What would you say to him? What's your-- what's your reasoning?RICKETTS: Well, what I would tell the vice president is that every state isdifferent and every state has its own approach to how to manage thepandemic and that's been successful throughout this pandemic. Here inNebraska we have put director health measures in place to slow the spreadof the virus and preserve a hospital capacity.Now we do require wearing masks in businesses where staff and patrons aregoing to be closer than fix feet for 15 minutes or more. But masks bythemselves are not going to be a panacea to stop the pandemic. You know,states like Wisconsin have had a mask mandate since August 1st and yet theysee similar climbs in their cases as we do here in Nebraska.And one of the things we talk about is that Swiss cheese approach where youlayer on the protections. We ask people to wear masks but we also ask themto stay six feet apart to wash their hands, to go to the store bythemselves, to stay home when they are sick. Work from home if you can. Allthese things together are what's going to slow the spread of the virus. Asingle thing like a mask is not going to do it just by itself.MACCALLUM: Yes, I think a lot of people have these questions because inmany cases they have been wearing the mask and then they got COVID anyway.And they are trying to figure out if compliance on that front is helpingthem although, you know, the White House and the CDC have been unanimous onthis. Here's what they continue to say, watch this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION:Masks work. Social distancing works. Hand washing works.UNKNOWN: We know masks works but we know that some Americans aren't sureand may not be as compliant as we'd like.MICHAEL PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Wash yourhands, practice social distancing. Wear a mask when social distancing isn'tpossible.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM: So, they are obviously recommending the kind of layering thatyou talked about. You had you an incident, you know, the governor ofCalifornia had an incident. It seems like you know when you run a state youare going to run into this situation where you were in a restaurant,somebody yelled at you. You didn't have your mask on. What do you want tosay about that moment and whether or not you were setting the example thatyou want to set?RICKETTS: Well, for example, in Nebraska, when you are sitting down in arestaurant you are not required to wear a mask. And in the case inparticular that was videoed. The family had called me over to take apicture. And I asked do you want the mask on or mask off? And, you know,kind of followed the guidelines of whatever the people are comfortablewith.And I think, again, this gets back to masks will help slow the spread ofthe virus but it's really, as some of the videos you just said if youcan't, you know, social distance or if you are going to be closer tosomebody for 15 minutes or more. So, typically when I take my mask off it'snot for that 15 minutes, it's for a short period of time while we take apicture.And so that really gets back to, you know, we have to think about thesethings as tools we use to be able to slow the spread of the virus. That onesingle thing like masks are not going to be a panacea to solve our problemson this.We have to layer these things together such as you described in yourvideos, with, you know, keeping that six-foot of distance, washing yourhands, staying home when you are sick. Go to the store once a week byyourself. You know, all these sorts sort of things will help us slow downthe spread of the virus. One thing by itself is not.MACCALLUM: So, you have had very big spike in Nebraska over the past coupleof weeks and an increase in deaths over the last couple of weeks. You areup to 877 which is a lot lower than many states across the country butstill obviously any life is too many to lose to this. What are you tellingpeople in Nebraska as we head into Thanksgiving week with regard to theseregulations that are being recommended?RICKETTS: Yes, we started actually strengthening our DHMs, our directivehealth measures starting October 15th. And one of the things we are tellingpeople for the Thanksgiving holiday is really rethink your plans withregard to those family get-togethers.You know, my family usually has a huge get together with, you know, 80people or something like that. But you we are all doing individual familygroups this year. Doing smaller groups is going to be better because at theend of the day this virus spreads from one person to another. Large groupsallow the virus to spread more. So we are asking people to be thoughtfulabout their Thanksgiving plans and really look to have those smaller groupgatherings.MACCALLUM: All right. Sounds like good advice. Thank you very much,governor. Good to see you tonight.RICKETTS: Thanks a lot, Martha. I appreciate it. Have a good one.MACCALLUM (on camera): You bet. Good to see you.So, after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month, HUD SecretaryDr. Ben Carson has just given an update on his condition writing onFacebook that he was, quote, "desperately ill at one point and that themonoclonal antibody therapy saved his life." He says he is now out of thewoods and we wish him well tonight.And next, former President Obama with this quip when asked if the presidentwill not concede the election?(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Well, Ithink we can always send the Navy SEALS in there to dig him out.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (voice over): Fox & Friends weekend co-host Pete Hegseth joins meon that and his new book that celebrates America's modern warriors. He'snext.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MACCALLUM (voice over): Former president Barack Obama taking some playfuljabs at his successor as President Trump holds out on concession.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JIMMY KIMMEL, COMEDIAN: You know the White House well. You lived there foreight years. Are there places someone could hide like if, say, they weregoing to be removed? Are there little cubby holes or anything we shouldknow about?OBAMA: Well, I think we can always send the Navy SEALS in there to dig himout.(END VIDEO CLIP)MACCALLUM (on camera): Joining me now Pete Hegseth, Fox & Friends weekendco-host and author of the new book out on Tuesday "Modern Warriors: RealStories, Real Heroes." Based on his program and there are just awesomestories in there. So, Pete, great to see you tonight. Thanks for beinghere.PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS HOST: Great to see you, Martha. Thank you for havingme. I appreciate it.MACCALLUM: It's our pleasure. Good to have you. So what do you -- what'syour response to the sort of joking about whether or not the president willvoluntarily leave and be out in time for a January 20th inauguration?HEGSETH: Yes, it's all part of the narrative that they want to push. Ofcourse, the least interesting interview in America is Jimmy Kimmel andBarack Obama. Do you hate Donald Trump more or I do hate Donald Trump more?You know exactly what you are getting there. And it's not interesting.And I guess the Navy SEALS would have been -- liked to have been unleashedin 2015 and 2016 to take down the caliphate and ISIS but they weren't.Donald Trump had to do that.But ultimately, this is part of the mythology that they are trying to pushon the left which is that ultimately Donald Trump or whoever does not winwould not ultimately concede. And what the president has said time and timeagain is, let's get all the legal votes counted, see where it lands, andthen ultimately there will be a peaceful transfer of power.But, until that happens, talking about sending in the Navy SEALS is justperpetuating one side of the narrative. And the president's team has everyright in the world after what's been done to him for four years to spendtwo weeks, four weeks, six weeks looking into everything at a micro level,at a macrolevel to determine whether or not this vote was actually fair.I do not believe we have a president-elect at this moment. I think we willdetermine that based on what the electors say but based on what legal teamsfind and legal challenges find. At that time there will be a transfer. But,until then, all of this is meant to feed the narrative that Donald Trump isstill illegitimate here four years later which is what the left has alwayssaid and always wanted.MACCALLUM: That sound bite was interesting from President Obama talkingabout the increase in black and Latino vote and black vote in particular inthis comment. It's a quote, actually. Let's put it up on the screen and wewill take a look at it.It says people are writing about the fact that Trump increased his supportamong black men and the occasional rapper who supported Trump. I have toremind myself that if you listen to rap music it's all about the bling, thewomen, the money. A lot of rap videos are using the same measures of whatit means to be successful as Donald Trump is everything is gold-plated thatinsinuates itself and seeps into the culture.What do you think about that, Pete?HEGSETH: Am I missing something, Martha? Wasn't it Jay-Z that made a coupleof trips to the White House and I don't know if you've checked Jay-Z'slyrics recently but there is plenty of bling and women and money in hislyrics. So, does it only go one way? I'm not sure.The reality is they are dismissing the fact that President Trump took veryseriously the black vote, did not take it for granted and said I'minvesting in you in meaningful ways, criminal justice reform, historicallyblack colleges, unemployment rates. Seriously saying I don't take you as anovelty. I want to address your concerns and be serious about it.And he awoken in amongst black men, black women and others the idea asCandace Owens says we are not victims, we can be victors. And this countryenables us to be successful just like anybody else. And I don't buy intothe victim mentality, that's a powerful thing that can be dismissed byBarack Obama or the left. But ultimately, it's a product of a veryintentional outreach that the president has made, which is good on him fordoing.MACCALLUM: I think it's an insulting statement to those performers really.HEGSETH: Of course.MACCALLUM: Because it belittles the issues that they brought up. You know?They brought up taxes. They brought up abortion. Kanye West brought upabortion. It's the things that they really cared about.HEGSETH: Very true.MACCALLUM: That they felt resonated. So I find it kind of an insultingcomment. But Pete, thank you. And I really suggest everybody check out"Modern Warriors" and the Fox Nation patriot awards that are coming up thatyou are hosting.HEGSETH: Yes.MACCALLUM: It's just such a great job. So, thanks for being here tonight.Good to see you.HEGSETH: Thank you, Martha. I appreciate it.MACCALLUM: You bet. So now we have an important tribute to read to youNovember 23rd, 1943.
