Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. I do not get the president. He represents all of us, the entire nation, and we the American people. We need to hear from him.
There is so much going on. There is Ebola, ISIS, jobs, you name it. And while I know this is campaign season, President Obama still needs to talk to all of us. Right now, it looks like you either have to pay to hear from him by attending a pricey Democratic fundraiser or you have to be one of his pals. He did Al Sharpton's radio show yesterday. But President Obama is not or will not talk to the American people, all of them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
It's easy for him to do it. He only needs to announce, "I'm having a press conference," and the White House Press will immediately show up and ask questions for the American people. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So yes, the president can do campaigning for the mid-terms. But he can also do his job, talk to everyone, not just a select few. We want to hear from you, Mr. President. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
