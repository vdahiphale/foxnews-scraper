TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.  
Rudy Giuliani and a number of the President's other lawyers held a press conference today on the topic of voter fraud. If you didn't actually see it, you've probably heard about it by now.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Giuliani along with a former Federal prosecutor called Sidney Powell and a number of others allege that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. To demonstrate that, they exhibited some of what they found after two weeks of investigating.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The presentation went on for 90 minutes with many different threads, which we will tell you about in a moment. How you viewed it dependent largely on who you voted for.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Trump voters seemed hopeful that it might change the election results. The left and virtually every single person in all of the news media immediately dismissed it as an embarrassing clown show, as well as a threat to the Republic. The very same people who swore that Vladimir Putin's agents controlled the U.S. government called it a conspiracy theory. Of course, we will have more on that in a minute.  
But first and more important, there is another way to look at what we saw this afternoon, and you don't have to be a partisan or even interested in the election to understand it.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A lot of Americans believe this election was rigged. They're not saying that because they are crazy. They're not just saying it because they're mad. They mean it. And that's a potentially fatal problem for this country.  
Elections aren't merely quote, "central to democracy." Elections are democracy. Voting is the way the public expresses its will. It's all people have.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If elections don't work, our entire system doesn't work. Everything in this country depends on fair elections, and it is obvious even now that we don't have them.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb3', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban4', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
When access to basic information is restricted and weaponized by a partisan billionaire class, and it is, you can't have a fair election. By definition, it is not possible.  
Google and Facebook are far greater threats to our system than Russia has ever been and we need to fix that immediately.  
In the meantime, though, the voting itself -- which was the topic of today's press conference -- let's assess what the President's lawyer said about it today.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb5', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban5', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Their allegations matter regardless of what the eventual outcome is. Rudy Giuliani began by saying the Democrats stole the election and they did it with a coordinated fraud in a number of states.  
Giuliani did not conclusively prove that as every newsreader on television promptly informed you, but he did raise legitimate questions and in some cases, he pointed to what appeared to be real wrongdoing.  
At one point, Giuliani held up an affidavit from a worker from the City of Detroit called Jessy Jacob. The affidavit alleges fraud in Detroit's polling places. Here's part of Giuliani's explanation.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban6', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb4', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb6', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY:  She was assigned to voting duties in September, and she was trained by the City of Detroit, in the State of Michigan. She was basically trained to cheat.  
She said that, "I was instructed by my supervisor to adjust the mailing date of these absentee ballot packages to be dated earlier than when they were actually sent in. The supervisor made that announcement for all workers to engage in that fraudulent practice." That's not me saying that.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban7', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's just American citizens saying that, under oath.  
(END VIDEO CLIP)   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb7', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
CARLSON:  The City of Detroit has denied that specific allegation, surprisingly or not. But what Rudy Giuliani said is correct. This is the sworn statement of an American citizen, apparently, an eye witness to it, made under oath under the penalty of perjury, so you cannot dismiss it out of hand.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban8', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Jacob goes on to say that her supervisor told her not to check the photo IDs of voters when they arrived. She says she saw city employees coaching voters on who to vote for as well as voters voting more than once.  
Is any of that provable? Is it true? Well, we should find out and not because Michigan is a swing state. Voter fraud is a direct attack on our democracy. But the media don't want to know. They are not interested.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb5', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb5', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If you watched the coverage after the press conference then you saw credentialed reporters, some of whom we know and like actually refused even to acknowledge it. No mention whatsoever of the contents of what they described as quote, "What he says are sworn affidavits."   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb8', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban9', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
What he says? Well, why don't you check? Giuliani says that this affidavit from Detroit has been made public, but they can't be bothered to check. 
Instead, they launched into editorials about how dishonest and crazy Rudy Giuliani is, as if their job was to rebut Rudy Giuliani.  
But that's not their job. Their job is to explain what just happened, preferably with some detail so that viewers at home can make up their minds. They didn't do that.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban10', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Behavior like this does not help anyone. It diminishes the news media's tiny remaining reserve of credibility. It certainly doesn't inform the public.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb9', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb9', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
On somes, of course, informing the public is last on the list of concerns. 
Watch one of the most reckless people on television go back to the Putin well and accused Giuliani yet again, of being a puppet of Russia.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb6', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb6', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban11', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST:  A quick reminder, Rudy Giuliani now at the helm of Donald Trump's election delegitimization effort was singled out by U.S. Intelligence agencies last year as the target of a likely Russian disinformation effort.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb10', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And earlier today, he held a wild news conference filled with falsehoods on voter fraud.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban12', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

CARLSON:  Russian disinformation. Sometimes you wonder if there's anything the Democrats don't like in America from acid reflux to termite damage that they won't blame on Russia.  
At some point, maybe five years from now, we all wake up from this stupor, a lot of people are going to be deeply embarrassed by a tape like that, so be sure to save it.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb11', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban13', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
In fact, there was nothing Russian about a lot of what Giuliani said today.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb7', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb7', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
He claimed that voters in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were allowed to change their ballots after the fact, cure the ballots, as it is known, by the Democratic Secretary of State and Republican counties were not.  
That's checkable. He said dozens of Republican voting inspectors of Pennsylvania weren't allowed near mail-in ballots and have signed affidavits saying so. That's another concrete checkable claim.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban14', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Giuliani said that mail-in votes are easier to falsify and harder to verify than traditional voting is. That's clearly true. Everyone knows it's true, and it's a major problem. Pretending otherwise is a lie.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb12', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And then Giuliani got to the way votes are counted.  
In this country, the process is mostly electronic. Giuliani suggested that electronic vote counting is an invitation to fraud, and he is right. That's why Canada for example, doesn't do it.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban15', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All of which brings us to the bombshell at the center of today's press conference that was delivered by former prosecutor Sidney Powell, who also serves as General Mike Flynn's lawyer.  
For more than a week, Powell has been all over conservative media with the following story. This election was stolen by a collection of international leftists who manipulated vote tabulating software in order to flip millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb8', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb8', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb13', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The other day on television, Powell said of Trump that when the fraud is finally uncovered, quote, "I think we'll find he had at least 80 million votes." In other words, rigged software stole about seven million votes in this election. Here's some of what Powell said today about the software.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban16', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  
SIDNEY POWELL, MEMBER OF TRUMP LEGAL TEAM:  One of its most characteristic features is its ability to flip votes. It can set and run an algorithm that probably ran all over the country to take a certain percentage of votes from President Trump and flipped them to President Biden, which we might never have uncovered had the votes for President Trump not been so overwhelming in so many of these states that it broke the algorithm that had been plugged into the system.  
And that's what caused them to have to shut down in the states they shut down in.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb14', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {

CARLSON:  That was a few hours ago. But Sidney Powell has been saying similar things for days. On Sunday night, we texted her after watching one of her segments. What Powell was describing would amount to the single greatest crime in American history. Millions of votes stolen in a day. 
Democracy destroyed. The end of our centuries' old system of self- government, not a small thing.

            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban18', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban18', '');

Now to be perfectly clear, we did not dismiss any of it. We don't dismiss anything anymore, particularly when it's related to technology. We've talked to too many Silicon Valley whistleblowers. We've seen too much.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb15', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb15', '');
          });

        }
      
After four years, this may be the single most open-minded show on television. We literally do UFO segments, not because we're crazy or even been interested in the subject, but because there is evidence that UFOs are real, and everyone lies about it.  
There's evidence that a lot of things that responsible people used to dismiss out of hand is ridiculous, are in fact real, and we don't care who mocks it. The louder the Yale Political Science Department and the staff of "The Atlantic" magazine scream conspiracy theory, the more interested we tend to be. That's usually a sign you're over the target.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban19', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
A lot of people with impressive sounding credentials in this country are frauds. They have no idea what they're doing. They are children posing as authorities and when they are caught, they lie and then they blame you for it.  
We see that every day. It's the central theme of this show and will continue to be.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb16', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So that's a long way of saying we took Sidney Powell seriously. We have no intention of fighting with her. We've always respected her work. We simply wanted to see the details. How could you not want to see them?   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban20', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So we invited Sidney Powell on the show. We would have given her the whole hour. We would have given her the entire week actually and listened quietly the whole time at rapt attention. That's a big story.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb10', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb10', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
But she never sent us any evidence, despite a lot of requests, polite requests, not a page. When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her.  
When we checked with others around the Trump Campaign, people in positions of authority they told us, Powell has never given them any evidence either nor did she provide any today at the press conference.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb17', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Powell did say that electronic voting is dangerous and she is right, we are with her there. But she never demonstrated that a single actual vote was moved illegitimately by software from one candidate to another, not one.  
Why are we telling you this? We're telling you this, because it's true. And in the end, that's all that matters -- the truth. It's our only hope. It's our best defense. And it is how we are different from them. We care what's true, and we know you care, too. That's why we told you.  
Maybe Sidney Powell will come forward soon with details on exactly how this happened, and precisely who did it. Maybe she will. We are certainly hopeful that she will.  
What happened with the vote counting this month and at the polling places in Detroit and the polling places in Philadelphia, and so much else actually matters. It matters no matter who you voted for, it matters whether or not you think this election is already over.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb18', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb18', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Until we know the answers to those questions conclusively, and we can agree on them, this country will not be united.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb11', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb11', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Greg Gutfeld is the host of "The Greg Gutfeld Show" and we're happy to have him on tonight. Weirdly incurious media today about some of these allegations.  
GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST, THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW:  Yes.  
CARLSON:  Some of them weren't proven, that's true. Some of them seem like pretty good leads. Why is no one following up?   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb19', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb19', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD:  Yes, in fact, even if this stuff washes out, I don't see the problem in actually letting the process unfold. I mean, we were kind of at the mercy of a four-year process and we were pretty patient.  
So if you -- if we gave you four years to undermine the democracy, i.e. an elected President, maybe give us four weeks, and I think that's what this story is really about for the voters.  
It's not just about voter fraud. It's about the trust in a system that was undermined by the Democrats and the media for four years. They had the collusion hoax that they basically pummeled us with every day, then they damned the candidate as like a version of Darth Vader and Hitler combined into one package.  
And we forget, like they sowed suspicion that he would manipulate the election using the Postal Service, which of course, that kind of just disappeared.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb12', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb12', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
       
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb20', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb20', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So no matter what, people have a right. This is what bugs me, people have a right to be suspicious right now because they've been treated like crap for four years.  
So don't ridicule the viewer. Don't look down upon them because you think that this is absurd, and stupid, all right, because you've got to get in their shoes first and realize that they thought what you were doing for four years was a damn waste of their time that you made their lives miserable.  
And so you know what, I'm small enough to admit that I want to make your life miserable for a couple of weeks, just a couple of weeks. That's all. 
Let's do this. See how it goes?   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb21', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb21', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Because this by friends, was a different election. This wasn't Bush-Gore. 
This wasn't Romney-Obama. This wasn't even Reagan and that other guy. It wasn't Democrats versus Republicans.  
This was a movement versus a resistance to a movement. And what was part of that resistance? You had media, you had tech platforms, you had the entertainment industry, you had the elite class, academia. They were all working together as part of a resistance against a movement, against 70 plus million people. And you think that maybe we might think you'd throw an election? Because you hate this guy so much.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb13', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb13', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
You think he is Hitler. Hell, you -- we got rid of Gaddafi for less because we think Trump is worse than Hitler. Why wouldn't we?  
I mean, my God, we've undermined elections in other countries for less. So why can't we be a little skeptical?  
And the fact is, everybody hated this guy for four years. Why wouldn't they do it? So that's my thing.  
You know? No, you nailed it. Right? It's almost kind of right now, let's see how this process goes. Let's see what the evidence is. But I'm not going to take anybody seriously about being impatient over this. What's the rush?  
CARLSON:  Well, let me ask you a question, since you're in the media. Why wouldn't people who are smart enough to have paying jobs in the news media
-- not that it takes a super high IQ or anything -- but why wouldn't they understand that the center of their job is credibility?  
So if you think the country is too volatile, I think all of us do think that. I certainly think that it is way too volatile. It's unhealthy. Why wouldn't you do all you can to assuage people's fears by giving them facts as credibly as you possibly could. I don't see anybody trying to do that.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb14', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb14', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
GUTFELD:  No, I guess, maybe they feel they don't have to because they all are -- instead of speaking truth to power, they are speaking truth to the bubble. It's not like their peers are expecting them to do it.  
Now, the viewers would expect you to do it, like, you know, maybe do a special on what is election fraud? Does it exist? Where has it happened before? And what can we look forward to in the future if we have mail-in ballots or electronic ballots? That's something that, you know, reporters and investigators, investigative journalists could do.  
But no one is putting any -- they are going to go into hibernation again, Tucker for four years. They did a lot of work writing those Trump jokes. 
And now, they don't want to do the work. All they want to do is say, hey, come on, it's Joe. Everything is going to be fine.  
CARLSON:  Totally.  
GUTFELD:  You know, now I can finally get to sleep. No more Trump tweets. I can finally sleep. Never mind that there are no body bags coming home from foreign wars. We had a tremendous economy, low unemployment.  
He created -- invented the moonshot for vaccines, which years from now will be looked back upon, as probably one of the biggest modern achievements.  
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb15', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb15', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
All things are happening. But that's all canceled out because I was up at night, you know, anxious over these tweets.  
So that's where we are. The media allowed Trump to get to them emotionally. 
And I'm saying that as part of the media. I let him get to me emotionally early on when he was running.  
I was like, I couldn't believe this guy. And then I learned to separate the deeds from the words. And once you do that, you see something pretty special, a phenomenon.  
CARLSON:  I think that's right. Greg Gutfeld. Great to see you. Thank you for that.  
GUTFELD:  Great to see you, Tucker.  
CARLSON:  So all this stuff is going on and behind it, a lot of other things are going on. They are not covered at all. For example, Joe Biden has been making some high level hires that could change the way we enforce the law for a long time.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb16', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb16', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Can you walk to the end of your block without fearing getting killed? That hangs in the balance?  
Heather Mac Donald is here to explain how Police Departments should respond, next.  
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  
CARLSON:  You don't hear too much about Minneapolis anymore. That's kind of weird. Just a few months ago, it felt like every reporter in the country was there with the story of the century.  
A man called George Ford, a convicted felon, had died and the world's Fortune 500 companies collectively found a culprit. It wasn't the fatal levels of fentanyl in his system with a blocked artery. It was systemic racism.  
So naturally, Minneapolis burned for days. Democrats called for defunding the police. Then the media moved on.  
Now, we know why they moved on and have never really returned. Defunding the police has been a disaster for every person in Minneapolis.   
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb17', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb17', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
According to the Minneapolis Police Office, 100 cops have already left the force this year. That's more than double the usual number. Meanwhile, murders in Minneapolis are up 50 percent, 500 people have been shot in Minneapolis so far in 2020. That's the highest number in a decade.  
Those numbers tell you a lot of things including why Democrats lost House seats across the country and particularly in Western Minnesota along with six State Senate races there.  
People want security, it turns out. They want it above all and they will vote for any political party they think will provide it. That's why Richard Nixon won the single biggest landslide in American history in 1972, forty nine states. It wasn't because of his personality.  
Nixon one because he promised what his opponent refused to promise: law and order. Not repression, not fascism, law and order. Simple concepts upon which all human civilization is built.  
Local politicians in Minneapolis didn't understand that concept. It was too sophisticated for them. So this summer, we retreated to interviews like this one, which feels more like performance art that was accidentally somehow broadcast on television. Watch this.

ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR:  Do you understand that the word dismantle or police free also makes some people nervous. For instance, what if in the middle of the night, my home is broken into. Who do I call?

LISA BENDER, PRESIDENT, MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL:  Yes, I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors. And I know -- and myself, too -- and I know that that comes from a place of privilege because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality, where calling the police may mean more harm is done.  
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
CARLSON:  So only people with a certain sort of frivolous, overpriced education talk that way, as you well know. But more to the point, as a practical matter, if you want people to flee your city, that's exactly what you say.  
We know that for certain 50 years ago, half of Brooklyn moved to Long Island within a year. Why? Because crime rose, so normal people split. 
Crime is the only thing -- not global warming, not systemic racism, not any other problem we may face -- it's the only thing that will make people leave the neighborhoods they grew up in, the neighborhoods they raise their children in, where their friends are, their churches are. They'll leave if their lives are threatened. Period.  
And normal people are leaving. It's happening again all over New York.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  First came the pandemic and hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers reportedly fled the city temporarily. Now, even more are leaving, this time permanently, saying they don't feel safe in the city anymore.  
Hairstylist Jodie Usher says she was harassed twice on her commute, so she moved her Family to Florida.  
Others are following amid spikes in gun violence. Shootings up 177 percent this July compared to last July.  
Then public displays of junkies shooting up in Midtown. People who work in the area say they called police, but their calls went unanswered.  
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
CARLSON:  Yes, I wonder why people are leaving. Maybe it's the tax rates, right? No, it's the junkies and the muggers. That's the one thing people will not put up with.  
So if you watched that video, you might conclude the Democratic Party is inept. They don't understand their job is to keep citizens safe. But it's not just them. We hate to tell you this, but it's true.

On Monday, the Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, admitted to his party, too, has no idea what's going on in this country. None. Here's what McCarthy wrote in a tweet, quote, "Twelve Democrat incumbents lost their re-election to the House. Every one of them lost to a Republican woman, minority and/or veteran. The Republican Party is stronger because of our diversity." End quote.  
Not against diversity, but we need to find the person who decided that tweet was a good idea and fire him immediately. If the Republican Party becomes the party of identity, any identity, that party will fail and it will deserve to fail.  
The Republican Party at its core exists to defend the founding promise: 
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And order is a prerequisite for all of those things.  
The Republicans that Kevin McCarthy was talking about who won because of their diversity, their great strength, they understood that.  
Carlos Gimenez picked up a seat in Florida. That's how. Michelle Steel, we talked to yesterday managed to win in California. That's how. She beat an incumbent by the way. It's how Nicole Malliotakis flipped a blue district in New York. She marched with police officers when Democrats abandoned the police. This is not complicated.  
In the State of Indiana, Victoria Sparks defeated her opponent the very same way, running ads like this one.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Liberal Christina Hale stands with radicals that want fewer cops on our streets. Hale is bankrolled by groups who want to defund our police. She even marched with dangerous extremists.  
How did Hale describe their radical anti-police agenda? Productive.  
Christina Hale. Too liberal, too extreme. She won't keep us safe.  
(END VIDEO CLIP)  
CARLSON:  What's the last line of that spot? She won't keep us safe. Done. 
It's done.  
If someone is not going to keep you safe, it doesn't matter if it's your dad or your congressman. You're not for that person. It's super simple. 
This is Human Nature 101.  
And by the way, they're not keeping you safe. They're working against your safety. Oregon just decriminalized heroin in the middle of an opioid epidemic. Ha? George Soros is funding district attorneys who refuse to enforce the law and punish people who try to protect themselves.  
What is the Republican Party doing about this? Not a lot. They're busy tweeting about the chromosomes of their newest members.  
Two of Joe Biden's picks for senior White House roles are in favor of something called mandatory gun buybacks. What's that? Well, it is gun confiscation. Gun confiscation at a time when people are buying guns in ever larger numbers, historic numbers. Why? Because they love guns. They're crazy. No. Because they're afraid.  
And they're trying to take them away. They're letting gun criminals out of jail. But planning to disarm law-abiding Americans. Chew on that for an afternoon and see what you conclude.  
Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, for example, said last year that she wants to confiscate quote, "15 or 16 million firearms." Another incoming White House adviser, Cedric Richmond, uttered one of the most chilling quotes you'll ever hear from a politician. And we're quoting, "If it's a mandatory buyback, I think that you may run into some complications, but it sounds like something I could support." Gun confiscation? Okay.  
And by some complications, you mean, of course that some law-abiding gun owners might get shot. But at the end of the day, Cedric Richmond can live with that.  
Who is allowing this to go unchecked? Gun criminals are getting out of jail. Democrats are letting them out. On the other side of their mouth, they are telling you they're worried about gun violence and you who have never committed a crime must give your gun, which you use to defend yourself from the people they're letting out of jail for gun crimes in order to reduce gun violence. This is insane. And almost no Republicans understand it.  
The Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis understands it. It is one of the reasons people are moving to Florida. DeSantis is now pushing legislation that allows store owners to shoot looters.  
It would also make it a felony to block traffic during a protest. So let's say ambulances could get by. Remember ambulances? Yes, they were one of the many casualties of BLM this year.  
If the Republican Party wants to keep existing, it needs that kind of legislation. Tweets like the one we read, we don't want to be mean, but that doesn't keep us safe. Our constitutional rights keep us safe. And if DeSantis keeps talking like this, he has got a future.  
In the meantime, Heather Mac Donald has thought more about the subject than maybe anyone in America. She's a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. We're happy to have her on tonight.  
Heather, thanks a lot for coming on. Give us without scaring us too much, give us some sort of sense of what might be coming from the pro-crime left.  
HEATHER MAC DONALD, FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE:  Well, the Biden criminal justice plan, Tucker, reads like a Black Lives Matter wish list. Among its most notable features, it's going to revive the Obama-era practice of slapping crippling costly Consent Decrees on Police Departments without any credible evidence that they're engaged in Civil Rights violations.  
It's going to expand the Obama-era practice of Consent Decrees by going after prosecutorial offices if they actually prosecute crime. What's the agenda here? In Biden's own words, it's to eliminate so-called racial disparities in the law enforcement system.  
Well, sadly, the only way you can eliminate racial disparities in law enforcement is to eliminate law enforcement itself. The police cannot go where people are most being victimized by mindless drive-by shootings and homicides without having a disparate impact.  
Blacks die of homicide in this country between the ages of 10 and 43 at 13 times the rate of whites. That's a disparity that you would think Black Lives Matter activists and Biden and Kamala Harris would care about. They don't say a word about it.  
Why do blacks die of homicide at 13 times the rate of whites? They're not being killed by the cops. They're not being killed by whites, they're being killed by other blacks. Blacks' homicide commission rates are equally disparate.  
Now, the ultimate solution to that is to rebuild the black family, but short of that, we need the police, and when the police back off as you've seen, as you've brought up in Minneapolis and across the country, crime is going up. It's spreading.  
Republicans have to start telling the truth about crime and above all, Police Chiefs have to because this narrative that policing is racist merely by going after criminals is going to send this country into an anarchy that is going to be very hard to pull back from.  
CARLSON:  I couldn't agree more. Defund the police is the most decadent slogan I've ever heard and I've heard a lot. Heather Mac Donald, we will see you again. Thanks for coming tonight.  
MAC DONALD:  Thanks, Tucker.  
CARLSON:  Big news out of Martha's Vineyard this week, a well-known Netflix producer called Barack Obama sat in the studio and talked about himself for
29 hours straight, possibly a world record.  
Adam Carolla didn't listen to all of it, but he has thought through what you could do with 29 hours and he'll tell us after the break.  
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  
CARLSON:  Well, political intolerance is now the rule in schools, but some examples of it still manage to get our attention and shock us a little bit. 
Rick Leventhal has one for us tonight. Hey, Rick.  
RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Tucker. La Jolla Country Day, one of the most prestigious private schools in the San Diego area. Tuition is almost 17 grand for first grade up to 37,000 for high school.  
Students are allowed to wear hats on campus and there are no rules against political attire in the Parent-Student Handbook, but Make America Great Again hats, not okay.  
The Head of School Dr. Gary Krahn sent an e-mail to all parents to let them know there would be no on campus classes the week after Thanksgiving. And then he added, "We also had a student wear a MAGA hat today. I have talked with that student who now understands why that hat is offensive to our community. He will not wear it again."  
In addition, " ... his mom said that she was embarrassed by his actions. 
She will fulfill her role as a parent. We will continue to grow as a community that sees and values the dignity of all people."  
So I called Dr. Krahn and asked him about why he thinks that hat is offensive to his community? In what way it violates school policy? And why an e-mail to all parents was necessary? He didn't pick up. I left a message. And Tucker, I haven't heard back from him yet.  
CARLSON:  Amazing. This was not a setup. I actually didn't see that story coming. I've been writing all afternoon. I actually went to that school, La Jolla Country Day and it was less expensive and more tolerant when I was a little kid there. Sad.  
LEVENTHAL:  Yes?  
CARLSON:  Sad to hear it. Rick Leventhal, thanks so much.  
LEVENTHAL:  News we didn't know before.  
CARLSON:  And I didn't know it either. Amazing.  
Well, if you had a few days of uninterrupted free time to do literally whatever you wanted, how would you spend it? We're not life coaches. We're just talk show hosts. But we do have a humble suggestion.  
You might want to consider listening to Barack Obama talk about himself in his second autobiography for 29 hours straight. That sounds a little crazy. 
But listen to this sample from this new audio book, and try to ask yourself, are you not irresistibly attracted to that idea? Here it is.  
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)  
BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  She generally avoided talking to me about the horserace aspects of the campaign, which is why I was surprised when in bed later that night, she turned to me and said, "You're going to win, aren't you?" "A lot can still happen. But yes, there's a pretty good chance I will."  
I looked at my wife. Her face was pensive as if she were working out a puzzle in her mind. Finally, she nodded to herself and returned my gaze. 
"You're going to win," she said softly. She kissed me on the cheek, turned off the bedside lamp and pulled the covers over her shoulders.  
(END AUDIO CLIP)  
CARLSON:  Wasn't he supposed to be a great writer? Well, they always tell you, he is a great writer. Really? Too many adverbs. Too stilted. Reads like a PG-13 version of a Stacey Abrams soft core novel, which we strongly prefer.  
Adam Carolla is the host of "The Adam Carolla Show." He has some ideas about how you might spend 29 hours for free time. He joins us tonight. Hey, Adam, how would you spend 29 hours? Not that you ever have it?  
ADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN AND AUTHOR:  Well, first off, let me tell you how big this book is. I downloaded it today and my phone got heavier.  
CARLSON:  Just on the ones and zeros? That's crazy.  
CAROLLA:  Yes. Yes. I think it's 19 bucks at Amazon, but shipping is $1,700.00.  
CARLSON:  What? Look, he is not that much older than either one of us. He was President. I'll give him that, for two terms. That's great.  
But two autobiographies before you're 60? I think we can say he doesn't have a self-esteem problem.  
CAROLLA:  No, you know, as I was sort of thinking about this subject, I thought it's interesting. So our current President, everyone accuses of being an insane narcissist. Everyone thinks he's an egomaniac narcissist.  
But the reality is, is Obama is a bigger narcissist than Trump. Trump comes in a narcissist package. Trump comes in at narcissist package you can see from outer space. And Obama is kind of like a stealth fighter jet. But he's much more of a narcissist than Trump is.  
And I know a lot of people would go, how's that possible? It is. I believe that if you took those guys and you squeezed them, and you got every drop of narcissism out of them, that Obama's beaker would be much more full of narcissism than Trump's.  
CARLSON:  It is a disgusting image. It's interesting, though. I mean, I wonder in the 29 hours, does he acknowledge that his mismanagement division that he caused within the country over eight years, pave the way for Trump. 
Does he ever take credit for that, I wonder?  
CAROLLA:  I don't know. I was only able to listen to the first 17 hours on the toilet this morning. So I haven't gotten to the rest of the book.  
CARLSON:  Okay. Are you clearing your schedule out?  
CAROLLA:  Yes, I am. The thing about Obama is nobody is better at saying nothing than Obama. If there was a Hall of Fame for people that delivered no message, but in a fantastic package, I think that's Obama.  
CARLSON:  I think that's right. But there was anger at the center of that. 
I think we're just starting to figure out Obama. It's taken a while. He's not stupid, I will say that.  
Adam Carolla, great to see you. Thank you.  
CAROLLA:  Thanks, Tucker.  
CARLSON:  So kind of an amazing story. New York City shocked everyone including the Governor of New York apparently by shutting down all public schools this week. Now, no one was happy about that except for the teachers unions. They planned it.  
No work, full pay. We'll tell you how they did it, just ahead.  
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  
CARLSON:  So New York City, the largest school district in the country shut down its schools this week with less than 24 hours' notice. They did that even though New York Public Schools have tested over 140,000 students and staff and as of Monday, they had a positive rate of 0.2 percent.  
This is a bizarre story that affects a huge amount of people in the worst way. So what's going on here? Why did they do it?  
Well, it turns out, teachers unions engineered it and they're not just doing that in New York. Libby Emmons has been on top of this story. She's a senior editor at the "Post Millennial" and she joins us now to explain.  
Libby, thanks for coming on. This is one of those stories that hasn't gotten enough attention, but it really hurts people. Please tell us how would happen.  
LIBBY EMMONS, SENIOR EDITOR, "POST MILLENNIAL":  So yes, so in New York City, they shut down the schools with less than 24 hours' notice. And I had to tell my kid that he couldn't go to school the next day. He'd only been going to school two days a week anyway.  
And when I told him, he was just like this -- you know, this really sucks.  
What's going on basically, though, is that the powerful teachers unions in this country are holding our kids' education hostage to their special interest. And they are demanding $175 billion for everything from raises to social justice curriculum and they're refusing to go back to work.  
CARLSON:  In New York, the teachers union apparently just endorsed the Black Lives Matter platform, including dismantling the nuclear family. It's all so perverse and sick and dark. It's hard to think this can continue.  
I mean, I've got to ask you a macro question. A couple years ago, affluent liberals seemed to decide after they were waiting for the "Superman" movie that came out that they were skeptical of teachers unions, and that they were going to reduce their power. Whatever happened to that? They don't seem less powerful.  
EMMONS:  I don't think they're actually interested in reducing their power. 
And in fact, affluent liberals' kids are in school. The private schools are open. The daycares are open.  
The public schools are closed and the difference is the teachers unions. 
And now that we have, you know, Biden and Kamala Harris who are looking to take over the White House, the teachers unions are coming to collect. They have endorsed Biden for a long time and they released their list of demands today. They call it a playbook.  
But what it really has is a bunch of money that's being demanded from the Federal government, a bunch of oversight for curriculum, and all kinds of other things that they want to enforce at local levels to deny parents control. They want to take away charter schools. They want to take away private schools. They want the only option to be public schooling.  
And they know that if they have any competition, they're just not going to measure up. And that's -- you know, that's why they want to do it.  
This is a power thing and we've seen this before with unions. The teachers union is the largest union in the country with about three million members. 
And already, we've seen that either the head of the UFT or the head of the NEA is going to be the head of the Department of Education.  
And then what? Then what happens to all of the kids who actually need an education?  
CARLSON:  If you're a Democratic politician like the Governor of California and you're sending your children to private school, because you know it's better for them to be in class, and you're shutting down or allowing unions to shut down the public schools, I think you have to answer for that on some moral level. I think that's really wrong, don't you?  
EMMONS:  I think so as well. Yes. I called around yesterday. So my son is in fifth grade. And you know, I called around yesterday to see what was going on with the private schools, the ones that cost $50,000.00 a year. 
They're all open.  
A couple of them when I called to say, "Are you open?" They were like, yes. 
Wait, who are you? Why are you calling?  
CARLSON:  Exactly.  
EMMONS:  Because I want to know, why is my kid not getting educated?  
CARLSON:  That's true. I mean, I guess the good news, from your perspective is a lot of those $50,000.00 a year schools are really, really bad. Really bad. Trust me.  
Libby, it's great to see you. Thank you for coming on.  
EMMONS:  Thanks so much.  
CARLSON:  Well, Senate Republicans released a report today about communications between Joe Biden's son and the Communist Party of China. 
Other media organizations buried this story, we're not going to bury it. 
We'll tell you what's in that report. Some of this is very interesting, next.  
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  
CARLSON:  The social media companies and corporate media tried to bury the story for weeks, but it's not going away because it's real.  
Yesterday, Senate Republicans released a report on Hunter Biden's connection to a Chinese tycoon linked to the communist government of that country.  
According to the report, Biden's business partner made $6 million in two wire transfers from a Chinese entity tied to the Communist Party in 2017. 
What does this amount to exactly?  
Sean Davis is the co-founder of "The Federalist." He has followed the story from day one. We're happy to have him tonight. Sean, thanks for coming. So what can we take from this report? What should we know?  
SEAN DAVIS, CO-FOUNDER, "THE FEDERALIST":  Well, I think you hit the most fascinating and interesting aspect of it, which is that Hunter Biden's business partner, who is also the spouse of Jill Biden's former top aide in the White House, got himself two $3 million wire transfers from a Communist Chinese linked energy company, and this was done in 2017.  
And you'll probably recall having, you know, been a consumer of the news for the past couple of years, all the accusations of collusion and treason because Donald Trump, Jr. had a 20-minute meeting with a Russian who was actually a client of a Clinton campaign contractor.  
So if a 20-minute meeting is necessary and sufficient to have a multiyear investigation, I think it's time to have a pretty big investigation about the millions of dollars funneled to Hunter Biden and his friends.  
CARLSON:  And the partner who got this money wired to him knew Joe Biden. I mean, we put a picture on the air of them playing golf together. He was at the meeting between Biden and Tony Bobulinski in Los Angeles at the Milken Conference. I mean, this is someone who is not separated by too many degrees of separation from Joe Biden.  
And presumably he was getting the money because of his connections to Biden. Is there any other reason? Was he an energy expert?  
DAVIS:  Not that I can tell. I mean, we know Hunter Biden certainly is not an expert in international energy or commodities markets. I think it's obvious to anyone who has a lick of commonsense what was going on here is that they were using Joe Biden's name, the Biden family name as bait for getting access and money from these people who wanted their hooks into the U.S. government and it worked for them.  
CARLSON:  It's not a small thing since, I mean, China and the United States will intersect in really profound ways over the next four years without question.  
DAVIS:  Right and you really have to wonder, again, looking at Biden's China policy. He certainly thinks China is a friend of ours, he wanted Trump to go easy on them.  
You have to wonder, given all of this Chinese money that was flowing to Hunter Biden and his friends whether that has an impact on the Biden foreign policy with America's number one geopolitical foe in the world right now.  
CARLSON:  Yes, that's exactly right. A virus mysteriously emerges from Central China. Totally rearranges the entire western economy. And Biden and friends first response is, don't call it Chinese. That's racism.  
I mean, I don't know. Maybe some effect.  
DAVIS:  Yes, it's like leave China alone. It's not like they control a whole bunch of money and/or antagonistic towards our foes, dumping products here to put our companies out of business.  
CARLSON:  Right.  
DAVIS:  You really have to wonder what the Biden's have with them and what the Chinese have on the Biden's at this point.  
CARLSON:  Yes. Where does all the fentanyl come from that's killing a hundred thousand Americans?  
Sean Davis, great to see you tonight. Thank you.  
DAVIS:  Thank you.  
CARLSON:  We appreciate your watching tonight. Thanks for trusting us. We appreciate it.  
Sean Hannity from New York this evening.  
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST:  Hi.
