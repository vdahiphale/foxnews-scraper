Let's all go "Off the Record" for just a minute. I missed the Grammys last night, but many are outraged about that steamy performance by Beyonce and Jay-Z. My thoughts? Why is anyone surprised?
What did anyone expect? It's Hollywood and typical Hollywood awards shows. The performers are all trying to outdo each other to create buzz and buzz means money. And they know steamy behavior, pushing the envelope, doing something provocative will build their careers. Artists who stun and outrage, they're rewarded by the many who will still watch - still buy - all their records and movies and maybe buy more because there is a buzz about them. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Hollywood is not in the decency business, in case you haven't noticed. They're in the money business. And don't forget, as much as you might not like to hear this, singing and dancing is a First Amendment right. While some may say the Grammys is different, that it is broadcast and not cable and primetime, that law in Hollywood was lost a long time ago. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Nothing will change Hollywood unless the American people stop watching and buying. So if you don't like it, try National Geographic Channel or my favorite, set up serious recording for ON THE RECORD so you can catch up on old episodes of ON THE RECORD. If the kids are still up, try a movie like "Ice Age" on DVD. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
If enough people do that, Hollywood will change. That's the only way. That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an important story or issue you think I should take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.
