TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST:  Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSONTONIGHT. You've heard a lot over the past few days about the security of ourelectronic voting machines, and this is a real issue, no matter who raisesit, or who tries to dismiss it out of hand as a conspiracy theory. Electronic voting is not as secure as traditional hand counting. Period. Itnever will be as secure. Voters can see this because it's obvious and itmakes them nervous. And why wouldn't it make them nervous? Our leaders havegiven us every reason not to trust technology. The people now telling us to stop asking questions about voting machinesare the same ones who claim that our phones weren't listening to us. Theylie. We all know that. Other countries understand that. They don't use electronic voting becausethey know it undermines confidence in democracy. A system cannot functionif no one trusts the vote, and that's true here, too, as we're finding out. Going forward, we need to find out exactly what happened in this month'spresidential election. We need to find out no matter how long it takes theinvestigation to unfold or how much it costs. And once we get answers from that investigation, we ought to revertimmediately to the traditional system of voting, the one that served ourdemocracy for hundreds of years. What we're doing now is not working. That's an understatement. As of tonight, the State of New York still hasn't managed to count thevotes in five house races, thanks to mail-in voting. That's a disaster.Let's stop pretending that it's not. But at the same time, we shouldn't let our focus on voting machinesdistract us from all that happened earlier this month. The 2020 presidential election was not fair. No honest person would claimthat it was fair. On many levels, the system was rigged against one candidate and in favor ofanother, and it was rigged in ways that were not hidden from view. We allsaw it happen. The media openly colluded with the Democratic nominees. Joe Biden andKamala Harris refused to explain what they would do if they were elected. That's never happened before in any presidential election in Americanhistory, but the media allowed them to do it. At the same time, beginning in the spring, Democrats used our public healthemergency for nakedly partisan ends. They punish Trump supporters fortrying to gather, but they exempted their own activists, rioters andvandals from BLM and Antifa from the COVID lockdowns entirely. They saidthis out loud. The restrictions they did enforce crushed America's small businesses, theheart of the Republican Party, and yet they made their own donorsfantastically richer. Jeff Bezos alone saw his net worth jump by more than $70 billion during thepandemic. Then Democrats used the coronavirus to change your system of voting. Theyvastly increased the number of mail-in ballots, because they knew theircandidates would benefit from less secure voting. They were right. They used the courts to neutralize the Republican Party's single mosteffective get-out-the-vote operation, which for generations had been theNational Rifle Association. Not enough has been written about this, but anyone on the ground saw it.Thanks to legal harassment from the left, the NRA played a vastly reducedrole in this election and that made a huge difference in swing states likePennsylvania and others. But above all, Democrats harnessed the power of Big Tech to win thiselection. Virtually all news and all information in the English speakingworld travels through a single company, Google. A huge percentage of our political debates take place on Facebook andTwitter. If you use technology to censor, the idea is that people areallowed to express online, ultimately, you control how the population votesand that's exactly what they did. They rigged the election in front of all of us and nobody did anythingabout it. Dr. Robert Epstein saw this coming. Epstein is one of the world's foremostexperts on the effect of Big Tech on politics. Epstein is not a partisanTrump supporter. In fact, he's a Democrat. But he believes in democracy,and for years, he has warned that Silicon Valley could steal this election.This is what he said we spoke to him about a year ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ROBERT L. EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FORBEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-CALIFORNIA:  Google and similarcompanies like Facebook are completely unregulated in the United States, sothey can do whatever they please. And if they all work together in 2020 to support the same presidentialcandidate, which is very likely, and probably it'll be a candidate that Isupport, by the way, they can shift upwards of 15 million votes with no oneknowing that they've been manipulated and without leaving a paper trail forauthorities to trace. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Dr. Epstein has tracked the effect he says Google has had on thismonth's presidential election and he joins us now to explain what he hasfound. Doctor, thanks so much for coming on. What effect do you think have youmeasured of Big Tech on the voting outcome this month? EPSTEIN:  Well, a couple of things that we've looked at so far. First ofall, we had 733 field agents in three key swing states this year: Arizona,North Carolina and Florida, and we preserved more than 500,000 ephemeralexperiences. That's a lot. That's about 30 times more data than we got in2016. And we're finding a couple of things that are pretty clear. Number one, isthat Google's search results were strongly biased in favor of liberals andDemocrats. This was not true on Bing or Yahoo. The bias was being shown to pretty much every demographic group we lookedat, including conservatives. So in fact, conservatives got slightly moreliberal bias in their search results than liberals did. How do you accountfor that? And then we also found what seems to be a smoking gun. That is we found aperiod of days when the vote reminder on Google's homepage was being sentonly to liberals, not one of our conservative field agents received a votereminder during those days. The good news is on that fourth day that we were monitoring, we went publicwith some of our findings, and Google backed off, they literally shut offthat manipulation that night. And so for four days before the election,they were showing vote reminders to everyone, finally. CARLSON:  What effect and we're thankful that you are apparently the onlyperson monitoring this, it controls -- Google single handily controls ourview of the world, and yet no one seems to care. But what do you imaginethe effects? What if you measured the effect of this manipulation had onthe outcome of the election? EPSTEIN:  Well, there are multiple manipulations here. We were alsomonitoring YouTube this time, and Facebook and Bing and Yahoo. The bottom line at the moment is that these manipulations, the ones thatwe've so far quantified, could easily have shifted at least six millionvotes in just one direction. That's the bare minimum at this point that I'mconfident of. The maximum, we haven't even begun to estimate that yet because we have somuch data to look at. CARLSON:  So that's the margin of the election right there. So, you'resaying that what you feared could happen may indeed have happened, that themanipulations from one company Google may have determined the outcome ofthe presidential election. EPSTEIN:  Well, we've been told this for nearly a year by whistleblowersfrom Google. We've seen it in leaked documents from Google, leaked videosfrom Google. There is no question that they set about after the 2016 election to makesure that President Trump, whom I do not support, by the way to make surethat he is not re-elected, and the massive amount of data we've collectedis consistent with what the whistleblowers and leaks have been telling usfor a long time now. So yes, the answer is yes. CARLSON:  So why is this not at the top of the concern of anybody who caresabout democracy? Why are we allowing this to happen do you think? EPSTEIN:  Unfortunately, the answer is pretty obvious. Google literallybuys candidates and politicians and my colleagues, my fellow academics areoften bought by Google with large grants. So you know, the fact is that if you're a Democrat, or you're a liberal,you like what Google and to some extent, these other tech companies aredoing. You like it, it's to your advantage. You know, the problem, though, is that we don't know who Google is going tobe supporting tomorrow. And in fact, in different countries around theworld, they don't necessarily support liberals. In some countries, theysupport conservatives. In China, they work with the Chinese government tohelp surveil and control the Chinese population. CARLSON:  This is the story right here. Dr. Epstein, I hope that you getthe funding that you need to continue this research. I think it's -- hardto think of many things more important and I hope that changes are madeimmediately. Or this is -- EPSTEIN:  Well, we have moved into Georgia. So, we're now monitoring theGeorgia runoff. So we're doing our best. CARLSON:   I hope that you will. Thank you. So Big Tech, clearly, influenced the outcome in this election. That shouldbe shocking and unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy or goodgovernment and yet it was essentially celebrated by the national media,which shared the goal of removing Trump from office. Sharyl Attkisson is the author of the book, "Slanted: How the News MediaTaught Us to Love Censorship and Hate Journalism." She joins us tonight.Boy, that title is chilling, but true. Sharyl Attkisson thanks so much forcoming on. What effect do you think the tech companies had on this election? SHARYL ATTKISSON, AUTHOR, "SLANTED":  Well, I think it was big looking atit in a non-forensic way -- Dr. Epstein knows a lot more about all of thatthan I do -- but just looking at the influence that they have had over thepast couple of years after a concerted campaign that began in 2016, on thepart of political and corporate interests, to try to control the internetlandscape, the information that we get online, because these forces knewthat once they had largely controlled the terms of how we talk about newsstories, in news divisions and on TV and on cable news, that there wasstill this place, they saw people were getting unfettered access to offnarrative information. Studies maybe they don't want you to see or know about, opinions that maybethey don't want you to have or know about, and so they set out their goalsto then move into the internet in a way like we hadn't seen before, in avery overt way in those weeks before the election, in fact, to try tocontrol that information landscape as well. CARLSON:  I don't know how frequently we can sound this alarm. I hopesomething is done about it soon. But give us an example of what they did inthe weeks before the election, if you would. ATTKISSON:  Well, there are plenty of ways and hidden ways that every day,our information is controlled. And it's for example, Google actually madethis announcement when coronavirus hit that they were going to directsearches to the World Health Organization, which in retrospect admitted --the W.H.O. -- had gotten certain things completely wrong. But that's wherewe were being directed because of the partnership that they developed,because interest wanted us to go there and believe that. But right before the election in ways that weren't even partly hidden, Ifelt like there was a sense of desperation, because the tech companiesbegan overtly censoring and taking down accounts rather than just sort ofminimizing them or minimizing their reach in ways that couldn't be denied. So look at "The New York Post" story on Hunter Biden and the audacity ofthat, but to not even care in those couple of weeks leading up to theelection that we saw exactly what they were doing, because they knew therewould be no repercussions for that before the election and perhaps none,quite frankly, after the election. CARLSON:  That's absolutely shocking. Do you think that there's any way torein this in before the next election even before the runoff in January inGeorgia that will determine control of the Congress? ATTKISSON:  Well, I doubt before the runoff, but if we're looking fouryears down the road, there are a lot of strong technical minds andindependent journalism minds and information people who are looking for allkinds of new ways where information can be disseminated without beingcurated by these self-appointed parties who have their own conflicts ofinterest, where people won't be deplatformed if they simply share factualinformation, or hey, if they want to share information that's not true, butleave it up to you to discern what is and isn't and the research that youwant to do rather than letting these unnamed faceless people with conflictsof interest, do it for you. There are a lot of people searching for ways to do that, and I do thinksomething new will be born of all of this. CARLSON:  Man, that can't come too soon. Sharyl Attkisson, great to see youtonight. Thank you so much. ATTKISSON:  Thanks. CARLSON:  If you're a Trump voter and you suspect that this election wasstolen, was rigged, you're on to something, and it is the tech companiesabove all that did it. Keep that in mind. Up next, banning building, solar panels, signing international agreementsthat destroy American jobs to make people like John Kerry feel virtuous,seems like something that would happen in 2009, but Joe Biden wants tobring it all back. J.D. Vance joins us after the break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  It turns out John Kerry, like Barack Obama is what they call aclimate denier. How do we know that? Well, because like Obama, John Kerryrecently purchased a $12 million waterfront home on the island of Martha'sVineyard. So obviously, he's not really worried about rising sea levels. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  The passiveindifference that most countries are accepting is basically a mutualsuicide pact. That's what people are on right now. Because we are not doingwhat is necessary to save the planet. He is not helping the forgotten American. He is hurting them. Their kidswill have worse asthma in the summer. President Trump pulling out of the Paris Agreement: that is going to costlives. That's not a simple political move. People are going to die becauseof the decision he made. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  So Joe Biden wants to spend a lot of money next four yearstalking about climate. What's interesting is that climate is very low onevery survey of voters' actual concerns.  They're worried about things like paying off their debt. Many people aredrowning in debt. They're worried about relatives who are dying of drugODs. They are worried about a stalled economy. So why do they keep talking to us about this? Have they not learnedanything in the past four years? J.D. Vance has thought more about thissubject than virtually anyone. He's the author of the famous book,"Hillbilly Elegy," a movie version of it is currently airing in theaters.It will begin streaming tomorrow. We wanted to ask him these questions. J.D. Vance joins us now. J.D., thanks so much for coming on. Before I ask you about the movie, let me ask you about the kind of centralplace in the elite liberal mind occupied by climate. They've neversucceeded in convincing the population that this should be a top concern.Why is that? J.D. VANCE, AUTHOR, "HILLBILLY ELEGY":  Well, I think because peopleorganize, they are fundamentally unserious. You know, people may not beexperts on the details of environmental policy, but I think people -- mostpeople recognize that if you're lecturing the average American about howmuch they drive their car, but you're letting the two biggest polluters inthe world, China and India, basically do whatever they want to, then you'renot interested in environmental damage, you're interested in gaslighting. And so I think when people like John Kerry try to preach about theimportance of self-denial, to just save the climate, and then go and buy a$13 million mansion and say nothing to China and India, people justrecognize they are full of crap. CARLSON:  But they keep trying. I mean, every time they speak, andcertainly every time they get power, they're coming up with a new scheme.These are people who, by the way, hate nature, or at war with nature, notinterested in the actual environment at all. But climate is always at thetop of their plans. What's in it for them? Why? VANCE:  Well, it's a pretty complicated question. I'll give you one part ofmy answer, which is that I think it's a quasi-religious phenomenon, right?I think what a lot of these people have is they have lost any sense of realreligious faith, and so their sense of virtue is very often tied up inself-denial around the climate. They don't drive their car. They don't go to certain places. They takecertain actions that are perceived as virtuous. It's at least an organizingprinciple around which they can kind of organize their life. I think a lot of people who maybe care about the environment in a very realway recognize that that sort of religious approach to this issue justdoesn't make any sense. But I also think there's just a component of basic power going on here. Ifyou look at the agenda that's being pushed by people who care the most, orat least claim that they care the most about the environment, it is veryoften making industries that are very important in the heartland, like oiland natural gas, more economically troubled, and it is making otherindustries like digital technology, easier to sort of push and make thecenterpiece of an American economic policy. So I think in a lot of ways, these people's sort of sense of virtue andsort of self-interest align and intersect in a way that makes theenvironmental issue pretty tough to bring any rationality to. CARLSON:  I think that's nicely put. So you wrote one of the bestsellingbooks of your generation, no exaggeration, "Hillbilly Elegy." It was not apolitical book, I read it. You didn't seem to have a political agenda inwriting it. The reviews of the film have been tinged by politics. The film, which isout now. Why do you think that is? What is that about? VANCE:  I think there are a couple things going on. I mean, you know, one,a lot of people don't like that I am a conservative and I talk about theseissues and that I come at these things from a right of center perspective. And I'm okay with that. I'm fine with the criticism. I can take it on. I ama big boy. I think there's something a little bit more pernicious that I'm starting topick up on that does really bother me. And it's this idea that, you know,Hollywood has made a movie about working class white people, and Tucker,you know, the story and a lot of folks who have read the book do, you know,it's really a story about addiction, about resilience, about family, sortof overcoming obstacles, but also suffering in really, really important andprofound ways. And, you know, unfortunately, those movies I think, aren't especiallypopular. Those stories are popular among the intelligentsia. They don'twant to hear about white working class Americans, they'd rather lecturethose people about being privileged. I think that's disgusting and wrong. But I'm at least glad that Ron Howard and the team at Imagine thoughtenough for the book to try and make a good story out of it. And I thinkthey did. I think folks who watch the movie on Netflix tomorrow, when it comes outwill hopefully find something about my family that they can sympathizewith. And that's, I think, really the goal of telling the story in thefirst place. CARLSON:  I think your analysis is exactly right. The reviews I have readobject to the idea of chronicling the lives of people who they think shouldjust shut up and go away or die, and so I just -- I commend you for tellingtheir story in a way that millions of people saw. I think it's reallyimportant. J.D. Vance. Congrats on the movie. VANCE:  Thanks, Tucker. CARLSON:  So LA County is shutting down restaurants and bars because ofcoronavirus. Here's the funny thing. Their own data show that restaurants and bars arenot responsible for the spread of the virus. What is that? We will tell you? Plus, the critically acclaimed Governor of New York won his Emmy today.Candace Owens, the noted television critic here to react straight ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Los Angeles is famous for its restaurants and restaurants andbars, and that city have done their very best to accommodate coronavirusrestrictions. They built patios. They've expanded outdoor seating. They've done a lot and they spent a lot of money doing it. Many are stillstruggling to get by. Now, Los Angeles County has ordered restaurants to stop all outdoor seatingthis Wednesday. What's the scientific justification for this? Is there one? FOX News medical contributor, Dr. Marc Siegel is following this story andjoins us tonight. Dr. Siegel, good to see you. DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Tucker, good to seeyou. I'm very concerned about government overreach here, using fear tocontrol and most importantly, in this case, the cruelty of closingrestaurants. The timing is here, right before Thanksgiving. And you know, Governor Newsom himself is in quarantine because of anexposure of his family. I wish him well, but a lot of people can't affordthe kind of quarantine he has and Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles says hewants the bubble to be as small as possible -- the bubble. Well, your bubble can't afford to be small, unless you can afford it,really afford it, the way that his family can. And I want to point out somestatistics that come out of our local FOX bureau tonight, which isshocking. LA County has said that there's 204 hotspot areas they are concerned about,but less than three percent of those are restaurants and bars. Tucker, youknow, what's more than seven percent? LA County buildings, governmentbuildings are more than twice the problem. And you know what the problem is? It's staffing, it's not even customers. So if you're a customer that wants to go to a restaurant in Los Angeles onWednesday or Thursday, you can't do it. Even with outdoor dining, as youpointed out, even at a time when it's 63 degrees today in Los Angeles, youcan't afford to eat outdoors. And it's poor people we're talking about here because the very few casesthat you've seen of COVID-19 are occurring in Domino's or in Taco Bell orMcDonalds or in Burger King or Domino's Pizza. That is who is affectedhere, not some beautiful gourmet restaurant governor in Napa Valley thatcould send you all the food you want to eat. So on Thanksgiving, restaurant owners were asked by a local reporter, whatare you going to do, Tucker? And many of them said, we're going to closeand we're not going to be able to reopen. And guess what we have here. We've got plenty of food for Thanksgiving. Wehave turkey. We have dressing. We have stuffing for everyone that was goingto be here. So my message for Mayor Garcetti tonight is this. Mayor, please reconsiderclosing the bars and restaurants in Los Angeles when they're not spreadingCOVID-19, when many people, Mayor, are waiting for their turkey at one ofthese restaurants instead, what are they going to do? Tucker, they're goingto be gathering together much bigger crowds than they would havepotentially spreading COVID-19. There is the hypocrisy of government -- Tucker. CARLSON:  Government buildings were responsible for more than twice thenumber of infections as restaurants, but they are open and restaurants areclosed. That's the takeaway from my perspective. Dr. Siegel, amazing. Thank you for the math. I appreciate it. SIEGEL:  Agree. Thank you. CARLSON:  Good news from the political world tonight, Governor Andrew Cuomoof New York has accepted his well-deserved Emmy Award. Here is the montagethe academy played during his celebration of his contributions totelevision history. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDREW COUMO (D-NY):  Flatten the curve, flatten the curve, flattenthe curve. This is an N-95 mask. We talk about social distancing. Slow the spread. New York has been getting the short end of the stick from this Federalgovernment from day one right across the board. Let's stop just for one moment, the partisanship. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Well, the newest season of "The Andrew Cuomo Show" debuted today,filling the empty spot where "The Sopranos" used to be. He appears to beauditioning for the Food Network now. The TV star governor unveiled his creative take on the traditionalThanksgiving dinner. Let us know if you think this is going to win a JamesBeard award. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CUOMO:  Yes, we're going to be along physically, but we are spirituallytogether, celebrating in a way that is even deeper. You're giving thanks and honoring your global family. It's not a normal Thanksgiving. It's not the traditional Thanksgiving. It'sbetter than that. It's deeper than that. It's more spiritual than that. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  Your global family. Has there ever been a dumber person in publicoffice? A global family isn't family at all, and you should know thatGovernor Cuomo is not spending Thanksgiving with his global family onlineon Zoom. He is spending it with his actual family because he is in charge,and he gets to do exactly what he wants. But for everyone else, subject to his rules, they are having turkey with aheap of loneliness. Well, the critically acclaimed governor also made it clear that it is lawenforcement's responsibility to make certain that after nearly 400 years oftradition you eat Thanksgiving alone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CUOMO:  How a law enforcement officer says, "I choose not to enforce thatlaw." I believe that law enforcement officer violates his or herconstitutional duty. I don't consider them a law enforcement officer. (END VIDEO CLIP) CARLSON:  If that guy ascends to a Cabinet position, we have to listen tohim for four more years. It's just going to be absolutely unbearable. Candace Owens, founder of Brexit joins us tonight. Candace, great to seeyou. So Governor Cuomo says, you need to spend the Holiday alone with yourglobal family, apparently like randoms on Facebook, but he is spending itwith his actual family. Tell me how this works. CANDACE OWENS, FOUNDER, BLEXIT:  Oh, it's COVID for thee and not for me.You have to love these Democrat governors. They have absolutely no shame. And let me just say this: in America right now, it just feels likeeverything is upside down. You've got this week rapper Cardi B wins Womanof the Year for rapping about her genitalia. Now, we have the governor whooversaw the most COVID deaths in his state and he wins an Emmy, Tucker. Hegets to win and take home an Emmy. I think around the corner, we can expect AOC will likely pick up a PulitzerPrize in Economics for her amazing and brilliant idea that the governmentshould just pay us to stay at home. I mean, it feels like we're honestly playing the crazy game. And you know,you take a look at this and to be serious, it's hard to mince words here.This is absolutely despicable stuff that we are seeing from these Democratleaders in inner cities, whether it's Los Angeles, whether it's Californiaor New York. It's horrible stuff that we're seeing and the American peopleare suffering. I mean, this guy during the midst of all of this coronavirus pandemic tookthe time to author a book. Don't forget that. He authored a book, agrandstanding book, an ode to himself about how great of a governor he isfrom beside his mansion walls while the people on the streets are sufferingfrom rioting, from looting. If anything, he is qualified to write a how-to manual on how to ruin yourstate in a couple of months, and that's all I see when I look at Cuomo. CARLSON:  So why didn't Harvey Weinstein think of this and write a guide toa happy marriage or like a, you know, fourth wave feminist tract orsomething like -- so the idea is, you take the thing that you're guilty ofand you pretend you're the opposite of guilty of it. In fact, you're thegreatest guy in the world at doing the thing that you're demonstrablyterrible at, is this going to work? OWENS:  I don't know if it's going to work. I recommend Nicolas Maduro downin Venezuela write a book in how to feed the masses. Maybe Robert Mugabe inZimbabwe can write a book on economics. I mean, this is crazy stuff that we're seeing but the American people aregetting sick of it. We saw last week the New Yorkers are starting to standup and they are rioting and they are protesting these masks and theselockdowns. You see this across in California taking place as well. The American people are fed up with this hypocrisy. You know, Gavin Newsom,dining with his family without a mask, while the restaurant owners are toldthey have to shut down and not enjoy Thanksgiving. I don't think this is going to end well for them because this hypocrisy isnot working. CARLSON:  No. And for any of us. I mean, you can push people to a pointwhere they start to respond, and then your politics become radical andangry. And that's kind of the last place we want to go. OWENS:  That's exactly right. And I'll say this, I know that I will behosting a big Thanksgiving with my family this year. I do not need thegovernment to give me permission to do so. This is America. This is a freecountry. And we've given these politicians far too much power this year interms of COVID-19. CARLSON:  Good for you. Thank you for your clarity and good luck. I hopeyour address is private. Candace Owens, good to see you tonight. So the City Council of the City of New York voted to cut the budget of theNYPD, the largest and best police department in the Western Hemisphere, bya billion dollars; eliminated the plainclothes police unit. So city residents didn't welcome this, they never wanted it. In fact, nowthey are clamoring for more policing. Like so many cities across thecountry, New York is experiencing a surge in crime. Shootings are way up inthe city. Twenty five people shot over the weekend, just this weekend inNew York. Just last night, six people were wounded and one killed at a singleshooting in Brooklyn. But if that's not grotesque enough for you, how about this, the suddenspike in subway passengers being pushed onto subway tracks. Yesterdaymorning, a 29-year-old was shoved in broad daylight onto the tracks in abusy station downtown Brooklyn. Last week, two others were shoved onto thetracks and separate incidents in the city. Bill de Blasio who has completely wrecked the largest city in the UnitedStates is now responding, sort of. He is promising to increase NYPDpresence on the subway. A little late for the people who have been killed. Well, Governor Cuomo is not the only one who is threatening to send armedmen to your home to stop you from celebrating Thanksgiving with yourfamily. Others are, too. We'll have that for you next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  Thanksgiving has been around for nearly 400 years in thiscountry. Just in the last century, it endured and continued despite twoWorld Wars and a global depression. But now in 12 states, it's coming to anend this year. They've canceled Thanksgiving. In Oregon, the Governor Kate Brown is ordering her subjects to keep theirThanksgiving dinners to six guests or less and those who defy her orderscould go to jail. FOX News Senior correspondent, Rick Leventhal has this story in itsentirety. We're happy to have him tonight. Rick, good to see you. RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Tucker, goodto see you. If you see something or say something that used to apply topossible terrorists among us, well now, in Oregon, it means call the copson your neighbors if they have too many guests for Thanksgiving dinner. Remember, this is the state that just legalized magic mushrooms anddecriminalized the possession of heroin, cocaine and LSD. So hard drugs areessentially okay, but the Governor says gyms, zoos and museums are not.Restaurants will also be closed to indoor and outdoor dining for the nexttwo weeks. And don't even think about having more than six people at your dinner tablefrom no more than two families -- or else. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUESTION:  Do you want people calling the police on their neighbors,nonemergency lines or 911? GOV. KATE BROWN (D-OR):  Look, this is no different than what happens ifthere's a party down the street and it's keeping everyone awake. What doneighbors do? They call law enforcement because it's too noisy. QUESTION:  Like that could be a yes. BROWN:  Yes, yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEVENTHAL:  Meanwhile, Pennsylvania is shutting down one of the biggestparty nights of the year. This Wednesday, the night before Thanksgiving,the state is banning all alcohol sales from 5:00 p.m. until eight the nextmorning begging residents to stay home to mitigate any new cases ofcoronavirus. Pennsylvania is not threatening penalties, but Oregon says violators of thenew restrictions including the six-person dinner limit, face up to 30 daysin jail, $1,250.00 in fines or both -- Tucker. CARLSON:  This all defies belief. Rick Leventhal, thank you for thatreport. Appreciate it. LEVENTHAL:  Thank you. CARLSON:  So Harvard University is richer than you may understand. Harvardhas an endowment -- it is not taxed -- worth more than $40 billion. It'sone of the richest private institutions in the world that has more moneythan the GDP of almost every country in Africa. Despite having this much money, the second coronavirus hit, Harvardattempted to fire most of its unskilled low paid staff. Harvard is chargingstudents full tuition to learn online, which isn't really learning at all. Then and this just happened, Harvard recently attempted to get rich off acoronavirus tax break by encouraging alumni to donate to the school. Oren Cass went to Harvard. He went to Harvard Law School. He is ExecutiveDirector of American Compass and unlike a lot of Harvard graduates, he ispretty honest about his alma mater. We're happy to have him on tonight. Oren Cass, tell us what Harvard is doing exactly here. OREN CASS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN COMPASS:  Well, I just received theusual alumni e-mail and the subject was "Smart Giving thanks to the CARESAct" and I thought it was going to be telling me, you know, be sure to givea little extra to those who need locally this year, but it was actually taxplanning advice for how I could take advantage of the CARES Act to make alarger gift than ever to Harvard and pay less taxes in the process. And apparently this is something that they and a lot of other quite wealthyinstitutions are pushing pretty hard. CARLSON:  So the CARES Act, of course was written and presented to the restof us as a way to help people suffering from the effects of the coronaviruslockdowns, but Harvard is trying to leverage this to get even richer. Dothey need the money? CASS:  No, they definitely don't. As you mentioned, their endowment isabove $40 billion, and in fact, it went up more than $2 billion, just thisyear. So with all of the struggling that you see going on, Harvard actuallyis better off than ever. As you mentioned there, they are still collecting full tuition from alltheir students, even though they are not offering a full education, andnow, on top of that, they are there hoping to vacuum up a little bit moreeven as in their own operations, frankly, they haven't made a point of, Ithink really attending to those in their own community who are in need. CARLSON:  So greed is a word that's fallen out of use, unfortunately, I'venoticed, but I don't think there's any other way to describe this otherthan greed. This is greed. CASS:  Well, it's always puzzling to see the focus on raising money forthese institutions that have more than they know what to do with frankly,and you know, I think there's an argument that we want our universities tobe teaching and to be to be investing in research. You know that's how weget the coronavirus vaccine. The problem of course is that that's not where most of the money at theseuniversities are going. I mean, they've become these amusement parkentitlements for kids and a huge share end up with degrees, you know, notat Harvard, but at a lot of places that aren't worth much. And then, you look at what they spend their time on. I went to the alumniweb page, and the top stories were all about racial justice, and I'm IbramKendi's speech -- he is the anti-racism guy, Latinx gathering, and youknow, if you want to do those things with your own money, that's fine. ButI'm not sure why we're giving people tax breaks to donate even more forthat when they've already got $40 billion to spend on it if they want. CARLSON:  To teach some of the smartest kids in the country to hate thenation that made all of this possible. I am wondering how long this kind ofpoison machine can continue, do you think? CASS:  I don't know. It was stunning, frankly, that the first thing youheard everyone talking about when it looked like Joe Biden had won theelection was well, let's hope -- you know, how much student loans can heforgive and how quickly? Can he forgive $50,000.00 of student loans? And I was sitting here wondering, well, why student loans? Why not autoloans? Well, why not mortgages if we're just waving people's debt away? Andthe reality is that a lot of folks in power have this weird idea of highereducation as this kind of noble pursuit when you look at what they'reactually doing, they're sort of just as grubby, especially interest as anyother and in a lot of ways they're doing a particularly large amount ofdamage to our nation. And they are also doing a tremendous amount of harm to the prospects of somany young people who would be much better off in other pathways thanspending a lot of money taking on a lot of debt for degrees that don't evenpay off in the long run. CARLSON:  That's exactly right. But they have the most powerful lobbies inWashington. Thank you for saying so. Oren Cass, great to see you tonight. CASS:  Good to see you. CARLSON:  Well, for this one night only, we're bringing back the "FriendZone." That's the portion of the show where we meet an old friend from FOXNews. We're happy to have Pete Hegseth joining us tonight. We'll be rightback. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CARLSON:  There are a lot of good and interesting people who work here atFOX News, and so tonight, we are resurrecting a segment we call the "FriendZone" where we invite one of our friends within the building onto the show. Pete Hegseth is one of them. He is co-host to "Fox and Friends" weekend,author of the new book, "Modern Warriors." We're happy to have him ontonight. Pete Hegseth, great to see you. PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  Great to see you, Tucker. CARLSON:  Who are these modern warriors? What is this? HEGSETH:  You know, on your show every night, Tucker, you do such a greatjob of exposing the misplaced priorities, the anti-American priorities ofour so called elite, the one percent. This book is about the real one percent of America, the men and women whoput on the uniform and answer freedom's call and are not afraid to go dothe dirty deeds of our nation, live to tell about it and their storiesdeserve to be told. You know, we have societies -- the things we celebrate and honor are areflection of what we value and in our society, we honor so many vapid, youknow actors and things that don't matter. This is meant to put thespotlight squarely on the chest of the men who have done the dirty work andthe heavy lifting for freedom. And so, you know, oftentimes on shows, we get three minutes to talk tosomeone and I'll talk to a Medal of Honor recipient and you know, it's agreat story, but you just scratch the surface. So my show on FOX Nation, "Modern Warriors" gets these guys in a room, havea couple of beers. Let's have the no BS politically incorrect, raw, bluntstory and the book channels that exact same thing. You hear from Navy SEAL,Army Rangers, Green Berets, bomb technician, snipers? What's it like to be in the heat of combat? What are your fears? How do youmanage pain? How do you transition the sacrifice? In your own words, in acomfortable place where we know all we want to do is celebrate what you'vedone. The book tries to channel that, and we just don't hear enough of thesestories. And a lot of vets don't want to talk to the media and share theirstory. In this book, they do, and it's meant to celebrate all those whohave done deployment after deployment after deployment, regardless of whatthe politicians say they did their job. CARLSON:  You must have met some very cool people in writing this book? HEGSETH:  Oh, Unbelievable. Unbelievable. The most difficult part washoning in on 15 stories to tell with all of them that you could. I mean,these snipers and bomb techs, the guys that walk the ground, that don'tknow one day or another whether they'll live or die, but they do it becausethey love their brothers, and they love our country. It was a humbling experience. And you meet them all and you meet the humanside of them. These are average folks from towns we grew up in, who gotextraordinary training, and went and did extraordinary things in the heatof battle. And then they had to transition back home. It is not an easy task. Themilitary train people well to fight in combat, not necessarily come home.And because I'm not a journalist and not a reporter out to get them, Ithink they were honest with me in ways that they may not always be aboutsome of the challenges they face and why they do what they do. CARLSON:  I believe that. These are really unusual people. And some greatpeople. Thank you. Pete Hegseth, it is terrific to see you tonight. HEGSETH:  Tucker, you're the man. Thank you. CARLSON:  Thank you. That's it for us this evening. We will be backtomorrow night and every night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemyof lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Tomorrow night, a special guest, one of our favorites: Rick Savage, ownerof the Sunday River Brewing Company in Maine. He came on the show tocomplain about corona. We will tell you what happened next. Guess who is here now? Trey Gowdy sitting in for Sean. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
