Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. Brendan Tevlin, you just saw the story right here. But before you did, had you ever heard of Brendan? If not, blame the police, your government and the media.
So far, no big national headlines, and the government certainly is not talking about it. But we all should be. And it isn't just because Brendan was 19, a good kid with lots of hopes and dreams who was viciously murdered in his car at a traffic light on June 25th and whose family is now, of course, devastated. But it's because Brendan's murder may be by Islamic extremists, an act of jihad right here in the United States, in New Jersey. Who says that? Ali Mohammed Brown says that. He's 29, he's been charged in Brendan's murder and three additional murders in Washington State. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Ali Mohammed Brown has confessed to the killings, saying that those four murders were in retaliation, revenge for Iraq and Syria. Right now, it's unclear to us whether Ali Mohammed Brown is making that up or not, was acting alone or is part of an extremist group. We only know what he is saying, and it is alarming, alarming enough that Americans need answers. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
We're doing what we can. We're going to hear from Brendan's parents, Michael and Allison, right here "On the Record" Wednesday night at 7:00 P.M. Eastern. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
