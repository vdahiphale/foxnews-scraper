MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS HOST:  I'm Mike Emanuel, in for Chris Wallace.Relief for millions of struggling Americans in jeopardy as President Trumpsuddenly objects to the bipartisan COVID deal.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It really is a disgrace.EMANUEL (voice-over):  The outgoing president's demand to increase the aidchecks for American family sending Congress scrambling, testing theallegiance of Republicans and potentially leading to a government shutdown;as the president grants dozens of pardons to longtime allies and associatesand continues to contest the results of the election.We'll discuss it all with Republican Senator Pat Toomey, only on "FOX NewsSunday".Then -- JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  Our darkest days in the battle againstCOVID are ahead of us, not behind us.EMANUEL:  Concerns about new, more contagious strains of the virus andincreased tension over who's next in line for the vaccine as millions ofAmericans travel this holiday despite health warnings.We are joined by Admiral Brett Giroir of the White House Coronavirus TaskForce.Plus -- MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're going to keepfighting until every legal vote is counted.EMANUEL:  How the president's focus on overturning Joe Biden's victorycould impact the Georgia Senate runoffs.We'll ask our Sunday panel whether it could derail Republicans efforts towin a Senate majority, all right now, on "FOX News Sunday".(END VIDEOTAPE)EMANUEL (on camera):  And hello again and happy New Year from FOX News inWashington.A Christmas holiday season like none other as Americans isolated by COVIDprecautions and looking for an economic boost now face more uncertainty.The president in Florida after throwing a wrench into relief proceedings.In Washington, time is running out, and tomorrow is shaping up to be one ofthe most consequential days of the congressional year. The House isscheduled to vote on the president's demand for $2,000 direct payments tosome Americans, although it will likely die in the Republican-controlledSenate. The country also facing a looming shutdown in the middle of apandemic which has killed more than 330,000 people in this country.In a moment, we'll speak with Republican Senator Pat Toomey ofPennsylvania, but first, let's bring in Mark Meredith with the latest fromthe president's Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida -- Mark.MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Mike, lawmakers from both partiesare pleading with the president to sign the stimulus and funding billalready in front of them all in an effort to prevent the governmentshutdown and keep pandemic assistance alive for millions of Americans.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)MEREDITH (voice-over):  This weekend, President Trump doubled down ondemands Congress rewrite its stimulus package tweeting overnight: $2,000plus $2,000 plus other family members, not 600. Remember, it was China'sfault.On Christmas Eve, Democrats tried to amend the $900 billion bill andincrease direct payments, but House Republicans blocked the effort.REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI):  We do not have unanimous consent.MEREDITH:  With both the stimulus and $1.4 trillion government funding billin limbo, Democrats say the consequences of inaction could be dire.DINGELL:  People are scared, people are desperate.MEREDITH:  On Saturday, enhanced unemployment benefits lapsed for someAmericans. An eviction moratorium will expire later this week. President-elect Joe Biden urging the president to sign the deal already worked outto, quote, make sure millions of Americans can put food on the table andkeep a roof over their heads in this holiday season.As Biden weighs his final cabinet picks, President Trump is demandingCongress not certify the November election when lawmakers meet for a jointsession in early January.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you all for being here.MEREDITH:  Meantime, the White House says the president is receivingconstant updates on the ongoing investigation into the Christmas Dayexplosion in Nashville. The FBI, which is leading the investigation,believes the blast was intentional.(END VIDEOTAPE)MEREDITH (on camera):  Tennessee's governor is asking for federalassistance to help with the cleanup. Overnight, Tennessee's congressionaldelegation sent a letter to the president urging him to support thatassistance with officials saying there is so much help needed not only forthe city of Nashville, but for local businesses as well -- Mike.EMANUEL:  Mark Meredith reporting from West Palm Beach -- Mark, thanks.Joining us from Pennsylvania, Republican Senator Pat Toomey.Senator, welcome back to "FOX News Sunday."SEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA):  Good morning, Mike. Thanks for having me.EMANUEL:  Enhanced unemployment benefits ran out Saturday. We could befacing a government shutdown midnight Monday night.Senator, you disagree with some of the provisions in this massive fundingpackage. Why should the president sign it?TOOMEY:  Well, because you don't get everything you want even if you're thepresident of the United States. We have two legislative bodies andDemocrats control one, Republicans the other.Look, if it were just a freestanding government funding bill, I wouldalmost certainly be voting against that, but I think the COVID reliefmeasures are really, really important. And, you know, in my state, as inmany other states, we have governors who are closing down businesses again.People are out of work, certainly through no fault of their own.I think we need the extended on employment benefits. I think we needanother round of the PPP loans, which really grants the small businesses tokeep their workforce, you know, part of their business. And time is runningout.So I understand the president would like to send bigger checks everybody. Ithink we ought to do is sign this bill and then make the case. Congress canpass another bill. I don't agree with $2,000 checks to people who have hadno lost income whatsoever, which is the vast majority of Americans.But the president is free to make that case. Democrats will agree with thatand see where it ends up. But we've got a bill right now that hisadministration helped negotiate. I think we ought to get that done.EMANUEL:  Your colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham, has tweeted: Afterspending some time with President @RealDonaldTrump, today I am convinced heis more determined than ever to increase stimulus payments to $2,000 perperson and challenge Section 230, big tech liability protection. Both arereasonable demands.Do you worry we are heading for a government shutdown, sir?TOOMEY:  I really don't know. I think the president has not actuallyexplicitly said he is going to veto this bill. I take that as a hopefulsign.I think as he leaves office, he will -- I understand he wants to beremembered for advocating for big checks, but the danger is he'll beremembered for chaos and misery and erratic behavior if he allows this toexpire.So I think the best thing to do, as I said, sign this and then make thecase for subsequent legislation.EMANUEL:  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is going to hold a floor vote on the$2,000 stimulus item President Trump has requested, putting all HouseRepublicans on the record.How can Republicans vote against more aid when millions of Americans arestill unemployed through no fault of their own?TOOMEY:  Yeah, because it's terribly untargeted, right? Why would we besending $2,000 to people with a six-figure income who had no suspension, noreduction of their income at all?Consider the millions of federal employees, never missed a check. They'renot going to miss object. Their expenses are probably somewhat diminished.Savings rate went through the roof. Why would we be standing severalthousand dollars to these folks?This money isn't sitting on a shelf. We're going to print it or we aregoing to borrow it, and I think that the aid should be much, much moretargeted. It should be targeted to people who have actually lost their job,small businesses that are actually in danger of going under. Those are veryreal categories.The numbers are significant. That's where the aid should go, not to peoplewho've never had any loss of income.EMANUEL:  President Trump pardoned some former campaign aides, former GOPcongressman, his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, former Blackwatersecurity operatives.Your colleague Senator Ben Sasse saying, quote: This is rotten to the core.While the president certainly has the power, do you disagree with how he'susing it?TOOMEY:  In some cases, I do.I think the case of Mike Flynn, for instance, was completely legitimate topardon him because the prosecution was an abuse of power. I don't thinkMichael Flynn ever committed a crime.But some of these other cases -- I mean, my goodness, we have tax fraud andbank fraud, witness tampering, obstruction of justice, but because theywere close to the president, they got pardoned?This is unfortunately reminiscent of the Marc Rich pardon by PresidentClinton. It is legal, it is constitutional but I think it's a misuse of thepower.EMANUEL:  Some are suggesting it's time to reform presidential powers. Doyou agree?TOOMEY:  You know, it's a good discussion to have but it's -- it's a toughcall. This is obviously a constitutional power, so I don't know how wewould do it without amending the Constitution and I think -- I think -- Ithink it would be very challenging.EMANUEL:  Do you anticipate a lot more pardons before he leaves office,Senator?TOOMEY:  I don't know what to anticipate. This president, he's oftenunpredictable.EMANUEL:  President Trump continues disputing the outcome of the 2020presidential contest. You have concerns about it hurting Republicans inGeorgia, where those critical runoffs will decide the Senate majority?TOOMEY:  Well, I think the president should accept the outcome of theelection. He had every right to challenge these votes. He had every rightto recounts and to litigate. He has done all of those things.In my state of Pennsylvania, he's drawn conservative, Republican judges whohave dismissed these cases for a lack of any credible evidence.In the case of Georgia, I think the reason we're going to win is we havebetter candidates. I think that's just an objective fact. Better candidatesand people who better reflect the wishes of the people of Georgia in KellyLoeffler and David Perdue, two terrific senators. So, I'm -- I'm stillcautiously optimistic about Georgia.EMANUEL:  What are the stakes there in Georgia in terms of what's the bigdifference between a Senate led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell orperhaps a Majority Leader Chuck Schumer?TOOMEY:  Well, the difference is if Republicans hold the Senate, thenlegislation will necessarily reflect broad compromise, because both partieswill have some say and neither party will be able to simply run off atwill.If Republicans were to lose both Senate races in Georgia, then theDemocrats will have complete control of the elected government, and I'mafraid that much of that party has been taken over by this radical wokeleft and a very liberal agenda openly advocating socialism, callingthemselves socialists, advocating for the elimination of policedepartments.I mean, just all kind of crazy policies, and there will be no check onthose policies accept whatever they choose who -- however they choose tolimit themselves, and that's not very reassuring.So I think for the sake of some balance and some consensus government, it'sreally important that Republicans hold on to the Senate.EMANUEL:  Back to the 2020 presidential contest, front and center is thepresident's fight, your state of Pennsylvania, the president's campaign hasasked the Supreme Court to throw out three state Supreme Court rulingsabout mail-in ballots and asking the general assembly be allowed to pickits own slate of electors. Even if it doesn't overturn the entire election,is that argument valid?TOOMEY:  So, again, it gets complicated. The Pennsylvania state SupremeCourt sadly is a rogue court where Democrats have decided to be extremelypolitical and disregard the law. That's a fact. And one of the examples iswe have a statute that says in order to be counted, the ballots have toarrive by 8:00 on Election Day.It's black-and-white. it's very easy to read. That's what the law says.And then the Pennsylvania Supreme Court came along and said, we'lldisregard that and allow votes to be counted for up to three days afterthat. They have no legal authority to do that. It's outrageous.But here's the important point, Mike -- it's fewer than 10,000 votes.President Trump lost Pennsylvania by over 80,000 votes. So even though thatwas a very bad decision, I think it should be overturned by the U.S.Supreme Court, it wouldn't have changed the outcome of the election andthat's something we -- we have to recognize.EMANUEL:  You're not running again in 2022, but what are your concernslooking forward about elections in your home state when at least thepresident's supporters think this election was a disaster?TOOMEY:  Well, I think there are some lessons we should learn. There aresome changes we should make. We should overturn these completely illegalPennsylvania state Supreme Court rules.I, for one, think it's perfectly okay for us to go back to the rules we hadbefore the pandemic where the vast majority of people voted in person. Thatserved us for, I don't know, over 200 years, it probably still works.If you really can't make it to the polls on Election Day, you can get anabsentee ballot, but I think that would make all the sense in the world togo back to that system. It's easier to monitor, it's easier to verify, andpeople would have more confidence in it.EMANUEL:  President Trump waited until the final hour on Wednesday to vetothe National Defense Authorization Act, which you voted in favor of. Thedefense bill affirms 3 percent pay raises for U.S. troops and authorizesmore than $740 billion in military programs and construction.Do you have the votes to override President Trump's veto?TOOMEY:  Well, I think we'll find out pretty soon. This legislation hasbeen passed by Congress every year for I think about 60 years running. It'swhen signed by presidents. I think it does put the right priorities behindour defense policy and it passed both houses with huge overwhelming votes.But we'll see. That's why you have the vote.EMANUEL:  Senator Toomey, thank you. Thanks for joining us this Christmasholiday we can.I'll see you back on the Hill.Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the president's actionsin the final stretch of his days in office.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DINGELL:  The president, when we finally thought that would be able to givepeople hope, doesn't give a damn about people. He sowed more fear. He threwkerosene on a terror fire.REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO):  We are giving money to Pakistan. We are giving moneyall over the world, really and not focusing on those who need it the mosthere at home.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL:  Members of both parties in the House expecting seriousfrustration over the relief package that the president is now threateningnot to sign.And it's time now for our Sunday group. Jason Riley of "The Wall StreetJournal", pollster and FOX News contributor, Kristen Soltis Anderson, andformer DNC chair Donna Brazile.Panel, welcome.JASON RILEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.EMANUEL:  It doesn't look like Republicans are going to go along withPresident Trump's demand of $2,000 stimulus checks.Jason, are we heading for a government shutdown?JASON RILEY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I don't know if we are headed for ashutdown, Mike. I do think that Republicans however feel like the presidenthas really pulled out the rug from under them at the last minute here.You know, people don't elect Republicans because Democrats don't spendenough money. They elect them because they want some fiscal responsibility.And the president's own negotiator, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin,thought he was negotiating in good faith for a $600 payment.I understand the president wanting to give people more money, but frankly,that is not I think what the country needs right now, so much as they needfor businesses to reopen, for the economy to get back up to speed in theselockdowns are the problem, not the fact that checks are supposedly toosmall.People need to get back to work and to the extent that some of theunemployment insurance relief supplements in this bill are too high, therewill be a disincentive for people to go back to work if they can be paidmore to not work, so we have to worry about that as well.EMANUEL:  To be clear, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initially accepted the$600 stimulus payment.Donna, did she cut a bad deal?DONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely not. Look, since thespring of 2020, the speaker and Democrats have been trying to give theAmerican people relief.We know that this virus is not going to disappear overnight and what theHouse Democrats along with those in the Senate tried to do was to negotiatea fair deal, something that will help the American people.You know, the $300 that the federal government will provide to the statesin addition to what they will receive is a lifeline to people getting backon their feet. Many of these workers who have lost their jobs, they've losttheir health care, they are struggling to make ends meet and at a time whenthey are trying to stay in their apartments or pay their mortgage, all theywant is relief.So I agree with vice president -- I mean the President-elect Joe Biden,it's an abdication of President Trump's responsibility not to sign thisbill and not to allow the government to continue to operate EMANUEL:  House lawmakers return tomorrow to start the process of trying tooverride President Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization.How awkward is this for the GOP to be clashing with the president ondefense and stimulus, Kristen?KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's putting a lot ofRepublicans in a very tough spot because some of the president 's mostvocal advocates are also those who would say we need to be getting a lot offunding to our defense, we cannot be allowing this collapse, and so, it'sputting them in a very tough spot.But I think it's sort of ironic, is that, on the one hand, you know, thepresident is right to complain abut the fact that these bills are enormous,things like the stimulus bill or the COVID relief bill that they areenormous bills, full of tons of stuff, and yet at the same time, thepresident is calling to add a tech policy piece to a military bill, sort ofasking to add something to a bill where it would be better if it was justkept clean and about with the bill should be about, which is our militaryand our nation's defenses.So it's putting a lot of Republicans in a very tough spot and we alwaystend to find Congress getting to the end of the year whether it's in 2012with the fiscal cliff, 2018 with the government shutdown we faced there. Italways seems like the holidays are the time for Congress to really struggleto be able to do its job properly.EMANUEL:  No doubt about that.Do you expect your Republicans to stick together and override the veto andwhat about section 230 concerns, Jason?RILEY:  I do expect Republicans to stick together. I think they willoverride the veto if, in fact, the president pushes them to do so.I understand the president's concerns about Section 230. I don't think thisis the place to hash that out however. I think that needs to be doneseparately.EMANUEL:  To presidential pardons, there was controversy when Bill Clintonpardoned Marc Rich and Patty Hearst. So this isn't new. But, Donna, is ittime to reform pardon power?BRAZILE:  Well, as Senator Toomey said, I mean, these constitutional powersare going to be difficult but he undermines the rule of law. If he makesjustice system looks so small when he basically rewards those who have beenconvicted of crimes. I mean, stealing from charities.But this is the president throwing as much chaos as he departs Washingtonthan we saw when he first arrived.EMANUEL:  Well, and there's no indication this is the end of PresidentTrump granting pardons. We've heard names like Julian Assange, RudyGiuliani, Steve Bannon.Kristen, what are your expectations?SOLTIS ANDERSON:  Well, I expect there to be more pardons. I think it's areal shame to see the way the powers being used in many of these instances.I can't help but think about the president's actions on criminal justicereform where he was taking those that had been charged with crimes thatwere very small, sentenced to absolutely unfair sentences, having theirlives taken away, that's the appropriate use, to undo wrongs that have beendone to those who are effectively innocent or who have been far too harshlythan they deserve, not to use it to pardon your political allies. It'ssimply wrong.EMANUEL:  Donna, what are expectations over the next couple of days? We'vegot the override vote in the NDAA. We've got the vote on the House floorabout the $2,000 payments, probably not going to go anywhere in theRepublican-led Senate. What are your expectations in the immediate daysahead?BRAZILE:  Well, I do believe that it is the responsibility of Congress toreturn to Washington, D.C., and to try to get as much done, especially now.The stimulus is absolutely needed. We should -- this is not the time toallow the government to shut down.And look, I understand the president is not -- he does not like the resultsof the election. I'm trying to be charitable this morning, but the fact isthat this is a time for a peaceful transfer of power and it's perhaps moreprudent for him right now to begin to think about his legacy and not throwanymore chaos into the room.EMANUEL:  Jason, looking ahead, what do expect this week and how awkward isit for Republicans to be battling with president from their own party?RILEY:  Well, Republicans I think are used to this. This president has beenpretty unpredictable from day one, so I mean, it's a little surprising thathe pulled this again right at the end but not entirely, so it's pretty muchin character. About the pardons, some of them are more controversialpardons, at least in terms of what's -- with the Washington crowd said. Idon't find particularly controversial.When you look at people like Paul Manafort or Roger Stone, these are peoplewho were only prosecuted because Robert Mueller thought he could flip themin the Russia investigation and the Russia investigation turned out to be ahuge waste of time.And I see no problem with the president doing this for people who stayedloyal to him during an investigation that shouldn't have taken place in thefirst place. So yeah, some of the pardons I think were out of line. Some ofthe congressman, Chris Collins, Duncan Hunter, I think they violated thepublic trust and I'm not sure they deserve pardons. But some of the onesthat have gotten the most attention I think were well-deserved EMANUEL:  All right. You guys are off to a fast start. Panel, we have totake a break here.When we come back, public health guidance doesn't stop millions ofAmericans from traveling this holiday. We will speak with Admiral BrettGiroir, member of the coronavirus task force, about what we can expect inthe New Year next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)EMANUEL:  Coming up, the U.S. approves to coronavirus vaccines andfrontline workers line up to get the first dosages.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUSDISEASES:  I want to encourage everyone who has the opportunity to getvaccinated so that we can have a veil of protection over this country.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL:  We'll ask Admiral Brett Giroir of the White House task force howthe rollout is going, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)EMANUEL:  Holiday season less merry and bright as COVID-19 continues tohammer the U.S., as new strains emerge overseas.Joining us now, Admiral Brett Giroir, a member of the White Housecoronavirus task force.Admiral, welcome to "FOX News Sunday."ADMIRAL BRETT GIROIR, MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE:  Great tobe here. Thank you for having me on EMANUEL:  TSA checkpoint travel numbers reveal more than 1 million per daytraveling leading up to Christmas despite those COVID warnings.Do you expect a spike in new cases as a result, sir?GIROIR:  Well, it really depends on what the travelers do when they getwhere they're going. We know the actual physical act of traveling inairplanes, for example, can be quite safe because of the air purificationsystems. What we really worry about is the mingling of different bubblesonce you get to your destination.Over Thanksgiving, we saw a mixed picture. In the Midwest and in thenorthern plains, cases continued to go down despite the travel, which meantthat people really did the kinds of things we talked to them about, likewearing a mask and limiting your gatherings. So we really have to wait andsee. I really encourage people to follow the CDC guidelines, make yourfamily gatherings small, safe, protect the elderly and we can get throughthis.EMANUEL: There are concerns about a new variant or mutations of the virusin places like United Kingdom, Japan, even Canada. Ontario's chief medicalofficer announced Saturday that they had confirmed two cases there.Considering global travel, do you think this new strain is now here in theUnited States?GIROIR: Well, we don't know if it's here or not. We would say that there iscertainly a possibility that it's here already because of global travel andit's in so many countries now.Let me tell you what we know about the strain. It is -- number one, it isnot any more serious than the normal strains of COVID. However, it doesappear to be more transmissible. There's not direct evidence of that, butthere's lots of suggestive evidence. But again, you can still protectyourself by the mitigation measures.And we have no evidence to suggest, nor do we believe, that this vaccine --that the vaccine would not be effective. In other words, we do believe thevaccine will be effective against this variance. So that's why we're, youknow, so excited and still very enthusiastic about the vaccine program,which is being rolled out on time, on schedule with almost 15 and a halfmillion doses being distributive by this week upcoming.EMANUEL: The United States is requiring negative test from travelers comingfrom the United Kingdom. Do we need that elsewhere? Is that enough at thispoint?GIROIR: So I think what's often not talked about is since March there'sbeen a very substantial travel restriction on U.K. and a variety ofcountries from -- from Europe. So, since March, we have had a decrease of90 to 95 percent of travelers coming from the U.K., which is our first lineof defense, which other countries did not have.The added testing puts an extra layer, and that's very important. There'sno perfect silver bullet, but a test three days before. Now, the CDC can'torder testing once you're in states after that, but we would certainlyencourage states to have quarantine orders or to have testing once thesetravelers arrive. So 95 percent decrease already. The extra testing putsanother barrier and the states could also impose things. So I think we'regoing to be pretty safe with these as again we roll out vaccines, which aregoing to be highly effective against all the strings that are out there.EMANUEL: To those vaccines. We've seem first responders, some high-profilepoliticians rolling up their sleeves.Who's next in line to receive the shots?GIROIR: Well, in the first wave, it is really been our health care workersand those in nursing homes. The next wave is going to be different bystate. The general recommendations are those over 75 and certain frontlineworkers. But it's going to very state-by-state.Let me talk about Governor Abbott in Texas. He really is going toprioritize anyone over 65 because those are the people who go to thehospitals. It's not the frontline 24-year-old worker who is at low risk ofgetting the infection and at very, very low risk of getting serious resultsfrom that. But over 65, yes, that's who's in the hospital and certain otherpeople, like cancer patients or people with sickle cell disease. GovernorDeSantis in Florida is prioritizing everyone over 70.So I think you're going to see variability and I think that variability iscritically important because as the hospitals fill up, the first priorityreally needs to be to save lives and to reduce the burden on hospitals.You're seeing that in Texas and Florida and you will probably see that inmany other states.EMANUEL: Interesting. OK. So how important is that for President Trump toreceive the vaccine in terms of building that critical, public confidence?GIROIR: Well, I, of course, think that the president should get a vaccineat the right time. Seventy-five million people voted for him. He has devoutfollowers and I think it would set an example.I would say that there is a medical reason and I don't know, I'm not hisphysician, so I don't know exactly right, but he did receive monoclonalantibodies within the last couple of months. And there is sort of, youknow, guidance about waiting 60 to 90 days after a monoclonal antibodybecause it could interfere with the -- with the actual vaccine. But, ofcourse, President Trump, for his own protection, and to set an example forthe 75 million people who voted for him, I think it's a great idea.EMANUEL: Currently the Emergency Authorization is for people at least 16and older. What about younger children? Isn't that important in terms ofgetting them back to school?GIROIR: Well, we all -- as a pediatrician, we certainly want to have thedata to show that it's safe and effective in children. We don't have thatyet. That is coming though. Sixteen and above for one vaccine, 18 and abovefor the Moderna vaccine. But I think it's very important for listeners tounderstand that getting children back to school right now is safe now.There's data upon data upon data that children could go back to schoolsafely in person.There was a recent study in the MMWR that says of all the places childrenare likely to turn positive, school is not one of them. So it is safe andvery important to get children back in school, even before they arevaccinated. Now, with the community rates going down we hope after theholidays, because we're seeing that trend right now, and with vaccines itwill be even safer because there will be less spread in the community. Butchildren do not need a vaccine to go back to school safely. It's vital fortheir health to get them back physically present as soon as possible.EMANUEL: What about their teachers? Should they be higher on the prioritylist in terms of vaccinations with millions of American parents worriedtheir children are not learning in online school?GIROIR: Well, they're probably going to be higher on the list than thegeneral public, but they certainly don't fall into the category of thecurrent ACIP recommendations or what's happening in Texas or Florida andmany other states.Young, healthy teachers should be at no more risk than young, healthyindividuals in any other profession. So I would imagine that those -- andthey are critical infrastructure. We love our teachers -- that they'regoing to be higher than the general public, but they're certainly not goingto be in -- in the next level on almost any state because they're not athigher risk, unless they are at higher risk if they have hypertension orsickle cell disease or a cancer survivor or over 65, of course they go inthat category. But, otherwise, they're probably going to be furthered downthe priority scale because we need to take care of those who arevulnerable, who will die, who will be hospitalized first and I think you're-- you're seeing that both by the ACIP recommendations, as well as byseveral states.EMANUEL: It feels like we're waiting for the point when the United Statesgets to herd immunity. What's your current estimate?GIROIR: So, herd immunity, when we get to herd immunity, that is when thepandemic is essentially over. Now, there could be pockets in certain placeswhere there are vaccine hesitancy and people don't get vaccinated.The truth is, nobody knows exactly the number, but based on mathematicalmodels as we have it right now, it is somewhere between 70 and 80 percentof individuals having gotten the vaccine or having gotten the naturalinfection. Now, obviously, we want to develop herd immunity by peoplegetting the vaccine because they're at no risk of ill health effects orspreading it to other individuals. Somewhere in that 70 to 80 percent rangeis probably the sweet spot. Nobody knows for sure. But based onmathematical models, people kind of converge at that number.EMANUEL: Admiral, we're running out of time, but final question, when doyou expect that any American who wants a vaccine should be able to get thevaccine?GIROIR: Well, we are clearly on schedule, 20 million vaccinationsdistributed by the first week in January. We expect another 30 million inJanuary, another 50 million in February. And with the current contracts,even with just the vaccines we have right now, we still expect that anyAmerican who wants a vaccine can be vaccinated by June. That's really veryexciting. That means a couple hundred million people being able to bevaccinated by that time.So, with good mitigation steps, with increasing vaccinations, particularlyamong the -- those who are vulnerable, we should see clearly light at theend of the tunnel, but we've got to keep disciplines, got to keep vigilantright now as we vaccinate.EMANUEL: Admiral, thank you for joining us. Thanks for your service. Wewish you a happy and very healthy new year.Up next, when our Sunday panel returns, control of the Senate puts Georgiain the national spotlight with both parties sending in reinforcements toturn out the base.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES:Everything is at stake. Everything that was at stake in November is atstake leading up to January 5th.IVANKA TRUMP, ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT: I am confident that Senators DavidPerdue and Kelly Loeffler will keep the Senate Republican and win anhistoric victory for American liberty.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL: Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and Ivanka Trump in Georgiawith very different messages ahead of the critical January 5th run offraces.And we're back now with our panel, Jason, Kristen, and Donna.So with the president's focus still on overturning the election, there areconcerns, Jason, about this dividing Republicans and even putting VicePresident Mike Pence in an awkward spot.JASON RILEY, "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL," FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, ANDMANHATTANINSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW: Yes, I think those concerns are warranted. Evenwith what's going on with the defense bill and the COVID relief packagethat's still being negotiated in Washington, I think it's having a bigimpact on this race. Both David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler supported boththe defense bill and a COVID relief package. In fact, David Perdue ran anad after the relief package passed Congress that said, I have delivered forGeorgia. So now he has to decide whether to -- to switch positions on that,because the president has, or to stick with what he said and crossed thepresident.And -- and you see this writ large when it comes to -- to the sort of dualmessages the president has been sending. On the one hand he's saying to hissupporters, go out in Georgia and vote for these Republican candidates. Butthen in the next breath he's saying, your votes don't count, the system isrigged, that's why Joe Biden stole the election.So these mixed messages, I think, are -- are creating all kinds of problemsfor these -- for these Republican candidates in Georgia.EMANUEL: So about those critical runoffs in Georgia, what about the concernof this ongoing election hangover hurting Republicans, Kristen, in theirefforts to hold onto that critical Senate majority?SOLTIS ANDERSON: Well, it certainly doesn't help that there is a mixedmessage situation going on. However, I do think that Republicans had beenfeeling pretty good about those runoffs until the events of the last week,which have really kind of thrown things up into the air. Typically, in arunoff election like this, you would expect Republicans to be favored.There are more Republicans in Georgia. If turnout drops off, typicallythose more high turnout voters tend to be more Republican.But what we're seeing now is already over 2 million early votes cast inGeorgia with still some more time to go until that election. So there'sgoing to be unbelievable and unprecedented turnout.You're also seeing incredible amounts of money go into the state ofGeorgia. Just this week, Jon Ossoff reportedly raising over $100 million.That is beyond eclipsing the most money that any Senate candidate hadpreviously raised in any Senate race. At a certain point, the poor peopleof the state of Georgia are not going to be able to turn anywhere withoutseeing ads from these candidates.So this is a very high-stakes contest. Both parties really feel it. Andthat's why I do think that the idea that the president's messaging about,you know, his allegations of election fraud, et cetera, may not have asmuch of an effect because there are so many other things on the line, mostnotably control of the United States Senate in a moment where it could handa united democratic government to Democrats if it goes a certain direction.EMANUEL: Donna, let's get your read.More than two million people have already voted in those Georgia runoffs.How do you analyze it?DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I stillbelieve it will be a nail-biter. I liked the numbers. There are somecounties that are over performing based on what happened on November 3rd,but it's going to be a tight race. I do believe that both Democraticcandidates have run an exceptionally good campaign, forcing Senator Perdueand Loeffler to explain the gridlock in Washington, why the checks arebeing held up. I do believe that Mitch McConnell move as a result of thosetwo races.But, at the end of the day, turnout on Election Day will probably mattermost. We do know that Georgia is one of those states with 159 counties.We've seen the recount happen on several occasions that if -- if they'relosing candidates -- lose by less than one percentage point, they can -- itcould be another couple weeks of recounts.But, overall, I feel good about Democratic performance. The fact that weare able to draw in some independent voters and a lot of young voters,especially in the metro Atlanta area, they're also turning out in theseearly days before the -- the race next week.EMANUEL: To the political dynamics on Capitol Hill, Speaker Nancy Pelosihas an historically slim majority looking forward and a split between themoderate and progressive wings.Jason, if their common enemy has been President Trump and he's due toleave, how do they function?RILEY: Yes, she's -- she's -- she's going to have her hands full and sowill President-elect Biden. You know, he's going to have the progressivespulling him one way. He's going to have moderates pulling him another.Nancy Pelosi knows that she is the speaker of the House because of thosemoderates and not because of those progressives, so she's going to have totoe that line as well.It's going to be difficult, but I -- you know, this is, I think, with theAmerican people voted for. They apparently did not want to give PresidentTrump a second term, but they did not want to give Democrats overwhelmingmajorities to have the run of Washington. And so this is -- this is the --I think this is what the American people want.EMANUEL: Kristen, how do you sense things will work in the House ofRepresentatives, a very narrow majority and -- and really there are somemoderate Democrats who saw some of their colleagues lose by basically goingalong with the agenda?ANDERSON: Democrats had a good election at the presidential level, buteverything else was a bit of a disappointment. And I think it's really lefta lot of folks in the Democratic Party wondering, is it time for a changein leadership in Congress?That right now the Democrats have really failed to, I think, have a veryadequate pipeline for those who are younger and in their ranks and whomight be moving up to be the rising stars of the party in the future. Theyjust haven't had an opportunity to do so because the very same people whohave been running the Democratic Party have been doing so for a very longtime.And so to the extent that we wind up in a situation where there's stillgridlock or progressives feel like, hey, we have a lot more control inWashington than we used to and we still can't get things done, that isgoing to place enormous pressure on Nancy Pelosi. She's -- she's heldcontrol for a really long time. I don't expect that she'll face a challengethat's significant to her speakership, but she's going to have to do a lotmore, I think, to try to create a sense that she is allowing youngerDemocrats to have a seat at the table in the leadership of their party.EMANUEL: Let's get Donna to weigh in on that.Expectations are high, particularly among progressives. How do SpeakerPelosi balance these competing interests, Donna?BRAZILE: She has shown incredible leadership in bringing everyone into theroom so that everybody has a seat at the table.Look, we have Hakeem Jeffries. We have, you know, Elissa Slotkin. We haveso many young Democrats who are basically at the table, helping to leadthis great party. We don't throw people away or tell them to sit -- go inthe back of the room simply because of their age. She loves and values theexperience that every Democrat bring to the caucus and she's going tocontinue to lead the Democratic Party in the House. And I think she's goingto be an incredible force, along with President-elect Joe Biden and VicePresident-elect Kamala Harris in moving the country forward in 2021 andbeyond.EMANUEL: Jason, it may not be an easy job for Senate Democratic LeaderChuck Schumer, who may be looking over his shoulder wondering whetherCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may give him a primary challenge intwo years. Your thoughts?RILEY: Oh, I think he's -- he's absolutely worried about that and -- and heshould be. I think she's -- she's very ambitious.But the thing is that no matter who wins down in Georgia, whether it's theDemocratic candidates or the -- or the Republicans or they split, thesewill be very, very narrow majorities one way or the other. I -- I -- Idon't think the Democrats will be able to do much that is overly ambitious.There -- there -- there will be no green new deals. There will be nostatehood for -- for D.C. or Puerto Rico and so forth. The -- some of the -- some of the -- the -- the things they were talking about during thecampaigns. That -- that is not what the American people voted for. And --and I also think that this COVID situation is going to concentrate thepolitical minds in Washington for some time to come. That -- that will bethe focus. And certainly it will be one way for -- for Joe Biden to put offthe progressives by saying, listen, we have to get this virus under controlfirst before we -- we turn to the rest of your agenda.EMANUEL: A big issue early in the new year will be confirming a newcabinet. Mitch McConnell told "The Louisville Courier-Journal," quote, they(Biden nominees) aren't all going to pass on a voice vote, and they aren'tall going to make it, but I will put them on the floor.With Biden's son, Hunter Biden, under federal investigation, picking anattorney general nominee is going to be tricky.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: I guarantee you I'm goingto do what I said. The attorney general of the United States of America isnot the president's lawyer. I will appoint someone who I expect to enforcethe law as the law is written, not guided by me.(END VIDEO CLIP)EMANUEL: I'm sorry we're nearly out of time, but, Kristen, which nomineesdo you anticipate could be in real trouble already?ANDERSON: I think the most challenging ones are going to be Neera Tanden,who has come from a progressive think tank and is facing more oppositionbecause she's taken shots at Republican senators.EMANUEL: Right.ANDERSON: That's going to be the toughest nomination to get through.EMANUEL: All right. Sorry I didn't do a great job of clock management.Thank you, panel.
