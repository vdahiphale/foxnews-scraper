Let's all go "Off the Record" for a minute. It's with great sadness that I show you video of the funeral of slain NYPD officer Brian Moore.
A very young man, only 25 years old, whose father, uncle and cousins all wore the uniform, Officer Moore was shot in the head last weekend after stopping a man suspected of carrying a hand gun. He died on Monday. And today, thousands and thousands of police officers from around the nation in a sea of blue all with broken hearts lining the streets of Long Island to say goodbye. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And to think, as you look at all those brokenhearted police officers filling the screen, that is only a small percentage of police officers around the nation tonight, they are risking their lives for you, for me. I don't know about you, but I never forget police have a very difficult job and a very dangerous one. With all the recent upheaval and controversy, from Ferguson to Baltimore, I know that many good police officers and their families are feeling pretty unappreciated by all of us tonight. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So let's do something about it. A small gesture can make a big impact. The next time you see police officer or the family member of one of them, just say something to show you appreciate that police officer. How about just a nice "thank you." It only takes three seconds and it can make a huge difference. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
