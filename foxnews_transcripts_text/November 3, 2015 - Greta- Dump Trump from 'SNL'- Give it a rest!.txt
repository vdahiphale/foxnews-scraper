Greta's 'Off the Record' comment to 'On the Record' viewers, 11/3/15: The clamor to get 'Saturday Night Live' to disinvite Donald Trump from hosting the show has been loud, clear. We all love entertainment, but we should love the First Amendment even more.

Let's all go "Off the Record." I just read an opinion piece in The Hill telling "Saturday Night Live" to dump Donald Trump from hosting SNL this coming Saturday.
An assistant professor at a California University penned a long piece slamming Trump for his comments about Mexican immigrants. The assistant professor calls Trump racist and inhumane. And then accuses SNL of legitimizing and reinforcing what the professor says is Trump's narrative. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Now Hillary Clinton has been on SNL, Sarah Palin has been on SNL. Both women are also high-profile politicians, and both have said things that lots of people don't like or don't agree with. But there is no clamoring to shut them down from doing the entertainment show. And that's because the rest of us, agree or not agree, we all respect the First Amendment. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
So, this assistant professor, he needs to give it a rest. He doesn't have to watch SNL. And he can even protest Trump if he wants. That's part of the First Amendment. But don't shut Trump down, and don't bully the network. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The First Amendment belongs to everyone. It's not always pretty, but it sure is important. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
