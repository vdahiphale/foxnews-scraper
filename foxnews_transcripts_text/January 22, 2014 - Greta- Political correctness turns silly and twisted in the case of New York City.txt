OK, let's go "Off the Record" for just a minute. I don't know about you, but I think this is silly, it's sort of twisted political correctness, morphing into a shopkeeper who simply wants his store and his clients to respect each other and to show respect by their dress.
So check out his store sign. Do you have any problem with that? Well, the New York City Commission On Human Rights does, they sued him, scaring him with a lawsuit, saying it discriminates against women because the commission claims the sign is not gender neutral. Really? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
The last time I looked, guys wear shorts and they even wear shoes, most of them. It is his store, if you don't like the store, if you don't like the sign, just don't shop there. It's that simple. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And I have a tip for the New York Commission on Human Rights: We women are not that fragile. You don't have to protect us this way. The sign doesn't set us back like unfair wages might. So stop with the silly stuff. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
By the way, if I was a shopkeeper's lawyer, just have some fun with it -- no pants down around your knees. The Commission would have to admit, that's a total guy thing. Bingo, gender neutral.
That's my "Off the Record" comment tonight. If you have an important story or issue that you think I should take "Off the Record," go to GretaWire.com and tell us about it.
