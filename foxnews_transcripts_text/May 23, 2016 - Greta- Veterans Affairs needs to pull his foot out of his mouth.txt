Let's all go "Off the Record." Does anyone have pliers? Because we need to help get the Department of V.A. Secretary Bob McDonald's foot out of his mouth.
At least I hope it's just his foot in his mouth and not some deep-seeded insensitivity to the grave needs of our injured vets. Here is what Secretary McDonald said earlier today about why he doesn't think releasing data on V.A. wait times is important. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('desktop', 'lb2', 'desktop-desk-ad-lb2', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban2', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban2', '');
          });
        } else {

BOB MCDONALD, U.S. SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS: What really counts, is, how does the veteran feel about they're encounter with the V.A.? When you go to Disney, do they measure the number of hours you wait in line or the number -- you know, what's important? What's important, is, what's your satisfaction with the experience? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb3', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }

Really? Veterans waiting for a medical care at the V.A., is like waiting for a ride at Disney World? That is so bad. And why so cavalier about the pain that waiting causes the men and women who didn't make the American people wait when they protected us? 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('mobile', 'ban3', 'mobile-mw-ad-ban3', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
Many of our vets say they are in excruciating pain from serious injuries, from IEDs to permanent traumatic brain injury. They are desperate for help. And we Americans promise to help them and we owe it to them.
Does the secretary think waiting is not a big deal? And note to the secretary - the wait time is both the experience and encounter with the V.A. I want that wait time data that he doesn't want us to get. It will show us if Secretary McDonald is doing his job to take care of the vets or not. 
        if (window && window.foxstrike && Array.isArray(window.foxstrike.cmd)) {
          window.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike) {
            Strike.insertAd('tablet', 'lb4', 'tablet-tw-ad-lb4', '');
          });
        } else {
          console.error('Error: window.foxstrike not found');
        }
      
And if he doesn't, get him out of there. That's the least you and can I do for our vets. And that's my "Off the Record" comment tonight.
